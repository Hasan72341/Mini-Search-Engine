The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.\nThe knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897.\nThe subset sum problem is a special case of the decision and 0-1 problems where for each kind of item, the weight equals the value: formula_1. In the field of cryptography, the term \"knapsack problem\" is often used to refer specifically to the subset sum problem. The subset sum problem is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems.\nApplications.\nKnapsack problems appear in real-world decision-making processes in a wide variety of fields, such as finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials, selection of investments and portfolios, selection of assets for asset-backed securitization, and generating keys for the Merkle\u2013Hellman and other knapsack cryptosystems.\nOne early application of knapsack algorithms was in the construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples, it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point values, it is more difficult to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to answer all of the questions to the best of their abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.\nA 1999 study of the Stony Brook University Algorithm Repository showed that, out of 75 algorithmic problems related to the field of combinatorial algorithms and algorithm engineering, the knapsack problem was the 19th most popular and the third most needed after suffix trees and the bin packing problem.\nDefinition.\nThe most common problem being solved is the 0-1 knapsack problem, which restricts the number \"formula_2\" of copies of each kind of item to zero or one. Given a set of \"formula_3\" items numbered from 1 up to \"formula_3\", each with a weight \"formula_5\" and a value \"formula_6\", along with a maximum weight capacity \"formula_7\",\n maximize formula_8\n subject to formula_9 and formula_10.\nHere \"formula_2\" represents the number of instances of item \"formula_12\" to include in the knapsack. Informally, the problem is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.\nThe bounded knapsack problem (BKP) removes the restriction that there is only one of each item, but restricts the number formula_2 of copies of each kind of item to a maximum non-negative integer value formula_14:\n maximize formula_8\n subject to formula_9 and formula_17\nThe unbounded knapsack problem (UKP) places no upper bound on the number of copies of each kind of item and can be formulated as above except that the only restriction on formula_2 is that it is a non-negative integer.\n maximize formula_8\n subject to formula_9 and formula_21\nOne example of the unbounded knapsack problem is given using the figure shown at the beginning of this article and the text \"if any number of each book is available\" in the caption of that figure.\nComputational complexity.\nThe knapsack problem is interesting from the perspective of computer science for many reasons:\nThere is a link between the \"decision\" and \"optimization\" problems in that if there exists a polynomial algorithm that solves the \"decision\" problem, then one can find the maximum value for the optimization problem in polynomial time by applying this algorithm iteratively while increasing the value of k. On the other hand, if an algorithm finds the optimal value of the optimization problem in polynomial time, then the decision problem can be solved in polynomial time by comparing the value of the solution output by this algorithm with the value of k. Thus, both versions of the problem are of similar difficulty.\nOne theme in research literature is to identify what the \"hard\" instances of the knapsack problem look like, or viewed another way, to identify what properties of instances in practice might make them more amenable than their worst-case NP-complete behaviour suggests. The goal in finding these \"hard\" instances is for their use in public-key cryptography systems, such as the Merkle\u2013Hellman knapsack cryptosystem. More generally, better understanding of the structure of the space of instances of an optimization problem helps to advance the study of the particular problem and can improve algorithm selection.\nFurthermore, notable is the fact that the hardness of the knapsack problem depends on the form of the input. If the weights and profits are given as integers, it is weakly NP-complete, while it is strongly NP-complete if the weights and profits are given as rational numbers. However, in the case of rational weights and profits it still admits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme.\nUnit-cost models.\nThe NP-hardness of the Knapsack problem relates to computational models in which the size of integers matters (such as the Turing machine). In contrast, decision trees count each decision as a single step. Dobkin and Lipton show an formula_22 lower bound on linear decision trees for the knapsack problem, that is, trees where decision nodes test the sign of affine functions. This was generalized to algebraic decision trees by Steele and Yao.\nIf the elements in the problem are real numbers or rationals, the decision-tree lower bound extends to the real random-access machine model with an instruction set that includes addition, subtraction and multiplication of real numbers, as well as comparison and either division or remaindering (\"floor\"). This model covers more algorithms than the algebraic decision-tree model, as it encompasses algorithms that use indexing into tables. However, in this model all program steps are counted, not just decisions.\nAn \"upper bound\" for a decision-tree model was given by Meyer auf der Heide who showed that for every \"n\" there exists an \"O\"(\"n\"4)-deep linear decision tree that solves the subset-sum problem with \"n\" items. Note that this does not imply any upper bound for an algorithm that should solve the problem for \"any given n\".\nSolving.\nSeveral algorithms are available to solve knapsack problems, based on the dynamic programming approach, the branch and bound approach or hybridizations of both approaches.\nDynamic programming in-advance algorithm.\nThe unbounded knapsack problem (UKP) places no restriction on the number of copies of each kind of item. Besides, here we assume that formula_23\n formula_24\n subject to formula_25 and formula_23\nObserve that formula_27 has the following properties:\n1. formula_28 (the sum of zero items, i.e., the summation of the empty set).\n2. formula_29\n, formula_30, where formula_6 is the value of the formula_12-th kind of item.\nThe second property needs to be explained in detail. During the process of the running of this method, how do we get the weight formula_33? There are only formula_12 ways and the previous weights are formula_35 where there are total formula_12 kinds of different item (by saying different, we mean that the weight and the value are not completely the same). If we know each value of these formula_12 items and the related maximum value previously, we just compare them to each other and get the maximum value ultimately and we are done.\nHere the maximum of the empty set is taken to be zero. Tabulating the results from formula_38 up through formula_39 gives the solution. Since the calculation of each formula_27 involves examining at most formula_3 items, and there are at most formula_7 values of formula_27 to calculate, the running time of the dynamic programming solution is formula_44. Dividing formula_45 by their greatest common divisor is a way to improve the running time.\nEven if P\u2260NP, the formula_44 complexity does not contradict the fact that the knapsack problem is NP-complete, since formula_7, unlike formula_3, is not polynomial in the length of the input to the problem. The length of the formula_7 input to the problem is proportional to the number of bits in formula_7, formula_51, not to formula_7 itself. However, since this runtime is pseudopolynomial, this makes the (decision version of the) knapsack problem a weakly NP-complete problem.\n0-1 knapsack problem.\nA similar dynamic programming solution for the 0-1 knapsack problem also runs in pseudo-polynomial time. Assume formula_53 are strictly positive integers. Define formula_54 to be the maximum value that can be attained with weight less than or equal to formula_33 using items up to formula_12 (first formula_12 items).\nWe can define formula_54 recursively as follows: (Definition A)\nThe solution can then be found by calculating formula_64. To do this efficiently, we can use a table to store previous computations.\nThe following is pseudocode for the dynamic program:\n// Input:\n// Values (stored in array v)\n// Weights (stored in array w)\n// Number of distinct items (n)\n// Knapsack capacity (W)\n// NOTE: The array \"v\" and array \"w\" are assumed to store all relevant values starting at index 1.\narray m[0..n, 0..W];\nfor j from 0 to W do:\n m[0, j] := 0\nfor i from 1 to n do:\n m[i, 0] := 0\nfor i from 1 to n do:\n for j from 1 to W do:\n if w[i] &gt; j then:\n m[i, j] := m[i-1, j]\n else:\n m[i, j] := max(m[i-1, j], m[i-1, j-w[i]] + v[i])\nThis solution will therefore run in formula_44 time and formula_44 space. \nHowever, if we take it a step or two further, we should know that the method will run in the time between formula_44 and formula_68. From Definition A, we know that there is no need to compute all the weights when the number of items and the items themselves that we chose are fixed. That is to say, the program above computes more than necessary because the weight changes from 0 to W often. From this perspective, we can program this method so that it runs recursively.\n// Input:\n// Values (stored in array v)\n// Weights (stored in array w)\n// Number of distinct items (n)\n// Knapsack capacity (W)\n// NOTE: The array \"v\" and array \"w\" are assumed to store all relevant values starting at index 1.\nDefine value[n, W]\nInitialize all value[i, j] = -1\nDefine m:=(i,j) // Define function m so that it represents the maximum value we can get under the condition: use first i items, total weight limit is j\n if i == 0 or j &lt;= 0 then:\n value[i, j] = 0\n return\n if (value[i-1, j] == -1) then: // m[i-1, j] has not been calculated, we have to call function m\n m(i-1, j)\n if w[i] &gt; j then: // item cannot fit in the bag\n value[i, j] = value[i-1, j]\n else: \n if (value[i-1, j-w[i]] == -1) then: // m[i-1,j-w[i]] has not been calculated, we have to call function m\n m(i-1, j-w[i])\n value[i, j] = max(value[i-1,j], value[i-1, j-w[i]] + v[i])\nRun m(n, W)\nFor example, there are 10 different items and the weight limit is 67. So,\nformula_69\nIf you use above method to compute for formula_70, you will get this, excluding calls that produce formula_71:\nformula_72\nBesides, we can break the recursion and convert it into a tree. Then we can cut some leaves and use parallel computing to expedite the running of this method.\nTo find the actual subset of items, rather than just their total value, we can run this after running the function above:\n * Returns the indices of the items of the optimal knapsack.\n * i: We can include items 1 through i in the knapsack\n * j: maximum weight of the knapsack\nfunction knapsack(i: int, j: int): Set&lt;int&gt; {\n if i == 0 then:\n if m[i, j] &gt; m[i-1, j] then:\n return {i} \u222a knapsack(i-1, j-w[i])\n else:\n return knapsack(i-1, j)\nknapsack(n, W)\nMeet-in-the-middle.\nAnother algorithm for 0-1 knapsack, discovered in 1974 and sometimes called \"meet-in-the-middle\" due to parallels to a similarly named algorithm in cryptography, is exponential in the number of different items but may be preferable to the DP algorithm when formula_7 is large compared to \"n\". In particular, if the formula_5 are nonnegative but not integers, we could still use the dynamic programming algorithm by scaling and rounding (i.e. using fixed-point arithmetic), but if the problem requires formula_75 fractional digits of precision to arrive at the correct answer, formula_7 will need to be scaled by formula_77, and the DP algorithm will require formula_78 space and formula_79 time.\n algorithm Meet-in-the-middle is\n input: A set of items with weights and values.\n output: The greatest combined value of a subset.\n partition the set {1...\"n\"} into two sets \"A\" and \"B\" of approximately equal size\n compute the weights and values of all subsets of each set\n for each subset of \"A\" do\n find the subset of \"B\" of greatest value such that the combined weight is less than \"W\"\n keep track of the greatest combined value seen so far\nThe algorithm takes formula_80 space, and efficient implementations of step 3 (for instance, sorting the subsets of B by weight, discarding subsets of B which weigh more than other subsets of B of greater or equal value, and using binary search to find the best match) result in a runtime of formula_81. As with the meet in the middle attack in cryptography, this improves on the formula_82 runtime of a naive brute force approach (examining all subsets of formula_83), at the cost of using exponential rather than constant space (see also baby-step giant-step). The current state of the art improvement to the meet-in-the-middle algorithm, using insights from Schroeppel and Shamir's Algorithm for Subset Sum, provides as a corollary a randomized algorithm for Knapsack which preserves the formula_84 (up to polynomial factors) running time and reduces the space requirements to formula_85 (see Corollary 1.4). In contrast, the best known deterministic algorithm runs in formula_84 time with a slightly worse space complexity of formula_87.\nApproximation Algorithms.\nAs for most NP-complete problems, it may be enough to find workable solutions even if they are not optimal. Preferably, however, the approximation comes with a guarantee of the difference between the value of the solution found and the value of the optimal solution.\nAs with many useful but computationally complex algorithms, there has been substantial research on creating and analyzing algorithms that approximate a solution. The knapsack problem, though NP-Hard, is one of a collection of algorithms that can still be approximated to any specified degree. This means that the problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme. To be exact, the knapsack problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).\nGreedy approximation algorithm.\nGeorge Dantzig proposed a greedy approximation algorithm to solve the unbounded knapsack problem. His version sorts the items in decreasing order of value per unit of weight, formula_88. It then proceeds to insert them into the sack, starting with as many copies as possible of the first kind of item until there is no longer space in the sack for more. Provided that there is an unlimited supply of each kind of item, if formula_89 is the maximum value of items that fit into the sack, then the greedy algorithm is guaranteed to achieve at least a value of formula_90.\nFor the bounded problem, where the supply of each kind of item is limited, the above algorithm may be far from optimal. Nevertheless, a simple modification allows us to solve this case: Assume for simplicity that all items individually fit in the sack (formula_91 for all formula_12). Construct a solution formula_93 by packing items greedily as long as possible, i.e. formula_94 where formula_95. Furthermore, construct a second solution formula_96 containing the first item that did not fit. Since formula_97 provides an upper bound for the LP relaxation of the problem, one of the sets must have value at least formula_90; we thus return whichever of formula_93 and formula_100 has better value to obtain a formula_101-approximation.\nIt can be shown that the average performance converges to the optimal solution in distribution at the error rate formula_102 \nFully polynomial time approximation scheme.\nThe fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem takes advantage of the fact that the reason the problem has no known polynomial time solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds off some of the least significant digits of the profit values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/\u03b5 where \u03b5 is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time that is correct within a factor of (1-\u03b5) of the optimal solution.\n algorithm FPTAS is \n input: \u03b5 \u2208 (0,1]\n a list A of n items, specified by their values, formula_6, and weights\n output: S' the FPTAS solution\n P := max formula_104 // the highest item value\n K := \u03b5 formula_105\n for i from 1 to n do\n formula_106 := formula_107\n end for\n return the solution, S', using the formula_106 values in the dynamic program outlined above\nTheorem: The set formula_109 computed by the algorithm above satisfies formula_110, where formula_111 is an optimal solution.\nQuantum approximate optimization.\nQuantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) can be employed to solve Knapsack problem using quantum computation by minimizing the Hamiltonian of the problem. The Knapsack Hamiltonian is constructed via embedding the constraint condition to the cost function of the problem with a penalty term.formula_112where formula_113 is the penalty constant which is determined by case-specific fine-tuning.\nDominance relations.\nSolving the unbounded knapsack problem can be made easier by throwing away items which will never be needed. For a given item formula_12, suppose we could find a set of items formula_115 such that their total weight is less than the weight of formula_12, and their total value is greater than the value of formula_12. Then formula_12 cannot appear in the optimal solution, because we could always improve any potential solution containing formula_12 by replacing formula_12 with the set formula_115. Therefore, we can disregard the formula_12-th item altogether. In such cases, formula_115 is said to dominate formula_12. (Note that this does not apply to bounded knapsack problems, since we may have already used up the items in formula_115.)\nFinding dominance relations allows us to significantly reduce the size of the search space. There are several different types of dominance relations, which all satisfy an inequality of the form:\nformula_126, and formula_127 for some formula_128\nwhere\nformula_129 and formula_130. The vector formula_131 denotes the number of copies of each member of formula_115.\nVariations.\nThere are many variations of the knapsack problem that have arisen from the vast number of applications of the basic problem. The main variations occur by changing the number of some problem parameter such as the number of items, number of objectives, or even the number of knapsacks.\nMulti-dimensional objective.\nHere, instead of a single objective (e.g. maximizing the monetary profit from the items in the knapsack), there can be several objectives. For example, there could be environmental or social concerns as well as economic goals. Problems frequently addressed include portfolio and transportation logistics optimizations.\nAs an example, suppose you run a cruise ship. You have to decide how many famous comedians to hire. This boat can handle no more than one ton of passengers and the entertainers must weigh less than 1000\u00a0lbs. Each comedian has a weight, brings in business based on their popularity and asks for a specific salary. In this example, you have multiple objectives. You want, of course, to maximize the popularity of your entertainers while minimizing their salaries. Also, you want to have as many entertainers as possible.\nMulti-dimensional weight.\nHere, the weight of knapsack item formula_12 is given by a D-dimensional vector formula_180 and the knapsack has a D-dimensional capacity vector formula_181. The target is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of weights in each dimension formula_75 does not exceed formula_183.\nMulti-dimensional knapsack is computationally harder than knapsack; even for formula_184, the problem does not have EPTAS unless Pformula_185NP. However, the algorithm in is shown to solve sparse instances efficiently. An instance of multi-dimensional knapsack is sparse if there is a set formula_186 for formula_187 such that for every knapsack item formula_12, formula_189 such that formula_190 and formula_191. Such instances occur, for example, when scheduling packets in a wireless network with relay nodes. The algorithm from also solves sparse instances of the multiple choice variant, multiple-choice multi-dimensional knapsack.\nThe IHS (Increasing Height Shelf) algorithm is optimal for 2D knapsack (packing squares into a two-dimensional unit size square): when there are at most five squares in an optimal packing.\nMultiple knapsacks.\nHere, there are multiple knapsacks. This may seem like a trivial change, but it is not equivalent to adding to the capacity of the initial knapsack, as each knapsack has its own capacity constraint. This variation is used in many loading and scheduling problems in Operations Research and has a Polynomial-time approximation scheme. This variation is similar to the Bin Packing Problem. It differs from the Bin Packing Problem in that a subset of items can be selected, whereas, in the Bin Packing Problem, all items have to be packed to certain bins. \nQuadratic.\nThe quadratic knapsack problem maximizes a quadratic objective function subject to binary and linear capacity constraints. The problem was introduced by Gallo, Hammer, and Simeone in 1980, however the first treatment of the problem dates back to Witzgall in 1975.\nGeometric.\nIn the geometric knapsack problem, there is a set of rectangles with different values, and a rectangular knapsack. The goal is to pack the largest possible value into the knapsack.\nOnline.\nIn the online knapsack problem, the items come one by one. Whenever an item arrives, we must decide immediately whether to put it in the knapsack or discard it. There are two variants: (a) non-removable - an inserted item remains in the knapsack forever; (b) removable - an inserted item may be removed later, to make room for a new item.\nHan, Kawase and Makino present a randomized algorithm for the unweighted non-removable setting. It is 2-competitive, which is the best possible. For the weighted removable setting, they give a 2-competitive algorithm, prove a lower bound of ~1.368 for randomized algorithms, and prove that no deterministic algorithm can have a constant competitive ratio. For the unweighted removable setting, they give an 10/7-competitive-ratio algorithm, and prove a lower bound of 1.25. \nThere are several other papers on the online knapsack problem.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It acts by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandin.\nIt was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1980.\nMedical uses.\nKetoprofen is generally prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches that result in the inflammation of the gums.\nKetoprofen topical patches are being used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain.\nKetoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.\nEfficacy.\nA 2013 systematic review indicated \"The efficacy of orally administered ketoprofen in relieving moderate-severe pain and improving functional status and general condition was significantly better than that of ibuprofen and/or diclofenac.\" A 2017 Cochrane systematic review investigating ketoprofen as a single-dose by mouth in acute, moderate-to-severe postoperative pain concluded that its efficacy is equivalent to drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac.\nThere is evidence supporting topical ketoprofen for osteoarthritis but not other chronic musculoskeletal pain.\nAdverse effects.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescribing information to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in fetuses that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.\nMechanism.\nKetoprofen undergoes metabolism in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid (glucuronidation) by UGT enzymes, hydroxylation of the benzoyl ring by the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and reduction of its ketone moiety (a carbonyl functional group, i.e. with carbon-oxygen double bond) by carbonyl reducing enzymes (CREs). Ketoprofen is used for its antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes reversibly, which decreases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin precursors.\nThe patches have been shown to provide rapid and sustained delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration.\nChirality and biological activity.\nKetoprofen has one stereogenic center in the side chain and hence exists as mirror-image twins. Majority of the profens are marketed as racemic mixtures. For most of the NSAIDs the pharmacological activity resides in the (S)-enantiomers with their (R)-enantiomer virtually inactive. An interesting observation about most profens including ketoprofen is that they undergo unidirectional metabolic inversion, chiral inversion, of the (R)- acid to its (S)-mirror-image version with no other change in the molecule.\nThere have been concerns raised that Ketoprofen can break down into the parent benzophenone molecule in skin exposed to strong summer or tropical UV light and this could pose a theoretical cancer risk. Given such a risk it is better to use other pain killers in such circumstances.\nHistory.\nThe earliest report of therapeutic use in humans is in 1972.\nSociety and culture.\nBrand names.\nBrand names in Albania are Oki and Fastum Gel. The names in Australia include Orudis and Oruvail. It is available in Estonia as Keto, Ketonal, and Fastum Gel; in Finland as Ketorin, Keto, Ketomex, and Orudis; in France as Prof\u00e9nid, Bi-Prof\u00e9nid, Toprec, and Ketum. It can be bought in Indonesia as Kaltrofen; in Ireland as Fastum Gel. In Italy it is sold as Ketodol, Fastum Gel, Lasonil, Orudis and Oki; in Greece as Okitask. It is available in Japan in a transdermal patch, Mohrus Tape, made by Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical. In Mexico it is sold as Arthril; in Norway as Zon and Orudis. In Poland as Ketonal, Ketonal active, and Ketolek. In Romania as Ketonal and Fastum Gel; in Russia as \u041e\u041a\u0418 (OKI), Fastum Gel and Ketonal. In Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia as Knavon and Ketonal. In Spain as Actron and Fastum Gel. It is available in the UK as Ketoflam and Oruvail. Lastly, it is sold in Venezuela as Ketoprofeno as an injectable solution of 100\u00a0mg and 150\u00a0mg capsules.\nIn some countries, the optically pure (\"S\")-enantiomer (dexketoprofen) is available; its trometamol salt is said to be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.\nVeterinary medicine.\nKetoprofen is a common NSAID, antipyretic, and analgesic used in horses and other equines. It is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, joint problems, and soft tissue injury, as well as laminitis. It is also used to control fevers and prevent endotoxemia. It is also used as a mild painkiller in smaller animals, generally following surgical procedures.\nIn horses, it is given at a dose of 2.2\u00a0mg/kg/day. Studies have shown that it does not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene B4, as originally claimed. It is therefore not considered superior to phenylbutazone as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use. In fact, phenylbutazone was shown superior to ketoprofen in cases of experimentally-induced synovitis when both drugs were used at labeled dosages.\nEcological problems.\nExperiments have found ketoprofen, like diclofenac, is a veterinary drug causing lethal effects in red-headed vultures.

{"id": "16985", "revid": "1308249557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16985", "title": "Kabuki", "text": "Classical Japanese dance-drama\n is a classical form of Japanese theatre, mixing dramatic performance with traditional dance. Kabuki theatre is known for its heavily stylised performances, its glamorous, highly decorated costumes, and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers.\nKabuki is thought to have originated in the early Edo period, when the art's founder, Izumo no Okuni, formed a female dance troupe that performed dances and light sketches in Kyoto. The art form later developed into its present all-male theatrical form after women were banned from performing in kabuki theatre in 1629. Kabuki developed throughout the late 17th century and reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.\nIn 2005, kabuki theatre was proclaimed by UNESCO as an intangible heritage possessing outstanding universal value. In 2008, it was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\nEtymology.\nThe individual kanji that make up the word \"kabuki\" can be read as , , and . \"Kabuki\" is therefore sometimes translated as 'the art of singing and dancing'. These are, however, characters which do not reflect actual etymology. The kanji of 'skill' generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre.\nSince the word \"kabuki\" is believed to derive from the verb , meaning 'to lean' or 'to be out of the ordinary', the word \"kabuki\" can also be interpreted as 'avant-garde' or 'bizarre' theatre. The expression referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed. It is often translated into English as 'strange things' or 'the crazy ones', and referred to the style of dress worn by gangs of samurai. Another explanation attributes the word \"kabuki\" to a verb that was used to describe young samurai patrons, meaning \"being weird\" or \"offbeat.\"\nHistory.\n1603\u20131629: Kabuki.\nThe history of kabuki began in 1603 during the Edo period when former shrine maiden Izumo no Okuni, possibly a of Izumo-taisha, began performing with a troupe of young female dancers a new, simple style of dance drama in pantomime, on a makeshift stage in the dry bed of the Kamo River in Kyoto.\nIn the earliest forms of kabuki, female performers played both men and women in comic playlets about ordinary life. It did not take long for the style to become popular, and Okuni was asked to perform before the Imperial Court. In the wake of such success, rival troupes quickly formed, and kabuki was born as ensemble dance and drama performed by women.\nMuch of the appeal of kabuki in this era was due to the ribald, suggestive themes featured by many troupes; this appeal was further augmented by the fact that many performers were also involved in prostitution. For this reason, kabuki was also known as during this period.\nKabuki became a common form of entertainment in the red-light districts of Japan, especially in Yoshiwara, the registered red-light district in Edo. The widespread appeal of kabuki often meant that a diverse crowd of different social classes gathered to watch performances, a unique occurrence that happened nowhere else in the city of Edo. Kabuki theatres became well known as a place to both see and be seen in terms of fashion and style, as the audience\u2014commonly comprising a number of socially low but economically wealthy merchants\u2014typically used a performance as a way to feature the fashion trends.\nAs an art-form, kabuki also provided inventive new forms of entertainment, featuring new musical styles played on the , clothes and fashion often dramatic in appearance, famous actors and stories often intended to mirror current events. Performances typically lasted from morning until sunset, with surrounding teahouses providing meals, refreshments and place to socialise. The area surrounding kabuki theatres also featured a number of shops selling kabuki souvenirs.\nAfter performances, women performers would offer sexual services for those who could afford it. Since fights would usually erupt among the young samurai patrons, shogunal authorities, who wanted to maintain order, banned women from performing on stage. Following this ban, Okuni replaced the women with boys in Kabuki performances. During the early seventeenth century, within a culture where pederasty was pervasive among samurai, her decision didn't significantly harm the theater's popularity. In fact, it may have even benefited Kabuki, as it caught the attention of the third shogun, Iemitsu, known for his interest in pederasty. He even arranged special performances. However, after Iemitsu's death in 1651 and with samurai now fighting for the attention of boys rather than girls, the shogunate imposed further restrictions, allowing only males over 15 to perform on stage.\nKabuki switched to adult male actors, called , in the mid-1600s. Adult male actors, however, continued to play both female and male characters, and kabuki retained its popularity, remaining a key element of the Edo period urban life-style.\nAlthough kabuki was performed widely across Japan, the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za theatres became the most widely known and popular kabuki theatres, where some of the most successful kabuki performances were and still are held.\n1629\u20131673: Transition to.\nDuring the time period of 1628\u20131673, the modern version of all-male kabuki actors, a style of kabuki known as (lit., \"young man kabuki\"), was established, following the ban on women and young boys. Cross-dressing male actors, known as \"\" (lit., \"woman role\") or \"\" took over previously female- or -acted roles. Young (adolescent) men were still preferred for women's roles due to their less obviously masculine appearance and the higher pitch of their voices. The roles of adolescent men in kabuki, known as , were also played by young men, often selected for their attractiveness; this became a common practice, and were often presented in an erotic context.\nThe focus of kabuki performances also increasingly began to emphasise drama alongside dance. However, the ribald nature of kabuki performances continued, with male actors also engaging in sex work for both female and male customers. Audiences frequently became rowdy, and brawls occasionally broke out, sometimes over the favors of a particularly popular or handsome actor, leading the shogunate to ban first and then roles for a short period of time; both bans were rescinded by 1652.\n1673\u20131841: Genroku period kabuki.\nDuring the Genroku period, kabuki thrived, with the structure of kabuki plays formalising into the structure they are performed in today, alongside many other elements which eventually came to be recognised as a key aspect of kabuki tradition, such as conventional character tropes. Kabuki theater and , an elaborate form of puppet theater later known as , became closely associated with each other, mutually influencing the other's further development.\nThe famous playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon, one of the first professional kabuki playwrights, produced several influential works during this time, though the piece usually acknowledged as his most significant, (\"The Love Suicides at\" ), was originally written for . Like many plays, it was adapted for kabuki, eventually becoming popular enough to reportedly inspire a number of real-life \"copycat\" suicides, and leading to a government ban on (plays about love suicides) in 1723.\nAlso during the Genroku period was the development of the style of posing, credited to kabuki actor Ichikawa Danj\u016br\u014d I, alongside the development of the mask-like makeup worn by kabuki actors in some plays.\nIn the mid-18th century, kabuki fell out of favor for a time, with taking its place as the premier form of stage entertainment among the lower social classes. That occurred partly because of the emergence of several skilled playwrights in that time. Little of note would occur in the further development of kabuki until the end of the century, when it began to reemerge in popularity.\n1842\u20131868: kabuki.\nIn the 1840s, repeated periods of drought led to a series of fires affecting Edo, with kabuki theatres\u2014traditionally made of wood\u2014frequently burning down, forcing many to relocate. When the area that housed the Nakamura-za was completely destroyed in 1841, the refused to allow the theatre to be rebuilt, saying that it was against fire code.\nThe shogunate, mostly disapproving of the socialisation and trade that occurred in kabuki theatres between merchants, actors and prostitutes, took advantage of the fire crisis in the following year, forcing the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za out of the city limits and into Asakusa, a northern suburb of Edo. This was part of the larger Tenp\u014d Reforms that the shogunate instituted starting in 1842 to restrict the overindulgence of pleasures. Actors, stagehands, and others associated with the performances were also forced to move as a result of the death of their livelihood; despite the move of everyone involved in kabuki performance, and many in the surrounding areas, to the new location of the theatres, the inconvenience of the distance led to a reduction in attendance. These factors, along with strict regulations, pushed much of kabuki \"underground\" in Edo, with performances changing locations to avoid the authorities.\nThe theatres' new location was called Saruwaka-ch\u014d, or Saruwaka-machi; the last thirty years of the Tokugawa shogunate's rule is often referred to as the \"Saruwaka-machi period\", and is well known for having produced some of the most exaggerated kabuki in Japanese history.\nSaruwaka-machi became the new theatre district for the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za theatres. The district was located on the main street of Asakusa, which ran through the middle of the small city. The street was renamed after Saruwaka Kanzaburo, who initiated Edo kabuki in the Nakamura-za in 1624.\nEuropean artists began noticing Japanese theatrical performances and artwork, and many artists, such as Claude Monet, were inspired by Japanese woodblock prints. This Western interest prompted Japanese artists to increase their depictions of daily life, including the depiction of theatres, brothels, main streets and so on. One artist, Utagawa Hiroshige, produced a series of prints based on Saruwaka from the Saruwaka-machi period in Asakusa.\nDespite the revival of kabuki in another location, the relocation diminished the tradition's most abundant inspirations for costuming, make-up, and storylines. Ichikawa KodanjiIV was considered one of the most active and successful actors during the Saruwaka-machi period. Deemed unattractive, he mainly performed , or dancing, in dramas written by Kawatake Mokuami, who also wrote during the Meiji era to follow. Kawatake Mokuami commonly wrote plays that depicted the common lives of the people of Edo. He introduced (seven-and-five syllable meter) dialogue and music such as . His kabuki performances became quite popular once the Saruwaka-machi period ended and theatre returned to Edo; many of his works are still performed.\nIn 1868, the Tokugawa ceased to exist, with the restoration of the Emperor. Emperor Meiji was restored to power and moved from Kyoto to the new capital of Edo, or Tokyo, beginning the Meiji period. Kabuki once again returned to the pleasure quarters of Edo, and throughout the Meiji period became increasingly more radical, as modern styles of kabuki plays and performances emerged. Playwrights experimented with the introduction of new genres to kabuki, and introduced twists on traditional stories.\nPost-Meiji period kabuki.\nBeginning in 1868, enormous cultural changes, such as the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, the elimination of the samurai class, and the opening of Japan to the West, helped to spark kabuki's re-emergence. Both actors and playwrights strove to improve the reputation of kabuki in the face of new foreign influence and amongst the upper classes, partially through adapting traditional styles to modern tastes. This endeavour would prove successful, with the Emperor sponsoring a kabuki performance on 21 April 1887.\nAfter World War II, the occupying forces briefly banned kabuki, which had formed a strong base of support for Japan's war efforts since 1931. This ban was in conjunction with broader restrictions on media and art forms that the American military occupation instituted after WWII. However, by 1947 the ban on kabuki was rescinded, but censorship rules lingered.\nPost-war to modern day kabuki.\nThe ensuing period of occupation following World War II posited a difficult time for kabuki; besides the war's physical impact and devastation upon the country, some schools of thought chose to reject both the styles and artforms of pre-war Japan, kabuki amongst them. Director Tetsuji Takechi's popular and innovative productions of kabuki classics at this time are credited with sparking new interest in kabuki in the Kansai region. Of the many popular young stars who performed with the Takechi Kabuki, Nakamura Ganjiro III (b. 1931) was the leading figure, first known as Nakamura Senjaku before taking his current name. It was this period of kabuki in Osaka that became known as the \"Age of Senjaku\" in his honor.\nToday, kabuki is the most popular of the traditional styles of Japanese drama, with its star actors often appearing in television or film roles. Well-known actor Band\u014d Tamasabur\u014d V has appeared in several non-kabuki plays and movies, often in the role of a woman.\nKabuki also appears in works of Japanese popular culture such as anime. In addition to the handful of major theatres in Tokyo and Kyoto, there are many smaller theatres in Osaka and throughout the countryside. The troupe, based in \u014cshika, Nagano Prefecture, is one example.\nSome local kabuki troupes today use female actors in roles. The Ichikawa Sh\u014djo Kabuki Gekidan, an all-female troupe, debuted in 1953 to significant acclaim, though the majority of kabuki troupes have remained entirely-male.\nThe introduction of earphone guides in 1975, including an English version in 1982, helped broaden the artform's appeal. As a result, in 1991 the Kabuki-za, one of Tokyo's best known kabuki theaters, began year-round performances and, in 2005, began marketing kabuki cinema films. Kabuki troupes regularly tour Asia, Europe and America, and there have been several kabuki-themed productions of Western plays such as those of Shakespeare. Western playwrights and novelists have also experimented with kabuki themes, an example of which is Gerald Vizenor's (2004). Writer Yukio Mishima pioneered and popularised the use of kabuki in modern settings and revived other traditional arts, such as Noh, adapting them to modern contexts. There have even been kabuki troupes established in countries outside Japan. For instance, in Australia, the Za Kabuki troupe at the Australian National University has performed a kabuki drama each year since 1976, the longest regular kabuki performance outside Japan.\nIn November 2002, a statue was erected in honor of kabuki's founder, Izumo no Okuni and to commemorate 400 years of kabuki's existence. Diagonally across from the Minami-za, the last remaining kabuki theater in Kyoto, it stands at the east end of a bridge (Shij\u014d \u014chashi) crossing the Kamo River in Kyoto.\nKabuki was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2005.\nSuper Kabuki.\nWhile still maintaining most of the historical practices of kabuki, aimed to broaden its appeal by creating a new genre of kabuki productions called . With as the first Super Kabuki production to premiere in 1986, remakes of traditional plays and new contemporary creations have been brought to local theaters throughout the country, including anime-based productions such as \"Naruto\" or \"One Piece\" starting from 2014.\nSuper Kabuki has sparked controversy within the Japanese population regarding the extent of modification of the traditional art form. Some say that it has lost its 400-year history, while others consider the adaptations necessary for contemporary relevance. Regardless, since incorporating more advanced technology in the new stage sets, costumes, and lighting, Super Kabuki has regained interest from the young demographic.\nIn addition, Square Enix announced a Super Kabuki adaptation of \"Final Fantasy X\" collaborating with Tokyo Broadcasting System in 2022. Entitled \"Kinoshita Group presents New Kabuki Final Fantasy X\" and part of celebrations of the \"Final Fantasy\" franchise's 35th anniversary, it is scheduled to be performed at the IHI Stage Around Tokyo from March 4 to April 12, 2023.\nElements.\nStage design.\nThe kabuki stage features a projection called a , a walkway which extends into the audience and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made. Okuni also performed on a stage with her entourage. The stage is used not only as a walkway or path to get to and from the main stage, but important scenes are also played on the stage.\nKabuki stages and theaters have steadily become more technologically sophisticated, and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18th century. A driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of kabuki theater, that of the sudden, dramatic revelation or transformation. A number of stage tricks, including actors' rapid appearance and disappearance, employ these innovations. The term , often translated as \"playing to the gallery\", is sometimes used as a catch-all for these tricks. The , and several innovations including revolving stage, and have all contributed to kabuki. The creates depth and both and provide a vertical dimension.\n (revolving stage) developed in the Ky\u014dh\u014d era (1716\u20131735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The (\"darkened revolve\") technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for (\"lighted revolve\"), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early 18th century.\n refers to the stage \"traps\" that have been commonly employed in kabuki since the middle of the 18th century. These traps raise and lower actors or sets to the stage. or refers to trap(s) moving upward and or to traps descending. This technique is often used to lift an entire scene at once.\n (riding in mid-air) is a technique, which appeared toward the middle of the 19th century, by which an actor's costume is attached to wires and he is made to \"fly\" over the stage or certain parts of the auditorium. This is similar to the wire trick in the stage musical \"Peter Pan\", in which Peter launches himself into the air. It is still one of the most popular (visual tricks) in kabuki today; major kabuki theaters, such as the National Theatre, Kabuki-za and Minami-za, are all equipped with installations.\nScenery changes are sometimes made mid-scene, while the actors remain on stage and the curtain stays open. This is sometimes accomplished by using a , or \"small wagon stage\". This technique originated at the beginning of the 18th century, where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform. Also common are stagehands rushing onto the stage adding and removing props, backdrops and other scenery; these are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible. Stagehands also assist in a variety of quick costume changes known as (\"quick change technique\").\nWhen a character's true nature is suddenly revealed, the devices of and are often used. This involves layering one costume over another and having a stagehand pull the outer one off in front of the audience.\nThe curtain that shields the stage before the performance and during the breaks is in the traditional colours of black, red and green, in various order, or white instead of green, vertical stripes. The curtain consists of one piece and is pulled back to one side by a staff member by hand.\nAn additional outer curtain called was not introduced until the Meiji era following the introduction of western influence. These are more ornate in their appearance and are woven. They depict the season in which the performance is taking place, often designed by renowned artists.\nAppearances.\nSince feudal laws in 17th century Japan prohibited replicating the looks of samurai or nobility and the use of luxurious fabrics, the kabuki costumes were groundbreaking new designs to the general public, even setting trends that still exist today.\nAlthough the earliest kabuki costumes have not been preserved, separate and kabuki costumes today are made based on written records called and in collaboration with those whose families have been in the kabuki industry for generations. The kimono the actors wear for their costumes are typically made with vibrant colours and multiple layers. Both and wear - pleated trousers \u2013 in some plays, and both use padding underneath their costumes to create the correct body shape for the outfit.\nKabuki makeup provides an element of style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form. Rice powder is used to create the white base for the characteristic stage makeup, and enhances or exaggerates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks. The colour of the is an expression of the character's nature: red lines are used to indicate passion, heroism, righteousness, and other positive traits; blue or black, villainy, jealousy, and other negative traits; green, the supernatural; and purple, nobility.\nAnother special feature of kabuki costumes is the , or the wig. Each actor has a different wig made for every role, constructed from a thin base of hand-beaten copper custom-made to fit the actor perfectly, and each wig is usually styled in a traditional manner. The hair used in the wigs is typically real human hair hand-sewn onto a habotai base, though some styles of wig require yak hair or horse hair.\nPerformance.\nThe three main categories of kabuki play are , , and .\n, or history plays, are set within the context of major events in Japanese history. Strict censorship laws during the Edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited criticising the shogunate or casting it in a bad light, although enforcement varied greatly over the years. Many shows were set in the context of the Genpei War of the 1180s, the Nanboku-ch\u014d Wars of the 1330s, or other historical events. Frustrating the censors, many shows used these historical settings as metaphors for contemporary events. , one of the most famous plays in the kabuki repertoire, serves as an excellent example; it is ostensibly set in the 1330s, though it actually depicts the contemporary (18th century) affair of the revenge of the 47 \"r\u014dnin\".\nUnlike , which generally focused upon the samurai class, focused primarily upon commoners, namely townspeople and peasants. Often referred to as \"domestic plays\" in English, generally related to themes of family drama and romance. Some of the most famous are the love suicide plays, adapted from works by the playwright Chikamatsu; these center on romantic couples who cannot be together in life due to various circumstances and who therefore decide to be together in death instead. Many if not most contain significant elements of this theme of societal pressures and limitations.\n pieces place their emphasis on dance, which may be performed with or without dialogue, where dance can be used to convey emotion, character and plot. Quick costume change techniques may sometimes be employed in such pieces. Notable examples include and . musicians may be seated in rows on stepped platforms behind the dancers.\nImportant elements of kabuki include the , in which the actor holds a picturesque pose to establish his character. At this point his house name () is sometimes heard in loud shout () from an expert audience member, serving both to express and enhance the audience's appreciation of the actor's achievement. An even greater compliment can be paid by shouting the name of the actor's father.\nThe main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen, drunkard person and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only faking his weakness, such as the character of Yuranosuke in . This is called or \"belly acting\", which means he has to perform from within to change characters. It is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn, but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor's emotion.\nEmotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes, a key element in kabuki. Gaudy and strong colours can convey foolish or joyful emotions, whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus.\nPlay structure and performance style.\nKabuki, like other forms of drama traditionally performed in Japan, was\u2014and sometimes still is\u2014performed in full-day programmes, with one play comprising a number of acts spanning the entire day. However, these plays\u2014particularly \u2014were commonly sequenced with acts from other plays in order to produce a full-day programme, as the individual acts in a kabuki play commonly functioned as stand-alone performances in and of themselves. plays, in contrast, were generally not sequenced with acts from other plays, and genuinely would take the entire day to perform.\nThe structure of a full-day performance was derived largely from the conventions of both and Noh theatre. Chief amongst these was the concept of , a pacing convention in theatre stating that the action of a play should start slow, speed up, and end quickly. The concept, elaborated on at length by master Noh playwright Zeami, governs not only the actions of the actors, but also the structure of the play, as well as the structure of scenes and plays within a day-long programme.\nNearly every full-length play occupies five acts. The first corresponds to , an auspicious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot. The next three acts correspond to , where events speed up, culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act, and possibly a battle in the second or fourth acts. The final act, corresponding to , is almost always short, providing a quick and satisfying conclusion.\nWhile many plays were written solely for kabuki, many others were taken from plays, Noh plays, folklore, or other performing traditions such as the oral tradition of the \"Tale of the Heike\". While plays tend to have serious, emotionally dramatic, and organised plots, plays written specifically for kabuki generally have looser, more humorous plots.\nOne crucial difference between and kabuki is a difference in storytelling focus; whereas focuses on the story and on the chanter who recites it, kabuki has a greater focus on the actors themselves. A play may sacrifice the details of sets, puppets, or action in favor of the chanter, while kabuki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actor's talents. It was not uncommon in kabuki to insert or remove individual scenes from a day's schedule in order to cater to an individual actor\u2014either scenes he was famed for, or that featured him, would be inserted into a program without regard to plot continuity. Certain plays were also performed uncommonly as they required an actor to be proficient in a number of instruments, which would be played live onstage, a skill that few actors possessed.\nKabuki traditions in Edo and the Kyoto-Osaka region (Kamigata) differed; throughout the Edo period, Edo kabuki was defined by its extravagance, both in the appearance of its actors, their costumes, stage tricks and bold poses. In contrast, Kamigata kabuki focused on natural and realistic styles of acting. Only towards the end of the Edo period did the two styles begin to merge to any significant degree. Before this time, actors from different regions often failed to adjust their acting styles when performing elsewhere, leading to unsuccessful performance tours outside of their usual region of performance.\nFamous plays.\nWhile there are many famous plays known today, many of the most famous were written in the mid-Edo period, and were originally written for theatre.\nActors.\nEvery kabuki actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stage names, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.\n are grand naming ceremonies held in kabuki theatres in front of the audience. Most often, a number of actors will participate in a single ceremony, taking on new stage-names. Their participation in a represents their passage into a new chapter of their performing careers.\nKabuki actors are typically part of a school of acting, or are associated with a particular theatre.\nInfluence of kabuki on other art forms.\nSince its beginning, kabuki has remained a significant piece of Japanese culture. The stories and actors have been recreated in many different art forms, including woodblock prints, books, magazines, oral storytelling, photography in later years, and others. Additionally, kabuki was and continues to be influenced by the books and stories circulating in Japan. In one such instance, the widely popular book , or Eight Dogs, was acted out in various episodes on the kabuki stage.\nOne important way the laboring class was able to enjoy kabuki performances outside of the stage was through home-brewed shows called . Also referred to as \"amateur kabuki\", these performances took place at the local level across Japan, but were most commonly held in the Gifu and Aichi prefectures. In Gifu Prefecture specifically, kabuki was a prominent feature of the annual autumn festival, with children's reenactments of kabuki performances taking place at Murakuni shrine for over 300 years.\nCloser to the cultural epicenter of kabuki in Edo (later Tokyo), commoners had other methods to enjoy performances without attending the shows. was a type of performance shorter in length and more affordable to the common class than kabuki. performances were often based on plots used in kabuki, and the two styles shared common themes. was another popular medium for kabuki consumption among commoners and elites alike. During the course of its publication, this magazine allowed those unable to attend performances to enjoy the liveliness of kabuki culture.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

McGilvrey had an ambitious vision for the school as a large university, instructing architect George F. Hammond, who designed the original campus buildings, to produce a master plan. Classes began in 1912 before any buildings had been completed at the campus in Kent. These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region. By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall. The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914. In 1915, the school was renamed Kent State Normal College due to the addition of four-year degrees. By then additional buildings had been added or were under construction. Kent State's enrollment growth was particularly notable during its summer terms. In 1924, the school's registration for summer classes was the largest of any teacher-training school in the United States. In 1929, the state of Ohio changed the name to Kent State College as it allowed the school to establish a college of arts and sciences.\nMcGilvrey's vision for Kent was not shared by many others outside the school, particularly at the state level and at other state schools. His efforts to have the state funding formula changed created opposition, particularly from Ohio State University and its president William Oxley Thompson. This resulted in a 1923 \"credit war\" where Ohio State refused Kent transfer credits and spread to several other schools taking similar action. It was this development \u2013 along with several other factors \u2013 which led to the firing of McGilvrey in January 1926. McGilvrey was succeeded first by David Allen Anderson (1926\u20131928) and James Ozro Engleman from 1928 to 1938, though he continued to be involved with the school for several years as president emeritus and as head of alumni relations from 1934 to 1945. He was present in Columbus on May 17, 1935, when Kent native Governor Martin L. Davey signed a bill that allowed Kent State and Bowling Green to add schools of business administration and graduate programs, giving them each university status; the college's name was thus changed to Kent State University.\n1940s to 1960s.\nFrom 1944 to 1963, the university was led by President George Bowman. During his tenure, the student senate, faculty senate and graduate council were organized. Although it had served Stark County from the 1920s, in 1946, the university's first regional campus, the Stark Campus, was established in Canton, Ohio. In the fall of 1947, Bowman appointed Oscar W. Ritchie as a full-time faculty member. Ritchie's appointment to the faculty made him the first African American to serve on the faculty at Kent State and also made him the first African American professor to serve on the faculty of any state university in Ohio. In 1977, the former Student Union, which had been built in 1949, was rededicated as Oscar Ritchie Hall in his honor. Recently renovated, Oscar Ritchie Hall currently houses the department of Pan-African Studies the Center of Pan-African Culture, the Henry Dumas Library, the Institute for African American Affairs, the Garrett Morgan Computer Lab and the African Community Theatre.\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw continued growth in both enrollment and in the physical size of the campus. Several new dorms and academic buildings were built during this time, including the establishment of additional regional campuses in Warren (1954), Ashtabula (1957), New Philadelphia (1962), Salem (1962), Burton (1964), and East Liverpool, Ohio (1965). In 1961, grounds superintendent Larry Wooddell and Biff Staples of the Davey Tree Expert Company released ten cages of black squirrels obtained from Victoria Park in London, Ontario, Canada, onto the Kent State campus. By 1964 their estimated population was around 150 and today they have spread in and around Kent and have become unofficial mascots of both the city and university. Since 1981, the annual Black Squirrel Festival is held every fall on campus.\nIn 1965, chemistry professor Glenn H. Brown established the Liquid Crystal Institute, a world leader in the research and development of the multibillion-dollar liquid crystal industry. James Fergason invented and patented the basic TN LCD in 1969 and ten liquid crystal companies have been spun off from the institute.\nIn 1967, Kent State became the first university to run an independent, student-operated Campus Bus Service. It was unique in that it provided jobs for students, receiving funding from student fees rather than bus fares. Campus Bus Service was the largest such operation in the country until it merged with the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority in 2004. 1969 saw the opening of a new Memorial Stadium on the far eastern edge of campus and the closure and dismantling of the old Memorial Stadium.\nKent State shootings.\nKent State gained international attention on May 4, 1970, when an Ohio Army National Guard unit fired at students during an anti-war protest on campus, killing four and wounding nine. The Guard had been called into Kent after several protests in and around campus had become violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of the ROTC building. The main cause of the protests was the United States' invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The shootings caused an immediate closure of the campus with students and faculty given just 60\u00a0minutes to pack belongings. Around the country, many college campuses canceled classes or closed for fear of similar violent protests. In Kent, schools were closed and the National Guard restricted entry into the city limits, patrolling the area until May 8. With the campus closed, faculty members came up with a variety of solutions\u2014including holding classes in their homes, at public buildings and places, via telephone, or through the mail\u2014to allow their students to complete the term, which was only a few weeks away at the time.\nIn 1971, the university established the Center for Peaceful Change, now known as the Center for Applied Conflict Management, as a \"living memorial\" to the students who had died. It offers degree programs in Peace and Conflict Studies and Conflict Resolution and is one of the earliest such programs in the United States.\nIn response to, and protest of, the Kent State shootings, Neil Young wrote the song \"Ohio\" which was performed by the folk rock group Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. In remembrance of the tragedy, a group of professors and students created a website that features a map with oral histories and eyewitness accounts of the event.\n1970s to 1980s.\nAlso in 1970, the university opened its 12-story library, moving from the previous home of Rockwell Hall to the tallest building in Portage County. Dedicated in 1971, the library became a member of the Association of Research Libraries in 1973. Kent State joined with the University of Akron and Youngstown State University in establishing the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in 1973. It was the world's first medical consortium. Today it includes a college of pharmacy and Cleveland State University as an additional consortium member.\nKent State was again in the national spotlight in 1977 when construction was set to begin on the Memorial Gym Annex, adjacent to the area where the Kent State shootings had occurred in 1970. Protesters organized a tent city in May, which lasted into July. Several attempts were made to block construction even after the end of the tent city, including an appeal to the United States Congress and the Department of the Interior to have the area declared a National Historic Landmark, which ended up being unsuccessful. Additional rallies were held that year, including one attended by Joan Baez on August 20. After several additional unsuccessful legal challenges, construction finally began on September 19 and was finished in 1979.\n1990\u2013present.\nIn March 1991, Kent State once again made history by appointing Carol Cartwright as president of the university, the first female to hold such a position at any state university in Ohio. In 1994, Kent State was named a \"Research University II\" by the Carnegie Foundation. Beginning in the late 1990s, the university began a series of building renovations and construction, which included the complete renovation of the historic original campus, the construction of several new residence halls, a student recreation center, and additional academic buildings on the Kent Campus and at the regional campuses. In September 2010, the university announced its largest student body ever, with a total enrollment of 41,365. U.S. News &amp; World Report's 2017 rankings put Kent State as tied for #188 for National Universities and tied for #101 in Top Public Schools. Kent State had a Fall 2015 acceptance rate of 85%.\nCampuses.\nKent State University is an eight-campus system in Northeast Ohio, with the main administrative center and largest campus in Kent.\nKent.\nWithin the Kent State University system, the main campus is officially referred to as the \"Kent Campus\".

He was educated at Lafayette High School in Buffalo, where he received training from long-time art teacher Elizabeth Weiffenbach. He entered the United States Army Air Forces right out of high school (Crystal Beach, Ontario, Canada). He flew as camera man for reconnaissance in the South Pacific and painted bomber noses during World War II. He then worked for Curtiss-Wright for a brief period, then went to study at The Art Institute of Pittsburgh and began to work in advertising. His first marriage was in 1948 to Nina Vaccaro, though they later divorced. He later married Pauline (Polly) Bussard in 1952; they had two children, Jacqui and Jerry. Polly died of cancer in January 1987. In 1988 he married (and is survived by) Dr. Laura Brodian.\nCareer.\nFreas began his work as a commercial artist in the late 1940s, mostly for television. His goal was to become a science fiction artist.\nThe fantasy magazine \"Weird Tales\" published the first cover art by Freas on its November 1950 issue: \"The Piper\" illustrating \"The Third Shadow\" by H. Russell Wakefield. His second was a year later in the same magazine, followed by several \"Planet Stories\" or \"Weird Tales\" covers and interior illustrations for three Gnome Press books in 1952. With his illustrating career underway, he continued to devise unique and imaginative concepts for other fantasy and science fiction magazines of that period. In a field where airbrushing is common practice, paintings by Freas are notable for his use of bold brush strokes, and a study of his work reveals his experimentation with a wide variety of tools and techniques.\nOver the next five decades, he created covers for hundreds of books and magazines (and much more interior artwork), notably \"Astounding Science Fiction\", both before and after its title change to \"Analog\", from 1953 to 2003. He started at \"Mad\" magazine in February 1957 and by July 1958 was the magazine's new cover artist; he painted most of its covers until October 1962 (featuring the iconic character, Alfred E. Neuman). He also created cover illustrations for DAW, Signet, Ballantine Books, Avon, all 58 Laser Books (which are now collector's items), and over 90 covers for Ace books alone. He was editor and artist for the first ten \"Starblaze\" books. He illustrated the cover of Jean Shepherd, Ian Ballantine, and Theodore Sturgeon's literary hoax, \"I, Libertine\" (Ballantine Books, 1956). That same year he drew cartoon illustrations for Bernard Shir-Cliff's \"The Wild Reader\".\nFreas also painted insignia and posters for Skylab I; pinup girls on bombers while in the United States Army Air Forces; comic book covers; the covers of the \"GURPS\" worldbooks \"Lensman\" and \"Planet Krishna\"; and more than 500 saints' portraits for the Franciscans executed simultaneously with his portraits of Alfred E. Neuman for \"Mad\". He was very active in gaming and medical illustration. His cover of Queen's album \"News of the World\" (1977) was a pastiche of his October 1953 cover illustration for Tom Godwin's \"The Gulf Between\" for \"Astounding Science Fiction\" magazine.\nFreas published several collections of his color and black-and-white artwork in the volumes \"Frank Kelly Freas: The Art of Science Fiction\" and \"Frank Kelly Freas: As Others See it\", as well as in a spiral-bound collection of his black-and-white illustrations from \"Astounding Science Fiction\". He also frequently gave art presentations, and his work appeared in numerous exhibitions. He was among several of the inaugural recipients of the Hugo Award for Best Artist in 1955 and was recipient under different names of the next three conferred in 1956, 1958, and 1959. With six more Hugo awards to his name (1970 and 1972\u201376), he became the first person to receive ten Hugo awards (he was nominated 20 times). No other artist in science fiction has consistently matched his record and output.\nFreas was twice a Guest of Honor at Worldcon, at Chicon IV in 1982 and at Torcon 3 in 2003, although a fall suffered shortly before the latter convention precluded him from attending.\nHe died in West Hills, California and is buried in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth.\nAwards.\nFreas's achievements include the Doctor of Arts, Art Institute of Pittsburgh, December 2003. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2006, the second artist after Chesley Bonestell.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nBiography and criticism\nBibliography and works"}
{"id": "16988", "revid": "51036699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16988", "title": "Knock-knock joke", "text": "Audience-participation joke\nThe knock-knock joke is an audience-participation joke cycle; a knock-knock joke is primarily a child's joke, though there are exceptions. \nThe scenario is of a person knocking on the front door to a house. The teller of the joke says, \"Knock, knock!\"; the recipient responds, \"Who's there?\" The teller gives a name (such as \"Noah\"), a description (such as \"Police\"), or something that purports to be a name (such as \"Needle\"). The other person then responds by asking the caller's surname (\"Noah who?\" / \"Police who?\" / \"Needle who?\"), to which the joke-teller delivers a pun involving the name (\"Noah place I can spend the night?\" / \"Police let me in\u2014it's cold out here!\" / \"Needle little help with the groceries!\").\nThe formula of the joke is usually followed strictly, though there are cases where it is subverted.\nStructure.\nKnock-knock jokes are a type of word play joke, which derive their humor from the conflation of homonyms. The joke is performed cooperatively by the speaker and the listener in a call and response format as they create a scene depicting a visitor knocking at a door. The joke is dependent on the speaker and the listener having previous exposure to the joke's format and enough general and linguistic knowledge to understand what is being referenced in the punchline.\nA standard knock-knock joke has five lines of dialogue.\nIn the first line, the speaker plays the role of someone knocking at the listener's front door by saying \"knock-knock\". The line is an example of onomatopoeia. It is often spoken with a stylized fall, a type of stylized intonation where the second syllable is said in a lower pitch than the first.\nIn the second line, the listener's response of \"who's there\" has them play the role of someone inside their own home as the speaker knocks.\nThe third line is the point that a person at the door would provide their given name or some other identifier. In the joke, the name does not provide enough information to identify a specific speaker. The joke traditionally uses a name for the third line, but any phrase can be used. If an inanimate object is referenced, it is inferred that the person knocking is a human using the object as a name, rather than the physical object they describe.\nThe fourth line is normally when the person at home would ask for more information to clarify who is at the door, as a given name or title on its own is not always specific enough to discern a person's identity. In the case of a given name, this can be because the person at home does not know anyone by that name or knows multiple people by that name.\nThe fifth line breaks from the imagined scenario of a person knocking on a door. Some knock-knock jokes end by repeating the third line, using its phonetic structure as a pun to be the start of a new sentence. In this case, the content of the third line is spoken quickly to blend its sound into the rest of the phrase. Other knock-knock jokes take advantage of the phonetic structure of the fourth line, and the fifth line is a response to the newly created phrase spoken by the listener. In both cases, the fifth line effectively changes the meaning of the third and fourth lines.\nHistory.\nDialogue resembling a knock-knock joke appears in the play \"The Case is Altered\" by Ben Jonson, written c.\u20091597, in which the character Juniper says he is not Rachel's father but is willing to become a father with her.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nJUNIPER: No, I'll knock. We'll not stand upon horizons and tricks but fall roundly to the matter. [He knocks.]\nONION: Well said, sweet Juniper. Horizons? Hang 'em! Knock, knock!\nRACHEL: [Within] Who's there? Father?\nJUNIPER: Father? No, and yet a father, if you please to be a mother.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe origin of the knock-knock joke, or the first appearance of the phrase \"knock knock, who's there\", is sometimes attributed to William Shakespeare for his 1606 play \"Macbeth\". In Act 2, Scene 3, the character of the porter gives a soliloquy about a porter accepting people into hell.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nKnock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of\nBeelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged\nhimself on the expectation of plenty: come in\ntime; have napkins enow about you; here\nyou'll sweat for't.\nKnock, knock! Who's there, in the other devil's\nname? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could\nswear in both the scales against either scale;\nwho committed treason enough for God's sake,\nyet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come\nin, equivocator.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe modern knock-knock joke first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century, although the exact origin is unknown. Writing in the \"Oakland Tribune\", Merely McEvoy recalled a style of joke from around 1900 where a person would ask a question such as \"Do you know Arthur?\", the unsuspecting listener responding with \"Arthur who?\" and the joke teller answering \"Arthurmometer!\" He compared it to a joke that emerged in the flapper community around 1920 where a woman would ask \"Have you ever heard of Hiawatha?\", and upon being asked \"Hiawatha who?\", she would respond with \"Hiawatha a good girl ... till I met you.\"\nA variation of the format in the form of a children's game was described in 1929. In the game of Buff, a child with a stick thumps it on the ground, and the dialogue ensues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nKnock, knock!\nWho's there?\nBuff.\nWhat says Buff?\nBuff says Buff to all his men, And I say Buff to you again.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nKnock-knock jokes emerged in the United States in the 1930s. They became a fad in 1936, and knock-knock clubs formed in the Midwestern United States. The Edgmont Cash &amp; Carry, a grocery store in Chester, Pennsylvania, used knock-knock jokes in its advertisements and hosted a contest for the best knock-knock jokes. The WKBO radio station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, helped popularize the format by making frequent jokes using the name of Frank Knox, the Republican vice presidential candidate in the 1936 United States presidential election. \"The Gridley Herald\" and \"The Milwaukee Journal\" reported on knock-knock jokes in 1936 as a new parlour game and derided it as uninteresting. The same year, Bob Dunn authored the book \"Knock Knock: Featuring Enoch Knox\", and he is regarded by some as having invented the modern knock-knock joke.\nIn 1936, the standard knock-knock joke format was used in a newspaper advertisement. That joke was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nKnock, knock!\nWho's there?\nRufus.\nRufus who?\nRufus the most important part of your house.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA 1936 Associated Press newspaper article said that \"What's This?\" had given way to \"Knock Knock!\" as a favorite parlor game. The article also said that \"knock knock\" seemed to be an outgrowth of making up sentences with difficult words, an old parlor favorite. A popular joke of 1936 (the year of Edward VIII's brief reign) was \"Knock knock. Who's there? Edward Rex. Edward Rex who? Edward Rex the Coronation.\" Fred Allen's 30 December 1936 radio broadcast included a humorous wrapup of the year's least important events, including a supposed interview with the man who \"invented a negative craze\" on 1 April: \"Ramrod Dank... the first man to coin a Knock Knock.\"\nAfter peaking in 1936, knock-knock jokes received greater push-back from critics who saw them as unfunny, pseudo-intellectual, or pathological. Despite this, they remained a popularly known joke format. Knock-knock jokes have since been popularized in other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.\nPopular culture.\nSwing orchestra performer Vincent Lopez wrote the novelty song \"Knock-Knock Song\", which incorporated audience call-and-response.\n\"Knock knock\" was the catchphrase of music hall performer Wee Georgie Wood, who was recorded in 1936 saying it in a radio play, but he simply used the words as a reference to his surname and did not use it as part of the well-known joke formula. The format was well known in the UK and US in the 1950s and 1960s before falling out of favor. It then enjoyed a renaissance after the jokes became a regular part of the badinage on \"Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In\".\nAn example of a non-standard knock-knock joke is:\nKnock knock.\nWho's there?\nDeath.\nDeath wh-gkh (gagging sound of sudden fatal choking).\nBeing familiar with the back-and-forth pattern of the joke is crucial. In an episode of the TV detective series \"Monk\", Adrian Monk is feeling sad. His assistant, Natalie, tries to cheer him up. She says she has thought of something funny, and asks if he wants to hear it. \"Yes,\" he answers. She begins, using the standard formula, \"Knock knock.\" Adrian pauses, obviously thinking about this, but puzzled. Then he dismisses it, saying, \"That's not funny.\" The joke, this time, is that he is not familiar with knock-knock jokes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name Kangol reflects the original materials for production, the K coming from the word 'silK' (a recent attribution to 'Knitting' is incorrect), the ANG from 'ANGora', and the OL from 'woOL'. Although no Kangol hat has ever actually been manufactured in Australia, the Kangaroo logo was adopted by Kangol in 1983 because Americans commonly asked where they could get \"the Kangaroo hat\".\nEarly history.\nFounded in 1938 by a Polish Jew, Jacques Spreiregen, Kangol produced hats for workers, golfers, and especially soldiers. Spreiregen, born Jacob Henryk Spreiregen in Warsaw in 1893, emigrated with his family to Paris in 1906. He then moved to London in 1914, where he worked as an importer and seller of various products that included wool, woollen goods, and berets. He served in the British Army in World War I, joining the Labour Corps to drive ambulances, and obtained British nationality in 1920. In 1938, he was joined by his nephew Joseph Meisner to open and run the first Kangol factory at Cleator, Cumbria, England. A second factory was opened at nearby Frizington, and later, under the direction of Spreiregen's younger nephew Sylvain Meisner, a third factory, manufacturing motorcycle helmets and seat belts in Carlisle. Kangol was the major supplier of berets for the armed forces during World War II; the company also provided the berets for the British Olympic Team in 1948.\nRecent history.\nKangol has been owned by Frasers Group since 2006, when it acquired the brand from private-equity fund August Equity Trust. Licences to manufacture and sell Kangol apparel have been sold to many different companies, including D2 and Topshop. In 2002, the Kangol apparel brand was acquired by Kangol Clothing North America LLC, a subsidiary of Chesterfield Manufacturing Corp in Charlotte North Carolina. In 2003, Chesterfield was acquired by Tomasello Inc., which was wholly owned and led by David W. Tomasello. The global rights to Kangol hats have been held by American hatmakers Bollman Hat Company since 2002.\nIt was announced, in February 2009, that Bollman were reviewing their worldwide operations, putting 33 jobs and the future of the Kangol head office in Cleator in doubt. On 6 April 2009, it was announced that the original factory would be converted to a warehouse with the loss of 25 jobs. No employees now remain employed at the company's original site as the outlet shop closed at the end of August 2009. The site in Frizington is now a housing estate, whilst the original Cleator site has been partly demolished to provide a Park &amp; Ride facility for nearby Sellafield and to facilitate other potential redevelopment. However, hats will continue to be made at their sites in Eastern Europe and the United States.\nPop fashion.\nIn the 1960s, designers Mary Quant and Pierre Cardin worked with the company, whose products graced the heads of the rich and famous, including the Beatles and Arnold Palmer, and later Diana, Princess of Wales. The company also supplied uniformed organisations such as the Scout Association.\nIn the 1980s, Kangol berets entered a new phase of fashion history with their adoption by members of the hip-hop community, such as Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Kangol Kid of UTFO, and The Notorious B.I.G.\nThe brand was popularised even more by the 1991 movie \"New Jack City\". The release of more consciously stylish products in the 1990s such as the furgora (angora-wool mix) Spitfire, was helped by its presence upon the head of Samuel L. Jackson in 1997. Kevin Eubanks, bandleader for \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", sported a Kangol beret on an almost nightly basis.\nIn 2009, Eminem wore the Cotton Twill Army Cap Kangol hat on his \"Beautiful\" video. As of 2024, Eminem's main hat style has been Kangol's army caps.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Regarded as one of the greatest drummers in the history of rock music, he was noted for his unique style of playing and his eccentric, self-destructive behaviour.\nMoon grew up in Wembley and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they recorded their first single. Moon was recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. Throughout his tenure with the Who, his drum kit steadily grew in size, and (along with Ginger Baker) he has been credited as one of the earliest rock drummers to regularly employ double bass drums in his setup. Moon occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation, and remained a member of the band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated with blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and destroying television sets. Moon also enjoyed touring and socialising, and became bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.\nMoon suffered a number of setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He suffered from alcoholism and acquired a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was \"Moon the Loon\". While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By the time of their final tour with him in 1976, and particularly during production of the studio album \"Who Are You\" (1978) and the concert film \"The Kids Are Alright\", his deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London from Los Angeles in 1978, dying that September from an overdose of clomethiazole, a drug intended to treat or prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. His drumming continues to be praised by critics and musicians, and he was posthumously inducted into the \"Modern Drummer\" Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming the second rock drummer to be chosen, and in 2011 he was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a \"Rolling Stone\" readers' poll. Moon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a member of the Who.\nEarly life.\nKeith John Moon was born to motor mechanic Alfred Charles Moon and Kathleen Winifred (\"Kit\"), n\u00e9e Hopley, on 23 August 1946 at Central Middlesex Hospital in northwest London; he grew up in Wembley. Moon was hyperactive as a boy, with a restless imagination and a particular fondness for music and \"The Goon Show\". Moon attended Alperton Secondary Modern School after failing his eleven plus exam, which precluded his attending a grammar school. His art teacher said in a report: \"Retarded artistically. Idiotic in other respects.\" His music teacher wrote that Moon \"has great ability, but must guard against a tendency to show off.\"\nMoon joined his local Sea Cadet Corps band at the age of twelve on the bugle, but found the instrument too difficult to learn and took up drums instead. He was interested in practical jokes and home science kits, with a particular fondness for explosions. On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macari's Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school around Easter 1961, at age 14. Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio repairman, enabling him to buy his first drum kit.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nMoon took lessons from one of the loudest contemporary drummers, Screaming Lord Sutch's Carlo Little, at ten shillings per lesson. His early style was influenced by jazz, American surf music and rhythm and blues, exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer Hal Blaine. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly Gene Krupa (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied). He also admired Elvis Presley's original drummer DJ Fontana, The Shadows' original drummer Tony Meehan and the Pretty Things' Viv Prince. Moon also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in Motown. Moon idolised the Beach Boys; Roger Daltrey later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even at the peak of the Who's fame.\nDuring this time Moon joined his first serious band, the Escorts, replacing his best friend Gerry Evans. In December 1962 he joined the Beachcombers, a semi-professional London cover band playing hits by groups such as The Shadows. During his time in the group Moon incorporated theatrical tricks into his act, including \"shooting\" the group's lead singer with a starter pistol. The Beachcombers all had day jobs; Moon, who worked in the sales department at British Gypsum, had the keenest interest in turning professional. In April 1964, aged 17, he auditioned for the Who as a replacement for Doug Sandom. The Beachcombers continued as a local cover band after his departure.\nThe Who.\nA commonly cited story of how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a \"ginger vision\"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; he played in the set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process.\nAs Moon later recounted: \"[T]hey said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song\u2014'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went \"arrgggGhhhh\" on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it.\" Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had \"just been filling in for the last fifteen years\".\nMoon's arrival in the Who changed the dynamics of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moon's temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. \"We used to fight regularly\", remembered Moon in later years. \"John [Entwistle] and I used to have fights\u2014it wasn't very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing.\" Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: \"We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music\", he said in a later interview. Although Townshend described him as a \"completely different person to anyone I've ever met\", the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moon's drumming style affected the band's musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moon's lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.\nMoon was particularly fond of touring since it was his only chance to regularly socialise with his bandmates, and was generally restless and bored when not playing live. This later carried over to other aspects of his life, as he acted them out (according to journalist and Who biographer Dave Marsh) \"as if his life were one long tour\". These antics earned him the nickname \"Moon the Loon\".\nMusical contributions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI suppose as a drummer, I'm adequate. I've got no real aspirations to be a great drummer. I just want to play drums for the Who and that's it.\n\u2014Keith Moon, \"Melody Maker\", September 1970\nMoon's style of drumming was considered unique by his bandmates, although they sometimes found his unconventional playing frustrating; Entwistle noted that he tended to play faster or slower according to his mood. \"He wouldn't play across his kit\", he later added. \"He'd play zig-zag. That's why he had two sets of tom-toms. He'd move his arms forward like a skier.\" Daltrey said that Moon \"just instinctively put drum fills in places that other people would never have thought of putting them\".\nWho biographer John Atkins wrote that the group's early test sessions for Pye Records in 1964 show that \"they seemed to have understood just how important was\u00a0... Moon's contribution.\" Contemporary critics questioned his ability to keep time, with biographer Tony Fletcher suggesting that the timing on \"Tommy\" was \"all over the place\". Who producer Jon Astley said, \"You didn't think he was keeping time, but he was.\" In the opinion of Atkins, early recordings of Moon's drumming sound tinny and disorganised; it was not until the recording of \"Who's Next\", with Glyn Johns' no-nonsense production techniques and the need to keep time to a synthesizer track, that Moon began developing more discipline in the studio. Fletcher considers the drumming on this album to be the best of Moon's career.\nUnlike contemporary rock drummers such as Ginger Baker and John Bonham, Moon hated drum solos and refused to play them in concert. At a Madison Square Garden show during The Who's 1974 tour, Townshend and Entwistle decided to spontaneously stop playing during \"Waspman\" to listen to Moon's drum solo. Moon continued briefly and then stopped, shouting, \"Drum solos are boring!\" On 23 June 1977, he made a guest appearance at a Led Zeppelin concert in Los Angeles.\nMoon also aspired to sing lead vocal on some songs. While the other three members handled most of the onstage vocals, Moon would attempt to sing backup (particularly on \"I Can't Explain\"). He provided humorous commentary during song announcements, although sound engineer Bob Pridden preferred to mute his vocal microphone on the mixing desk whenever possible. Moon's knack for making his bandmates laugh around the microphone led them to banish him from the studio when vocals were being recorded; this led to a game in which Moon would sneak in to join the singing. At the end of \"Happy Jack\", Townshend can be heard saying, \"I saw ya!\" to Moon as he tries to sneak into the studio. The drummer's interest in surf music and his desire to sing led to his performing lead vocals on several early tracks, including \"Bucket T\" and \"Barbara Ann\" (\"Ready Steady Who\" EP, 1966) and high backing vocals on other songs, such as \"Pictures of Lily\". His performance on \"Bell Boy\" (\"Quadrophenia\", 1973) saw him abandon \"serious\" vocal performances to sing in character, which gave him (in Fletcher's words) \"full licence to live up to his reputation as a lecherous drunk\"; it was \"exactly the kind of performance the Who needed from him to bring them back down to earth.\"\nMoon composed \"I Need You\", the instrumental \"Cobwebs and Strange\" (from the album \"A Quick One\", 1966), the single B-sides \"In The City\" (co-written with Entwistle) and \"Girl's Eyes\" (from \"The Who Sell Out\" sessions featured on \"Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B\" and a 1995 re-release of \"The Who Sell Out\"), \"Dogs Part Two\" (1969) and \"Waspman\" (1972). Moon also co-composed \"The Ox\" (an instrumental from their debut album, \"My Generation\") with Townshend, Entwistle and keyboardist Nicky Hopkins. \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" (from \"Tommy\") was credited to Moon because he came up with the idea, but the song was actually written by Townshend and, although there is a misconception that Moon sings on it, the album version is Townshend's demo.\nMoon produced the violin solo on \"Baba O'Riley\". Moon sat in on congas with East of Eden at London's Lyceum Ballroom, and afterwards suggested to violinist Dave Arbus that he play on the track.\nEquipment.\nMoon played a four- and later a five-piece drum kit during his early career. During much of 1964 and 1965 his setups consisted of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. He began to endorse Premier Drums in late 1965 and remained a loyal customer of the company. His first Premier kit was in red sparkle and featured two high toms. In 1966, Moon moved to an even larger kit, but without the customary hi-hat\u2014at the time he preferred keeping ride rhythms with ride and crash cymbals, but he later reinstated the hi-hats. His new larger configuration was notable for the presence of two bass drums; he has been credited, along with Ginger Baker, as one of the early pioneers of double bass drumming in rock. This kit was not used at the Who's performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. From 1967 to 1969, Moon used the \"Pictures of Lily\" drum kit (named for its artwork), which had two bass drums, two floor toms and three mounted toms. In recognition of his loyalty to the company, Premier reissued the kit in 2006 as the \"Spirit of Lily\".\nBy 1970, Moon had begun to use timbales, gongs and timpani, and these were included in his setup for the rest of his career. In 1973, Premier's marketing manager, Eddie Haynes, began consulting Moon about specific requirements. At one point, Moon asked Premier to make a white kit with gold-plated fittings. When Haynes said that it would be prohibitively expensive, Moon replied: \"Dear boy, do exactly as you feel it should be, but that's the way I want it.\" The kit was eventually fitted with copper fittings and later given to a young Zak Starkey, Moon's godson.\nDestroying instruments and other stunts.\nAt an early show at the Railway Tavern in Harrow, Townshend smashed his guitar after accidentally breaking it. When the audience demanded he do it again, Moon kicked over his drum kit. Subsequent live sets culminated in what the band later described as \"auto-destructive art\", in which band members (particularly Moon and Townshend) elaborately destroyed their equipment. Moon developed a habit of kicking over his drums, claiming that he did so in exasperation at an audience's indifference. Townshend later said, \"A set of skins is about $300 [then \u00a396] and after every show he'd just go bang, bang, bang and then kick the whole thing over.\"\nIn May 1966, Moon discovered that the Beach Boys' Bruce Johnston was visiting London. After the pair socialised for a few days, Moon and Entwistle brought Johnston to the set of \"Ready Steady Go!\", which made them late for a show with the Who that evening. During the finale of \"My Generation\", an altercation broke out on stage between Moon and Townshend which was reported on the front page of the \"New Musical Express\" the following week. Moon and Entwistle left the Who for a week (with Moon hoping to join the Animals or the Nashville Teens), but they changed their minds and returned.\nOn the Who's early US package tour at the RKO 58th Street Theatre in New York in March and April 1967, Moon performed two or three shows a day, kicking over his drum kit after every show. Later that year, during their appearance on \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\", he bribed a stagehand to load gunpowder into one of his bass drums; the stagehand used about ten times the standard amount. During the finale of \"My Generation\", he set off the charge. The intensity of the explosion singed Townshend's hair and embedded a piece of cymbal in Moon's arm. A clip of the incident became the opening scene for the film \"The Kids Are Alright\".\nAlthough Moon was known for kicking over his drum kit, Haynes claimed that it was done carefully and the kit rarely needed repairs. However, stands and foot pedals were frequently replaced; the drummer \"would go through them like a knife through butter\".\nOther work.\nMusic.\nWhile Moon generally said he was only interested in working with the Who, he participated in outside musical projects. In 1966, he worked with Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck, pianist Nicky Hopkins and future Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones on the instrumental \"Beck's Bolero\", which was the B-side to \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" and appeared on the album \"Truth\". Moon also played timpani on another track, a cover of Jerome Kern's \"Ol' Man River\". He was credited on the album as \"You Know Who\".\nMoon may have inspired the name for Led Zeppelin when he supposedly briefly considered leaving the Who in 1966 and spoke with Entwistle and Page about forming a supergroup; Moon (or Entwistle) remarked that a particular suggestion had gone down like a \"lead zeppelin\" (a play on \"lead balloon\"). Although this supergroup was never formed, Page remembered the phrase and later adapted it as the name of his new band.\nThe Beatles became friends with Moon, and this led to occasional collaborations. In 1967, he contributed backing vocals to \"All You Need Is Love\". On 15 December 1969, Moon joined John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band for a live performance at the Lyceum Theatre in London for a UNICEF charity concert. In 1972, the performance was released as a companion disc to Lennon and Ono's album \"Some Time in New York City\".\nMoon's friendship with Entwistle led to an appearance on \"Smash Your Head Against the Wall\", Entwistle's first solo album and the first by a member of the Who. Moon did not play drums on the album; Jerry Shirley did, with Moon providing percussion. \"Rolling Stone\"'s John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.\nMoon became involved in solo work when he moved to Los Angeles during the mid-1970s. Track Records-MCA released a Moon solo single in 1974, comprising cover versions of the Beach Boys' \"Don't Worry, Baby\" and \"Teenage Idol\". The following year he released his only solo album, entitled \"Two Sides of the Moon\". Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including Ringo Starr, session musicians Curly Smith and Jim Keltner, and actor-musician Miguel Ferrer). The album was received poorly by critics. \"New Musical Express\"'s Roy Carr wrote, \"Moonie, if you didn't have talent, I wouldn't care; but you have, which is why I'm not about to accept \"Two Sides of the Moon\".\" Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in \"Rolling Stone\", wrote: \"There isn't any legitimate reason for this album's existence.\" During one of his few televised solo drum performances (for ABC's \"Wide World\"), Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed as a cat on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and goldfish. When asked by an audience member what would happen to the kit, he joked that \"even the best drummers get hungry.\" His performance was not appreciated by animal lovers, several of whom called the station with complaints.\nFilm.\nIn the 2007 documentary film \"\", Daltrey and Townshend reminisced about Moon's talent for dressing as (and embodying) a variety of characters. They remembered his dream of getting out of music and becoming a Hollywood film actor, although Daltrey did not think Moon had the patience and work ethic required of a professional actor. Who manager Bill Curbishley agreed that Moon \"wasn't disciplined enough to actually turn up or commit to doing the stuff\".\nNevertheless, the drummer landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a cameo in Frank Zappa's \"200 Motels\" as a nun afraid of dying from a drug overdose. Although it only took 13 days to film, fellow cast member Howard Kaylan remembers Moon spending off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moon's next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stormy Tempest (played by Billy Fury) at a holiday camp during the early days of British rock 'n' roll, in 1973's \"That'll Be the Day\". He reprised the role for the film's 1974 sequel, \"Stardust\", in Jim MacLaine's (David Essex) backing band the Stray Cats and played Uncle Ernie in Ken Russell's 1975 film adaptation of \"Tommy\". Moon's last film appearance was in 1978's \"Sextette\".\nDestructive behaviour.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen you've got money and you do the kind of things I get up to, people laugh and say that you're eccentric, which is a polite way of saying you're fucking mad.\n\u2014Keith Moon\nMoon led a destructive lifestyle. During the Who's early days he began taking amphetamines, and in an \"NME\" interview said his favourite food was \"French Blues\". He spent his share of the band's income quickly, and was a regular at London clubs such as the Speakeasy (where manager Roy Flynn recalls having to throw him out on three occasions) and The Bag O'Nails. The combination of pills and alcohol escalated into alcoholism and drug addiction. \"[We] went through the same stages everybody goes through\u00a0\u2013 the bloody drug corridor\", he later reflected. \"Drinking suited the group a lot better.\"\nAccording to Townshend, Moon began destroying hotel rooms when the Who stayed at the Berlin Hilton on tour in late 1966. In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends' homes\u2014and even his own\u2014including throwing furniture from upper-storey windows. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing cost as much as \u00a3300,000. These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moon's way of demonstrating his eccentricity and he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant, Dougal Butler, observed: \"He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny; he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far. Like a train ride you couldn't stop.\"\nIn a limousine on the way to the airport, Moon insisted they return to their hotel, saying \"I forgot something.\" At the hotel he ran back to his room, grabbed the television and threw it out of the window into the swimming pool below. He then jumped back into the limo, saying \"I nearly forgot.\"\nFletcher argues that the Who's lengthy break (15 December 1971 \u2013 11 August 1972) between the end of their 1971 Who's Next Tour and the beginning of the \"Quadrophenia\" sessions devastated Moon's health, as without the rigours of lengthy shows and regular touring that had previously kept him in shape, his hard-partying lifestyle took a greater toll on his body. He did not keep a drum kit or practise at Tara, and began to deteriorate physically as a result of his lifestyle. Around the same time he became a severe alcoholic, starting the day with drinks. He changed from the \"lovable boozer\" he presented himself as, to a \"boorish drunk\". David Puttnam recalled, \"The drinking went from being a joke to being a problem. On \"That'll Be the Day\" it was social drinking. By the time \"Stardust\" came round it was hard drinking.\"\nExploding toilets.\nMoon's favourite stunt was to flush powerful explosives down toilets. According to Fletcher, Moon's toilet pyrotechnics began in 1965 when he purchased a case of 500 cherry bombs. Townshend remembers walking into the bathroom of Moon's hotel room and noticing the toilet had disappeared, with only the S-bend remaining. The drummer explained that since a cherry bomb was about to explode, he had thrown it down the toilet and showed Townshend the case of cherry bombs. \"And of course from that moment on,\" the guitarist remembered, \"we got thrown out of every hotel we ever stayed in.\"\nMoon moved from cherry bombs to M-80 fireworks to sticks of dynamite, which became his explosive of choice. \"All that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable,\" Moon remembered. \"I never realised dynamite was so powerful. I'd been used to penny bangers before.\" He quickly developed a reputation for destroying bathrooms and blowing up toilets. The destruction mesmerised him, and enhanced his public image as rock's premier hell-raiser. Tony Fletcher wrote that \"no toilet in a hotel or changing room was safe\" until Moon had exhausted his supply of explosives.\nEntwistle recalled being close to Moon on tour and both were often involved in blowing up toilets. In a 1981 \"Los Angeles Times\" interview he admitted, \"A lot of times when Keith was blowing up toilets I was standing behind him with the matches.\"\nOnce, a hotel manager called Moon in his room and asked him to lower the volume on his cassette recorder because it made \"too much noise\". In response the drummer asked him up to his room, excused himself to go to the bathroom, put a lit stick of dynamite in the toilet and shut the bathroom door. Upon returning, he asked the manager to stay for a moment, as he wanted to explain something. Following the explosion, Moon turned the recorder back on and said, \"That, dear boy, was noise. This is the 'Oo.'\"\nFlint Holiday Inn incident.\nOn 23 August 1967, on tour opening for Herman's Hermits, Moon celebrated his 21st birthday at a Holiday Inn in Flint, Michigan (though it was initially believed that he was actually turning 20). Entwistle later said, \"He decided that if it was a publicised fact that it was his 21st birthday, he would be able to drink.\"\nThe drummer immediately began drinking upon his arrival in Flint. The Who spent the afternoon visiting local radio stations with Nancy Lewis (then the band's publicist), and Moon posed for a photo outside the hotel in front of a \"Happy Birthday Keith\" sign put up by the hotel management. According to Lewis, Moon was drunk by the time the band went onstage at Atwood Stadium.\nReturning to the hotel, Moon started a food fight and soon cake began flying through the air. The drummer knocked out part of his front tooth; at the hospital, doctors could not give him an anaesthetic (due to his inebriation) before removing the remainder of the tooth. Back at the hotel, a melee erupted; fire extinguishers were set off, guests (and objects) thrown into the swimming pool and a piano reportedly destroyed. The chaos ended only when police arrived with guns drawn.\nA furious Holiday Inn management presented the groups with a bill for $24,000 (equivalent to about $ in 2024), which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life from all of the hotel's properties, but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in Rochester, New York, a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel's swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 \"Rolling Stone\" interview. However, Roger Daltrey, in an interview on BBC's \"Top Gear\", stated that the group was banned from \"an entire state's worth of Holiday Inns\", presumably then Michigan. He also claimed that, while he had not personally seen a car in a swimming pool, he had seen a bill for damages and removal.\nPassing out on stage.\nMoon's lifestyle began to undermine his health and reliability. During the 1973 Quadrophenia tour, at the Who's debut US date at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, Moon ingested a mixture of sedatives and brandy. During the concert, Moon passed out on his drum kit during \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". The band stopped playing, and a group of roadies carried Moon offstage. They gave him a shower and an injection of cortisone, sending him back onstage after a thirty-minute delay. Moon passed out again during \"Magic Bus\", and was again removed from the stage. The band continued without him for several songs before Townshend asked, \"Can anyone play the drums? \u2013 I mean somebody good?\" A drummer in the audience, Scot Halpin, came up and played the rest of the show.\nDuring the opening date of the band's March 1976 US tour at the Boston Garden, Moon passed out over his drum kit after two numbers and the show was rescheduled. The next evening, Moon systematically destroyed everything in his hotel room, cut himself doing so, and passed out. He was discovered by manager Bill Curbishley, who took him to a hospital, telling him \"I'm gonna get the doctor to get you nice and fit, so you're back within two days. Because I want to break your fucking jaw\u00a0... You have fucked this band around so many times and I'm not having it any more.\" Doctors told Curbishley that if he had not intervened, Moon would have bled to death. Marsh suggested that at this point Daltrey and Entwistle seriously considered firing Moon, but decided that doing so would make his life worse.\nEntwistle has said that Moon and the Who reached their live peak in 1975\u201376. At the end of the 1976 US tour in Miami that August, Moon became delirious and was treated in Hollywood Memorial Hospital for eight days. The group was concerned that he would be unable to complete the last leg of the tour, which ended at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on 21 October (Moon's last public show). During the band's recording sabbatical between 1976 and 1978, Moon gained a considerable amount of weight. By the time of the Who's invitation-only show at the Gaumont State Cinema on 15 December 1977 for \"The Kids are Alright\", Moon was visibly overweight and had difficulty sustaining a solid performance. After recording \"Who Are You\", Townshend refused to follow the album with a tour unless Moon stopped drinking and said that if Moon's playing did not improve he would be fired. Daltrey later denied threatening to fire him, but said that by this time Moon was out of control.\nFinancial problems.\nBecause the Who's early stage act relied on smashing instruments and owing to Moon's enthusiasm for damaging hotels, the group were in debt for much of the 1960s; Entwistle estimated they lost about \u00a3150,000. Even when the group became relatively financially stable after \"Tommy\", Moon continued to rack up debts. He bought a number of cars and gadgets and flirted with bankruptcy. Moon's recklessness with money reduced his profit from the group's 1975 UK tour to \u00a347.35 ().\nPersonal life and relationships.\nBirthdate.\nBefore the 1998 release of Tony Fletcher's \"Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon\", Moon's date of birth was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This erroneous date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography \"Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who\". The incorrect date had been supplied by Moon in interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.\nKim Kerrigan.\nMoon's first serious relationship was with 16-year-old Kim Kerrigan, whom he started dating in January 1965 after she saw the Who play at Le Disque a Go! Go! in Bournemouth. By the end of the year she discovered she was pregnant. Her parents, who were furious, met with the Moons to discuss their options, and she moved into the Moon family home in Wembley. She and Moon were married on 17 March 1966 at Brent Register Office, and their daughter Amanda was born on 12 July. The marriage (and child) were kept secret from the press until May 1968. Moon was occasionally violent towards Kim: \"if we went out after I had Mandy\", she later said, \"if someone talked to me, he'd lose it. We'd go home and he'd start a fight with me.\" He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. \"He had no idea how to be a father\", Kim said. \"He was too much of a child himself.\"\nFrom 1971 to 1975 Moon owned Tara, a home in Chertsey where he initially lived with his wife and daughter. The Moons entertained extravagantly at home, and owned a number of cars. Jack McCullogh, then working for Track Records (the Who's label), recalls Moon ordering him to purchase a milk float to store in the garage at Tara.\nIn 1973 Kim, convinced that neither she nor anyone else could moderate Keith's behaviour, left her husband and took Amanda; she sued for divorce in 1975 and later married Faces keyboard player Ian McLagan. Marsh believes that Moon never truly recovered from the loss of his family. Butler agrees; despite his relationship with Annette Walter-Lax, he believes that Kim was the only woman Moon loved. McLagan commented that Moon \"couldn't handle it\". Moon would harass them with phone calls, and on one occasion before Kim sued for divorce, he invited McLagan for a drink at a Richmond pub and sent several \"heavies\" to break into McLagan's home on Fife Road and look for Kim, forcing her to hide in a walk-in closet. She died in a car accident in Austin, Texas, on 2 August 2006.\nAnnette Walter-Lax.\nIn 1975 Moon began a relationship with Swedish model Annette Walter-Lax, who later said that Moon was \"so sweet when he was sober, that I was just living with him in the hope that he would kick all this craziness.\" She begged Malibu neighbour Larry Hagman to check Moon into a clinic to dry out (as he had attempted to do before), but when doctors recorded Moon's chemical intake at breakfast (a bottle of champagne, Courvoisier and amphetamines), they concluded that there was no hope for his rehabilitation.\nFriends.\nMoon enjoyed being the life of the party. Bill Curbishley remembered that \"he wouldn't walk into any room and just listen. He was an attention seeker and he had to have it.\"\nEarly in the Who's career, Moon got to know the Beatles. He would join them at clubs, forming a particularly close friendship with Ringo Starr. Moon later became friends with Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band members Vivian Stanshall and \"Legs\" Larry Smith, and the trio would drink and play practical jokes together. Smith remembers one occasion where he and Moon tore apart a pair of trousers, with an accomplice later looking for one-legged trousers. In the early 1970s, Moon helped Stanshall with his \"Radio Flashes\" radio show for BBC Radio 1, filling in for the vacationing John Peel. Moon filled in for Peel in 1973's \"A Touch of the Moon\", a series of four programmes produced by John Walters.\nGuitarist Joe Walsh enjoyed socialising with Moon. In an interview with \"Guitar World\" magazine, he recalled that the drummer \"taught me how to break things\". In 1974, Moon struck up a friendship with actor Oliver Reed while working on the film version of \"Tommy\". Although Reed matched Moon drink for drink, he appeared on set the next morning ready to perform; Moon, on the other hand, would cost several hours of filming time. Reed later said that Moon \"showed me the way to insanity\".\nDougal Butler.\nPeter \"Dougal\" Butler began working for the Who in 1967, becoming Moon's personal assistant the following year to help him stay out of trouble. He remembers managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp saying, \"We trust you with Keith but if you ever want any time off, for a holiday or some sort of rest, let us know and we'll pay for it.\" Butler never took them up on the offer.\nHe followed Moon when the drummer relocated to Los Angeles, but felt that the drug culture prevalent at the time was bad for Moon: \"My job was to have eyes in the back of my head.\" Townshend agreed, saying that by 1975 Butler had \"no influence over him whatsoever.\" Although he was a loyal companion to Moon, the lifestyle eventually became too much for him; he phoned Curbishley, saying that they needed to move back to England or one of them might die. Butler quit in 1978, and later wrote of his experiences in a book entitled \"Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of Keith Moon\".\nNeil Boland.\nOn 4 January 1970, Moon accidentally killed his friend, driver and bodyguard, Neil Boland, outside the Red Lion pub in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Pub patrons had begun to attack his Bentley; Moon, drunk, began driving to escape them and hit Boland. After an investigation, the coroner ruled Boland's death an accident; Moon, having been charged with a number of offences, received an absolute discharge.\nThose close to Moon said that he was haunted by Boland's death for the rest of his life. According to Pamela Des Barres, Moon had nightmares (which woke them both) about the incident and said he had no right to be alive.\nDeath.\nIn mid-1978, Moon moved into Flat 12, 9 Curzon Place (later Curzon Square), Mayfair, London, renting from Harry Nilsson. Singer Cass Elliot of the Mamas &amp; the Papas had died there four years earlier, at the age of 32; Nilsson was concerned about letting the flat to Moon, believing it was cursed. Townshend disagreed, assuring him that \"lightning wouldn't strike the same place twice\".\nAfter moving in, Moon began a prescribed course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He wanted to get sober, but because of his fear of psychiatric hospitals, he wanted to do it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.\nBy September 1978, Moon was having difficulty playing the drums, according to roadie Dave \"Cy\" Langston. After seeing Moon in the studio trying to overdub drums for \"The Kids Are Alright\", he said, \"After two or three hours, he got more and more sluggish, he could barely hold a drum stick.\"\nOn 6 September, Moon and Walter-Lax were guests of Paul and Linda McCartney at a preview of a film, \"The Buddy Holly Story\". After dining with the McCartneys at Peppermint Park in Covent Garden, Moon and Walter-Lax returned to their flat. He watched a film (\"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\"), and asked Walter-Lax to cook him lamb cutlets (which Walter-Lax had stated was his favourite meal). When she objected, Moon replied, \"If you don't like it, you can fuck off!\" These were his last words. Moon then took some clomethiazole tablets. When Walter-Lax checked on him the following afternoon, she discovered he was dead.\nCurbishley phoned the flat at around 5:00p.m. looking for Moon, and Dymond gave him the news. Curbishley told Townshend, who informed the rest of the band. Entwistle was giving an interview to two journalists when he was interrupted by a phone call with the news of Moon's death. When asked about the band's future plans, Entwistle burst into tears and quickly ended the interview.\nMoon's death came shortly after the release of their eighth studio album \"Who Are You\". On the album cover, he is straddling a chair to hide his weight gain; the words \"Not to be taken away\" are on the back of the chair. Police determined that there were 32 clomethiazole pills in Moon's system. Six were digested; the other 26 were undigested when he died. Max Glatt, an authority on alcoholism, wrote in \"The Sunday Times\" that Moon should never have been given the drug. Moon was cremated on 13 September 1978 at Golders Green Crematorium in London, and his ashes were scattered in its Gardens of Remembrance.\nTownshend persuaded Daltrey and Entwistle to carry on touring as the Who, although he later said that it was his means of coping with Moon's death and \"completely irrational, bordering on insane\". AllMusic's Bruce Eder said, \"When Keith Moon died, the Who carried on and were far more competent and reliable musically, but that wasn't what sold rock records.\" In November 1978, Faces drummer Kenney Jones joined the Who. Townshend later said that Jones \"was one of the few British drummers who could fill Keith's shoes\"; Daltrey was less enthusiastic, saying that Jones \"wasn't the right style\". Keyboardist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick, who had rehearsed with Moon earlier in the year, joined the live band as an unofficial member.\nJones left the Who in 1988, and drummer Simon Phillips (who praised Moon's ability to drum over the backing track of \"Baba O'Riley\") toured with the band the following year. From 1996 to 2025, the Who's drummer was Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey who, as a child, had been given a drum kit by Moon (whom he called \"Uncle Keith\"). Starkey had previously toured in 1994 with Roger Daltrey, and contributed to solo studio albums by Daltrey, and John Entwistle.\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games contacted Curbishley about Moon performing at the 2012 Summer Olympics, evidently unaware he had been dead for 34 years. In an interview with \"The Times\" Curbishley quipped, \"I emailed back saying Keith now resides in Golders Green Crematorium, having lived up to the Who's anthemic line 'I hope I die before I get old'\u00a0... If they have a round table, some glasses and candles, we might contact him.\"\nLegacy.\nMoon's drumming has been praised by critics. Author Nick Talevski described him as \"the greatest drummer in rock\", adding that \"he was to the drums what Jimi Hendrix was to the guitar.\" Holly George-Warren, editor and author of \"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: The First 25 Years\", said: \"With the death of Keith Moon in 1978, rock arguably lost its single greatest drummer.\" According to AllMusic critic Bruce Eder, \"Moon, with his manic, lunatic side, and his life of excessive drinking, partying, and other indulgences, probably represented the youthful, zany side of rock &amp; roll, as well as its self-destructive side, better than anyone else on the planet.\" \n\"The New Book of Rock Lists\" ranked Moon No.\u00a01 on its list of \"50 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Drummers\", and he was ranked No.\u00a02 on the 2011 \"Rolling Stone\" \"Best Drummers of All Time\" readers' poll. In 2016, the same magazine ranked him No. 2 in their list of the 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time, behind John Bonham. Adam Budofsky, editor of \"Drummer\" magazine, said that Moon's performances on \"Who's Next\" and \"Quadrophenia\" \"represent a perfect balance of technique and passion\" and \"there's been no drummer who's touched his unique slant on rock and rhythm since.\"\nSeveral rock drummers, including Neil Peart, have cited Moon as an influence. The Jam paid homage to Moon on the second single from their third album, \"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\"; the B-side of the single is a Who cover (\"So Sad About Us\"), and the back cover of the record has a photo of Moon's face. The Jam's single was released about a month after Moon's death. Animal, one of Jim Henson's Muppet characters, may have been based on Keith Moon due to their similar hair, eyebrows, personality and drumming style. Jazz drummer Elvin Jones praised Moon's work during \"Underture\", as integral to the song's effect.\nRay Davies lauded Moon's drumming during his speech for the Kinks' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1990: \"... Keith Moon changed the sound of drumming.\"\n\"God bless his beautiful heart\u00a0...\" Ozzy Osbourne told \"Sounds\" a month after the drummer's death. \"People will be talking about Keith Moon 'til they die, man.\"\nClem Burke of Blondie said: \"Early on all I cared about was Keith Moon and the Who. When I was about eleven or twelve, my favourite part of drum lessons was the last ten minutes, when I'd get to sit at the drumset and play along to my favourite record. I'd bring in 'My Generation'. At the end of the song, the drums go nuts. 'My Generation' was a turning point for me because before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing.\"\nIn 1998 Tony Fletcher published a biography of Moon, \"Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon\", in the United Kingdom. The phrase \"Dear Boy\" became a catchphrase of Moon's when, influenced by Kit Lambert, he began affecting a pompous English accent. In 2000, the book was released in the US as \"Moon (The Life and Death of a Rock Legend)\". \"Q Magazine\" called the book \"horrific and terrific reading\", and \"Record Collector\" said it was \"one of rock's great biographies.\"\nIn 2008, English Heritage declined an application for Moon to be awarded a blue plaque. Speaking to \"The Guardian\", Christopher Frayling said they \"decided that bad behaviour and overdosing on various substances wasn't a sufficient qualification.\" The UK's Heritage Foundation disagreed with the decision, presenting a plaque which was unveiled on 9 March 2009. Daltrey, Townshend, Robin Gibb and Moon's mother Kit were present at the ceremony.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is widely used as a fuel in aviation as well as households. Its name derives from the Greek (\"k\u0113r\u00f3s\") meaning \"wax\"; it was registered as a trademark by Nova Scotia geologist and inventor Abraham Gesner in 1854 before evolving into a generic trademark. It is sometimes spelled kerosine in scientific and industrial usage.\nKerosene is widely used to power jet engines of aircraft (jet fuel), as well as some rocket engines in a highly refined form called RP-1. It is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel, and for fire toys such as poi. In parts of Asia, kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small outboard motors or even motorcycles. World total kerosene consumption for all purposes is equivalent to about 5,500,000 barrels per day as of July 2023.\nThe term \"kerosene\" is common in much of Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, and the United States, while the term paraffin (or a closely related variant) is used in Chile, East Africa, South Africa, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The term \"lamp oil\", or the equivalent in the local languages, is common in the majority of Asia and the Southeastern United States, although in Appalachia, it is also commonly referred to as \"coal oil\".\nThe name \"paraffin\" is also used to refer to a number of distinct petroleum byproducts other than kerosene. For instance, liquid paraffin (called mineral oil in the US) is a more viscous and highly refined product which is used as a laxative. Paraffin wax is a waxy solid extracted from petroleum.\nTo prevent confusion between kerosene and the much more flammable and volatile gasoline (petrol), some jurisdictions regulate markings or colourings for containers used to store or dispense kerosene. For example, in the United States, Pennsylvania requires that portable containers used at retail service stations for kerosene be colored blue, as opposed to red (for gasoline) or yellow (for diesel).\nThe World Health Organization considers kerosene to be a polluting fuel and recommends that \"governments and practitioners immediately stop promoting its household use\". Kerosene smoke contains high levels of harmful particulate matter, and household use of kerosene is associated with higher risks of cancer, respiratory infections, asthma, tuberculosis, cataracts, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nProperties and grades.\nKerosene is a low-viscosity, clear liquid formed from hydrocarbons obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum between , resulting in a mixture with a density of 0.78\u20130.81 g/cm3. It is miscible with , but not with water. It is composed of hydrocarbon molecules that typically contain between 6 and 20 carbon atoms per molecule, predominantly containing 9 to 16 carbon atoms.\nRegardless of crude oil source or processing history, kerosene's major components are branched- and straight-chain alkanes (hydrocarbon chains) and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% of volume. Aromatic hydrocarbons such as alkylbenzenes (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring), do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.\nThe heat of combustion of kerosene is similar to that of diesel fuel; its lower heating value is 43.1 MJ/kg (around 18,500 Btu/lb), and its higher heating value is .\nASTM International recognizes two grades of kerosene: 1-K (less than 0.04% sulfur by weight) and 2-K (0.3% sulfur by weight). Grade 1-K kerosene burns cleaner with fewer deposits, fewer toxins, and less frequent maintenance than 2-K, and is the preferred grade for indoor heaters and stoves.\nIn the United Kingdom, two grades of heating oil are defined. BS 2869 Class C1 is the lightest grade used for lanterns, camping stoves, and wick heaters, and mixed with petrol in some vintage combustion engines as a substitute for tractor vaporizing oil. BS 2869 Class C2 is a heavier distillate, which is used as domestic heating oil. Premium kerosene is usually sold in 5- or 20-litre containers from hardware, camping and garden stores, and is often dyed purple. Standard kerosene is usually dispensed in bulk by a tanker and is undyed.\nNational and international standards define the properties of several grades of kerosene used for jet fuel. Flash point and freezing point properties are of particular concern for operation and safety; the standards also define additives for control of static electricity and other purposes.\nMelting, freeze and flash points.\nKerosene is liquid around room temperature: . The flash point of kerosene is between and , and its autoignition temperature is . The freezing point of kerosene depends on grade, with commercial aviation fuel standardized at .\nGrade 1-K kerosene freezes around \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F, 233 K).\nHistory.\nThe process of distilling crude oil/petroleum into kerosene, as well as other hydrocarbon compounds, was first written about in the ninth century by the Persian scholar R\u0101zi (or Rhazes). In his \"Kitab al-Asrar\" (\"Book of Secrets\"), the physician and chemist Razi described two methods for the production of kerosene, termed \"naft abyad\" (\u0646\u0641\u0637 \u0627\u0628\u064a\u0636 \"white naphtha\"), using an apparatus called an alembic. One method used clay as an absorbent, and later the other method using chemicals like ammonium chloride (\"sal ammoniac\"). The distillation process was repeated until most of the volatile hydrocarbon fractions had been removed and the final product was perfectly clear and safe to burn. Kerosene was also produced during the same period from oil shale and bitumen by heating the rock to extract the oil, which was then distilled. During the Chinese Ming Dynasty, the Chinese made use of kerosene through extracting and purifying petroleum and then converted it into lamp fuel. The Chinese made use of petroleum for lighting lamps and heating homes as early as 1500 BC.\nIlluminating oil from coal and oil shale.\nAlthough \"coal oil\" was well known by industrial chemists at least as early as the 1700s as a byproduct of making coal gas and coal tar, it burned with a smoky flame that prevented its use for indoor illumination. In cities, much indoor illumination was provided by piped-in coal gas, but outside the cities, and for spot lighting within the cities, the lucrative market for fueling indoor lamps was supplied by whale oil, specifically that from sperm whales, which burned brighter and cleaner.\nCanadian geologist Abraham Pineo Gesner claimed that in 1846, he had given a public demonstration in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island of a new process he had discovered. He heated coal in a retort, and distilled from it a clear, thin fluid that he showed made an excellent lamp fuel. He coined the name \"kerosene\" for his fuel, a contraction of \"keroselaion\", meaning \"wax-oil\". The cost of extracting kerosene from coal was high.\nGesner recalled from his extensive knowledge of New Brunswick's geology a naturally occurring asphaltum called albertite. He was blocked from using it by the New Brunswick coal conglomerate because they had coal extraction rights for the province, and he lost a court case when their experts claimed albertite was a form of coal. In 1854, Gesner moved to Newtown Creek, Long Island, New York. There, he secured backing from a group of businessmen. They formed the North American Gas Light Company, to which he assigned his patents.\nDespite clear priority of discovery, Gesner did not obtain his first kerosene patent until 1854, two years after James Young's United States patent. Gesner's method of purifying the distillation products appears to have been superior to Young's, resulting in a cleaner and better-smelling fuel. Manufacture of kerosene under the Gesner patents began in New York in 1854 and later in Boston\u2014being distilled from bituminous coal and oil shale. Gesner registered the word \"Kerosene\" as a trademark in 1854, and for several years, only the North American Gas Light Company and the Downer Company (to which Gesner had granted the right) were allowed to call their lamp oil \"Kerosene\" in the United States.\nIn 1848, Scottish chemist James Young experimented with oil discovered seeping in a coal mine as a source of lubricating oil and illuminating fuel. When the seep became exhausted, he experimented with the dry distillation of coal, especially the resinous \"boghead coal\" (torbanite). He extracted a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named \"paraffine oil\" because at low temperatures, it congealed into a substance that resembled paraffin wax. Young took out a patent on his process and the resulting products in 1850, and built the first truly commercial oil-works in the world at Bathgate in 1851, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, shale, and bituminous coal. In 1852, he took out a United States patent for the same invention. These patents were subsequently upheld in both countries in a series of lawsuits, and other producers were obliged to pay him royalties.\nKerosene from petroleum.\nIn 1851, Samuel Martin Kier began selling lamp oil to local miners, under the name \"Carbon Oil\". He distilled this from crude oil by a process of his own invention. He also invented a new lamp to burn his product. He has been dubbed the \"Grandfather of the American Oil Industry\" by historians. Kier's salt wells began to be fouled with petroleum in the 1840s. At first, Kier simply dumped the oil into the nearby Pennsylvania Main Line Canal as useless waste, but later he began experimenting with several distillates of the crude oil, along with a chemist from eastern Pennsylvania.\nIgnacy \u0141ukasiewicz, a Polish pharmacist residing in Lviv, and his partner Jan Zeh had been experimenting with different distillation techniques, trying to improve on Gesner's kerosene process, but using oil from a local petroleum seep. Many people knew of his work, but paid little attention to it. On the night of 31 July 1853, doctors at the local hospital needed to perform an emergency operation, virtually impossible by candlelight. They therefore sent a messenger for \u0141ukasiewicz and his new lamps. The lamp burned so brightly and cleanly that the hospital officials ordered several lamps plus a large supply of fuel. \u0141ukasiewicz realized the potential of his work and quit the pharmacy to find a business partner, and then traveled to Vienna to register his technique with the government. \u0141ukasiewicz moved to the Gorlice region of Poland in 1854, and sank several wells across southern Poland over the following decade, setting up a refinery near Jas\u0142o in 1859.\nThe petroleum discovery by Edwin Drake \u2013 Drake Well \u2013 in western Pennsylvania in 1859 caused a great deal of public excitement and investment drilling in new wells, not only in Pennsylvania, but also in Canada, where petroleum had been discovered at Oil Springs, Ontario in 1858, and southern Poland, where Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz had been distilling lamp oil from petroleum seeps since 1852. The increased supply of petroleum allowed oil refiners to entirely side-step the oil-from-coal patents of both Young and Gesner, and produce illuminating oil from petroleum without paying royalties to anyone. As a result, the illuminating oil industry in the United States completely switched over to petroleum in the 1860s. The petroleum-based illuminating oil was widely sold as Kerosene, and the trade name soon lost its proprietary status, and became the lower-case generic product \"kerosene\". Because Gesner's original Kerosene had been also known as \"coal oil\", generic kerosene from petroleum was commonly called \"coal oil\" in some parts of the United States well into the 20th century.\nIn the United Kingdom, manufacturing oil from coal (or oil shale) continued into the early 20th century, although increasingly overshadowed by petroleum oils.\nAs kerosene production increased, whaling declined. The American whaling fleet, which had been steadily growing for 50 years, reached its all-time peak of 199 ships in 1858. By 1860, just two years later, the fleet had dropped to 167 ships. The Civil War cut into American whaling temporarily, but only 105 whaling ships returned to sea in 1866, the first full year of peace, and that number dwindled until only 39 American ships set out to hunt whales in 1876. Kerosene, made first from coal and oil shale, then from petroleum, had largely taken over whaling's lucrative market in lamp oil.\nElectric lighting started displacing kerosene as an illuminant in the late 19th century, especially in urban areas. However, kerosene remained the predominant commercial end-use for petroleum refined in the United States until 1909, when it was exceeded by motor fuels. The rise of the gasoline-powered automobile in the early 20th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, and refiners invented methods to increase their output of gasoline, while decreasing their output of kerosene. In addition, some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel. Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters.\nKerosene from carbon dioxide and water.\nA pilot project by ETH Zurich used solar power to produce kerosene from carbon dioxide and water in July 2022. The product can be used in existing aviation applications, and \"can also be blended with fossil-derived kerosene\".\nProduction.\nKerosene is produced by fractional distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery. It condenses at a temperature intermediate between diesel fuel, which is less volatile, and naphtha and gasoline, which are more volatile.\nKerosene made up 8.5 percent by volume of petroleum refinery output in 2021 in the United States, of which nearly all was kerosene-type jet fuel (8.4 percent).\nApplications.\nAs fuel.\nHeating and lighting.\nThe fuel, also known as heating oil in the UK and Ireland, remains widely used in kerosene lamps and lanterns in the developing world. Although it replaced whale oil, the 1873 edition of \"Elements of Chemistry\" said, \"The vapor of this substance [kerosene] mixed with air is as explosive as gunpowder.\" This statement may have been due to the common practice of adulterating kerosene with cheaper but more volatile hydrocarbon mixtures, such as naphtha.\nKerosene was a significant fire risk; in 1880, nearly two of every five New York City fires were caused by defective kerosene lamps.\nIn less-developed countries kerosene is an important source of energy for cooking and lighting. It is used as a cooking fuel in portable stoves for backpackers. As a heating fuel, it is often used in portable stoves, and is sold in some filling stations. It is sometimes used as a heat source during power failures.\nKerosene is widely used in Japan and Chile as a home heating fuel for portable and installed kerosene heaters. In Chile and Japan, kerosene can be readily bought at any filling station or be delivered to homes in some cases.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, kerosene is often used as a heating fuel in areas not connected to a gas pipeline network. It is used less for cooking, with LPG being preferred because it is easier to light. Kerosene is often the fuel of choice for range cookers such as Rayburn. Additives such as RangeKlene can be put into kerosene to ensure that it burns cleaner and produces less soot when used in range cookers.\nThe Amish, who generally abstain from the use of electricity, rely on kerosene for lighting at night.\nMore ubiquitous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, kerosene space heaters were often built into kitchen ranges, and kept many farm and fishing families warm and dry through the winter. At one time, citrus growers used a smudge pot fueled by kerosene to create a pall of thick smoke over a grove in an effort to prevent freezing temperatures from damaging crops. \"Salamanders\" are kerosene space heaters used on construction sites to dry out building materials and to warm workers. Before the days of electrically lighted road barriers, highway construction zones were marked at night by kerosene fired, pot-bellied torches. Most of these uses of kerosene created thick black smoke because of the low temperature of combustion.\nA notable exception, discovered in the early 19th century, is the use of a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick, the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly thorium dioxide), heated to incandescence by the flame from the wick. The thorium and cerium oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would. These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does. Recently, a multipurpose lantern that doubles as a cook stove has been introduced in India in areas with no electricity.\nCooking.\nIn countries such as Nigeria, kerosene is the main fuel used for cooking, especially by the poor, and kerosene stoves have replaced traditional wood-based cooking appliances. As such, increases in the price of kerosene can have a major political and environmental consequence. The Indian government subsidizes the fuel to keep the price very low, to around 15 U.S. cents per liter as of February 2007, as keeping the price low discourages dismantling of forests for cooking fuel. In Nigeria, an attempt by the government to remove a fuel subsidy that includes kerosene met with strong opposition.\nKerosene is used as a fuel in portable stoves, especially in Primus stoves invented in 1892. Portable kerosene stoves are reliable and durable in everyday use, and perform especially well under adverse conditions. In outdoor activities and mountaineering, a decisive advantage of pressurized kerosene stoves over gas cartridge stoves is their particularly high thermal output and their ability to operate at very low ambient temperatures in winter or at high altitude. Wick stoves like Perfection's or wickless like Boss continue to be used by the Amish and off grid living, and in natural disasters where there is no power available.\nEngines.\nIn the early to mid-20th century, kerosene or tractor vaporizing oil was used as a cheap fuel for tractors and hit-and-miss engines. A petrol-paraffin engine would start on gasoline, then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up. On some engines, a heat valve on the manifold would route the exhaust gasses around the intake pipe, heating the kerosene to the point where it was vaporized and could be ignited by an electric spark.\nIn Europe following the Second World War, automobiles were similarly modified to run on kerosene rather than gasoline, which they would have to import and pay heavy taxes on. Besides additional piping and the switch between fuels, the head gasket was replaced by a much thicker one to diminish the compression ratio (making the engine less powerful and less efficient, but able to run on kerosene). The necessary equipment was sold under the trademark \"Econom\".\nDuring the fuel crisis of the 1970s, Saab-Valmet developed and series-produced the Saab 99 Petro that ran on kerosene, turpentine or gasoline. The project, codenamed \"Project Lapponia\", was headed by Simo Vuorio, and towards the end of the 1970s, a working prototype was produced based on the Saab 99 GL. The car was designed to run on two fuels. Gasoline was used for cold starts and when extra power was needed, but normally it ran on kerosene or turpentine. The idea was that the gasoline could be made from peat using the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process. Between 1980 and 1984, 3,756 Saab 99 Petros and 2,385 Talbot Horizons (a version of the Chrysler Horizon that integrated many Saab components) were made. One reason to manufacture kerosene-fueled cars was that, in Finland, kerosene was less heavily taxed than gasoline.\nKerosene is used to fuel smaller-horsepower outboard motors built by Yamaha, Suzuki, and Tohatsu. Primarily used on small fishing craft, these are dual-fuel engines that start on gasoline and then transition to kerosene once the engine reaches optimum operating temperature. Multiple fuel Evinrude and Mercury Racing engines also burn kerosene, as well as jet fuel.\nToday, kerosene is mainly used in fuel for jet engines in several grades. One highly refined form of the fuel is known as RP-1, and is often burned with liquid oxygen as rocket fuel. These fuel grade kerosenes meet specifications for smoke points and freeze points. The combustion reaction can be approximated as follows, with the molecular formula C12H26 (dodecane):\n 2 C12H26(\"l\") + 37 O2(\"g\")\u00a0\u2192 24 CO2(\"g\")\u00a0+ 26 H2O(\"g\"); \u2206\"H\"\u02da\u00a0= -7513 kJ\nIn the initial phase of liftoff, the Saturn V launch vehicle was powered by the reaction of liquid oxygen with RP-1. For the five 6.4 meganewton sea-level thrust F-1 rocket engines of the Saturn V, burning together, the reaction generated roughly 1.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01011 watts (J/s) (162 gigawatt) or 217 million horsepower.\nKerosene is sometimes used as an additive in diesel fuel to prevent gelling or waxing in cold temperatures.\nUltra-low sulfur kerosene is a custom-blended fuel used by the New York City Transit Authority to power its bus fleet. The transit agency started using this fuel in 2004, prior to the widespread adoption of ultra-low-sulfur diesel, which has since become the standard. In 2008, the suppliers of the custom fuel failed to tender for a renewal of the transit agency's contract, leading to a negotiated contract at a significantly increased cost.\nJP-8 (for \"Jet Propellant 8\"), a kerosene-based fuel, is used by the United States military as a replacement in diesel fueled vehicles and for powering aircraft. JP-8 is also used by the U.S. military and its NATO allies as a fuel for heaters, stoves, tanks, and as a replacement for diesel fuel in the engines of nearly all tactical ground vehicles and electrical generators.\nChemical processes.\nAliphatic kerosene is a type of kerosene which has a low aromatic hydrocarbon content. The aromatic content of crude oil varies greatly from oil field to oil field, however by solvent extraction, it is possible to separate aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic (alkane) hydrocarbons. A common method is solvent extraction with methanol, DMSO or sulfolane. Aromatic kerosene is a grade of kerosene with a large concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons, an example of this would be Exxon's Solvesso 150.\nKerosene is commonly used in metal extraction as the diluent. For example, in copper extraction by LIX-84, it can be used in mixer settlers.\nKerosene is used as a diluent in the PUREX extraction process, but it is increasingly being supplanted by dodecane and other artificial hydrocarbons such as TPH (hydrogenated propylene trimer). Traditionally the UK plants at Sellafield used aromatic kerosene to reduce the radiolysis of TBP while the French nuclear industry tended to use diluents with very little aromatic content. The French nuclear reprocessing plants typically use TPH as their diluent. In recent times, it has been shown by Mark Foreman at Chalmers that aliphatic kerosene can be replaced in solvent extraction with HVO100, which is a second generation biodiesel made by Neste.\nIn X-ray crystallography, kerosene can be used to store crystals. When a hydrated crystal is left in air, dehydration may occur slowly. This makes the color of the crystal become dull. Kerosene can keep air away from the crystal.\nIt can be also used to prevent air from re-dissolving in a boiled liquid, and to store alkali metals such as potassium, sodium, and rubidium (with the exception of lithium, which is less dense than kerosene, causing it to float).\nIn entertainment.\nKerosene is often used in the entertainment industry for fire performances, such as fire breathing, fire juggling or poi, and fire dancing. Because of its low flame temperature when burnt in free air, the risk is lower should the performer come in contact with the flame. Kerosene is generally not recommended as fuel for indoor fire dancing, as it produces an unpleasant (to some) odor, which becomes poisonous in sufficient concentration. Ethanol was sometimes used instead, but the flames it produces look less impressive, and its lower flash point poses a high risk.\nIn industry.\nAs a petroleum product miscible with many industrial liquids, kerosene can be used as both a solvent, able to remove other petroleum products, such as chain grease, and as a lubricant, with less risk of combustion when compared to using gasoline. It can also be used as a cooling agent in metal production and treatment (oxygen-free conditions).\nIn the petroleum industry, kerosene is often used as a synthetic hydrocarbon for corrosion experiments to simulate crude oil in field conditions.\nSolvent.\nKerosene can be used as an adhesive remover on hard-to-remove mucilage or adhesive left by stickers on a glass surface (such as in show windows of stores).\nIt can be used to remove candle wax that has dripped onto a glass surface; it is recommended that the excess wax be scraped off prior to applying kerosene via a soaked cloth or tissue paper.\nIt can be used to clean bicycle and motorcycle chains of old lubricant before relubrication.\nIt can also be used to thin oil-based paint used in fine art. Some artists even use it to clean their brushes; however, it leaves the bristles greasy to the touch.\nOthers.\nIt has seen use for water tank mosquito control in Australia, where a temporary thin floating layer above the water protects it until the defective tank is repaired.\nToxicity.\nThe World Health Organization considers kerosene to be a polluting fuel and recommends that \"governments and practitioners immediately stop promoting its household use\". Kerosene smoke contains high levels of harmful particulate matter, and household use of kerosene is associated with higher risks of cancer, respiratory infections, asthma, tuberculosis, cataract, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nIngestion of kerosene is harmful. Kerosene is sometimes recommended as a folk remedy for killing head lice, but health agencies warn against this as it can cause burns and serious illness. A kerosene shampoo can even be fatal if fumes are inhaled.\nPeople can be exposed to kerosene in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of 100\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16994", "revid": "5846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16994", "title": "Kwashiorkor", "text": "Severe protein malnutrition\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nKwashiorkor ( , is a form of severe protein malnutrition characterized by edema and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates. It is thought to be caused by sufficient calorie intake, but with insufficient protein consumption (or lack of good quality protein). It is different from marasmus, which is malnutrition of all sources of energy including protein. Recent studies have found that a lack of antioxidant micronutrients such as \u03b2-carotene, lycopene, other carotenoids, and vitamin C as well as the presence of aflatoxins may play a role in the development of the disease. However, the exact cause of kwashiorkor is still unknown. Inadequate food supply is correlated with kwashiorkor; occurrences in high-income countries are rare. It occurs amongst weaning children to ages of about five years old.\nConditions analogous to kwashiorkor were well documented around the world throughout history.\nThe disease's first formal description was published by Jamaican pediatrician Cicely Williams in 1933. She was the first to research kwashiorkor, and to suggest that it might be a protein deficiency to differentiate it from other dietary deficiencies.\nThe name, introduced by Williams in 1935, was derived from the Ga language of coastal Ghana, translated as \"the sickness the baby gets when the new baby comes\" or \"the disease of the deposed child\", and reflecting the development of the condition in an older child who has been weaned from the breast when a younger sibling comes.\nBreast milk contains amino acids vital to a child's growth. In at-risk populations, kwashiorkor is most likely to develop after children are weaned from breast milk and begin consuming a diet high in carbohydrates, including maize, cassava, or rice.\nClassification.\nKwashiorkor is a type of severe acute malnutrition (SAM). SAM is a category, composed of two conditions: marasmus and kwashiorkor. Both kwashiorkor and marasmus fall under the umbrella of protein\u2013energy malnutrition (PEM). These diseases are oftentimes discussed together, but are distinctly separate conditions of malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is marked by an array of metabolic disturbances of uncertain cause. In contrast, marasmus is more clearly an energy deficiency syndrome, marked by weight loss. On physical exam, kwashiorkor is also distinguished from marasmus by the presence of edema. When children present with both kwashiorkor and marasmus, the condition is referred to as \"marasmic-kwashiorkor\". In general, kwashiorkor is marked by more profound serum depletions of antioxidant molecules and minerals, relative to marasmus.\nWellcome's classification.\nWellcome classification is a system for classifying protein-energy malnutrition in children based on weight for their age and based on presence of edema. Other classifications include Gomez classification and Waterlow classification.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe defining sign of kwashiorkor in children is bilateral edema in the feet. Edema may also involve the hands, trunk, and face. Kwashiorkor is characterized by a fatty liver. This fatty liver of the undernutrition phenotype is often accompanied by evidence of inflammation and fibrosis. Whereas a fatty liver of undernutrition is a consistent feature of kwashiorkor, it is only encountered sometimes in children with marasmus. In addition to this characteristic hepatic steatosis, kwashiorkor is marked by a parallel pattern of multi-organ dysfunction. Organs often affected in children with kwashiorkor include the kidneys, pancreas, heart, and nervous system. Other findings that may be encountered on physical exam include a distended abdomen, hair thinning, loss of teeth, skin or hair depigmentation, and dermatitis. Children with kwashiorkor often develop irritability and anorexia. Generally, kwashiorkor is treated by introducing a high-quality source of protein to the diet. Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) as well as F-100 and F-75 milk powders, which both include skim milk powder, are recommended for the treatment of kwashiorkor. These products are designed for use in low-resource settings. The limited number of kwashiorkor cases that occur in high resource settings, where there is good access to advanced therapeutic tools, are typically treated with partially hydrolyzed or elemental enteral formulas, with parenteral nutrition provided in extreme cases.\nDifferential Diagnosis.\nWhile Kwashiorkor is primarily characterized by edema, growth failure, and dermatitis, it can sometimes be misdiagnosed as https://, as both conditions present with similar dermatological symptoms. However, AE is caused by zinc deficiency, not protein deficiency, and is associated with a significant decrease in serum zinc levels. Unlike kwashiorkor, which is diagnosed based on clinical signs like edema and low serum albumin levels, AE requires additional diagnostic tests, such as zinc uptake tests and genetic screening, to differentiate it from other disorders with similar symptoms. Therefore, while both conditions can present with dermatitis, the underlying etiology helps distinguish the two. \nCauses.\nThe precise etiology of kwashiorkor remains unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed that are associated with and explain some, but not all aspects of the pathophysiology of kwashiorkor. They include, but are not limited to protein deficiency causing hypoalbuminemia, amino acid deficiency, oxidative stress, and gut microbiome changes.\nLow protein intake.\nKwashiorkor is a severe form of malnutrition associated with a low-protein diet. The extreme lack of protein causes an osmotic imbalance in the gastrointestinal system causing swelling of the gut diagnosed as an edema or retention of water.\nExtreme fluid retention observed in individuals suffering from kwashiorkor is accompanied by irregularities in the lymphatic system as well as disruptions of capillary exchange. The lymphatic system serves three major purposes: fluid recovery, immunity, and lipid absorption. Victims of kwashiorkor commonly exhibit reduced ability to recover fluids, immune system failure, and low lipid absorption. Fluid recovery by the lymphatic system is accomplished by the re-vascularization of fluid and macromolecules from the interstitial space, allowing these constituents of whole blood to be returned to the venous circulation. Compromised fluid recovery may contribute to the phenomenon of extravascular fluid accumulation in kwashiorkor.\nThe low protein theory for the pathogenesis of kwashiorkor has been used to teach that capillary exchange between the lymphatic system and circulating blood is impaired by a reduced oncotic (i.e. colloid osmotic pressure, COP) in the blood, as a consequence of inadequate protein intake, so that the hydrostatic pressure gradient, which favors extravasation of fluid from small vessels, is not overcome. Proteins, mainly albumin, are responsible for creating the COP observed in the blood and tissue fluids. The difference in the COP of the blood and tissue tends to favor the reentry of fluid from the extravascular space, into the circulatory system. This tendency is opposed by the venous hydrostatic pressure, which tends to favor the exit of fluid from small vessels, into the interstitial space. The low protein theory for the pathogenesis of kwashiorkor held that a deficiency of serum proteins, caused by inadequate protein intake, disrupted this balance, and thus impaired the return flow of fluid from the interstitium into the capillary and venous structures. It has been taught that this is what accounts for the accumulation of extravascular fluid in kwashiorkor, and the subsequent pedal edema and abdominal distension.\nThe low protein theory, which relies heavily upon Starling's theory for the movement of fluid in biological systems, provided a compelling rationale for the pathogenesis of edema in kwashiorkor. What it does not explain, however, is the entire array of disturbances that define the kwashiorkor syndrome. These include irritability, anorexia, skin desquamation, skin depigmentation, hair discoloration, reduced mitochondrial respiration, impaired lipid export from the liver without an accompanying reduction of lipoprotein synthesis, 'oxidative stress', glutathione depletions, transsulfuration disturbances, diffuse DNA hypomethylation, immune dysfunction, decreased transmethylation activity, and sulfated glycosaminoglycan deficiencies. It is now generally acknowledged that by itself, the low protein theory does not adequately account for the pathogenesis of kwashiorkor. More complex deficiencies are at work. These have still not been established.\nSocial factors are also relevant. Ignorance of nutrition can be a cause. A case was described where parents who fed their child cassava failed to recognize malnutrition because of the edema caused by the syndrome and believed the child was well-nourished despite the development of kwashiorkor.\nAflatoxins.\nRecent studies have attempted to pinpoint a relationship between kwashiorkor and high levels of aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins produced by the mold \"Aspergillus flavus\", a fungus found in areas with hot and humid climates. These toxins tend to grow and can be found in agricultural crops such as millet, maize, and rice. An analysis found that the presence of aflatoxins was found more frequently and in higher concentrations in individuals with kwashiorkor when compared to individuals with marasmus (another form of severe acute malnutrition). In particular, biological samples showed greater levels of aflatoxins in the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lungs, serum, stool, and urine. Aflatoxins were not found in liver samples of individuals with marasmus. It has been known that the liver organ is the main target of aflatoxins and chronic toxicity can result in immunosuppressive and carcinogenic effects. However, there is currently conflicting evidence to pinpoint a connection between kwashiorkor and aflatoxins. Studies have shown that not all children with kwashiorkor present with detectable aflatoxin levels. It has also been proposed that damage done by aflatoxins may be due to glutathione depletion (another proposed mechanism of the disease) in children with kwashiorkor.\nMechanisms.\nPeripheral edema and hypoalbuminemia.\nKwashiorkor is a form of protein deficiency, which can result in both osmotic imbalances and irregularities in the lymphatic system.\nKwashiorkor is most notable for peripheral edema. The presence of edema in kwashiorkor is correlated with very low albumin concentration (hypoalbuminemia). Edema results from a loss of fluid balance between the hydrostatic and oncotic pressures across the capillary blood vessel walls due to the lack of protein which affects the body's ability to draw fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream. Low albumin concentration influences negatively the strength of oncotic pressure. Failure leads to fluid buildup in the abdomen, resulting in edema and belly distension.\nFurthermore, the release of antidiuretic hormone is stimulated by hypovolemia, also leading to the development of peripheral edema. Plasma renin is also stimulated, promoting sodium retention.\nIt is important to distinguish the pathophysiology of marasmus and kwashiorkor when it comes to treating malnourished children who may have hypovolemic shock that is caused by an acute loss of salt and water. Children with severe albumin deficiency struggle physiologically to maintain their blood volume.\nLow glutathione levels.\nKwashiorkor is also marked by low glutathione levels. Glutathione is used in many of the body processes on a molecule level.\nIt is believed to be related to high oxidant levels commonly seen in people who suffer from starvation and rarely in chronic inflammation. Glutathione serves vital functions including management of oxidative stress which is an imbalance that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of many diseases.\nEvidence indicates that amino acid balance has an important effect on protein nutrition and therefore on glutathione homeostasis.\nCysteine is an essential amino acid that acts as the limiting amino acid for glutathione synthesis in humans. Factors that increase demand for glutathione may increase demand for cysteine, and hence methionine. Such demands have been hypothesized to increase the risk for kwashiorkor.\nOthers.\nA proposed experimental theory suggests that alterations in the microbiome/virome contribute to edematous malnutrition, but further studies are required to understand the mechanism.\nDiagnosis.\nKwashiorkor, or edematous malnutrition, like many other malnutrition diseases, is indirectly assessed using anthropometry. Kwashiorkor is a subtype of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) characterized by bilateral peripheral pitting edema. According to the World Health Organization, the SAM diagnosis parameters are a \"mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of &lt; 115 mm, weight-for-height/length Z-score (WHZ) of &lt; -3Z and nutritional edema or any combination of these parameters.\" Additional clinical findings on physical exam include marked muscle atrophy, abdominal distension, dermatitis, and hepatomegaly.\nWHO criteria for clinical assessment of malnutrition are based on the degree of wasting (MUAC), stunting (weight-for-height Z-score), and the presence of edema (mild to severe).&lt;ref name=\"WHO 10665/95584\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn addition to anthropometric measures, laboratory tests can be critical for diagnosing kwashiorkor. Low serum albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia) are a hallmark of protein deficiency, and elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction. Electrolyte imbalances and blood tests may also be used to assess the degree of organ involvement and complications.\nSpecifically in children, severe malnutrition, such as kwashiorkor, can lead to notable changes in brain function and behavior. Children with kwashiorkor tend to be irritable and may develop cerebral atrophy, whereas those with severe wasting frequently show apathy, reduced movement, and speech delays. These neurological and behavioral changes are key factors in the clinical assessment of malnutrition.\nScreening.\nBecause it can be difficult to measure weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ) frequently, screening is performed by physical exam, with careful examination of the child's feet to detect the presence of bilateral pitting edema. Screening for edema is essential for the diagnosis of kwashiorkor, since nearly two-thirds of kwashiorkor cases do not have evidence of acute wasting (i.e. mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt; 125 mm, or WHZ &lt; -2) when diagnosed with kwashiorkor.\nPrevention.\nAs for the prevention of childhood malnutrition, there needs to be public health changes such as improving agriculture and improving access to healthcare to effectively reduce the rates of malnutrition in children. By educating individuals of childbearing age on proper nutrition and health during and after pregnancy, they can provide their children with the appropriate nutrients from a young age. By ensuring they are equipped with the proper education and resources, caretakers and infants are in better health, ultimately preventing childhood malnutrition.\nBecause edema can hide decreased muscle mass, it can be hard to diagnose kwashiorkor in young children; however, if cases are overlooked, children become more susceptible to infections and can ultimately lead to morbidity and mortality. To prevent this from happening, parents can be educated on proper nutrition and the importance of breastfeeding infants to ensure they receive all the nutrients they need.\nA diet rich in carbohydrates, fats that provide 10% of the total caloric needs, and proteins that provide 15% of the caloric needs can prevent kwashiorkor.\nProteins can be found in the following foods\nTreatment.\nWHO guidelines outline 10 general principles for the inpatient management of severely malnourished children.\nBoth clinical subtypes of severe acute malnutrition (kwashiorkor and marasmus) are treated similarly. Upon initial treatment, children with kwashiorkor may experience weight loss as their edema resolves. Therefore, after concerns of refeeding syndrome have passed, children may require 120-140% of their estimated caloric needs to achieve catch-up growth.\nThe cause, type, and severity of malnutrition determine what type of treatment would be most appropriate. For primary acute malnutrition, children with no complications are treated at home and are encouraged to either continue breastfeeding (for infants) or start using ready-to-use therapeutic foods (for children). For secondary acute malnutrition, the underlying cause needs to be identified to appropriately treat children. Only after the primary disease is determined can an appropriate dietary plan be made, as fluid, vitamins, and macronutrients may need to be considered to not exacerbate the cause of malnutrition. For example, it is important to recognize that supplementation with key micronutrients like vitamin A, zinc, and iron may be necessary for children during recovery. Micronutrient deficiencies are common in malnourished children and contribute to immune dysfunction. Specific vitamin A supplementation is particularly important for preventing further damage to the liver and skin.\nReady-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) and F-75 and F-100 milks were created to provide appropriate nutrition and caloric intake to those experiencing malnutrition. F-75 milk would be ideal when trying to reintroduce food into a malnourished person, and F-100 milk would be used to aid in weight gain. While RUTFs and F-100 milk were made to have the same nutritional value, RUTFs are beneficial as they are dehydrated and do not require much preparation.\nIt is also important to note that infections are common in children with severe malnutrition and can further complicate treatment. Routine antibiotics, even in the absence of clinical infection, are generally given as a prophylactic measure, especially in regions with a high risk of infectious diseases. However, due to concerns about antibiotic resistance, there is debate over their routine use.\nPrognosis.\nKwashiorkor is associated with a high risk of mortality and long-term complications. Treatment under the guidelines of the World Health Organization has proven to reduce this mortality risk and affected children tend to recover faster than children with other severe malnutrition diseases. However, physical and intellectual capabilities are not fully restored. Growth stunting and chronic disruption of microbiota are commonly observed after recovery.\nA high risk of death is identified by a brachial perimeter &lt; 11\u00a0cm or by a weight-for-age threshold &lt; \u22123 z-scores below the median of the WHO child growth standards. In practice, malnourished children with edema are suffering from potentially life-threatening severe malnutrition.\nEpidemiology.\nKwashiorkor is rare in high-income countries. It is mostly observed in low-income and middle-income nations and regions such as Southeast Asia, Central America, Congo, Ethiopia, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, South Africa, and Uganda, where poverty is prominent. Occurrences of severe malnutrition also tend to trend higher under conditions of food insecurity, higher prevalence of infectious diseases, lack of access to appropriate care, and poor living situations with inadequate sanitation. Communities experiencing famine are affected the most, especially during the rainy season. Prevalence varies, but it affects children of either sex commonly under five years old. \"Globally, kwashiorkor indirected accounted for 53% of deaths among children under five between 2000 and 2003 when associated with other common childhood diseases like acute respiratory infections, malaria, measles, HIV/AIDS and other causes of perinatal deaths.\"\nWhen compared to marasmus in developing countries, kwashiorkor typically has a lower prevalence, \"0.2%-1.6% for kwashiorkor and 1.2%-6.8% for marasmus.\" Factors such as \"diet, geographical locations, climate, and aflatoxin exposure\" have been invoked as potential causes for observed differences in the prevalence of kwashiorkor and marasmus.\nIn general, in areas where Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is prevalent, marasmus is more often the dominant SAM condition. However, in certain areas, kwashiorkor may be more common than marasmus.\nHistory.\nKwashiorkor was present in the world long before 1933 when Cicely Williams published research that took the Ga name for the disease. There were already many names for the illness which referenced the cessation of breastfeeding, or the consumption of monotonous diets high in starch. However, Williams was the first to suggest that this might be a deficiency of protein or an amino acid. Despite publishing in 1933, it was only in 1949 that the World Health Organization officially recognized kwashiorkor as a public health concern. This period also correlated with the promotion of infant formula, often by European colonial powers. The substitution of formula for breastmilk contributed significantly to the increasing visibility of kwashiorkor throughout the twentieth century. Cicely Williams later described the promotion of formula as \"the most criminal form of sedition, and that those deaths should be regarded as murder.\" These arguments underpinned the 1970s Nestl\u00e9 boycott.\nEffects on pharmacokinetics.\nThose experiencing poverty-related infectious diseases (PRDs) such as malaria and tuberculosis are also likely to be malnourished. Malnutrition can affect the pharmacokinetics of various drugs used to treat PRDs by changing a drug's bioavailability, distribution, and elimination. To optimize the treatment of those diseases, there needs to be more research into how severe malnutrition, specifically kwashiorkor, can affect treatment response.\nResearch directions.\nCurrent research and recommendations to manage severe acute malnutrition (SAM), such as kwashiorkor, in children, are largely based on expert opinions. Only one-third of the WHO guidelines for the management of SAM are based on epidemiological and clinical research. Further studies are needed to \"improve treatment outcomes in the large number of children with SAM.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an important concept in , where it is believed to be a force or power associated with the divine feminine or the formless aspect of the Goddess. This energy in the subtle body, when cultivated and awakened through tantric practice, is believed to lead to spiritual liberation. Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is associated with the goddess Parvati or Adi Parashakti, the supreme being in Shaktism, and with the goddesses Bhairavi and Kubjika. The term, along with practices associated with it, was adopted into Hatha Yoga in the 9th century. It has since then been adopted into other forms of Hinduism as well as modern spirituality and New Age thought.\nKu\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b awakenings are said to occur by a variety of methods. Many systems of yoga focus on awakening ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b through: meditation, pranayama, the practice of asana, and chanting of mantras. \nEtymology.\nThe concept of Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is mentioned in the Upanishads (9th \u2013 7th centuries BCE). The Sanskrit adjective ' means \"circular, annular\". It is mentioned as a noun for \"snake\" (in the sense of \"coiled\") in the 12th-century \"Rajatarangini\" chronicle (I.2). ' (a noun meaning \"bowl, water-pot\" is found as the name of a N\u0101ga (serpent deity) in Mahabharata 1.4828). The 8th-century \"Tantrasadbhava Tantra\" uses the term \"kundal\u012b\", glossed by David Gordon White as \"she who is ring-shaped\".\nThe use of \"ku\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012b\" as a name for Goddess Durga (a form of Shakti) appears often in Tantrism and Shaktism from as early as the 11th century in the \"\u015aaradatilaka\". It was adopted as a technical term in Hatha yoga during the 15th century, and became widely used in the Yoga Upanishads by the 16th century. Eknath Easwaran has paraphrased the term as \"the coiled power\", a force which ordinarily rests at the base of the spine, described as being \"coiled there like a serpent\".\nIn Shaivism.\nKu\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b arose as a central concept in , especially among the \u015a\u0101kta sects like the Kaula. In these Tantric traditions, Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is \"the innate intelligence of embodied Consciousness\". The first possible mention of the term is in the \"Tantrasadbh\u0101va-tantra\" (eighth century), but other earlier tantras mention the visualization of Shakti in the central channel and the upward movement of prana or vital force (which is often associated with Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b in later works). According to David Gordon White, this feminine spiritual force is also termed \"bhogavati,\" which has a double meaning of \"enjoyment\" and \"coiled\" and signifies her strong connection to bliss and pleasure, both mundane physical pleasure and the bliss of spiritual liberation (moksha), which is the enjoyment of Shiva's creative activity and ultimate union with the Goddess.\nIn the influential Shakta tradition called Kaula, Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is seen as a \"latent innate spiritual power\" associated with the Goddess Kubjika (lit. \"the crooked one\"), who is the supreme Goddess (Paradevi). She is also pure bliss and power (Shakti), the source of all mantras, and resides in the six chakras along the central channel. In Shaiva Tantra, various practices like Pranayama, Bandhas, Mantra recitation, and tantric ritual were used to awaken this spiritual power and create a state of bliss and spiritual liberation.\nAccording to Abhinavagupta, the great tantric scholar and master of the Kaula and Trika lineages, there are two main forms of Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b, an upward moving Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b (\"urdhva\") associated with expansion, and a downward moving Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b (\"adha\") associated with contraction. According to the scholar of comparative religion Gavin Flood, Abhinavagupta links Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b with \"the power that brings into manifestation the body, breath, and experiences of pleasure and pain\", with \"the power of sexuality as the source of reproduction\" and with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the force of the syllable \"ha\" in the mantra and the concept of \"aham\", the supreme subjectivity as the source of all, with \"a\" as the initial movement of consciousness and \"m\" its final withdrawal. Thus we have an elaborate series of associations, all conveying the central conception of the cosmos as a manifestation of consciousness, of pure subjectivity, with Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b understood as the force inseparable from consciousness, who animates creation and who, in her particularised form in the body, causes liberation through her upward, illusion-shattering movement.\nIn Vaishnavism.\nDespite mostly being associated with Shaiva and Shakta traditions, the concept of Kundalini Shakti is not at all alien to Vaishnavism. A popular Vaishnava text called \"Narada Pancharatra\" gives a detailed, although somewhat different description of Chakras and Kundalini Shakti compared to Shaivism and Shaktism. \nDescription.\nAccording to William F. Williams, ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is a type of religious experience within the Hindu tradition, within which it is held to be a kind of \"cosmic energy\" that accumulates at the base of the spine.\nWhen awakened, ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is described as rising up from the muladhara chakra, through the central nadi (called \"sushumna\") inside or alongside the spine reaching the top of the head. The progress of ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b through the different chakras is believed to achieve different levels of awakening and a mystical experience, until Kundalini finally reaches the top of the head, Sahasrara or crown chakra, producing a profound transformation of consciousness.\nSwami Sivananda Saraswati of the Divine Life Society stated in his book \"Kundalini Yoga\" that \"Supersensual visions appear before the mental eye of the aspirant, new worlds with indescribable wonders and charms unfold themselves before the Yogi, planes after planes reveal their existence and grandeur to the practitioner and the Yogi gets divine knowledge, power and bliss, in increasing degrees, when Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b passes through Chakra after Chakra, making them to bloom in all their glory...\"\nKundalini experiences.\nTechniques for the awakening of Kundalini.\nYoga gurus consider that Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b can be awakened by \"shaktipat\" (spiritual transmission by a Guru or teacher), or by spiritual practices such as yoga or meditation.\nThere are two broad approaches to Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b awakening: active and passive. The \"active approach\" involves systematic physical exercises and techniques of concentration, visualization, pranayama (breath practice) and meditation under the guidance of a competent teacher. These techniques come from any of the main branches of yoga, and some forms of yoga, such as Kriya yoga and Kundalini yoga, which emphasize Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b techniques.\nThe \"passive approach\" is instead a path of surrender where one lets go of all the impediments to the awakening rather than trying to actively awaken Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b. A chief part of the passive approach is shaktipat where one individual's Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is awakened by another who already has the experience. Shaktipat only raises Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b temporarily but gives the student an experience to use as a basis.\nThe twentieth century yogi and mystic Gopi Krishna, who helped to bring the concept of Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b to the Western world, stated that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe American comparative religions scholar Joseph Campbell describes the concept of Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b as \"the figure of a coiled female serpent\u2014a serpent goddess not of \"gross\" but \"subtle\" substance\u2014which is to be thought of as residing in a torpid, slumbering state in a subtle center, the first of the seven, near the base of the spine: the aim of the yoga then being to rouse this serpent, lift her head, and bring her up a subtle nerve or channel of the spine to the so-called \"thousand-petaled lotus\" (Sahasrara) at the crown of the head...She, rising from the lowest to the highest lotus center will pass through and wake the five between, and with each waking, the psychology and personality of the practitioner will be altogether and fundamentally transformed.\"\nHatha yoga.\nAccording to the \"Gorak\u1e63a\u015bataka\", or \"Hundred Verses of Goraksa\", hatha yoga practices such as the mudras mula bandha, uddiyana bandha, and jalandhara bandha, and the pranayama practice of kumbhaka can awaken Kundalini. Another hatha yoga text, the \"Khecar\u012bvidy\u0101\", states that khechari mudra enables one to raise Kundalini and access the stores of amrita in the head, which subsequently flood the body.\nShaktipat.\nThe spiritual teacher Meher Baba emphasized the need for a master when actively trying to awaken Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn his book, \"Building a Noble World\", Shiv R. Jhawar describes his Shaktipat experience at Muktananda's public program at Lake Point Tower in Chicago on 16 September 1974 as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Baba [Swami Muktananda] had just begun delivering his discourse with his opening statement: 'Today's subject is meditation. ... 'Kundalini starts dancing when one repeats Om Namah Shivaya.' Hearing this, I mentally repeated the mantra, I noticed that my breathing was getting heavier. Suddenly, I felt a great impact of a rising force within me. The intensity of this rising kundalini force was so tremendous that my body lifted up a little and fell flat into the aisle; my eyeglasses flew off. As I lay there with my eyes closed, I could see a continuous fountain of dazzling white lights erupting within me. In brilliance, these lights were brighter than the sun but possessed no heat at all. I was experiencing the thought-free state of \"I am\", realizing that \"I\" have always been, and will continue to be, eternal. I was fully conscious and completely aware while I was experiencing the pure \"I am\", a state of supreme bliss. Outwardly, at that precise moment, Baba delightfully shouted from his platform, \u2018I didn't do anything. The Energy has caught someone.''\nKundalini awakening.\nThe experience of Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b awakening can happen when one is either prepared or unprepared.\nAccording to Hindu tradition, in order to be able to integrate this spiritual energy, a period of careful purification and strengthening of the body and nervous system is usually required beforehand. Yoga and Tantra propose that Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b can be awakened by a guru (teacher), but body and spirit must be prepared by yogic austerities, such as pranayama, or breath control, physical exercises, visualization, and chanting. The student is advised to follow the path in an open-hearted manner.\nReligious interpretations.\nIndian interpretations.\nKu\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is considered to occur in the chakra and nadis of the subtle body. Each chakra is said to contain special characteristics and with proper training, moving Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b through these chakras can help express or open these characteristics.\nKu\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is described as a sleeping, dormant potential force in the human organism.\nIt is one of the components of an esoteric description of the \"subtle body\", which consists of nadis (energy channels), chakras (psychic centres), prana (subtle energy), and bindu (drops of essence).\nKu\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is described as being coiled up at the base of the spine. The description of the location can vary slightly, from the rectum to the navel. Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is said to reside in the triangular sacrum bone in three and a half coils.\nSwami Vivekananda describes Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b briefly in his book \"Raja Yoga\" as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b Shakti is conceived as a goddess, then, when it rises to the head, it unites itself with the Supreme Being of (Lord Shiva). The aspirant then becomes engrossed in deep meditation and infinite bliss. Paramahansa Yogananda in his book \"\" states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the command of the yogi in deep meditation, this creative force turns inward and flows back to its source in the thousand-petaled lotus, revealing the resplendent inner world of the divine forces and consciousness of the soul and spirit. Yoga refers to this power flowing from the coccyx to spirit as the awakened kundalini.\nParamahansa Yogananda also states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The yogi reverses the searchlights of intelligence, mind and life force inward through a secret astral passage, the coiled way of the kundalini in the coccygeal plexus, and upward through the sacral, the lumbar, and the higher dorsal, cervical, and medullary plexuses, and the spiritual eye at the point between the eyebrows, to reveal finally the soul's presence in the highest center (Sahasrara) in the brain.\nKrishnamacharya, often called the \"father of modern yoga\", described ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b differently. To him, Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b is not an energy that rises: it is a blockage that prevents pr\u0101\u1e47a v\u0101yu (breath) from entering the su\u1e63umn\u0101 and rising. This interpretation came partly from his own experience and partly from teachings of two sects of Vishnu-worshiping temple priests.\nWestern significance.\nSir John Woodroffe (1865\u20131936) \u2013 also known by his pseudonym Arthur Avalon \u2013 was a British Orientalist whose published works stimulated a far-reaching interest in Hindu philosophy and Yogic practices. While serving as a High Court Judge in Calcutta, he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy, particularly as it related to Hindu Tantra. He translated numerous original Sanskrit texts and lectured on Indian philosophy, Yoga and Tantra. His book, \"The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga\" became a major source for many modern Western adaptations of Kundalini yoga practice. It presents an academically and philosophically sophisticated translation of, and commentary on, two key Eastern texts: \"Shatchakranir\u016bpana\" (Description and Investigation into the Six Bodily Centers) written by Tantrik P\u016brn\u0101nanda Sv\u0101m\u012b (1526) and the \"Paduka-Pancak\u0101\" from the Sanskrit of a commentary by K\u0101l\u012bcharana (Five-fold Footstool of the Guru). The Sanskrit term \"Kundali Shakti\" translates as \"Serpent Power\". Kundalini is thought to be an energy released within an individual using specific meditation techniques. It is represented symbolically as a serpent coiled at the base of the spine.\nWhen Woodroffe later commented upon the reception of his work he clarified his objective, \"All the world (I speak of course of those interested in such subjects) is beginning to speak of Kundalin\u00ee Shakti.\" He described his intention as follows: \"We, who are foreigners, must place ourselves in the skin of the Hindu, and must look at their doctrine and ritual through their eyes and not our own.\"\nCarl Jung.\nWestern awareness of Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b was strengthened by the interest of Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875\u20131961).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Jung's seminar on Kundalini yoga presented to the Psychological Club in Zurich in 1932 was widely regarded as a milestone in the psychological understanding of Eastern thought and of the symbolic transformations of inner experience. Kundalini yoga presented Jung with a model for the developmental phases of higher consciousness, and he interpreted its symbols in terms of the process of individuation, with sensitivity towards a new generation's interest in alternative religions and psychological exploration.\"\nIn the introduction to Jung's book \"The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga\", Sonu Shamdasani puts forth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The emergence of depth psychology was historically paralleled by the translation and widespread dissemination of the texts of yoga... for the depth psychologies sought to liberate themselves from the stultifying limitations of Western thought to develop maps of inner experience grounded in the transformative potential of therapeutic practices. A similar alignment of \"theory\" and \"practice\" seemed to be embodied in the yogic texts that moreover had developed independently of the bindings of Western thought. Further, the initiatory structure adopted by institutions of psychotherapy brought its social organization into proximity with that of yoga. Hence, an opportunity for a new form of comparative psychology opened up.\"\nMore recent viewpoints.\nThe American writer William Buhlman began to conduct an international survey of out-of-body experiences in 1969 in order to gather information about symptoms: sounds, vibrations and other phenomena that commonly occur at the time of the OBE event. His primary interest was to compare the findings with reports made by yogis such as Gopi Krishna who have referred to similar phenomena, such as the \"vibrational state\" as components of their kundalini-related spiritual experience. He explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSri Aurobindo was the other great scholarly authority on Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b, with a viewpoint parallel to that of Woodroffe but of a somewhat different slant - this according to Mary Scott, herself a latter-day scholar on Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b and its physical basis, and a former member of the Theosophical Society.\nPsychology.\nAccording to Carl Jung \"the concept of Kundalini has for us only one use, that is, to describe our own experiences with the unconscious.\" Jung used the Kundalini system symbolically as a means of understanding the dynamic movement between conscious and unconscious processes.\nAccording to Shamdasani, Jung claimed that the symbolism of Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b yoga suggested that the bizarre symptomatology that patients at times presented, actually resulted from the awakening of the Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b. He argued that knowledge of such symbolism enabled much that would otherwise be seen as the meaningless by-products of a disease process to be understood as meaningful symbolic processes, and explicated the often peculiar physical localizations of symptoms.\nThe popularization of eastern spiritual practices has been associated with psychological problems in the west. Psychiatric literature notes that \"since the influx of eastern spiritual practices and the rising popularity of meditation starting in the 1960s, many people have experienced a variety of psychological difficulties, either while engaged in intensive spiritual practice or spontaneously.\" Among the psychological difficulties associated with intensive spiritual practice we find \"Kundalini awakening,\" \"a complex physio-psychospiritual transformative process described in the yogic tradition.\" Researchers in the fields of Transpersonal psychology, and Near-death studies have described a complex pattern of sensory, motor, mental, and affective symptoms associated with the concept of Kundalini, sometimes called the Kundalini syndrome.\nThe differentiation between spiritual emergency associated with Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b awakening may be viewed as an acute psychotic episode by psychiatrists who are not conversant with the culture. The biological changes of increased P300 amplitudes that occur with certain yogic practices may lead to acute psychosis.

He is commemorated as a martyr in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 14 August, alongside Maximilian Kolbe.\nBiography.\nHe was born Kaj Harald Leininger Petersen on the island of Lolland, Denmark, and raised by a family named Munk after the death of his parents. From 1924 until his death, Munk was the vicar of Veders\u00f8 in Western Jutland. Munk's plays were mostly performed and made public during the 1930s, although many were written in the 1920s. Much of his other work concerns the \"philosophy-on-life debate\" (religion\u2014Marxism\u2014Darwinism) which marked much of Danish cultural life during this period.\nOn one occasion, in the early 1930s, in a comment that came back to haunt him in later years, Munk expressed admiration for Hitler (for uniting Germans) and wished a similar unifying figure for Danes. However, Munk's attitude towards Hitler (and Mussolini) turned to outspoken criticism as he witnessed Hitler's persecution of the German Jewish community, and Mussolini's conduct of the war in Ethiopia. In 1938, the Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\" published on its front page an open letter to Benito Mussolini written by Kaj Munk criticising the persecutions against Jews.\nEarly on, Munk was a strong opponent of the German Occupation of Denmark (1940\u20131945), although he continually opposed the idea of democracy as such, preferring the idea of a \"Nordic dictator\" who should unite the Nordic countries and keep them neutral during periods of international crisis. His plays \"Han sidder ved Smeltediglen\" (\"He sits by the melting pot\") and \"Niels Ebbesen\" were direct attacks on Nazism. The latter, centering on the figure of Niels Ebbesen, a medieval Danish squire considered a national hero for having assassinated an earlier German occupier of Denmark, Count Gerhard III, was a contemporary analogue to World War II-era Denmark. Despite his friends urging Munk to go underground, he continued to preach against Danes who collaborated with the Nazis.\nThe Gestapo arrested Munk on the night of 4 January 1944, a month after he had defied a Nazi ban and preached the first Advent sermon at the national cathedral in Copenhagen. Munk's body was found in a roadside ditch in rural H\u00f8rbylunde near Silkeborg the next morning with a note stating, \"Swine, you worked for Germany just the same.\" \nMunk's body was returned to his parish church, Veders\u00f8, where it is buried outside the choir. A simple stone cross was also erected on a small hill overlooking the site where Munk's body was dumped.\nHalf of the January 1944 issue of the resistance newspaper \"De frie Danske\" was dedicated to Munk with his portrait filling the front page. The obituary \"Danmarks store S\u00f8n\u2014Kaj Munk\" (The great son of Denmark\u2014Kaj Munk) filled the next page, followed by excerpts from a new year's sermon he had given. Next came a description of his murder and a photo reportage from his funeral. Lastly the paper featured condemning reactions from influential Scandinavians, namely Prince Wilhelm, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland, Jarl Hemmer, Johannes J\u00f8rgensen, Sigrid Undset, Erling Eidem and Harald Bohr.\nThe Danish government allowed his widow, Lise, to live at the parish house until she died in 1998. The church and parish house were restored as a memorial and opened to the public in 2010.\nPlaywright.\nMunk often used a historical background for his plays\u2014among his influences were William Shakespeare, Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, Henrik Ibsen, and George Bernard Shaw. As a playwright, Munk became known for \"strong characters\"\u2014integrated people who fight wholeheartedly for their ideals (whether good or bad). In his play \"En Idealist\", for example, the \"hero\" is King Herod whose fight to maintain power is the motive behind all of his acts until he is at last defeated by a show of kindness to the Christ child in a weak moment.\nHis 1925 play \"Ordet\" (\"The Word\") is generally considered to be his best work; it is an investigation of miracles from the unique (at least, to theatre) viewpoint of one who was not prepared to dismiss them. A family of farmers\u2014of differing degrees of faith\u2014find themselves reconciled to their neighbours through a miracle. A 1943 film adaptation titled \"The Word\" was directed by Gustaf Molander. A 1955 film version of \"Ordet\" was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, and won numerous awards, including the Golden Lion at the 16th Venice International Film Festival and the 1956 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nMunk's plays, many of which have been performed at the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen, and elsewhere, include:\nHis play \"Niels Ebbesen\" has been translated into English (2006) by his granddaughter Arense Lund and Canadian playwright Dave Carley.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17001", "revid": "82432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17001", "title": "Kohlrabi", "text": "Biennial cultivar of wild cabbage\nKohlrabi (; pronounced in English; scientific name \"Brassica oleracea\" Gongylodes Group), also called German turnip or turnip cabbage, is a biennial vegetable, a low, stout cultivar of wild cabbage. It is a cultivar of the same species as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, Savoy cabbage, and gai lan.\nIt can be eaten raw or cooked. Edible preparations are made with both the stem and the leaves. Despite its common names, it is not the same species as turnip, although both are in the genus \"Brassica\".\nEtymology.\nThe name comes from the German (\"cabbage\") plus \"R\u00fcbe\" ~ \"Rabi\" (Swiss German variant) (\"turnip\"), because the swollen stem resembles the latter.\nIts Group name Gongylodes (or lowercase and italicized \"gongylodes\" or \"gongyloides\" as a variety name) means \"roundish\" in Greek, from (, 'round').\nHistory.\nThe first European written record is by the botanist Mattioli in 1554 who wrote that it had \"come lately into Italy\". By the end of the 16th century, kohlrabi spread to North Europe and was being grown in Austria, Germany, England, Italy, Spain, Tripoli and parts of the eastern Mediterranean.\nDescription.\nKohlrabi has been created by artificial selection for lateral meristem growth (a swollen, nearly spherical shape); its origin in nature is the same as that of cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collard greens, and Brussels sprouts: they are all bred from, and are the same species as, the wild cabbage plant (\"Brassica oleracea\").\nThe taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to those of a broccoli stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter, with a higher ratio of flesh to skin. The young stem in particular can be as crisp and juicy as an apple, although much less sweet.\nExcept for the \"Gigante\" cultivar, spring-grown kohlrabi that are much over in size tend to be woody, as do full-grown kohlrabi much over perhaps in size; the Gigante cultivar can achieve great size while retaining good eating quality. The plant matures in 55\u201360 days after sowing and has good standing ability for up to 30 days after maturity. The approximate weight is . It grows well in hydroponic systems, producing a large edible bulk without clogging the nutrient troughs.\nThere are several varieties commonly available, including 'White Vienna', 'Purple Vienna', 'Grand Duke', 'Gigante' (also known as \"Superschmelz\"), 'Purple Danube', and 'White Danube'. Colouration of the purple types is superficial: the edible parts are all pale yellow. The leafy greens can also be eaten. One commonly used variety grows without a swollen stem, having just leaves and a very thin stem, and is called \"Haakh\". \"Haakh\" and \"Monj\" are popular Kashmiri dishes made using this vegetable. In the second year, the plant will bloom and develop seeds.\nNutrition.\nRaw kohlrabi is 91% water, 6% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount, raw kohlrabi supplies 27 calories, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (65% DV) and a moderate source (10\u201319% DV) of copper and potassium, with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).\nPreparation and use.\nKohlrabi stems (the enlarged vegetal part) are surrounded by two distinct fibrous layers that do not soften appreciably when cooked. These layers are generally peeled away prior to cooking or serving raw, with the result that the stems often provide a smaller amount of food than one might assume from their intact appearance.\nAlthough all parts of kohlrabi are edible, the bulbous stem is most frequently used, typically raw in salad or slaws. It has a texture similar to that of a broccoli stem, but with a flavor that is sweeter and less vegetal. It is also more crunchy and crisp than a raw broccoli stem.\nKohlrabi leaves are edible and can be used similarly to collard greens and kale, but take longer to cook.\nKohlrabi is an important part of Kashmiri cuisine, where it is called \"M\u014fnji.\" It is one of the most commonly cooked vegetables, along with collard greens (\"haakh\"). It is prepared with its leaves and served with a light soup and eaten with rice.\nIn Cyprus, it is popularly sprinkled with salt and lemon and served as an appetizer.\nKohlrabi is a common ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine. It can also be found in the dish nem r\u00e1n, stir fry and canh. Raw kohlrabi is usually sliced thinly for n\u1ed9m or n\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m.\nSome varieties are grown as feed for cattle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They have previously been known as \"long-horned grasshoppers\". More than 8,000 species are known. Part of the suborder Ensifera, the Tettigoniidae are the only extant (living) family in the superfamily Tettigonioidea.\nMany species are nocturnal in habit, having strident mating calls and may exhibit mimicry or camouflage, commonly with shapes and colours similar to leaves.\nEtymology.\nThe family name Tettigoniidae is derived from the genus \"Tettigonia\", of which the great green bush cricket is the type species; it was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. In Latin \"tettigonia\" means a kind of small cicada, leafhopper; it is from the Greek \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \"tettigonion\", the diminutive of the imitative (onomatopoeic) \u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b9\u03be, \"tettix\", cicada. All of these names such as \"tettix\" with repeated sounds are onomatopoeic, imitating the stridulation of these insects. The common name \"katydid\" is also onomatopoeic and comes from the particularly loud, three-pulsed song, often rendered \"ka-ty-did\", of the nominate subspecies of the North American \"Pterophylla camellifolia\", belonging to the subfamily Pseudophyllinae, which are known as \"true katydids\".\nDescription and life cycle.\nDescription.\nTettigoniids range in size from as small as to as large as . The smaller species typically live in drier or more stressful habitats which may lead to their small size. The small size is associated with greater agility, faster development, and lower nutritional needs. Tettigoniids are tree-living insects that are most commonly heard at night during summer and early fall. Tettigoniids may be distinguished from the grasshopper by the length of their filamentous antennae, which may exceed their own body length, while grasshoppers' antennae are always relatively short and thickened.\nLife cycle.\nEggs are typically oval and may be attached in rows to plants. Where the eggs are deposited relates to the way the ovipositor is formed. It consists of up to three pairs of appendages formed to transmit the egg, to make a place for it, and place it properly. Tettigoniids have either sickle-shaped ovipositors which typically lay eggs in dead or living plant matter, or uniform long ovipositors which lay eggs in grass stems. When tettigoniids hatch, the nymphs often look like small, wingless versions of the adults, but in some species, the nymphs look nothing at all like the adult and rather mimic other species such as ants, spiders and assassin bugs, or flowers, to prevent predation. The nymphs remain in a mimic state only until they are large enough to escape predation. Once they complete their last molt (after about 5 successful molts), they are then prepared to mate.\nDistribution.\nTettigoniids are found on every continent except Antarctica. The vast majority of katydid species live in the tropical regions of the world. For example, the Amazon basin tropical forests are home to over 2,000 species. However, katydids are found in the cool, dry temperate regions, as well, with about 255 species in North America.\nClassification.\nThe Tettigoniidae are a large family and have been divided into a number of subfamilies:\nThe Copiphorinae were previously considered a subfamily, but are now placed as tribe Copiphorini in the subfamily Conocephalinae. The genus \"Acridoxena\" is now placed in the tribe Acridoxenini of the Mecopodinae (previously its own subfamily, Acridoxeninae).\nExtinct taxa.\nThe \"Orthoptera species file\" lists:\nThe genus \u2020\"Triassophyllum\" is extinct and may be placed here or in the Archaeorthoptera.\nEcology.\n \nThe diet of most tettigoniids includes leaves, flowers, bark, and seeds, but many species are exclusively predatory, feeding on other insects, snails, or even small vertebrates such as snakes and lizards. Some are also considered pests by commercial crop growers and are sprayed to limit growth, but population densities are usually low, so a large economic impact is rare.\nTettigoniids are serious insect pests of karuka (\"Pandanus julianettii\"). The species \"Segestes gracilis\" and \"Segestidea montana\" eat the leaves and can sometimes kill trees. Growers will stuff leaves and grass in between the leaves of the crown to keep insects out.\nBy observing the head and mouthparts, where differences can be seen in relation to function, it is possible to determine what type of food the tettigoniids consume. Large tettigoniids can inflict a painful bite or pinch if handled, but seldom break the skin.\nSome species of bush crickets are consumed by people, such as the \"nsenene\" (\"Ruspolia differens\") in Uganda and neighbouring areas.\nCommunication.\nThe males of tettigoniids have sound-producing organs located on the hind angles of their front wings. In some species, females are also capable of stridulation. Females chirp in response to the shrill of the males. The males use this sound for courtship, which occurs late in the summer. The sound is produced by rubbing two parts of their bodies together, called stridulation. In many cases this is done with the wings, but not exclusively. One body part bears a file or comb with ridges; the other has the plectrum, which runs over the ridges to produce a vibration. For tettigoniids, the fore wings are used to sing. Tettigoniids produce continuous songs known as trills. The size of the insect, the spacing of the ridges, and the width of the scraper all influence what sound is made.\nMany species stridulate at a tempo which is governed by ambient temperature, so that the number of chirps in a defined period of time can produce a fairly accurate temperature reading. For American katydids, the formula is generally given as the number of chirps in 15 seconds plus 37 to give the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.\nPredation.\nSome tettigoniids have spines on different parts of their bodies that work in different ways. The Listroscelinae have limb spines on the ventral surfaces of their bodies. This works in a way to confine their prey to make a temporary cage above their mouthparts. The spines are articulated and comparatively flexible, but relatively blunt. Due to this, they are used to cage and not penetrate the prey's body. Spines on the tibiae and the femora are usually more sharp and nonarticulated. They are designed more for penetration or help in the defensive mechanism they might have. This usually works with their diurnal roosting posture to maximize defense and prevent predators from going for their head.\nDefense mechanisms.\nWhen tettigoniids go to rest during the day, they enter a diurnal roosting posture to maximize their cryptic qualities. This position fools predators into thinking the katydid is either dead or just a leaf on the plant. Various tettigoniids have bright coloration and black apical spots on the inner surfaces of the tegmina, and brightly colored hind wings. By flicking their wings open when disturbed, they use the coloration to fool predators into thinking the spots are eyes. This, in combination with their coloration mimicking leaves, allows them to blend in with their surroundings, but also makes predators unsure which side is the front and which side is the back.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt; \nKatydid \nI LOVE to hear thine earnest voice,\n Wherever thou art hid,\nThou testy little dogmatist,\n Thou pretty Katydid!\nThou mindest me of gentlefolks, -\n Old gentlefolks are they, -\nThou say'st an undisputed thing\n In such a solemn way. \nThou art a female, Katydid!\n I know it by the trill\nThat quivers through thy piercing notes,\n So petulant and shrill.\nI think there is a knot of you\n Beneath the hollow tree, -\nA knot of spinster Katydids, -\n Do Katydids drink tea? \nO, tell me where did Katy live,\n And what did Katy do?\nAnd was she very fair and young,\n And yet so wicked, too?\nDid Katy love a naughty man,\n Or kiss more cheeks than one?\nI warrant Katy did no more\n Than many a Kate has done.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"From the \"To An Insect\" poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt; \nTo A Katydid \nLITTLE friend among the tree-tops, \n Chanting low your vesper hymns,\n Never tiring, \n Me inspiring, \n Seated 'neath the swaying limbs, \nDo you know your plaintive calling, \nWhen the summer dew is falling, \nEchoes sweeter through my brain \nThan any soft, harmonic strain?\nOthers call you an intruder, \n Say discordant notes you know; \n Or that sadness, \n More than gladness, \n From your little heart doth flow; \nAnd that you awake from sleeping \nThoughts in quiet they were keeping, \nFaithless love, or ill-laid schemes, \nHopes unanchored \u2014 broken dreams.\nNo such phantoms to my vision \n Doth your lullaby impart, \n But sweet faces, \n No tear traces, \n Smile as joyous in my heart, \nAs when first at mother's knee \nLearned I your sweet mystery. \nI defend you with my praises, \nFor your song my soul upraises. \nOft I fancy when your neighbors, \n In some secret thicket hid, \n Are debating, \n Underrating \n What that little maiden did, \nThat above their clam'rous singing \nI can hear your accents ringing, \nLike a voice that must defend \nFrom abuse some time-loved friend. \nDream I not of fame or fortune, \n Only this I inward crave, \n Sweet assurance, \n Long endurance, \n Of a love beyond the grave. \nShould my songs die out and perish, \nYou'll my name repeat and cherish; \nThough all trace is lost of me, \nStill you'll call from tree to tree.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"From the \"To A Katydid\" poem by Kate Slaughter McKinney\"\nReproductive behavior.\nThe males provide a nuptial gift for the females in the form of a spermatophylax, a body attached to the males' spermatophore and consumed by the female, to distract her from eating the male's spermatophore and thereby increase his paternity.\nPolygamy.\nThe Tettigoniidae have polygamous relationships. The first male to mate is guaranteed an extremely high confidence of paternity when a second male couples at the termination of female sexual refractoriness. The nutrients that the offspring ultimately receive will increase their fitness. The second male to mate with the female at the termination of her refractory period is usually cuckolded.\nCompetition.\nThe polygamous relationships of the Tettigoniidae lead to high levels of male-male competition. Male competition is caused by the decreased availability of males able to supply nutritious spermaphylanges to the females. Females produce more eggs on a high-quality diet; thus, the female looks for healthier males with a more nutritious spermatophylax. Females use the sound created by the male to judge his fitness. The louder and more fluent the trill, the higher the fitness of the male.\nStress response.\nIn species which produce larger food gifts, the female often seeks out the males to copulate. This, however, is a cost to females as they risk predation while searching for males. Also, a cost-benefit tradeoff exists in the size of the spermatophore which the male tettigoniids produce. When males possess a large spermatophore, they benefit by being more highly selected for by females, but they are only able to mate one to two times during their lifetimes. Inversely, male Tettigoniidae with smaller spermatophores have the benefit of being able to mate two to three times per night, but have lower chances of being selected by females. Even in times of nutritional stress, male Tettigoniidae continue to invest nutrients within their spermatophores. In some species, the cost of creating the spermatophore is low, but even in those which it is not low, it is still not beneficial to reduce the quality of the spermatophore, as it would lead to lower reproductive selection and success. This low reproductive success is attributed to some Tettigoniidae species in which the spermatophylax that the female receives as a food gift from the male during copulation increases the reproductive output of the reproduction attempt. However, in other cases, the female receives few, if any, benefits.\nThe reproductive behavior of bush crickets has been studied in great depth. Studies found that the tuberous bush cricket (\"Platycleis affinis\") has the largest testes in proportion to body mass of any animal recorded. They account for 14% of the insect's body mass and are thought to enable a fast remating rate.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside, is a layer of ionised gas occurring roughly between above the ground \u2014 one of several layers in the Earth's ionosphere. It is also known as the E region. It reflects medium-frequency radio waves. Because of this reflective layer, radio waves radiated into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon. This \"skywave\" or \"skip\" propagation technique has been used since the 1920s for radio communication at long distances, up to transcontinental distances.\nPropagation is affected by the time of day. During the daytime the solar wind presses this layer closer to the Earth, thereby limiting how far it can reflect radio waves. Conversely, on the night (lee) side of the Earth, the solar wind drags the ionosphere further away, thereby greatly increasing the range which radio waves can travel by reflection. The extent of the effect is further influenced by the season, and the amount of sunspot activity.\nHistory.\nExistence of a reflective layer was predicted in 1902 independently and almost simultaneously by the American electrical engineer Arthur Edwin Kennelly (1861\u20131939) and the British polymath Oliver Heaviside (1850\u20131925), as an explanation for the propagation of radio waves beyond the horizon observed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1901. However, it was not until 1924 that its existence was shown by British scientist Edward V. Appleton, for which he received the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nPhysicists resisted the idea of the reflecting layer for one very good reason; it would require total internal reflection, which in turn would require that the speed of light in the ionosphere would be greater than in the atmosphere below it. Since the latter speed is essentially the same as the speed of light in vacuum (\"c\"), scientists were unwilling to believe the speed in the ionosphere could be higher. Nevertheless, Marconi had received signals in Newfoundland that were broadcast in England, so clearly there must be some mechanism allowing the transmission to reach that far. The paradox was resolved by the discovery that there were two velocities of light, the \"phase velocity\" and the \"group velocity\". The phase velocity can in fact be greater than \"c\", but the group velocity, being capable of transmitting information, cannot, by special relativity, be greater than \"c\". The phase velocity for radio waves in the ionosphere is indeed greater than \"c\", and that makes total internal reflection possible, and so the ionosphere can reflect radio waves. The geometric mean of the phase velocity and the group velocity cannot exceed \"c\", so when the phase velocity goes above \"c\", the group velocity must go below it.\nIn 1925, Americans Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve first mapped the Heaviside layer's variations in altitude. The ITU standard model of absorption and reflection of radio waves by the Heaviside Layer was developed by the British Ionospheric physicist Louis Muggleton in the 1970s.\nEtymology.\nAround 1910, William Eccles proposed the name \"Heaviside Layer\" for the radio-wave reflecting layer in the upper atmosphere, and the name has subsequently been widely adopted. The name Kennelly\u2013Heaviside layer was proposed in 1925 to give credit to the work of Kennelly, which predated the proposal by Heaviside by several months.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Practical knots are classified by function, including hitches, bends, loop knots, and splices: a \"hitch\" fastens a rope to another object; a \"bend\" fastens two ends of a rope to each another; a \"loop knot\" is any knot creating a loop; and \"splice\" denotes any multi-strand knot, including bends and loops. A knot may also refer, in the strictest sense, to a stopper or knob at the end of a rope to keep that end from slipping through a grommet or eye. Knots have excited interest since ancient times for their practical uses, as well as their topological intricacy, studied in the area of mathematics known as knot theory.\nHistory.\nKnots and knotting have been used and studied throughout history. For example, Chinese knotting is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of Chinese folk art in the Tang and Song Dynasty (960\u20131279 AD) in China, later popularized in the Ming. Knot theory is the recent mathematical study of knots.\nKnots of ancient origin include the bottle sling, bowline, cat's paw, clove hitch, cow hitch, double fisherman's knot, eskimo bowline, figure-eight knot, fisherman's knot, half hitch, kalmyk loop, one-sided overhand bend, overhand knot, overhand loop, reef knot, running bowline, single hitch, thief knot, Turk's head knot, and two half-hitches.\nThe eleven main knots of Chinese knotting are the four-flower knot, six-flower knot, Chinese button knot, double connection knot, double coin knot, agemaki, cross knot, square knot, Plafond knot, Pan Chang knot, and the good luck knot.\nKnots of more recent origin include the friendship knot of Chinese knotting. The sheepshank knot originates from 1627 while the Western Union splice originates from the beginning of telegraphy.\nUse.\nThere is a large variety of knots, each with properties that make it suitable for a range of tasks. Some knots are used to attach the rope (or other knotting material) to other objects such as another rope, cleat, ring, or stake. Some knots are used to bind or constrict objects. Decorative knots usually bind to themselves to produce attractive patterns.\nTeaching.\nWhile some people can look at diagrams or photos and tie the illustrated knots, others learn best by watching how a knot is tied. Knot tying skills are often transmitted by sailors, scouts, climbers, canyoners, cavers, arborists, rescue professionals, stagehands, fishermen, linemen and surgeons. The International Guild of Knot Tyers is an organization dedicated to the promotion of knot tying.\nApplications.\nTruckers in need of securing a load may use a trucker's hitch, gaining mechanical advantage. Knots can save spelunkers from being buried under rock. Many knots can also be used as makeshift tools, for example, the bowline can be used as a rescue loop, and the munter hitch can be used for belaying. The diamond hitch was widely used to tie packages on to donkeys and mules.\nIn hazardous environments such as mountains, knots are very important. In the event of someone falling into a ravine or a similar terrain feature, with the correct equipment and knowledge of knots a rappel system can be set up to lower a rescuer down to a casualty and set up a hauling system to allow a third individual to pull both the rescuer and the casualty out of the ravine. Further application of knots includes developing a high line, which is similar to a zip line, and which can be used to move supplies, injured people, or the untrained across rivers, crevices, or ravines. Note the systems mentioned typically require carabiners and the use of multiple appropriate knots. These knots include the bowline, double figure eight, munter hitch, munter mule, prusik, autoblock, and clove hitch. Thus any individual who goes into a mountainous environment should have basic knowledge of knots and knot systems to increase safety and the ability to undertake activities such as rappelling.\nKnots can be applied in combination to produce complex objects such as lanyards and netting. In ropework, the frayed end of a rope is held together by a type of knot called a whipping knot. Many types of textiles use knots to repair damage. Macram\u00e9, one kind of textile, is generated exclusively through the use of knotting, instead of knits, crochets, weaves or felting. Macram\u00e9 can produce self-supporting three-dimensional textile structures, as well as flat work, and is often used ornamentally or decoratively.\nProperties.\nStrength.\nKnots weaken the rope in which they are made. When knotted rope is strained to its breaking point, it almost always fails at the knot or close to it, unless it is defective or damaged elsewhere. The bending, crushing, and chafing forces that hold a knot in place also unevenly stress rope fibers and ultimately lead to a reduction in strength. The exact mechanisms that cause the weakening and failure are complex and are the subject of continued study. Special fibers that show differences in color in response to strain are being developed and used to study stress as it relates to types of knots.\nRelative knot strength, also called knot efficiency, is the breaking strength of a knotted rope in proportion to the breaking strength of the rope without the knot. Determining a precise value for a particular knot is difficult because many factors can affect a knot efficiency test: the type of fiber, the style of rope, the size of rope, whether it is wet or dry, how the knot is dressed before loading, how rapidly it is loaded, whether the knot is repeatedly loaded, and so on. The efficiency of common knots ranges between 40 and 80% of the rope's original strength.\nIn most situations forming loops and bends with conventional knots is far more practical than using rope splices, even though the latter can maintain nearly the rope's full strength. Prudent users allow for a large safety margin in the strength of rope chosen for a task due to the weakening effects of knots, aging, damage, shock loading, etc. The working load limit of a rope is generally specified with a significant safety factor, up to 15:1 for critical applications. For life-threatening applications, other factors come into play.\nSecurity.\nEven if the rope does not break, a knot may still fail to hold. Knots that hold firm under a variety of adverse conditions are said to be more secure than those that do not.\nThe following sections describe the main ways that knots fail to hold.\nSlipping.\nThe load creates tension that pulls the rope back through the knot in the direction of the load. If this continues far enough, the working end passes into the knot and the knot unravels and fails. This behavior can worsen when the knot is repeatedly strained and let slack, dragged over rough terrain, or repeatedly struck against hard objects such as masts and flagpoles.\nEven with secure knots, slippage may occur when the knot is first put under real tension. This can be mitigated by leaving plenty of rope at the working end outside of the knot, and by dressing the knot cleanly and tightening it as much as possible before loading. Sometimes, the use of a stopper knot or, even better, a backup knot can prevent the working end from passing through the knot; but if a knot is observed to slip, it is generally preferable to use a more secure knot. Life-critical applications often require backup knots to maximize safety.\nCapsizing.\nTo capsize (or spill) a knot is to change its form and rearrange its parts, usually by pulling on specific ends in certain ways. When used inappropriately, some knots tend to capsize easily or even spontaneously. Often the capsized form of the knot offers little resistance to slipping or unraveling. A reef knot, when misused as a bend, can capsize dangerously.\nSometimes a knot is intentionally capsized as a method of tying another knot, as with the \"lightning method\" of tying a bowline. Some knots, such as the carrick bend, are generally tied in one form then capsized to obtain a stronger or more stable form.\nSliding.\nIn knots that are meant to grip other objects, failure can be defined as the knot moving relative to the gripped object. While the knot itself is not untied, it ceases to perform the desired function. For instance, a simple rolling hitch tied around a railing and pulled parallel to the railing might hold up to a certain tension, then start sliding. Sometimes this problem can be corrected by working-up the knot tighter before subjecting it to load, but usually the problem requires either a knot with more wraps or a rope of different diameter or material.\nReleasability.\nKnots differ in the effort required to untie them after loading. Knots that are very difficult to untie, such as the water knot, are said to \"jam\" or be jamming knots. Knots that come untied with less difficulty, such as the Zeppelin bend, are referred to as \"non-jamming\".\nA bight is any curved section, slack part, or loop between the ends of a rope, string, or yarn.\nAs a ropeworker's term, \"bitter end\" refers to the end of a rope that is tied off. In British nautical usage, the bitter end is the ship end of the anchor cable, secured by the anchor bitts and the bitter pin in the cable locker under the forecastle. At anchor, the more anchor line that is payed out, the better the anchor's hold. In a storm, if the anchor drags, ships will pay out more and more anchor line until they reach the \"bitter end.\" At this point, they can only hope the anchor holds, hence the expression \"hanging on to the bitter end\". (A \"bitt\" is a metal block with a crosspin for tying lines to, also found on piers.) Also, the working end.\nA curve narrower than a bight but with separate ends.\nTwo crossing points created by an extra twist in a loop or a circle.\nThe standing end is the longer end of the rope not involved in the knot, often shown as unfinished. It is often (but not always) the end of the rope under load after the knot is complete. For example, when a clove hitch ties a boat to a pier, the end going to the boat is the \"standing end\".\nSection of line between knot and the standing end (seen above).\nA turn or single turn is a curve with crossed legs.\nA round turn is the complete encirclement of an object; requires two passes.\nTwo round turns circles the object twice; requires three passes.\nThe active end of a line used in making the knot. May also be called the \"running end\", \"live end\", or \"tag end\".\nSection of line between knot and the working end.\nKnot categories.\nThe list of knots is extensive, but common properties allow for a useful system of categorization. For example, \"loop\" knots share the attribute of having some kind of an anchor point constructed on the standing end (such as a loop or overhand knot) into which the working end is easily hitched, using a round turn. An example of this is the bowline. \"Constricting\" knots often rely on friction to cinch down tight on loose bundles; an example is the Miller's knot. Knots may belong to more than one category.\nTrick knots.\nTrick knots are knots that are used as part of a magic trick, a joke, or a puzzle. They are useful for these purposes because they have a deceptive appearance, being easier or more difficult to tie or untie than their appearance would suggest. The easiest trick knot is the slip knot. Other noted trick knots include:\nCoxcombing.\nCoxcombing is a decorative knotwork performed by sailors during the Age of Sail.\nThe general purpose was to dress-up, protect, or help identify specific items and parts of ships and boats.\nIt is still found today in some whippings and wrappings of small diameter line on boat tillers and ships' wheels to enhance the grip, or to identify rudder amidships.\nKnots used in coxcombing include Turk's head knot, Flemish, French whipping, and others.\nKnot theory.\nKnot theory is a branch of topology. It deals with the mathematical analysis of knots, their structure and properties, and with the relationships between different knots. However, it does not take into account the role of friction in knots; in fact, no satisfactory general theory of knots that takes into account friction exists. \nIn topology, a knot is a figure consisting of a single loop with any number of crossing or knotted elements: a closed curve in space which may be moved around so long as its strands never pass through each other. As a closed loop, a mathematical knot has no proper ends, and cannot be undone or untied; however, any physical knot in a piece of string can be thought of as a mathematical knot by fusing the two ends. A configuration of several knots winding around each other is called a \"link\". Various mathematical techniques are used to classify and distinguish knots and links. For instance, the Alexander polynomial associates certain numbers with any given knot; these numbers are different for the trefoil knot, the figure-eight knot, and the unknot (a simple loop), showing that one cannot be moved into the other (without strands passing through each other).\nPhysical theory of friction knots.\nA simple mathematical theory of hitches has been proposed by Bayman and extended by Maddocks and Keller. It makes predictions that are approximately correct when tested empirically. No similarly successful theory has been developed for knots in general.\nKnot tying.\nKnot tying consists of the techniques and skills employed in tying a knot in rope, nylon webbing, or other articles. The proper tying of a knot can be the difference between an attractive knot and a messy one, and occasionally life and death. It is important to understand the often subtle differences between what works, and what does not. For example, many knots \"spill\" or pull through, particularly if they are not \"backed up,\" usually with a single or double overhand knot to make sure the end of the rope does not make its way through the main knot, causing all strength to be lost.\nDifficulty.\nThe tying of a knot may be very straightforward (such as with an overhand knot), or it may be more complicated, such as a monkey's fist knot. Tying knots correctly requires an understanding of the type of material being tied (string, cord, monofilament line, kernmantle rope, or nylon webbing). For example, cotton string may be very small and easy to tie with much internal friction to keep it from falling apart once tied, while stiff 5/8\" thick kernmantle rope will be very difficult to tie, and may be so slick as to tend to come apart once tied.\nMaterial.\nThe form of the material will influence the tying of a knot as well. Rope is round in cross-section, and has little dependence upon the manner in which the material is tied. Nylon webbing, on the other hand, is flat, and usually \"tubular\" in construction, meaning that it is spiral-woven, and has a hollow core. In order to retain as much of the strength as possible with webbing, the material must be tied \"flat\" such that parallel sections do not cross, and that the sections of webbing are not twisted when they cross each other within a knot.\nThe crossing of strands is important when dealing with round rope in other knots; for example, the figure-eight loop loses strength when strands are crossed while the knot is being \"finished\" and tightened. Moreover, the standing end or the end from which the hauling will be done must have the greater radius of curvature in the finished knot to maximize the strength of the knot.\nTools.\nTools are sometimes employed in the finishing or untying of a knot, such as a fid, a tapered piece of wood that is often used in splicing. With the advent of wire rope, many other tools are used in the tying of \"knots.\" However, for cordage and other non-metallic appliances, the tools used are generally limited to sharp edges or blades such as a sheepsfoot blade, occasionally a fine needle for proper whipping of laid rope, a hot cutter for nylon and other synthetic fibers, and (for larger ropes) a shoe for smoothing out large knots by rolling them on the ground.\nUse by animals.\nThe hagfish is known to strip slime from its skin by tying itself into a simple overhand knot, and moving its body to make the knot travel toward the tail. It also uses this action in reverse (tail to head) to pry out flesh after biting into a carcass.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The only extant species in the genus \"Orcinus\", it is recognizable by its distinct pigmentation; being mostly black on top, white on the bottom and having recognizable white eye patches. A cosmopolitan species, it inhabits a wide range of marine environments, from Arctic to Antarctic regions to tropical seas, but is more commonly documented in temperate or cooler coastal waters. Scientists have proposed dividing the global population into races, subspecies, or possibly even species.\nOrcas are apex predators with a diverse diet. Individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey, including bony fish, sharks, rays, and marine mammals such as seals, dolphins, and whales. They are highly social, with some populations forming stable matrilineal family groups (pods). Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, often unique to specific groups and passed down from generation to generation, are considered to be manifestations of animal culture. The most studied populations are off the west coast of North America, which include fish-eating \"residents\", mammal-eating \"transients\", and offshores.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the orca's conservation status as data deficient as multiple orca types may represent distinct species. Some local populations are threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), captures for marine parks, and conflicts with fisheries. In late 2005, the southern resident orcas were added to the U.S. Endangered Species list.\nOrcas have been revered by indigenous peoples while Western cultures have historically feared them. They have been taken by whalers when stocks of larger species have declined. The orca's image took a positive turn in the 1960s, due to greater public and scientific awareness and their display in captivity. Since then, orcas have been trained to perform in marine parks, a practice that has been criticized as unethical. Orcas rarely pose a threat to humans, and no fatal attack has been recorded in the wild. However, captive orcas have injured or killed their handlers in marine theme parks.\nNaming.\nOrcas are often referred to as \"killer whales\" because ancient sailors saw them hunt larger whales. Since the 1960s, the term \"orca\" has increasingly replaced \"killer whale\" in common usage.\nAlthough some sources suggest that \"Orcinus\" means 'of the kingdom of the dead', the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) mentions that the name orca originates from the Latin word \"orca\", meaning 'a large-bellied pot.' \"Orcinus\" is a derived form created by adding a masculine suffix to it. Ancient Romans originally used \"orca\" (pl. \"orcae\") for these animals, possibly borrowing Ancient Greek (\"\u00f3ryx\"), which was used for various whale species potentially including the narwhal.\nThey are sometimes referred to as 'blackfish', a term also used for other cetaceans. Historically, 'grampus' was another name for the species, though it is now rarely used. This usage should not be confused with the genus \"Grampus\", which includes only Risso's dolphin (\"Grampus griseus\").\nTaxonomy.\n\"Orcinus orca\" is the only extant species recognized in the genus \"Orcinus\" and one of many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of \"Systema Naturae\". Conrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of an orca in his \"Piscium &amp; aquatilium animantium natura\" of 1558, part of the larger \"Historia animalium\", based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.\nThe orca is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The orca lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale, and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences indicates that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus \"Orcaella\". However, a more recent (2018) study places the orca as a sister taxon to the Lissodelphininae, a clade that includes \"Lagenorhynchus\" and \"Cephalorhynchus\". In contrast, a 2019 phylogenetic study found the orca to be the second most basal member of the Delphinidae, with only the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (\"Leucopleurus acutus\") being more basal.\nTypes.\nThe three to five types of orcas may be distinct enough to be considered different races, subspecies, or possibly even species (see Species problem). The IUCN reported in 2008, \"The taxonomy of this genus is clearly in need of review, and it is likely that \"O. orca\" will be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years.\" Although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different orca groups complicates simple differentiation into types, research off the west coast of North America has identified fish-eating \"residents\", mammal-eating \"transients\" and \"offshores\". Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish and mammal eating orcas have been distinguished elsewhere. Mammal-eating orcas in different regions were long thought likely to be closely related, but genetic testing has refuted this hypothesis.\nA 2024 study supported the elevation of Eastern North American resident and transient orcas as distinct species, \"O. ater\" and \"O. rectipinnus\" respectively. The Society for Marine Mammalogy declined to recognize the two species, citing uncertainty as to whether the types constituted unique species or subspecies. \"Pending a more complete global review and revision\", the Society provisionally recognized them as subspecies \"Orcinus orca ater\" and \"O. o. rectipinnus\", with \"O. o. orca\" as the nominate subspecies.\nFour types have been documented in the Antarctic, Types A\u2013D. Two dwarf species, named \"Orcinus nanus\" and \"Orcinus glacialis\", were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status. Complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups (types B and C) should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. A 2019 study of Type D orcas also found them to be distinct from other populations and possibly even a unique species.\nCharacteristics.\nOrcas are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from long and weigh in excess of . Females are smaller, generally ranging from and weighing about . Orcas may attain larger sizes as males have been recorded at and females at . Large males can reach a weight of over , large females can reach a weight of over . Calves at birth weigh about and are about long. The skeleton of the orca is typical for an oceanic dolphin, but more robust. They can also reach speeds of up to \nWith their distinctive pigmentation, adult orcas are rarely confused with any other species. When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with false killer whales or Risso's dolphins. The orca is mostly black but with sharply bordered white areas. The entire lower jaw is white and from here, the colouration stretches across the underside to the genital area; narrowing and expanding some, and extending into lateral flank patches close to the end. The tail fluke (fin) is also white on the underside, while the eyes have white oval-shaped patches behind and above them, and a grey or white \"saddle patch\" exists behind the dorsal fin and across the back. Males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas. In newborns, the white areas are yellow or orange coloured. Antarctic orcas may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Some Antarctic orcas are brown and yellow due to diatoms in the water. Both albino and melanistic orcas have been documented.\nOrca pectoral fins are large and rounded, resembling paddles, with those of males significantly larger than those of females. Dorsal fins also exhibit sexual dimorphism, with those of males about high, more than twice the size of the female's, with the male's fin more like an elongated isosceles triangle, whereas the female's is more curved. In the skull, adult males have longer lower jaws than females, as well as larger occipital crests. The snout is blunt and lacks the beak of other species. The orca's teeth are very strong, and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The firm middle and back teeth hold prey in place, while the front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward to protect them from powerful jerking movements.\nOrcas have good eyesight above and below the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in the water by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family. The mean body temperature of the orca is . Like most marine mammals, orcas have a layer of insulating blubber ranging from thick beneath the skin. The pulse is about 60 heartbeats per minute when the orca is at the surface, dropping to 30 beats/min when submerged.\nAn individual orca can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of orcas to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into life cycles and social structures.\nRange and habitat.\nOrcas are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their enormous range, numbers, and density, relative distribution is difficult to estimate, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments. Areas which serve as major study sites for the species include the coasts of Iceland, Norway, the Vald\u00e9s Peninsula of Argentina, the Crozet Islands, New Zealand and parts of the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska. Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of orcas (&gt;0.40 individuals per 100\u00a0km2) in the northeast Atlantic around the Norwegian coast, in the north Pacific along the Aleutian Islands, the Gulf of Alaska and in the Southern Ocean off much of the coast of Antarctica. They are considered \"common\" (0.20\u20130.40 individuals per 100\u00a0km2) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland and the Faroe Islands.\nIn the Antarctic, orcas range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. However, orcas are merely seasonal visitors to Arctic waters, and do not approach the pack ice in the summer. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. Occasionally, orcas swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented up the Columbia River in the United States. They have also been found in the Fraser River in Canada and the Horikawa River in Japan.\nMigration patterns are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been sighted from southern Alaska to central California.\nPopulation.\nWorldwide population estimates are uncertain, but recent consensus suggests a minimum of 50,000 (2006). Local estimates include roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250\u20132,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500\u20131,500 off Norway. Japan's Fisheries Agency estimated in the 2000s that 2,321 orcas were in the seas around Japan.\nFeeding.\nOrcas are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called \"wolves of the sea\", because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Orcas hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles. Different populations or ecotypes may specialize, and some can have a dramatic impact on prey species. However, whales in tropical areas appear to have more generalized diets due to lower food productivity. Orcas spend most of their time at shallow depths, but occasionally dive several hundred metres depending on their prey. On average, an orca eats each day.\nFish.\nFish-eating orcas prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish's autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. Salmon account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents' diet, particularly Chinook salmon which make up 65% of the salmon eaten by orcas. Chum salmon are also eaten, but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item. Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. While salmon are usually hunted by an individual whale or a small group, herring are often caught using carousel feeding: the orcas force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, stunning or killing up to 15 fish at a time, then eating them one by one. Carousel feeding has been documented only in the Norwegian orca population, as well as some oceanic dolphin species.\nIn New Zealand, sharks and rays appear to be important prey, including eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks, basking sharks, and shortfin makos. With sharks, orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. In other parts of the world, orcas have preyed on broadnose sevengill sharks, whale sharks, and even great white sharks. Competition between orcas and white sharks is probable in regions where their diets overlap. The arrival of orcas in an area can cause white sharks to flee and forage elsewhere. Orcas appear to target the liver of sharks.\nMammals and birds.\nOrcas are sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals. They are recorded to prey on other cetacean species, usually smaller dolphins and porpoises such as common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins, dusky dolphins, harbour porpoises and Dall's porpoises. While hunting these species, orcas usually have to chase them to exhaustion. For highly social species, orca pods try to separate an individual from its group. Larger groups have a better chance of preventing their prey from escaping, which is killed by being thrown around, rammed and jumped on. Arctic orcas may attack beluga whales and narwhals stuck in pools enclosed by sea ice, the former are also driven into shallower water where juveniles are grabbed. By contrast, orcas appear to be wary of pilot whales, which have been recorded to mob and chase them. Nevertheless, possible predation on long-finned pilot whales has been recorded in Iceland, and one study suggests short-finned pilot whales are among Caribbean orcas' prey. Killer whales have been recorded attacking short-finned pilot whales in Peru as well.\nOrcas also prey on larger species such as sperm whales, grey whales, humpback whales and minke whales. On three separate occasions in 2019 orcas were recorded to have killed blue whales off the south coast of Western Australia, including an estimated individual. Large whales require much effort and coordination to kill and orcas often target calves. A hunt begins with a chase followed by a violent attack on the exhausted prey. Large whales often show signs of orca attack via tooth rake marks. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. There is also evidence that humpback whales will defend against or mob orcas who are attacking either humpback calves or juveniles as well as members of other species.\nPrior to the advent of industrial whaling, great whales may have been the major food source for orcas. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided orcas by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating the availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for orcas, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to the decline of these as well.\nOther marine mammal prey includes seal species such as harbour seals, elephant seals, California sea lions, Steller sea lions, South American sea lions and walruses. Often, to avoid injury, orcas disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. In steeply banked beaches off Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands, orcas feed on South American sea lions and southern elephant seals in shallow water, even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behaviour, and can require years of practice for the young. Orcas can then release the animal near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. In the Antarctic, type B orcas hunt Weddell seals and other prey by \"wave-hunting\". They \"spy-hop\" to locate them resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other orcas lie in wait.\nIn the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to orca predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in seal populations, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling. Orcas have been observed preying on terrestrial mammals, such as moose swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Orca cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One orca was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident orcas have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason. Some dolphins recognize resident orcas as harmless and remain in the same area.\nOrcas do consume seabirds but are more likely to kill and leave them uneaten. Penguin species recorded as prey in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters include gentoo penguins, chinstrap penguins, king penguins and rockhopper penguins. Orcas in many areas may prey on cormorants and gulls. A captive orca at Marineland of Canada discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.\nBehaviour.\nDay-to-day orca behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Orcas frequently engage in surface behaviour such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings. Resident orcas swim alongside porpoises and other dolphins.\nOrcas will engage in surplus killing, that is, killing that is not designed to be for food. As an example, a BBC film crew witnessed orcas in British Columbia playing with a male Steller sea lion to exhaustion, but not eating it.\nSome orcas have been observed swimming with dead salmon on their heads, resembling hats.\nSocial structure.\nOrcas have complex societies. Only elephants and higher primates live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas' complex social bonds, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep them in captivity.\nResident orcas in the eastern North Pacific live in particularly complex and stable social groups. Unlike any other known mammal social structure, resident whales live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. The permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has only been recorded once, in the case of an orca named Luna.\nClosely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The highest association layer is the community, which consists of pods that regularly associate with each other but share no maternal relations or dialects.\nTransient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become \"rovers\" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.\nAs with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating orcas off Norway have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating orcas in Argentina and the Crozet Islands behave more like transients.\nOrcas of the same sex and age group may engage in physical contact and synchronous surfacing. These behaviours do not occur randomly among individuals in a pod, providing evidence of \"friendships\".\nVocalizations.\nLike all cetaceans, orcas depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.\nNortheast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, which are insensitive to orca calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear whale calls well and thus transients are typically silent. Vocal behaviour in these whales is mainly limited to surfacing activities and milling (slow swimming with no apparent direction) after a kill.\nAll members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with pod members. Family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation growing over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.\nDialects also distinguish types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore orcas have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.\nNorwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting. A population that live in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica have 28 complex burst-pulse and whistle calls.\nIntelligence.\nOrcas have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals (after sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). Orcas have more gray matter and more cortical neurons than any mammal, including humans. They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring \"intelligence\" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans. Orcas imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed. In March 2023, a female orca was spotted with a newborn pilot whale in Sn\u00e6fellsnes.\nPeople who have interacted closely with orcas offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan orcas have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. The tactic worked initially, but the orcas adapted quickly and split into groups.\nIn other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild orcas playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.\nIn 2025, one of the Salish Sea orcas was observed tearing off strands of bull kelp and rolling them around its body. This was the first observation of a killer whale using tools. Scientists called this behavior \"allokelping.\"\nThe orca's use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of animal culture.\nLuke Rendell, in an article in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\", writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (\"Orcinus orca\") appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties.\"\nLife cycle.\nFemale orcas begin to mature at around the age of 10\u201313 and reach peak fertility around 20, experiencing periods of polyestrous cycling separated by non-cycling periods of three to 16 months. Females can often breed until age 40, followed by a rapid decrease in fertility. Orcas are among the few animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. The lifespans of wild females average 50 to 80 years. Some are claimed to have lived substantially longer: Granny (J2) was estimated by some researchers to have been as old as 105 years at the time of her death, though a biopsy sample indicated her age as 65 to 80 years. One of the oldest living orcas is Ocean Sun (identified as L25), a Southern Resident Orca, who is estimated to be more than years old. It is thought that orcas held in captivity tend to have shorter lives than those in the wild, although this is subject to scientific debate.\nMales mate with females from other pods, which prevents inbreeding. Gestation varies from 15 to 18 months. Mothers usually calve a single offspring about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life, when 37\u201350% of all calves die. Weaning begins at about 12 months of age, and is complete by two years. According to observations in several regions, all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young.\nMales sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia, which would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010. The oldest male in Scottish waters is John Coe (identified as W001), estimated to be years old, while a male in Puget Sound named Harbeson (identified as T087) is thought to be around years old. Orcas are unique among cetaceans, as their caudal sections elongate with age, making their heads relatively shorter.\nInfanticide, once thought to occur only in captive orcas, was observed in wild populations by researchers off British Columbia on December 2, 2016. In this incident, an adult male killed the calf of a female within the same pod, with the adult male's mother also joining in the assault. It is theorized that the male killed the young calf in order to mate with its mother (something that occurs in other carnivore species), while the male's mother supported the breeding opportunity for her son. The attack ended when the calf's mother struck and injured the attacking male. Such behaviour matches that of many smaller dolphin species, such as the bottlenose dolphin. However, forced mating by males appears to be rare in killer whales.\nConservation.\nIn 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the orca's conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more orca types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are the most significant worldwide threats. In January 2020, the first orca in England and Wales since 2001 was found dead with a large fragment of plastic in its stomach.\nLike other animals at the highest trophic levels, the orca is particularly at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbour seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in orcas were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. A 2018 study published in \"Science\" found that global orca populations are poised to dramatically decline due to such toxic pollution.\nIn the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. In the Puget Sound region, only 75 whales remain with few births over the last few years. On the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.\nIn 2005, the United States government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live mostly in the Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past 10 years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.\nScientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied orcas since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm orcas. He studied orcas from the Center for Whale Research, located in Friday Harbor, Washington. He was also able to study orcas from \"his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months\". In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the orcas. The whales seemed \"agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water\" to escape the sound of the sonars. \"Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate distant, Balcomb said.\" The impact of sonar waves on orcas is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and CAT scans of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.\nAnother conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along with their habitats) for orcas aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming orcas were facing threats along the British Columbia Coast including increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population, and the federal government did nothing to protect them.\nUnderwater noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key orca habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Orcas also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs orcas along with other marine mammals. Orcas are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behaviour, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.\nThe \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill adversely affected orcas in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local orcas. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.\nOrcas are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning international trade (including in parts/derivatives) is regulated.\nRelationship with humans.\nIndigenous cultures.\nThe Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast feature orcas throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded orcas as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of orcas living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these stories, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka'wakw, the orca was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka'wakw mythology, orcas may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the orca as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.\nThe Lummi consider orca to be people, referring to them as \"qwe'lhol'mechen\" which means \"our relations under the waves\".\nThe Maritime Archaic people of Newfoundland also had great respect for orcas, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial at the Port au Choix Archaeological Site.\nIn the tales and beliefs of the Siberian Yupik people, orcas are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as orcas in summer. Orcas are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, as does a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco or meat are strewn into the sea for them.\nThe Ainu people of Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, and southern Sakhalin often referred to orcas in their folklore and myth as \"Repun Kamuy\" (God of Sea/Offshore) to bring fortunes (whales) to the coasts, and there had been traditional funerals for stranded or deceased orcas akin to funerals for other animals such as brown bears.\nAttacks by wild orcas on humans and animals.\nIn Western cultures, orcas were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written description of an orca was given by Pliny the Elder \"circa\" AD 70, who wrote, \"Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other kinds of whale]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming.\" (see citation in section \"Naming\", above).\nOf the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild orcas, none have been fatal. In one instance, orcas tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the orca's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, but the orca then retreated, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbour seals was bumped by an orca that apparently misidentified him as prey.\nOrca attacks on sailboats and small vessels.\nBeginning around 2020, one or more pods of orcas began to attack sailing vessels off the southern tip of Europe, and a few were sunk. At least 15 interactions between orcas and boats off the Iberian coast were reported in 2020. According to the Atlantic Orca Working Group (GTOA) as many as 500 vessels have been damaged between 2020 and 2023. In one video, an orca can be seen biting on one of the two rudders ripped from a catamaran near Gibraltar. The captain of the vessel reported this was the second attack on a vessel under his command and the orcas focused on the rudders. \"Looks like they knew exactly what they are doing. They didn't touch anything else.\" After an orca repeatedly rammed a vessel off the coast of Norway in 2023, there is a concern the behavior is spreading to other areas. This has led to recommendations that sailors now carry bags of sand. Dropping sand into the water near the rudder is thought to confuse the sonar signal. Experts were divided as to whether the behavior was some sort of revenge or protection response to a previous traumatic incident, or playful or frustrated attempts to get a boat's propeller to emit a stream of high-speed water.\nAttacks on humans by captive orcas.\nUnlike wild orcas, captive orcas have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, some of which have been fatal.\nHuman attacks on orcas.\nCompetition with fishermen also led to orcas being regarded as pests. In the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of orcas was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the orcas captured in Puget Sound for aquariums through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of orcas in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine guns, rockets, and depth charges.\nModern Western attitudes.\nWestern attitudes towards orcas have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, orcas came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the live-capture and display of an orca known as Moby Doll, a southern resident orca harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. He was the first ever orca to be studied at close quarters alive, not postmortem. Moby Doll's impact in scientific research at the time, including the first scientific studies of an orca's sound production, led to two articles about him in the journal \"Zoologica\". So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, non-aggressive whale who made no attempts to attack humans.\nBetween 1964 and 1976, 50 orcas from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother\u2013offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.\nBigg's techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.\nThe public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale\u2013keeping in aquariua. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in orcas has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film \"Free Willy\", the movie's captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland in 2002. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. Keiko however did not adapt to the harsh climate of the Arctic Ocean, and died a year into his release after contracting pneumonia, at the age of 27. In 2002, the orphan Springer was discovered in Puget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behaviour and social structure of the region's orcas. The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young orca named Luna, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.\nWhaling.\nThe earliest known records of commercial hunting of orcas date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored orcas because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, orcas were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 orcas (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between the late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Extensive hunting of orcas, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979\u201380 alone, prompted the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, orcas were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.\nCooperation with humans.\nOrcas have helped humans hunting other whales. One well-known example was the orcas of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.\nWhale watching.\nWhale watching continues to increase in popularity, but may have some problematic impacts on orcas. Exposure to exhaust gases from large amounts of vessel traffic is causing concern for the overall health of the 75 remaining southern resident orcas (SRKWs) left as of early 2019. This population is followed by approximately 20 vessels for 12 hours a day during the months May\u2013September. Researchers discovered that these vessels are in the line of sight for these whales for 98\u201399.5% of daylight hours. With so many vessels, the air quality around these whales deteriorates and impacts their health. Air pollutants that bind with exhaust fumes are responsible for the activation of the cytochrome P450 1A gene family. Researchers have successfully identified this gene in skin biopsies of live whales and also the lungs of deceased whales. A direct correlation between activation of this gene and the air pollutants can not be made because there are other known factors that will induce the same gene. Vessels can have either wet or dry exhaust systems, with wet exhaust systems leaving more pollutants in the water due to various gas solubility. A modelling study determined that the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) of exhaust pollutants was about 12% of the human dose.\nAs a response to this, in 2017 boats off the British Columbia coast now have a minimum approach distance of 200 metres compared to the previous 100 metres. This new rule complements Washington State's minimum approach zone of 180 metres that has been in effect since 2011. If a whale approaches a vessel it must be placed in neutral until the whale passes. The World Health Organization has set air quality standards in an effort to control the emissions produced by these vessels.\nCaptivity.\nThe orca's intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.\nOrganizations such as World Animal Protection and Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60\u201390% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. That said, a 2015 study coauthored by staff at SeaWorld and the Minnesota Zoo suggested no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive orcas. However, in the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70\u201380 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50\u201360 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild orca behaviour, see above. Wild orcas may travel up to in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Between 1991 and 2010, the bull orca known as Tilikum was involved in the death of three people, and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film \"Blackfish\". Tilikum lived at SeaWorld from 1992 until his death in 2017.\nIn March 2016, SeaWorld announced that they would be ending their orca breeding program and their theatrical shows. However, as of 2025, theatrical shows featuring orcas are still ongoing.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1963, he was revealed to be a member of the Cambridge Five, a spy ring that had divulged British secrets to the Soviets during World War II and in the early stages of the Cold War. Of the five, Philby is widely considered to have been the most successful in providing secret information to the Soviets.\nBorn in British India, Philby was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1934, while he was studying at Cambridge. After leaving Cambridge, Philby worked as a journalist, covering the Spanish Civil War and the Battle of France. In 1940, he began working for the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6). By the end of the Second World War he had become a high-ranking member.\nIn 1949, Philby was appointed first secretary to the British Embassy in Washington and served as chief British liaison with American intelligence agencies. During his career as an intelligence officer, he passed large amounts of intelligence to the Soviet Union, including the Albanian Subversion, a scheme to overthrow the pro-Soviet government of Communist Albania.\nPhilby was suspected of tipping off two other spies under suspicion of Soviet espionage, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, both of whom subsequently fled to Moscow in May 1951. Under suspicion himself, Philby resigned from MI6 in July 1951 but was publicly exonerated by then-Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan in 1955. He resumed his career as both a journalist and a spy for MI6 in Beirut, but was forced to defect to Moscow after finally being unmasked as a Soviet agent in 1963. Philby lived in Moscow until his death in 1988.\nEarly life.\nKim Philby was born in Ambala, Punjab, British India, to author and explorer St John Philby and his wife, Dora Johnston. A member of the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at the time of Philby's birth, St John later became a civil servant in Mesopotamia and advisor to King Ibn Sa'ud of Saudi Arabia.\nNicknamed \"Kim\" after the boy-spy in Rudyard Kipling's novel \"Kim\", Philby attended Aldro preparatory school, an all-boys school located in Shackleford, Surrey. In his early teens, he spent some time with the Bedouin in the Arabian desert. Following in the footsteps of his father, Philby continued to Westminster School, which he left in 1928 at age 16. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read history and economics. He graduated in 1933 with a 2:1 degree.\nAt Cambridge, Philby exhibited a \"leaning towards communism\", in the words of his father, who went on to write: \"The only serious question is whether Kim definitely intended to be disloyal to the government while in its service\". One of the first things Philby did in Cambridge was join the Cambridge University Socialist Society, attending their meetings but taking little part in their proceedings. However, following the Labour Party's defeat in the 1931 general election, he took a more active role in the society and served as its treasurer in 1932 and 1933.\nUpon Philby's graduation, Maurice Dobb, a tutor in economics at Trinity, introduced him to the World Federation for the Relief of the Victims of German Fascism, an organization based in Paris, which attempted to aid victims of Nazi Germany and provide education on oppositions to fascism. The organization was one of several fronts operated by German communist Willi M\u00fcnzenberg, a member of the Reichstag who had fled to France in 1933.\nCommunism and recruitment.\nWhile working to aid German refugees in Vienna, Philby met Litzi Friedmann (born Alice Kohlmann), a young Austrian communist of Hungarian Jewish origins. Philby admired the strength of her political convictions and later recalled that at their first meeting:\nA frank and direct person, Litzi came out and asked me how much money I had. I replied \u00a3100, which I hoped would last me about a year in Vienna. She made some calculations and announced, \"That will leave you an excess of \u00a325. You can give that to the International Organisation for Aid for Revolutionaries. We need it desperately.\" I liked her determination. \nPhilby acted as a courier between Vienna and Prague, paying for the train tickets out of his remaining \u00a375 and using his British passport to evade suspicion. He also delivered clothes and money to refugees. Following the Austrofascist victory in the Austrian Civil War, Philby and Friedmann married in February 1934, enabling her to escape to the United Kingdom with him two months later.\nIt is possible that it was a Viennese-born friend of Friedmann's in London, Edith Tudor Hart\u2013herself, at this time, a Soviet agent\u2013who first approached Philby about the possibility of working for Soviet intelligence. In early 1934 Arnold Deutsch, another Soviet agent, was sent to University College London under the cover of a research appointment, but in reality had been assigned to recruit the brightest students from Britain's top universities. Philby had come to the Soviets' notice earlier that year in Vienna, where he had been involved in demonstrations against the government of Engelbert Dollfuss. In June 1934, Deutsch recruited Philby to the Soviet intelligence services. Philby later recalled:\nLizzy came home one evening and told me that she had arranged for me to meet a \"man of decisive importance\". I questioned her about it but she would give me no details. The rendezvous took place in Regents Park. The man described himself as Otto. I discovered much later from a photograph in MI5 files that the name he went by was Arnold Deutsch. I think that he was of Czech origin; about 5\u00a0ft 7in, stout, with blue eyes and light curly hair. Though a convinced Communist, he had a strong humanistic streak. He hated London, adored Paris, and spoke of it with deeply loving affection. He was a man of considerable cultural background.\"\nPhilby recommended to Deutsch several of his Cambridge contemporaries, including Donald Maclean, who at the time was working in the Foreign Office, as well as Guy Burgess, despite his personal reservations about Burgess' erratic personality.\nJournalism.\nIn London, Philby began a career as a journalist. He took a job at a monthly magazine, the \"World Review of Reviews\", for which he wrote a large number of articles and letters (sometimes under a variety of pseudonyms) and occasionally served as \"acting editor\". Meanwhile, Philby and Friedmann separated. They remained friends for many years following their separation and divorced only in 1946, following the end of the Second World War. When the Germans threatened to overrun Paris in 1940, where she was living at the time, Philby arranged for Friedmann's escape to Britain.\nIn 1936, Philby began working at a failing trade magazine, the \"Anglo-Russian Trade Gazette\", as editor. After the magazine's owner changed the paper's role to covering Anglo-German trade, Philby engaged in a concerted effort to make contact with Germans such as Joachim von Ribbentrop, at that time the German ambassador in London. He became a member of the Anglo-German Fellowship, an organization aiming at rebuilding and supporting a friendly relationship between Germany and the United Kingdom. The Anglo-German Fellowship, at this time, was supported both by the British and German governments, and Philby made many trips to Berlin.\nIn February 1937, Philby travelled to Spain, then embroiled in a bloody civil war triggered by the \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" of Falangist forces under General Francisco Franco against the government of President Manuel Aza\u00f1a. Philby worked at first as a freelance journalist; from May 1937, he served as a first-hand correspondent for \"The Times\", reporting from the headquarters of the pro-Franco forces in Seville. He also began working for both the Soviet and British intelligence, which usually consisted of posting letters in a crude code to a fictitious girlfriend, Mlle Dupont in Paris, for the Soviets. He used a simpler system for MI6, delivering post at Hendaye, France, for the British embassy in Paris. When visiting Paris after the war, he was shocked to discover that the address that he used for Mlle Dupont was that of the Soviet embassy. His controller in Paris, a Latvian national named Ozolin-Haskins (code name Pierre), was shot in Moscow in 1937 during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. His successor, Boris Bazarov, suffered the same fate two years later.\nBoth the British and the Soviets were interested in analyzing the combat performance of the new Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter planes and Panzer I and Panzer II tanks deployed with Falangist forces in Spain. Philby told the British, after a direct question to Franco, that German troops would never be permitted to cross Spain to attack Gibraltar. Philby's Soviet controller at the time, Theodore Maly, reported in April 1937 to the NKVD that he had personally briefed Philby on the need \"to discover the system of guarding Franco and his entourage\". Maly was one of the Soviet Union's most powerful and influential illegal controllers and recruiters. With the goal of potentially arranging Franco's assassination, Philby was instructed to report on vulnerable points in Franco's security and recommend ways to gain access to him and his staff. However, such an act was never a real possibility; upon debriefing Philby in London on 24 May 1937, Maly wrote to the NKVD, \"Though devoted and ready to sacrifice himself, [Philby] does not possess the physical courage and other qualities necessary for this [assassination] attempt.\"\nIn December 1937, during the Battle of Teruel, a Republican shell hit just in front of the car in which Philby was travelling along with correspondents Edward J. Neil of the Associated Press, Bradish Johnson of \"Newsweek\" and Ernest Sheepshanks of Reuters. Johnson was killed outright, and Neil and Sheepshanks soon died of their injuries. Philby suffered only a minor head wound. As a result of this accident, Philby, who was well-liked by the Nationalist forces whose victories he trumpeted, was awarded the Red Cross of Military Merit by Franco on 2 March 1938. Philby found that the award proved helpful in obtaining access to fascist circles:\n...there had been a lot of criticism of British journalists from Franco officers who seemed to think that the British in general must be a lot of Communists because so many were fighting with the International Brigades. After I had been wounded and decorated by Franco himself, I became known as 'the English-decorated-by-Franco' and all sorts of doors opened to me.\nIn 1938, Walter Krivitsky (born Samuel Ginsberg), a former GRU officer in Paris who had defected to France the previous year, travelled to the United States and published an account of his time in \"Stalin's secret service\". He testified before the Dies Committee (later to become the House Un-American Activities Committee) regarding Soviet espionage within the US. In 1940 he was interviewed by MI5 officers in London, led by Jane Archer. Krivitsky claimed that two Soviet intelligence agents had penetrated the Foreign Office and that a third Soviet intelligence agent had worked as a journalist for a British newspaper in Spain. No connection with Philby was made at the time, and Krivitsky was found shot in a Washington hotel room the following year.\nAlexander Orlov (born Lev Feldbin; code-name Swede), Philby's controller in Madrid, who had once met him in France, also defected. To protect his family, still living in the Soviet Union, Orlov said nothing about Philby, an agreement Stalin respected. On a short trip back from Spain, Philby tried to recruit Flora Solomon as a Soviet agent; she was the daughter of a Russian banker and gold dealer, a relative of the Rothschilds and wife of a London stockbroker. At the same time, Burgess was trying to get her into MI6. But the \"rezident\" (Russian term for spymaster) in France, probably Pierre at this time, suggested to Moscow that he suspected Philby's motives. Solomon introduced Philby to the woman who would become Philby's second wife, Aileen Furse. Solomon went to work for the British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer.\nBritish intelligence career.\nWorld War II.\nIn July 1939, Philby returned to \"The Times\" office in London. When Britain declared war on Nazi Germany in September 1939, Philby's contact with his Soviet controllers was lost and he failed to attend the meetings that were necessary for his work. During the Phoney War from September 1939 until the Dunkirk evacuation, Philby worked as \"The Times\"' first-hand correspondent with the British Expeditionary Force headquarters. After being evacuated from Boulogne on 21 May, he returned to France in mid-June and began representing \"The Daily Telegraph\" in addition to \"The Times\". He briefly reported from Cherbourg and Brest, sailing for Plymouth less than 24 hours before France surrendered to Germany in June 1940.\nIn 1940, on the recommendation of Burgess, Philby joined MI6's Section D, a secret organisation charged with investigating how enemies might be attacked through non-military means. Philby and Burgess ran a training course for would-be saboteurs at Brickendonbury Manor in Hertfordshire. His time at Section D, however, was short-lived; the \"tiny, ineffective, and slightly comic\" section was soon absorbed by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in the summer of 1940. Burgess was arrested in September for drunken driving and was subsequently fired, while Philby was appointed as an instructor on clandestine propaganda at the SOE's finishing school for agents at the Estate of Lord Montagu in Beaulieu, Hampshire.\nPhilby's role as an instructor of sabotage agents again brought him to the attention of the Soviet Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU). This role allowed him to conduct sabotage and instruct agents on how to properly conduct sabotage. The new London \"rezident\", Ivan Chichayev (code-name Vadim), re-established contact and asked for a list of British agents being trained to enter the Soviet Union. Philby replied that none had been sent and that none was undergoing training at that time. This statement was underlined twice in red and marked with two question marks, clearly indicating confusion and questioning of this, by disbelieving staff at Moscow Central in the Lubyanka, according to Genrikh Borovik, who saw the telegrams much later in the KGB archives.\nPhilby provided Stalin with advance warning of Operation Barbarossa and of the Japanese intention to strike into southeast Asia instead of attacking the Soviet Union as Adolf Hitler had urged. The first was ignored as a provocation, but the second, when confirmed by the Russo-German journalist and spy Richard Sorge in Tokyo, contributed to Stalin's decision to begin transporting troops from the Far East in time for the counteroffensive around Moscow.\nBy September 1941, Philby began working for Section Five of MI6, a section responsible for offensive counter-intelligence. On the strength of his knowledge and experience of Franco's Spain, he was put in charge of the subsection that dealt with Spain and Portugal. This entailed responsibility for a network of undercover operatives in several cities such as Madrid, Gibraltar, Lisbon and Tangier. At this time, the German \"Abwehr\" was active in Spain, particularly around the British naval base of Gibraltar, which its agents hoped to watch with many detection stations to track Allied supply ships in the Western Mediterranean. Thanks to British counter-intelligence efforts, of which Philby's Iberian subsection formed a significant part, the project (Abwehr code-name \"Bodden\") never came to fruition.\nDuring 1942\u201343, Philby's responsibilities were then expanded to include North Africa and Italy, and he was made the deputy head of Section Five under Major Felix Cowgill, an army officer seconded to SIS. In early 1944, as it became clear that the Soviet Union was likely to once more prove a significant adversary to Britain, SIS re-activated Section Nine, which dealt with anti-communist efforts. In late 1944 Philby, on instructions from his Soviet handler, maneuvered through the system successfully to replace Cowgill as head of Section Nine. Charles Arnold-Baker, an officer of German birth (born Wolfgang von Blumenthal) working for Richard Gatty in Belgium and later transferred to the Norwegian/Swedish border, voiced many suspicions of Philby and his intentions but was repeatedly ignored.\nWhile working in Section Five, Philby had become acquainted with James Jesus Angleton, a young American counter-intelligence officer working in liaison with SIS in London. Angleton, later chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Counterintelligence Staff, became suspicious of Philby when he failed to pass on information relating to a British agent executed by the Gestapo in Germany. It later emerged that the agent\u2014known as Schmidt\u2014had also worked as an informant for the \"Rote Kapelle\" organisation, which sent information to both London and Moscow. Nevertheless, Angleton's suspicions went unheard.\nIn late summer 1943, the SIS provided the GRU an official report on the activities of German agents in Bulgaria and Romania, soon to be liberated by the Soviet Union. The NKVD complained to Cecil Barclay, the SIS representative in Moscow, that information had been withheld. Barclay reported the complaint to London. Philby claimed to have overheard discussion of this by chance and sent a report to his controller. This turned out to be identical with Barclay's dispatch, convincing the NKVD that Philby had seen the full Barclay report. A similar lapse occurred with a report from the Japanese embassy in Moscow sent to Tokyo. The NKVD received the same report from Sorge but with an extra paragraph claiming that Hitler might seek a separate peace with the Soviet Union. These lapses by Philby aroused intense suspicion in Moscow.\nElena Modrzhinskaya at GUGB headquarters in Moscow assessed all material from the Cambridge Five. She noted that they produced an extraordinary wealth of information on German war plans but next to nothing on the repeated question of British penetration of Soviet intelligence in either London or Moscow. Philby had repeated his claim that there were no such agents. She asked, \"Could the SIS really be such fools they failed to notice suitcase-loads of papers leaving the office? Could they have overlooked Philby's Communist wife?\" Modrzhinskaya concluded that all were double agents, working essentially for the British.\nA more serious incident occurred in August 1945, when Konstantin Volkov, an NKVD agent and vice-consul in Istanbul, requested political asylum in Britain for himself and his wife. For a large sum of money, Volkov offered the names of three Soviet agents inside Britain, two of whom worked in the Foreign Office and a third who worked in counterintelligence in London. Philby was given the task of dealing with Volkov by British intelligence. He warned the Soviets of the attempted defection and travelled to Istanbul\u2014ostensibly to handle the matter on behalf of SIS but, in reality, to ensure that Volkov had been neutralised. By the time he arrived in Turkey, three weeks later, Volkov had been removed to Moscow.\nThe intervention of Philby in the affair and the subsequent capture of Volkov by the Soviets might have seriously compromised Philby's position. Volkov's defection had been discussed with the British embassy in Ankara on telephones which turned out to have been tapped by Soviet intelligence. Volkov had insisted that all written communications about him take place by bag rather than by telegraph, causing a delay in reaction that might plausibly have given the Soviets time to uncover his plans. Philby was thus able to evade blame and detection.\nA month later Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk in Ottawa, took political asylum in Canada and gave the Royal Canadian Mounted Police names of agents operating within the British Empire that were known to him. When Jane Archer (who had interviewed Krivitsky) was appointed to Philby's section he moved her off investigatory work in case she became aware of his past. He later wrote \"she had got a tantalising scrap of information about a young English journalist whom the Soviet intelligence had sent to Spain during the Civil War. And here she was plunked down in my midst!\"\nYears after the war, Sir Hardy Amies, who had served as an intelligence officer, recalled that Philby was in his mess and on being asked what the infamous spy was like, Hardy quipped, \"He was always trying to get information out of me\u2014most significantly the name of my tailor\". Philby, \"employed in a Department of the Foreign Office\", was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1946.\nIstanbul.\nIn February 1947, Philby was appointed head of British intelligence for Turkey and posted to Istanbul with his second wife, Aileen, and their family. His public position was that of First Secretary at the British Consulate; in reality, his intelligence work required overseeing British agents and working with the Turkish security services.\nPhilby planned to infiltrate five or six groups of \u00e9migr\u00e9s into Soviet Armenia or Soviet Georgia, but efforts among the expatriate community in Paris produced just two recruits. Turkish intelligence took them to a border crossing into Georgia but soon afterwards shots were heard. Another effort was made using a Turkish gulet for a seaborne landing, but it never left port. Philby was implicated in a similar campaign in Communist Albania. Colonel David Smiley, an aristocratic Guards officer who had helped Enver Hoxha and his communist guerillas to liberate Albania, now prepared to remove Hoxha. He trained Albanian commandos\u2014some of whom were former Nazi collaborators\u2014in Libya or Malta. From 1947, they infiltrated the southern mountains to build support for former King Zog.\nThe first three missions, overland from Greece, were trouble-free. Larger numbers were landed by sea and air under Operation Valuable, which continued until 1951, increasingly under the influence of the newly formed CIA. Stewart Menzies, head of SIS, disliked the idea, which was promoted by former SOE men now in SIS. Most infiltrators were caught by the Sigurimi, the Albanian Security Service. Clearly there had been leaks and Philby was later suspected as one of the leakers. His own comment was, \"I do not say that people were happy under the regime but the CIA underestimated the degree of control that the Authorities had over the country.\" Philby later wrote of his attitude towards the operation in Albania:\nThe agents we sent into Albania were armed men intent on murder, sabotage and assassination ... They knew the risks they were running. I was serving the interests of the Soviet Union and those interests required that these men were defeated. To the extent that I helped defeat them, even if it caused their deaths, I have no regrets.\nPhilby's wife had suffered from psychological problems since childhood which caused her to inflict injuries upon herself. In 1948, troubled by Philby's heavy drinking and frequent depressions and his life in Istanbul, she experienced a breakdown, staging an accident and injecting herself with urine and insulin to cause skin disfigurations. She was sent to a clinic in Switzerland to recover. Upon her return to Istanbul in late 1948, she was badly burned in an incident with a charcoal stove and returned to Switzerland. Shortly afterward, Philby was moved to the job as chief SIS representative in Washington, with his family.\nWashington, D.C..\nIn September 1949, the Philbys arrived in the United States. Officially, his post was that of First Secretary to the British Embassy; in reality, he served as chief British intelligence representative in Washington. His office oversaw a large amount of urgent and top secret communications between Washington and London. Philby was also responsible for liaising with the CIA and promoting \"more aggressive Anglo-American intelligence operations\". A leading figure within the CIA was Philby's wary former colleague, James Jesus Angleton, with whom he once again found himself working closely. Angleton remained suspicious of Philby but lunched with him every week in Washington.\nA more serious threat to Philby's position had come to light. During the summer of 1945, a Soviet cipher clerk had reused a one-time pad to transmit intelligence traffic. This mistake made it possible to break the normally impregnable code. Contained in the traffic (intercepted and decrypted as part of the Venona project) was information that documents had been sent to Moscow from the British embassy in Washington. The intercepted messages revealed that the embassy source (identified as \"Homer\") travelled to New York City to meet his Soviet contact twice a week. Philby had been briefed on the situation shortly before reaching Washington in 1949; it was clear to Philby that the agent was Maclean, who worked in the embassy at the time and whose wife, Melinda, lived in New York. Philby had to help discover the identity of \"Homer\", but also wished to protect Maclean.\nIn January 1950, on evidence provided by the Venona intercepts, Soviet atomic spy Klaus Fuchs was arrested. His arrest led to others: Harry Gold, a courier with whom Fuchs had worked, David Greenglass, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The investigation into the embassy leak continued and the stress of it was exacerbated by the arrival in Washington, in October 1950, of Burgess\u2014Philby's unstable and dangerously alcoholic fellow spy.\nBurgess, who had been given a post as Second Secretary at the British Embassy, took up residence in the Philby family home and rapidly set about causing offence to all and sundry. Philby's wife resented him and disliked his presence; Americans were offended by his \"natural superciliousness\" and \"utter contempt for the whole pyramid of values, attitudes, and courtesies of the American way of life\". J. Edgar Hoover complained that Burgess used British embassy automobiles to avoid arrest when he cruised Washington in pursuit of homosexual encounters. His dissolution had a troubling effect on Philby; the morning after a particularly disastrous and drunken party, a guest returning to collect his car heard voices upstairs and found \"Kim and Guy in the bedroom drinking champagne. They had already been down to the Embassy but being unable to work had come back\".\nBurgess' presence was awkward for Philby, yet it was potentially dangerous for Philby to leave him unsupervised. The situation in Washington was tense. From April 1950, Maclean had been the prime suspect in the investigation into the embassy leak. Philby had undertaken to devise an escape plan that would warn Maclean, in England, of the intense suspicion he was under and arrange for him to flee. Burgess had to get to London to warn Maclean, who was under surveillance. In early May 1951, Burgess got three speeding tickets in a single day\u2014then pleaded diplomatic immunity, causing an official complaint to be made to the British ambassador. Burgess was sent back to England, where he met Maclean in his London club.\nThe SIS planned to interrogate Maclean on 28 May 1951. On 23 May, concerned that Maclean had not yet fled, Philby wired Burgess, ostensibly about his Lincoln convertible that had been abandoned in the embassy car park. \"If he did not act at once it would be too late\", the telegram read, \"because [Philby] would send his car to the scrap heap. There was nothing more [he] could do.\" On 25 May, Burgess drove Maclean from his home at Tatsfield, Surrey, to Southampton, where both boarded the steamship \"Falaise\" to France and then proceeded to Moscow.\nPublic denials.\nBurgess had intended to aid Maclean in his escape, not accompany him in it. The \"affair of the missing diplomats\", as it was referred to before Burgess and Maclean surfaced in Moscow, attracted a great deal of public attention, and Burgess' disappearance, which identified him as complicit in Maclean's espionage, deeply compromised Philby's position. Under a cloud of suspicion raised by his highly visible and intimate association with Burgess, Philby returned to London. There, he underwent MI5 interrogation aimed at ascertaining whether he had acted as a \"third man\" in Burgess and Maclean's spy ring. In July 1951, Philby resigned from MI6, preempting his all-but-inevitable dismissal.\nEven after his departure from MI6, suspicion towards Philby continued. Interrogated repeatedly regarding his intelligence work and his connection with Burgess, he continued to deny that he had acted as a Soviet agent. From 1952, Philby struggled to find work as a journalist, eventually\u2014in August 1954\u2014accepting a position with a diplomatic newsletter called the \"Fleet Street Letter\". Lacking access to material of value and out of touch with Soviet intelligence, he all but ceased to operate as a Soviet agent.\nOn 25 October 1955, following revelations in \"The New York Times\", Labour MP Marcus Lipton used parliamentary privilege to ask Prime Minister Anthony Eden if he was determined \"to cover up at all costs the dubious third man activities of Mr Harold Philby...\" This was reported in the British press, leading Philby to threaten legal action against Lipton if he repeated his accusations outside Parliament. Lipton later withdrew his comments. This retraction came about when Philby was officially cleared by Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan on 7 November. The minister told the House of Commons, \"I have no reason to conclude that Mr. Philby has at any time betrayed the interests of his country, or to identify him with the so-called 'Third Man', if indeed there was one.\" Following this, Philby gave a press conference in his mother's London flat in which\u2014calmly, confidently, and without the stammer he had struggled with since childhood\u2014he reiterated his innocence, declaring, \"I have never been a communist.\"\nReturn to journalism.\nAfter being exonerated, Philby was no longer employed by MI6 and Soviet intelligence lost all contact with him. In August 1956 he was sent to Beirut as a Middle East correspondent for \"The Observer\" and \"The Economist\". There, his journalism served as cover for renewed work for MI6. He wrote under his own name and under the pen name \"Charles Garner\" when writing about subjects he considered too \"fluffy\"(distasteful), for example the subject of Arab slave girls.\nIn Lebanon, Philby at first lived in Mahalla Jamil, his father's large household located in the village of Ajaltoun, just outside Beirut. Following the departure of his father and stepbrothers for Saudi Arabia, he continued to live alone in Ajaltoun, but took a flat in Beirut after beginning an affair with Eleanor Brewer, the wife of \"New York Times\" correspondent Sam Pope Brewer. Following the death of his second wife in 1957 and Eleanor's subsequent divorce from Brewer, the two were married in London in 1959 and set up house together in Beirut. From 1960, Philby's formerly marginal work as a journalist became more substantial and he frequently travelled throughout the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait and Yemen.\nDefection to Russia.\nIn 1961, Anatoliy Golitsyn, a major in the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, defected to the United States from his diplomatic post in Helsinki. Golitsyn offered the CIA revelations of Soviet agents within American and British intelligence services. Following his debriefing in the US, Golitsyn was sent to SIS for further questioning. The head of MI6, Dick White, only recently transferred from MI5, had suspected Philby as the \"third man\". Golitsyn proceeded to confirm White's suspicions about Philby's role. Nicholas Elliott, an MI6 officer recently stationed in Beirut who was a friend of Philby's and had previously believed in his innocence, was tasked with attempting to secure his full confession.\nIt is unclear whether Philby had been alerted, but Eleanor noted that as 1962 wore on, expressions of tension in his life \"became worse and were reflected in bouts of deep depression and drinking\". She recalled returning home to Beirut from a sight-seeing trip in Jordan to find Philby \"hopelessly drunk and incoherent with grief on the terrace of the flat\", mourning the death of a little pet fox that had fallen from the balcony. When Elliott met Philby in late 1962, the first time since Golitsyn's defection, he found Philby too drunk to stand and with a bandaged head; he had fallen repeatedly and cracked his skull on a bathroom radiator, requiring stitches.\nPhilby told Elliott that he was \"half expecting\" to see him. Elliott confronted him, saying, \"I once looked up to you, Kim. My God, how I despise you now. I hope you've enough decency left to understand why.\" Prompted by Elliott's accusations, Philby confirmed the charges of espionage and described his intelligence activities on behalf of the Soviets. However, when Elliott asked him to sign a written statement, he hesitated and requested a delay in the interrogation. Another meeting was scheduled to take place in the last week of January. It has since been suggested that the whole confrontation with Elliott had been a charade to convince the KGB that Philby had to be brought back to Moscow, where he could serve as a British penetration agent of Moscow Central.\nOn the evening of 23 January 1963, Philby vanished from Beirut, failing to meet his wife for a dinner party at the home of Glencairn Balfour Paul, First Secretary at the British Embassy: Paul and his wife Marnie had a close friendship with the Philbys. The \"Dolmatova\", a Soviet freighter bound for Odessa, had left Beirut that morning so abruptly that cargo was left scattered over the docks; Philby claimed that he left Beirut on board this ship, a claim backed by Balfour Paul. The defection of Philby, given their close friendship, was to cause Balfour Paul - as a prominent diplomat - considerable discomfort, not least when Philby published a list of 'British spies in the Middle East' in Pravda with Balfour Paul's name at the top. Balfour Paul considered this a joke on Philby's part, and 'a singularly bad one'. Balfour Paul himself noted that Philby had likely been apprised of British suspicions of his role as a double agent by 'Fourth Man' Anthony Blunt, who had travelled to Beirut in December 1962 ostensibly in search of a rare frog orchid.\nBalfour Paul was to remember Philby as, '...an unforgiveable traitor to his country, responsible among much else for the assassination by his Soviet associates of many brave men. All that I can say is that in the half of him I knew (the most deceitful half, of course) he was a most enjoyable friend.' Balfour Paul also noted that he had never once seen Philby drunk, despite his reputation during his time in Lebanon as being a frequent and hard drinker. That view of Philby was not shared by Balfour Paul's contemporary, Alan Munro who recalled Philby and Eleanor kept '...a hospitable establishment in the Rue Kantara and are rarely to be found sober.' \nIt was not until 1 July 1963 that Philby's flight to Moscow was officially confirmed. On 30 July, Soviet officials announced that they had granted him political asylum in the Soviet Union, along with Soviet citizenship. When the news broke, MI6 came under criticism for failing to anticipate and block Philby's defection, though Elliott was to claim he could not have prevented Philby's flight. Journalist Ben Macintyre, author of several works on espionage, speculated that MI6 might have left open the opportunity for Philby to flee to Moscow to avoid an embarrassing public trial. Philby himself thought this might have been the case.\nMoscow.\nUpon his arrival in Moscow in January 1963, Philby discovered that he was not a colonel in the KGB, as he had been led to believe. He was paid 500 roubles a month (the average Soviet salary in 1960 was Rbls\u00a080.60 a month and Rbls\u00a0122 in 1970) and his family was not immediately able to join him in exile. Philby was under virtual house arrest and under guard, with all visitors screened by the KGB. It was ten years before he was given a minor role in the training of KGB recruits. Mikhail Lyubimov, his closest KGB contact, explained that this was to guard his safety, but later admitted that the real reason was the KGB's fear that Philby would return to London.\nSecret files released to the National Archives in late 2020 indicated that the British government had intentionally conducted a campaign to keep Philby's spying confidential \"to minimise political embarrassment\" and prevent the publication of his memoirs, according to a report by \"The Guardian\". Nonetheless, the information was publicized in 1967 when he granted an interview to Murray Sayle of \"The Times\" in Moscow. Philby confirmed that he had worked for the KGB and that \"his purpose in life was to destroy imperialism\".\nIn Moscow, Philby occupied himself by writing his memoirs, which were published in Britain in 1968 under the title \"My Silent War\"; they were not published in the Soviet Union until 1980. In the book, Philby says that his loyalties were always with the communists; he considered himself not to have been a double agent but \"a straight penetration agent working in the Soviet interest\". Philby continued to read \"The Times\", which was not generally available in the USSR, listened to the BBC World Service and was an avid follower of cricket.\nPhilby's award of the Order of the British Empire was cancelled and annulled in 1965. Though he claimed publicly in January 1988 that he did not regret his decisions and that he missed nothing about England except some friends, Colman's mustard and Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce, his wife Rufina Ivanovna Pukhova later described Philby as \"disappointed in many ways\" by what he found in Moscow. \"He saw people suffering too much\", but he consoled himself by arguing that \"the ideals were right but the way they were carried out was wrong. The fault lay with the people in charge.\" Pukhova said, \"he was struck by disappointment, brought to tears. He said, 'Why do old people live so badly here? After all, they won the war.'\" Philby's drinking and depression continued; according to Rufina, he had attempted suicide by slashing his wrists sometime in the 1960s.\nPhilby found work in the early 1970s in the KGB's Active Measures Department churning out fabricated documents. Working from genuine unclassified and public CIA or US State Department documents, Philby inserted \"sinister\" paragraphs regarding US plans. The KGB would stamp the documents \"top secret\" and begin their circulation. For the Soviets, Philby was an invaluable asset, ensuring the correct use of idiomatic and diplomatic English phrases in their disinformation efforts.\nPersonal life.\nIn February 1934, Philby married Litzi Friedmann, an Austrian Jewish communist whom he had met in Vienna. They subsequently moved to Britain; however, as Philby assumed the role of a fascist sympathiser, they separated. Litzi lived in Paris before returning to London for the duration of the war; she ultimately settled in East Germany.\nWhile working as a correspondent in Spain, Philby began an affair with Frances Doble, Lady Lindsay-Hogg, an actress and aristocratic divorc\u00e9e who was an admirer of Franco and Hitler. They travelled together in Spain through August 1939.\nIn 1940, Philby began living with Aileen Furse in London. Their first three children, Josephine, John and Tommy, were born between 1941 and 1944. In 1946, Philby arranged a divorce from Litzi. He and Aileen were married on 25 September 1946, while Aileen was pregnant with their fourth child, Miranda. Their fifth child, Harry George, was born in 1950. Aileen suffered from psychiatric problems, which grew more severe during the period of poverty and suspicion following the flight of Burgess and Maclean. She lived separately from Philby, settling with their children in Crowborough while he lived first in London and later in Beirut. Weakened by alcoholism and frequent illness, she died of influenza in December 1957. Through his son John, Philby's granddaughter is the author Charlotte Philby.\nIn 1956, Philby began an affair with Eleanor Brewer, the wife of \"New York Times\" correspondent Sam Pope Brewer. Following Eleanor's divorce, the couple married in January 1959. After Philby defected in 1963, Eleanor visited him in Moscow. In November 1964, after a visit to the US, she returned, intending to settle permanently. In her absence, Philby had begun an affair with Donald Maclean's wife, Melinda. He and Eleanor divorced and she departed Moscow in May 1965. Melinda left Maclean and briefly lived with Philby in Moscow. In 1968, she returned to Maclean.\nIn 1971, Philby married Rufina Pukhova, a 39-year-old Russo-Polish woman, with whom he lived until his death on 11 May 1988, aged 76, in Moscow.\nDeath.\nIn a Moscow hospital on 11 May 1988 Kim Philby died of heart failure. (Rumors of suicide were based purely on a famous line of his, \"A true secret agent only shoots [a gun] once in his life - when he has no other way out.\") He was \"buried with the honours of a KGB General.\" Rufina Ivanovna Pukhova, his fourth wife, told a reporter that Philby was \"disillusioned with Communism by the end of his life, tortured by his failings, and drank himself to death.\"\nPosthumous awards.\nThe USSR posthumously awarded numerous Soviet medals to Philby:\nMotivation.\nIn a 1981 videoed lecture to Stasi agents, the East German intelligence agency, Philby attributed the failure of British intelligence to unmask him as due in great part to these things: the British class system\u2014it was inconceivable that one \"born into the ruling class of the British Empire\" would be a traitor; the amateurish and incompetent nature of the British organisation; and because so many in MI6 had so much to lose if he was proven to be a spy. He had the policy of never confessing; a document in his own handwriting was dismissed as a forgery.\nPhilby said that at the time of his recruitment as a spy there were no prospects of him being useful; he was instructed to make his way into the Secret Service, which took years, starting with journalism and building up contacts in the British establishment. He said that there was no discipline there; he made friends with the archivist, which enabled him for years to take secret documents home, many unrelated to his own work, and bring them back the next day; his handler photographed them overnight.\nWhen he was instructed to remove and replace his boss, Felix Cowgill, he asked if it was proposed \"to shoot him or something\" but was told to use bureaucratic intrigue. He said: \"It was a very dirty story\u2014but after all our work does imply getting dirty hands from time to time but we do it for a cause that is not dirty in any way.\" Commenting on his sabotage of the operation to secretly send thousands of anti-communists into Albania to overthrow the communist government, Philby defended his actions by saying that he had helped prevent another world war.\nFictional and non-fictional representations.\nKim Philby has been the subject of several books, films and television series, including \"A Spy Among Friends\" (2022) and \"\" (2014). Philby's granddaughter Charlotte Philby wrote her fourth novel \"Edith and Kim\" (2022) about her grandfather.\nPhilby is a main character in Frederick Forsyth's 1984 novel \"The Fourth Protocol\", and a lesser role in the 1987 film based on the novel. He is the initial instigator and later patron of the plan to smuggle parts of an atomic bomb into the UK.\nIrish blues guitarist Rory Gallagher has a song, \"Philby\", on his \"Top Priority\" (1979) record.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17013", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17013", "title": "Kamacite", "text": "Alloy of iron and nickel found in meteorites\nKamacite is an alloy of iron and nickel, which is found on Earth only in meteorites. According to the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) it is considered a proper nickel-rich variety of the mineral native iron. The proportion iron:nickel is between 90%:10% and 95%:5%; small quantities of other elements, such as cobalt or carbon may also be present. The mineral has a metallic luster, is gray and has no clear cleavage although its crystal structure is isometric-hexoctahedral. Its density is about 8\u00a0g/cm3 and its hardness is 4 on the Mohs scale. It is also sometimes called balkeneisen.\nThe name was coined in 1861 and is derived from the Greek root \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba-\" \"kamak\" or \"\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03be\" \"kamaks\", meaning vine-pole. It is a major constituent of iron meteorites (octahedrite and hexahedrite types). In the octahedrites it is found in bands interleaving with taenite forming Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns. In hexahedrites, fine parallel lines called Neumann lines are often seen, which are evidence for structural deformation of adjacent kamacite plates due to shock from impacts.\nAt times kamacite can be found so closely intermixed with taenite that it is difficult to distinguish them visually, forming plessite. The largest documented kamacite crystal measured .\nPhysical properties.\nKamacite has many unique physical properties including Thomson structures and extremely high density.\nIdentification.\nKamacite is opaque, and its surface generally displays varying shades of gray streaking, or \"quilting\" patterns. Kamacite has a metallic luster. Kamacite can vary in hardness based on the extent of shock it has undergone, but commonly ranks a four on the mohs hardness scale. Shock increases kamacite hardness, but this is not 100% reliable in determining shock histories as there are myriad other reasons that the hardness of kamacite could increase.\nKamacite has a measured density of . It has a massive crystal habit but normally individual crystals are indistinguishable in natural occurrences. There are no planes of cleavage present in kamacite which gives it a hackly fracture. Kamacite is magnetic, and isometric which makes it behave optically isometrically.\nKamacite occurs with taenite and a mixed area of kamacite and taenite referred to as plessite.\nTaenite contains more nickel (12 to 45\u00a0wt. % Ni) than kamacite (which has 5 to 12\u00a0wt. % Ni). The increase in nickel content causes taenite to have a face-centered unit cell, whereas kamacite's higher iron content causes its unit cell to be body centered. This difference is caused by nickel and iron having a similar size but different interatomic magnetic and quantum interactions.\nTetragonal phase.\nThere is evidence of a tetragonal phase, observed in X-ray powder tests and later under a microscope. When tested two meteorites gave d-values that could \"be indexed on the basis of a tetragonal unit cell, but not on the basis of a cubic or hexagonal unit cell\". It has been speculated to be e-iron, a hexagonal polymorph of iron.\nThomson structures.\nThomson structures, usually referred to as Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns, are textures often seen in meteorites that contain kamacite. These are bands which are usually alternating between kamacite and taenite. In 1804, William Thomson stumbled upon these structures when he noticed unexpected geometric patterns after cleaning a specimen with nitric acid (HNO3). He published his observations in a French journal but due to the Napoleonic wars the English scientists, who were doing much of the meteorite research of the time, never discovered his work. It was not until 1808, four years later, that the same etching patterns were discovered by Count Alois von Beck Widmanst\u00e4tten who was heating iron meteorites when he noticed geometric patterns caused by the differing oxidation rates of kamacite and taenite. Widmanst\u00e4tten told many of his colleagues about these patterns in correspondence leading to them being referred to as Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns in most literature.\nThomson structures or Widmanst\u00e4tten patterns are created as the meteorite cools; at high temperatures both iron and nickel have face-centered lattices. When the meteorite is formed it starts out as entirely molten taenite (greater than 1500\u00a0\u00b0C) and as it cools past 723\u00a0\u00b0C the primary metastable phase of the alloy changes into taenite and kamacite begins to precipitate out. It is in this window where the meteorite is cooling below 723\u00a0\u00b0C where the Thomson structures form and they can be greatly affected by the temperature, pressure, and composition of the meteorite.\nOptical properties.\nKamacite is opaque and can be observed only in reflected light microscopy. It is isometric and therefore behaves isotropically.\nMagnetism.\nAs the meteorite cools below 750\u00a0\u00b0C iron becomes magnetic as it moves into the kamacite phase. During this cooling the meteorite takes on non-conventional thermoremanent magnetization. Thermoremanent magnetization on Earth gives iron minerals formed in the Earth's crust, a higher magnetization than if they were formed in the same field at room temperature. This is a non-conventional thermoremanent magnetization because it appears to be due to a chemical remanent process which is induced as taenite is cooled to kamacite. What makes this especially interesting is this has been shown to account for all of the ordinary chondrites magnetic field which has been shown to be as strong as 0.4 oersted (symbol Oe).\nCrystallography.\nKamacite is an isometric mineral with a body cubic centered unit cell. Kamacite is usually not found in large crystals; however the anomalously largest kamacite crystal found and documented measured 92\u00d754\u00d723 centimeters. Even with large crystals being so rare, crystallography is extremely important to understand plays an important role in the formation of Thomson structures.\nSymmetry.\nKamacite forms isometric, hexoctahedral crystals this causes the crystals to have many symmetry elements. Kamacite falls under the 4/m32/m class in the Hermann\u2013Mauguin notation meaning it has three fourfold axes, four threefold axes, and six twofold axes and nine mirror planes. Kamacite has a space group of Fm3m.\nUnit cell.\nKamacite is made up of a repeating unit of \u03b1-(Fe, Ni), Fe0.9Ni0.1, which makes up cell dimensions of a = 8.603\u00a0\u00c5, Z = 54\u00a0\u00c5; V = 636.72\u00a0\u00c53. The interatomic magnetic and quantum interactions of the zerovalent iron (metallic Fe0) atoms interacting with each other causes kamacite to have a body centered lattice.\nChemistry.\nFormula and dominant elements.\nKamacite is made up of a repeating unit of \u03b1-(Fe, Ni), Fe0.9Ni0.1, in which both iron and nickel have the valence zero (Fe0 and Ni0) as they are metallic native elements commonly found in iron meteorites. Besides trace elements, it is normally considered to be made up of 90% iron and 10% nickel but can have a ratio of 95% iron and 5% nickel. This makes iron the dominant element in any sample of kamacite. It is grouped with the native elements in both Dana and Nickel-Strunz classification systems.\nConditions of formation.\nKamacite starts to form around 723\u00a0\u00b0C, where iron splits from being face centered to body centered while nickel remains face centered. To accommodate this areas start to form of higher iron concentration displacing nickel to the areas around it which creates taenite which is the nickel end member.\nTrace elements.\nThere has been a great deal of research into kamacite's trace elements. The most notable trace elements in kamacite are gallium, germanium, cobalt, copper, and chromium. Cobalt is the most notable of these where the nickel content varies from 5.26% to 6.81% and the cobalt content can be from 0.25% to 0.77%. All of these trace elements are metallic and their appearance near the kamacite taenite border can give important clues to the environment the meteorite was formed in. Mass spectrometry has revealed kamacite to contain considerable amounts of platinum to be an average of 16.31 (\u03bcg/g), iridium to be an average of 5.40 (\u03bcg/g), osmium to be an average of 3.89 (\u03bcg/g), tungsten to be an average of 1.97 (\u03bcg/g), gold to be an average of 0.75 (\u03bcg/g), and rhenium to be an average of 0.22 (\u03bcg/g). The considerable amounts of cobalt and platinum are the most notable.\nImportant minor elements, substitutions, solid solutions.\nKamacite sulfurization has been done experimentally in laboratory conditions. Sulfurization resulted in three distinct phases: a mono-sulfide solid solution (Fex(Ni,Co)1-xS), a pentlandite phase (Fex(Ni,Co)9-xS8), as well as a P-rich phase. This was done in a lab to construct conditions concurrent with that of the solar nebula. With this information it would be possible to extract information about the thermodynamic, kinetic, and physical conditions of the early solar system. This still remains speculatory as many of the sulfides in meteorites are unstable and have been destroyed. Kamacite also alters to tochilinite (Fe2+\u00b7 5-6 (Mg, Fe2+)5S6(OH)10). This is useful for giving clues as to how much the meteorite as a whole has been altered. Kamacite to tochilinite alteration can be seen in petrologic microscopes, scanning electron microscope, and electron microprobe analysis. This can be used to allow researchers to easily index the amount of alteration that has taken place in the sample. This index can be later referenced when analyzing other areas of the meteorite where alteration is not as clear.\nRelationship with taenite.\nTaenite is the nickel rich end member of the kamacite\u2013taenite solid solution. Taenite is naturally occurring on Earth whereas kamacite is only found on Earth when it comes from space. Kamacite forms taenite as it forms and expels nickel to the surrounding area, this area forms taenite. Due to the face centered nature of the kamacite lattice and the body centered nature of the nickel lattice the two make intricate angles when they come in contact with each other. These angles reveal themselves macroscopically in the Thomson structure. Also due to this relationship we get the terms ataxite, hexahedrites and octahedrite. Ataxite refers to meteorites that do not show a grossly hexahedral or octahedral structure. Meteorites composed of 6 wt% or less nickel are often referred to as hexahedrites due to the crystal structure of kamacite being isometric and causing the meteorite to be cubic. Likewise if the meteorite is dominated by the face centered taenite it is called an octahedrite as kamacite will exsolve from the octahedral crystal boundaries of taenite making the meteorite appear octahedral. Both hexahedrites and octahedrite only appear when the meteorite breaks along crystal planes or when prepared to accentuate the Thomson structures therefore many are mistakenly called ataxites ar first.\nStability range.\nKamacite is only stable at temperatures below 723\u00a0\u00b0C or 600\u00a0\u00b0C (Stacey and Banerjee, 2012), as that is where iron becomes cool enough to arrange in a body centered crystal structure. Kamacite is also only stable at low pressures as can be assumed because it only forms in the space.\nEffect of shock.\nMetallographic and X-ray diffraction can be used on kamacite to determine the shock history of a meteorite. Using hardness to determine shock histories has been experimented with but was found to be too unreliable. Vickers hardness test was applied to a number of kamacite samples and shocked meteorites were found to have values of 160\u2013170\u00a0kg/mm and non-shocked meteorites can have values as high as 244\u00a0kg/mm. Shock causes a unique iron transformation structure that is able to be measured using metallographic and X-ray diffraction techniques. After using metallographic and X-ray diffraction techniques to determine shock history it was found that 49% of meteorites found on Earth contain evidence of shock.\nGeologic occurrences.\nKamacite meteorites have been found on every continent on Earth and have also been found on Mars.\nMeteorites.\nKamacite is primarily associated with meteorites because it needs high temperatures, low pressures and few other more reactive elements like oxygen. Chondrite meteorites can be split into groups based on the chondrules present. There are three major types: enstatite chondrites, carbonaceous chondrites and ordinary chondrites. Ordinary chondrites are the most abundant type of meteorite found on Earth making up 85% of all meteorites recorded. Ordinary chondrites are thought to have all originated from three different sources thus they come in three types LL, L, and H; LL stands for Low iron, Low metal, L stands for Low iron abundance, and H is High iron content. All ordinary chondrites contain kamacite in decreasing abundance as you move from H to LL chondrites.\nKamacite is also found in many of the less common meteorites mesosiderites and E chondrites. E chondrites are chondrites which are made primarily of enstatite and only account for 2% of meteorites that fall onto the Earth. E chondrites have an entirely different source rock than that of the ordinary chondrites. In analysis of kamacite in E chondrites it was found that they contain generally less nickel than average.\nAbundance.\nSince kamacite is only formed in space and is only found on Earth in meteorites, it has very low abundance on Earth. Its abundance outside the Solar System is difficult to determine. Iron, the main component of kamacite, is the sixth most abundant element in the universe and the most abundant of those elements generally considered metallic.\nSpecific examples.\nMeteor crater Arizona.\nKamacite has been found and studied in Meteor Crater, Arizona. Meteor Crater was the first confirmed meteor impact site on the planet, and was not universally recognized as such until the 1950s. In the 1960s United States Geological Survey discovered kamacite in specimens gathered from around the site tying the mineral to meteorites.\nPlanets.\nKamacite primarily forms on meteorites but has been found on extraterrestrial bodies such as Mars. This was discovered by The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) \"Opportunity\". The kamacite did not originate on Mars but was put there by a meteorite. This was particularly of interest because the meteorite fell under the lesser known class of mesosiderites. Mesosiderites are very rare on Earth and its occurrence on Mars gives clues to the origin of its larger source rock.\nUses.\nMuseums, university and photo specimen preparation.\nDue to the rareness and the generally dull appearance of kamacite it is not popular among private collectors. However many museums and universities have samples of kamacite in their collection. Normally kamacite samples are prepared using polish and acid to show off the Thomson structures. Preparing specimens involves washing them in a solvent, such as Thomson did with nitric acid to bring out the Thomson structures. Then they are heavily polished so they look shiny. Generally the kamacite can be told apart from taenite easily as after this process the kamacite looks slightly darker than the taenite.\nLooking to the future.\nKamacite and taenite both have the potential to be economically valuable. An option that would make asteroid mining more profitable would be to gather the trace elements. One difficulty would be refining elements such as platinum and gold. Platinum is worth around 12,000 US$/kg and (kamacite contains 16.11\u00a0\u03bcg/g platinum) and gold is worth around 12,000 US$/kg (kamacite contains 0.52\u00a0\u03bcg/g gold); however the likeliness of a profitable return is fairly slim. Asteroid mining for space uses could be more practical, as transporting materials from Earth is costly. Similar to current plans of reusing the modules of the International Space Station in other missions, an iron meteorite could be used to build space craft in space. NASA has put forward preliminary plans to build a space ship in space.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It ranges from the coastal urban center to the rural Yushan Range with an area of making It the largest city in Taiwan by area. Kaohsiung City has a population of approximately 2.72 million people and is Taiwan's third most populous city and the largest city in southern Taiwan.\nFounded in the 17th century as a small trading village named Tancoia, a name of uncertain origins, the city has since grown into the economic center of southern Taiwan, with key industries such as manufacturing, steel-making, oil refining, freight transport and shipbuilding. It is classified as a \"Sufficiency\" level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, with some of the most prominent infrastructures in Taiwan. \nKaohsiung is of strategic importance to the nation as the city is the main port city of Taiwan; the Port of Kaohsiung is the largest and busiest harbor in Taiwan and more than 67% of the nation's exports and imports container throughput goes through Kaohsiung. Kaohsiung International Airport is the second busiest airport in number of passengers in Taiwan. The city is well-connected to other major cities by high speed and conventional rail, as well as several national freeways. It also hosts the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) fleet headquarters and its naval academy. More recent public works such as Pier-2 Art Center, National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts and Kaohsiung Music Center have been aimed at growing the tourism and cultural industries of the city.\nEtymology.\nHoklo immigrants to the area during the 16th and 17th centuries called the region \"Takau\" (). The surface meaning of the associated Chinese characters was \"beat the dog\". According to one theory, the name \"Takau\" originates from the indigenous Austronesian Siraya language and translates as \"bamboo forest\". According to another theory, the name evolved via metathesis from the name of the Makatao tribe, who inhabited the area at the time of European and Hoklo settlement. The Makatao is considered by some to be part of the Siraya tribe.\nDuring the Dutch colonization of southern Taiwan, the area was known as \"Tancoia\" to Europeans for a period of about three decades. In 1662, the Dutch were expelled by the Kingdom of Tungning, founded by Ming loyalists of Koxinga. His son, Zheng Jing, renamed the village \"Banlian-chiu\" () in 1664.\nThe name of \"Takau\" was restored in the late 1670s, when the town expanded drastically with immigrants from mainland China and was kept through Taiwan's cession to the Japanese Empire in 1895. In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa James W. Davidson relates that \"Takow\" was already a well-known name in English. In 1920, the name was changed to and administered the area under Takao Prefecture. While the new name had quite a different surface meaning, its pronunciation in Japanese sounded more or less the same as the old name spoken in Hokkien.\nAfter Taiwan was ceded to the Republic of China, the Chinese characters did not change, but adapted to Mandarin pronunciation, thus the official romanization became Kaohsiung (), derived from the Wade\u2013Giles romanization of the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation for .\nThe name \"Takau\" remains the official name of the city in Austronesian languages of Taiwan such as Rukai, although these are not widely spoken in the city. The name also remains popular locally in the naming of businesses, associations, and events.\nHistory.\nThe written history of Kaohsiung can be traced back to the early 17th century, through archaeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7,000 years ago. Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the Makatao people of the Siraya tribe, who settled on what they named Takau Isle (translated to \u6253\u72d7\u5dbc by Ming Chinese explorers); \"Takau\" meaning \"bamboo forest\" in the aboriginal language.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4,700\u20135,200 years ago. Most of the discovered remnants were located in the hills surrounding Kaohsiung Harbor. Artifacts were found at Shoushan, Longquan Temple, Taoziyuan, Zuoying, Houjing, Fudingjin and Fengbitou. The prehistoric Dapenkeng, Niuchouzi, Dahu, and Niaosong civilizations were known to inhabit the region. Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal Makatao civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter. Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved. Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as Hunter-gatherer societies. Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present. The pronunciation of Kaohsiung (Takao) in Japanese is similar to Takau (Takau), so the local flavor of Takao was renamed Kaohsiung.\nThe first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by Chen Di, a member of Ming admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and Penghu of pirates. In his report on the \"Eastern Barbarian Lands\" (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is unknown when the barbarians (Taiwanese aborigines) arose on this island in the ocean beyond Penghu, but they are present at Keeong Harbor (nowaday's Budai, Chiayi), the bay of Galaw (Anping, Tainan), Laydwawan (Tainan City), Yaw Harbor (Cheting, Kaohsiung), Takau Isle (Kaohsiung City), Little Tamsui (Donggang, Pingtung), Siangkeykaw (Puzi, Chiayi), Gali forest (Jiali District, Tainan), the village of Sabah (Tamsui, Taipei), and Dwabangkang (Bali, New Taipei City).\nDutch Formosa.\nTaiwan became a Dutch colony in 1624, after the Dutch East India Company was ejected from Penghu by Ming forces. At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan. The Dutch named the place \"Tankoya\", and the harbor \"Tancoia\". The Dutch missionary Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn named Takau Mountain \"Ape Berg\", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century. \"Tankoia\" was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day Anping, Tainan) by sail. At the time, a wide shallow bay existed there, sufficient for small vessels. However, constant silting changed the coastline.\nDuring this time, Taiwan was divided into five administrative districts, with Takau belonging to the southernmost district. In 1630, the first large scale immigration of Han Chinese to Taiwan began due to famine in Fujian, with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.\nQing dynasty.\nIn 1684, the Qing dynasty annexed Taiwan and renamed the town Fongshan County (), considering it a part of Taiwan Prefecture. It was first opened as a port during the 1680s and subsequently prospered fairly for generations.\nJapanese rule.\nIn 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan as part of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Administrative control of the city was moved from New Fongshan Castle to the Fongshan Sub-District of . In November 1901, twenty \"ch\u014d\" were established in total; was established nearby. In 1909, H\u014dzan Ch\u014d was abolished, and Takow was merged into Tainan Ch\u014d.\nIn 1920, during the tenure of 8th Governor-General Den Kenjir\u014d, districts were abolished in favor of prefectures. Thus the city was administered as under Takao Prefecture.\nThe Japanese developed Takao, especially the harbor that became the foundation of Kaohsiung to be a port city. Takao was then systematically modernized and connected to the end of North-South Railway. Forming a north\u2013south regional economic corridor from Taipei to Kaohsiung in the 1930s, Japan's Southward Policy set Kaohsiung to become an industrial center. Kaohsiung Harbor was also developed starting from 1894. The city center was relocated several times during the period due to the government's development strategy. Development was initially centered on \"Ki-au\" () region but the government began laying railways, upgrading the harbor, and passing new urban plans. New industries such as refinery, machinery, shipbuilding and cementing were also introduced.\nBefore and during World War II it handled a growing share of Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan, and was also a major base for Japan's campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Extremely ambitious plans for the construction of a massive modern port were drawn up. Toward the end of the war, the Japanese promoted some industrial development at Kaohsiung, establishing an aluminum industry based on the abundant hydroelectric power produced by the Sun Moon Lake project in the mountains.\nThe city was heavily bombed by Task Force 38 and FEAF during World War II between 1944 and 1945.\nRepublic of China.\nAfter control of Taiwan was handed over from Japan to the government of the Republic of China on 25 October 1945, Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County were established as a provincial city and a county of Taiwan Province respectively on 25 December 1945. The official romanization of the name came to be \"Kaohsiung\", based on the Wade\u2013Giles romanization of the Mandarin reading of the kanji name. Kaohsiung City then consisted of 10 districts, which were Gushan, Lianya (renamed \"Lingya\" in 1952), Nanzih, Cianjin, Cianjhen, Cijin, Sanmin, Sinsing, Yancheng, and Zuoying.\nDuring this time, Kaohsiung developed rapidly. The port, badly damaged in World War II, was restored. It also became a fishing port for boats sailing to Filipino and Indonesian waters. Largely because of its climate, Kaohsiung overtook Keelung as Taiwan's major port. Kaohsiung also surpassed Tainan to become the second largest city of Taiwan in the late 1970s and Kaohsiung City was upgraded from a provincial city to special municipality on 1 July 1979, by the Executive Yuan with a total of 11 districts. The additional district is Siaogang District, which was annexed from Siaogang Township of Kaohsiung County.\nThe Kaohsiung Incident, where the government suppressed a commemoration of International Human Rights Day, occurred on 10 December 1979. Since then, Kaohsiung gradually grew into a political center of the Pan-Green population of Taiwan, in opposition to Taipei where the majority population is Kuomintang supporters.\nOn 25 December 2010, Kaohsiung City merged with Kaohsiung County to form a larger special municipality with administrative centers in Lingya District and Fongshan District.\nOn 31 July 2014, a series of gas explosions occurred in the Cianjhen and Lingya Districts of the city, killing 31 and injuring more than 300. Five roads were destroyed in an area of nearly near the city center. It was the largest gas explosion in Taiwan's modern history.\nGeography.\nThe city sits on the southwestern coast of Taiwan facing the Taiwan Strait, bordering Tainan City to the northwest, Chiayi and Nantou County to the north, Taitung County to its east and Pingtung County to the south and southeast. The downtown areas are centered on Kaohsiung Harbor with Cijin Island on the other side of the harbor acting as a natural breakwater. The Love River (Ai River) flows into the harbor through the Old City and downtown. Zuoying Military Harbor lies to the north of Kaohsiung Harbor and the city center. Kaohsiung's natural landmarks include Ape Hill and Mount Banping.\nClimate.\nLocated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, Kaohsiung has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\"), near to a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Am\") with monthly mean temperatures between and relative humidity ranging between 71 and 81%.\nKaohsiung's warm climate is very much dictated by its low latitude and its exposure to warm sea temperatures year-round, with the Kuroshio Current passing by the coast of southern Taiwan, and the Central Mountain Range on the northeast blocking out the cool northeastern winds during the winter. The city, therefore, has a noticeably warmer climate than nearby cities located at similar latitudes such as Hong Kong, Guangzhou as well as various cities further south in northern Vietnam, such as Hanoi. Although the climate is classified as tropical, Kaohsiung has a defined cooler season unlike most other cities in Asia classified with this climate but located closer to the equator such as Singapore or Manila. Daily maximum temperature typically exceeds during the warmer season (April to November) and during the cooler season (December to March), with the exception when cold fronts strike during the winter months, when the daily mean temperature of the city can drop between 10 and 12\u00a0\u00b0C depending on the strength of the cold front. Also, besides the high temperatures occurring during the usual summer months, daytime temperatures of inland districts of the city can often exceed from mid-March to late April before the onset of the monsoon season, with clear skies and southwesterly airflows. Average annual rainfall is around , focused primarily from June to August. At more than 2,210 hours of bright sunshine, the city is one of the sunniest areas in Taiwan.\nThe sea temperature of Kaohsiung Harbor remains above year-round, the second highest of Southern Taiwan after Liuqiu Island. According to recent records, the average temperature of the city has risen around 1 degree Celsius over the past three decades, from about in 1983 to around by 2012.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of August 2025, Kaohsiung has a population of 2,722,984 people, making it the third-largest city after New Taipei and Taichung, and a population density of 922.47 people per square kilometer. Within the city, Fongshan District is the most populated district with a population of 354,455 people, while Sinsing District is the most densely populated district with a population density of 25,052 people per square kilometer.\nEthnic composition.\nHan Chinese.\nAs in most Taiwanese cities or counties, the majority of the population are Han Chinese. The Chinese are divided into 3 subgroups: Hoklo, Hakka, and Waishengren. The Hoklo and Waishengren mostly live in flatland townships and the city centre, while the majority of the Hakka population lives in the suburbs or rural townships of the northeastern hills.\nIndigenous peoples.\nThe indigenous peoples of Kaohsiung, who belong to various ethnic groups that speak languages belonging to the Austronesian language family, live mostly in the mountain indigenous district such as Taoyuan or Namasia. The main indigenous groups in the city include the Bunun, Rukai, Saaroa and the Kanakanavu.\nOther ethnicities.\nAs of December 2010, Kaohsiung hosts around 21,000 foreign spouses. Around 12,353 are Mainland Chinese, 4,244 are Vietnamese, around 800 are Japanese and Indonesians, and around 4,000 are other Asians or foreigners from Europe or America.\nAs of April 2013, Kaohsiung hosts 35,074 foreign workers who mainly work as factory workers or foreign maids (not including foreign specialists such as teachers and other professionals). About half of them are Indonesians, with the other half being workers from other Southeast Asian countries, mainly from Vietnam, the Philippines or Thailand.\nEconomy.\nKaohsiung is a major international port and industrial city in the southwest of Taiwan. As an exporting center, Kaohsiung serves the agricultural interior of southern Taiwan, as well as the mountains of the southeast. Major raw material exports include rice, sugar, bananas, pineapples, peanuts (groundnuts) and citrus fruits. The Linhai Industrial Park, on the waterfront, was completed in the mid-1970s and includes a steel mill, shipyard, petrochemical complex, and other industries. The city has an oil refinery, aluminum and cement works, fertilizer factories, sugar refineries, brick and tile works, canning factories, salt-manufacturing factories, and papermaking plants. Designated an export-processing zone in the late 1970s, Kaohsiung also attracted foreign investment to process locally purchased raw materials for export.\nIn 2020, Kaohsiung's land reclamation project in the Port of Kaohsiung was completed, equivalent to 16 of Taipei's Daan Forest Parks.\nThe Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau plans to buy 49 hectares of the reclaimed land to establish a solar energy industrial district that would be in the harbor's free trade zone.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) in nominal terms of Kaohsiung City is estimated to be around US$45\u00a0billion, and US$90\u00a0billion for the metropolitan region. As of 2008[ [update]], the GDP per capita in nominal terms was approximately US$24,000.\nDespite early success and heavy governmental investment, the city suffers from the economic North\u2013South divide in Taiwan, which continues to be the center of political debate. There has been public aims to shift the local economy towards tourism and cultural industries, with projects such as Pier-2 Art Center, National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts and Kaohsiung Music Center.\nAgriculture.\nThe main agricultural crops in Kaohsiung are vegetables, fruits and rice with a total arable land of 473\u00a0km2, which accounts to 16% of the total area of the municipality. Kaohsiung has the highest production of guava, jujube and lychee in Taiwan. The main livestock are chicken, dairy cattle, deer, duck, goose, pigs and sheep. The total annual agricultural income in Kaohsiung is NT$24.15\u00a0billion.\nCulture.\nTourism.\nMain landmarks of Kaohsiung city include the 85 Sky Tower, the Ferris wheel of the Kaohsiung Dream Mall, the Kaohsiung Arena and Port of Kaohsiung. The newly developed city is also known for having a large number of shopping streets, organized night markets and newly developed leisure parks such as the Pier-2 Art Center, E-DA Theme Park, Metropolitan Park, the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, the National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts, and Taroko Park.\nNatural attractions of the city include Shoushan (Monkey mountain), the Love River, Cijin Island, Sizihwan, the Dapingding Tropical Botanical Garden and Yushan National Park at the northeastern tip of the city. The city also features various historical attractions such as the Old City of Zuoying, a historical town built during the early 17th century, the Former British Consulate at Takao built during the late 19th century, and various sugar and crop factories built under Japanese rule.\nNatural attractions.\nKaohsiung city includes a wide range of different natural attractions due to its large size and geographical variation, as it is bordered by the Central Mountain Range in the northeast and the warm South China Sea to the west and southwest. The year-round warm climate allows coral reefs to grow along the coasts around Kaohsiung Harbor, with Shoushan Mountain being a small mountain completely made up of coral reefs and calcium carbonate, while the mountainous districts in the northeast include Taiwan's highest mountain, Yushan. Other notable natural attractions include the Mount Banping, Lotus Pond, and Dongsha Atoll National Park, which is currently inaccessible by the public due to military occupation.\nHistorical sites.\nA large number of historical sites and monuments were left in the city after the colonization of the Dutch in the 17th century, the Qing dynasty during the 18th and 19th century and the Japanese empire from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century. The city government has protected various sites and monuments from further damage and many have been opened to the public since the early 1980s. Notable historical sites include the Cemetery of Zhenghaijun, Fengshan Longshan Temple, Former British Consulate at Takao, Former Dinglinzihbian Police Station, Meinong Cultural and Creative Center, Former Sanhe Bank, and the Kaohsiung Lighthouse, one of the oldest lighthouses of the city.\nMuseums.\nKaohsiung is home to many museums, including the Chung Li-he Museum, Cijin Shell Museum, Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum, Jiasian Petrified Fossil Museum, Kaohsiung Astronomical Museum, Kaohsiung Hakka Cultural Museum, Kaohsiung Harbor Museum, Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, Kaohsiung Museum of History, Kaohsiung Museum of Labor, Kaohsiung Vision Museum, Meinong Hakka Culture Museum, National Science and Technology Museum, Republic of China Air Force Museum, Soya-Mixed Meat Museum, Taiwan Pineapple Museum, Taiwan Sugar Museum, Takao Railway Museum, Xiaolin Pingpu Cultural Museum and YM Museum of Marine Exploration Kaohsiung.\nParks and zoos.\nAs the largest municipality in Taiwan, Kaohsiung has a number of newly built leisure areas and parks. Notable parks or pavilions in the city include the Central Park, Siaogangshan Skywalk Park, Fo Guang Shan Monastery, the Dragon and Tiger Pagodas, Spring and Autumn Pavilions, the Love Pier, Singuang Ferry Wharf and Kaohsiung Fisherman's Wharf. Notable zoo in the city includes the Kaohsiung City Shousan Zoo.\nOther.\nKaohsiung is home to many night markets, such as Jin-Zuan Night Market, Liuhe Night Market, Ruifeng Night Market, Zhonghua Street Night Market, and the Kaisyuan Night Market. Other attractions include the Cijin Tianhou Temple, Dome of Light of Kaohsiung MRT's Formosa Boulevard Station, the Kaohsiung Mosque and the Tower of Light of Sanmin District.\nTraditional \"wet\" markets have long been the source of meat, fish, and produce for many residents. With the arrival of Western-style supermarkets in the 1980s and 1990s, such markets have encountered fierce competition. In 1989, the global leader in hypermarkets, Carrefour, entered Asia, opening its first store in Kaohsiung. Due to the success of its Taiwan operation, the French retailer expanded throughout the country and Asia. Jean-Luc Ch\u00e9reau, the general manager in Taiwan from 1993 to 1999, used this newfound understanding of Chinese culture and ways of doing business with Chinese customers to lead its China expansion starting in 1999. As of February 2020, Carrefour has opened 137 hypermarkets and supermarkets in Taiwan. Despite the fierce competition from \"Westernized\" supermarkets, Taiwan's traditional markets and mom-and-pop stores remain \"one of the most popular retail formats for many Asian families when they purchase daily food items and basic household goods.\"\nLanguages.\nThe majority of those living in Kaohsiung can communicate in both Taiwanese Hokkien and Mandarin. Some of the elderly who grew up during the Japanese colonization of Taiwan can communicate in Japanese, while most of the younger population have basic English skills.\nSince the spread of Standard Chinese after the Nationalist Government retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Hakka Chinese and various Formosan languages are gradually no longer spoken with the new generation and many Formosan languages are therefore classified as moribund or endangered languages by the United Nations. Nowadays, only elder Hakka people mostly living in Meinong, Liouguei, Shanlin and Jiasian districts can communicate in Hakka and elder Taiwanese aborigines living mostly in the rural districts of Namasia and Taoyuan can communicate with the aboriginal languages. The Taiwanese government has established special affairs committees for both the Aboriginals and the Hakkas to protect their language, culture, and minority rights.\nArts.\nThe \"Dome of Light\" in the concourse of Formosa Boulevard Station of Kaohsiung MRT is one of the world's largest public glass works of art. The city also has the Urban Spotlight Arcade spanning along the street in Cianjin District. Acknowledged as the largest performance arts center under one roof in the world Weiwuying (the National Kaohsiung Centre for the Arts), opened in 2018. The center was designed by Mecanoo.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe religious population of Kaohsiung is mainly divided into five main religious groups: Buddhists, Taoists, Muslim and Christians (Catholics and Protestants). As of 2015[ [update]], Kaohsiung City has 1,481 temples, the second highest in Taiwan after Tainan. Kaohsiung also has 306 churches.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhism is one of the major religions in Taiwan, with over 35% of Taiwan's population identifying as Buddhists. The same applies to Kaohsiung city. Kaohsiung also hosts the largest Buddhist temple in Taiwan, the Fo Guang Shan Monastery with its Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum. There are also other famous Buddhist temples such as Fengshan Longshan Temple and Hong Fa Temple.\nTaoism.\nAround 33% of the Taiwanese population are Taoists, making it the second largest religion of Taiwan. Most people who believe in Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the sea goddess known as Tian Shang Sheng Mu () or Mazu, who is variously syncretized as a Taoist immortal or embodiment of the bodhisattva Guanyin. Her temple on Cijin Island, Chi Jin Mazu Temple, is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed the center of the city's early settlement. There are also other prominent Taoist temples such as Fengshan Tiangong Temple, dedicated to the Jade Emperor, Cih Ji Palace, dedicated to Bao Sheng Da Di, Qing Shui Temple, dedicated to Qing Shui Zu Shi and Gushan Daitian Temple dedicated to Wang Ye worship.\nChristianity.\nChristianity is a minority religion in Taiwan. It was first brought onto the island when the Dutch and Spanish colonized Taiwan during the 17th century, mostly to the aboriginals. Kaohsiung currently hosts around 56,000 Christians.\nIslam.\nBesides the majority population of Buddhists and Taoists, Kaohsiung also includes a rather tiny population of Muslims. During the Chinese Civil War, some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled mainland China with the Kuomintang government to Taiwan. During the 1980s, another few thousand Muslims from Myanmar and Thailand, who are mostly descendants of Nationalist soldiers who fled Yunnan as a result of the communist takeover, migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life, resulting in an increase of Muslim population within the country. More recently, with the rise of Indonesian workers working in Taiwan, an estimated number of 88,000 Indonesian Muslims currently live in the country, in addition to the existing 53,000 Taiwanese Muslims. Combining all demographics, Taiwan hosts around 140,000 Muslims, with around 25,000 living in Kaohsiung. Kaohsiung Mosque is the largest mosque in Kaohsiung and the main gathering site of Muslims within the city.\nPolitics.\nGovernment.\nSometimes Kaohsiung used to be seen as the political opposite of Taipei. While northern Taiwan leans towards the Pan-Blue Coalition in the state-level elections, southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung, leaned towards the Pan-Green Coalition since the late 1990s. Frank Hsieh of the Democratic Progressive Party was reelected twice as Mayor of Kaohsiung, where he was widely credited for transforming the city from an industrial sprawl into an attractive modern metropolis. Hsieh resigned from the office of mayor to take up the office of Premier of the Republic of China in 2005. The municipal election, held on 9 December 2006, resulted in a victory for the Democratic Progressive Party's candidate Chen Chu, the first elected female mayor of special municipality in Taiwan, defeating her Kuomintang rival and former deputy mayor, Huang Jun-ying. As of 12 June 2020, the mayor of Kaohsiung City is Chen Chi-mai.\nSubdivisions.\nKaohsiung is divided into 38 districts, three of which are mountain indigenous districts. There are a total of 651 villages in which each village is subdivided into neighborhoods (\u9130). There are 18,584 neighborhoods in Kaohsiung City. Lingya and Fongshan districts are the administrative centers of the city while Lingya and Sinsing Districts are the two most densely populated districts of the city. Kaohsiung has the most numbers of districts among other special municipalities in Taiwan.\nNotable people.\n \nTransportation.\nPort of Kaohsiung.\nA major port, through which pass most of Taiwan's marine imports and exports, is located in the city but is not managed by the city government. Instead, it is administered by Kaohsiung Port Authority, under the Ministry of Transportation. There is a push for Kaohsiung City to annex the Port of Kaohsiung to facilitate better regional planning.\nAlso known as the \"Harbour Capital\" of Taiwan, Kaohsiung has always had a strong link with the ocean and maritime transportation. Ferries play a key role in everyday transportation, especially for transportation across the harbor. With five terminals and 23 berths, the \"Port of Kaohsiung\" is Taiwan's largest container port and the 13th largest in the world. In 2007 the port reached its handling capacity with a record trade volume of 10.2\u00a0million\u00a0twenty-foot equivalent units\u00a0(TEU). A new container terminal is under construction, increasing future handling capacity by 2 million\u00a0TEU by 2013.\nKaohsiung is one of the biggest ports in the world for importing shark fins, sold at high prices in the restaurants and shops of Taiwan and China. They are brought in from overseas and are placed out to dry in the sun on residential rooftops near the port.\nKaohsiung International Airport.\nKaohsiung City is also home to Taiwan's second-largest international airport, the Kaohsiung International Airport, located in Siaogang District near the city's center. It is one of the three major international airports of Taiwan, serving passengers of the entire southern and southeastern part of the country. However, the size of the airport is relatively small, with short runways compared to other major airports of Taiwan due to its age and its location near the city center, making it impossible for large aircraft such as the Airbus A380 to land at the airport. As a result, plans for work to begin on a new terminal is expected to start in 2023, and could handle up to 16.5 million passengers once complete.\nRapid transit.\nKaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit opened for service in March 2008. The MRT is made up of two lines with 37 stations covering a distance of .\nTwo of Kaohsiung's MRT stations, Formosa Boulevard Station and Central Park Station, were ranked among the top 50 most beautiful subway systems in the world by Metrobits.org in 2011. In 2012, the two stations respectively are ranked as the 2nd and the 4th among the top 15 most beautiful subway stops in the world by BootsnAll.\nCircular Light Rail.\nThe Circular Light Rail Line (also known as the Kaohsiung LRT, Kaohsiung Tram) for Kaohsiung City is a light rail line. Construction of Phase 1, known as the Waterside Light Rail began in June 2013 and is in full operation since September 2017. To combat air pollution, usage of the light rail, as well as buses, was made free of charge for electronic ticket holders from December to February, when air pollution is at its peak.\nRailway.\nThe city is served by the Taiwan Railway's Western Line and Pingtung Line. Kaohsiung Main Station is an underground station, replacing the old ground level station.\nHigh Speed Railway.\nSince 2007, Taiwan High Speed Rail has served Kaohsiung via Zuoying HSR station. On January 4, 2023, the Pingtung HSR extension was approved by Premier Su Zhenchang, and the High Speed Rail extension was confirmed to bypass central Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung Main Station.\nSports.\nKaohsiung is home to Taiwan's largest international-class stadium, the National Stadium, with a maximum capacity of 55,000 seats, as well as Kaohsiung Arena. The city hosted the 2009 World Games at the National Stadium. Nearly 6,000 athletes, officials, coaches, referees and others from 103 countries participated in the 2009 Kaohsiung World Games.\nTaiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League has a professional baseball team, TSG Hawks, based in Kaohsiung.\nKaohsiung also has two professional basketball teams, the Kaohsiung Aquas of the T1 League and the Kaohsiung 17LIVE Steelers of the P. League+. Kaohsiung was also home to the Kaohsiung Truth of the ASEAN Basketball League. They were the first team in the history of the league that was based outside Southeast Asia. The team folded in 2017.\nOther recent major sporting events held by Kaohsiung include:\nEducation.\nKaohsiung has a number of colleges and junior colleges offering training in commerce, education, maritime technology, medicine, modern languages, nursing, and technology, as well as various international schools and eight national military schools, including the three major military academies of the country, the Republic of China Military Academy, Republic of China Naval Academy and Republic of China Air Force Academy.\nUniversities\nTechnical and vocational universities\nHigh schools and junior high schools\nInternational schools\nMilitary schools\nConferences and events.\nThe Kaohsiung Exhibition Center, built by the Kaohsiung City Government, was opened on 14 April 2014. It includes an exhibition space for 1,500 booths, and a convention hall for 2,000 people.\nThe center hosted the Taiwan International Boat Show in May 2014. Another conference and event-related venue is the newly renovated International Convention Center Kaohsiung in 2013.\nSister cities and friendship cities.\nThere are three Consulates in Kaohsiung. Institute in Taiwan Kaohsiung Branch Office, -Taiwan Exchange Association Kaohsiung Office, Representative Office Kaohsiung Branch in Taiwan.\nKaohsiung is twinned with the following locations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWords in native languages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their settlement area is referred to as Kashubia. They speak the Kashubian language, which is classified as a separate language closely related to Polish.\nThe Kashubs are closely related to the Poles and sometimes classified as their subgroup. Moreover, the vast majority of Kashubians declare themselves as Poles and many of them have a Polish-Kashubian identity. The Kashubs are grouped with the Slovincians as Pomeranians. Similarly, the Slovincian (now extinct) and Kashubian languages are grouped as Pomeranian languages, with Slovincian (also known as \u0141eba Kashubian) either a distinct language closely related to Kashubian, or a Kashubian dialect.\nModern Kashubia.\nAmong larger cities, Gdynia (\"Gdini\u00f4\") contains the largest proportion of people declaring Kashubian origin. However, the biggest city of the Kashubia region is Gda\u0144sk (\"Gdu\u0144sk\"), the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Between 80.3% and 93.9% of the people in towns such as Linia, Sierakowice, Szemud, Kartuzy, Chmielno, \u017bukowo, etc. are of Kashubian descent.\nThe traditional occupations of the Kashubs have been agriculture and fishing. These have been joined by the service and hospitality industries, as well as agrotourism. The main organization that maintains the Kashubian identity is the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association. The recently formed \"Odroda\" is also dedicated to the renewal of Kashubian culture.\nThe traditional capital has been disputed for a long time and includes Kartuzy (\"Kartuz\u00eb\") among the seven contenders. The biggest cities claiming to be the capital are: Gda\u0144sk (\"Gdu\u0144sk\"), Wejherowo (\"Wejrow\u00f2\"), and Byt\u00f3w (\"B\u00ebtow\u00f2\").\nPopulation.\nThe total number of Kashubians (Pomeranians) varies depending on one's definition. A common estimate is that over 500,000 people in Poland are of the Kashubian ethnicity, the estimates range from ca. 500,000 to ca. 567,000. In the Polish census of 2002, only 5,062 people declared Kashubian national identity, although 52,655 declared Kashubian as their everyday language. Most Kashubs declare Polish national identity and Kashubian ethnicity, and are considered both Polish \"and\" Kashubian. On the 2002 census there was no option to declare one national identity and a different ethnicity, or more than one ethnicity. On the 2011 census, the number of persons declaring \"Kashubian\" as their only ethnicity was 16,000, and 233,000 including those who declared Kashubian as first or second ethnicity (together with Polish). In that census, over 108,000 people declared everyday use of Kashubian language. The number of people who can speak at least some Kashubian is higher, around 366,000.\nAs of 1890, linguist Stefan Ramu\u0142t estimated the number of Kashubs (including Slovincians) in Pomerelia as 174,831. He also estimated that at that time there were over 90,000 Kashubs in the United States, around 25,000 in Canada,15,000 in Brazil and 25,000 elsewhere in the world. In total 330,000.\nIn the census of 2021 in total 179,685 people in Poland claimed Kashubian as their ethnic-national identity. Of them only 12,846 claimed it without accompanying Polish identity.\nHistory.\nKashubians are a Western Slavic people living on the shores of the Baltic Sea. Kashubians have their own unique language, history, culture and traditions.\nHistorical population.\nUntil the end of the 12th century, the vast majority of inhabitants of Pomerania (Hither, Farther and Eastern) were Slavic-speakers, but the province was quite sparsely populated, with large areas covered by forests and waste lands. During the 13th century, the German began in this region. Slavic dukes of Pomerania such as Barnim I (1220\u20131278) \u2013 despite calling themselves \u2013 contributed a lot to the change of ethnic structure by promoting German immigration and granting land to German nobles, monks and clergy. The Slavic ruling dynasty itself started intermarrying with German princesses and became culturally Germanized over time. Wendish commoners became alienated in their own land, their culture replaced by that of newcomers. All of this led to Germanization of most of Slavic Pomeranians and the gradual death of their Slavic language, with the general direction of assimilation and language shift from west to east.Johannes Bugenhagen wrote that at the beginning of the 16th century the German-Slavic language border was near Koszalin. During the 17th century, the border between areas with mostly German-speaking and mostly Slavic-speaking populations ran more or less along the present-day border between West Pomeranian and Pomeranian Voivodeships.\nIn year 1612, cartographer Eilhard Lubinus \u2013 while working on his map of Pomerania \u2013 travelled from the direction of Pollnow towards Treblin on his way to Gda\u0144sk. While staying in the manor house of Stanislaus Stenzel von Puttkamer in Treblin, he noted in his diary: \"we have entered Slavic-inhabited lands, which has surprised us a lot.\" Later, while returning from Gda\u0144sk to Stettin, Lubinus slept over in Wielka Wie\u015b near Stolp, and noted: \"in the whole village, we cannot find even one German-speaker\" (which caused communication problems). Lubinus also travelled from Chocimino through \u015awierzno to Trzebielino, he entered Slavic-inhabited land. During another trip, near Wierzchocino, he was not able to find even one German-speaking person.\nOver a century later, in 1772\u20131778, the area was visited by Johann Bernoulli. He noted that villages owned by Otto Christoph von Podewils \u2013 such as Dochow, Zipkow and Warbelin \u2013 were inhabited entirely by Slavic-speakers. He also noted that local priests and nobles were making great efforts to weed out Slavic language and turn their subjects into Germans. Br\u00fcggemann in 1779 wrote that the area to the east of Lupow river was inhabited by \"pure-blood Wends\", while to the west of this river some rural areas were inhabited by already half-Germanised \"Wendischdeutsche\".\nPerhaps the earliest census figures on ethnic or national structure of West Prussia and Farther Pomerania are from 1817 to 1823.\nKarl Andree, (Leipzig 1831), gives the total population of West Prussia as 700,000 \u2013 including 50% Poles (350,000), 47% Germans (330,000) and 3% Jews (20,000). Kashubians are included with Poles, while Mennonites with Germans.\nModern estimates of Kashubian population in West Prussia in the early 19th century, by county, are given by Leszek Belzyt and Jan Mordawski:\nAccording to Georg Hassel, there were 65,000 Slavic-speakers in the whole Provinz Pommern in 1817\u20131819. Modern estimates for just eastern parts of Pommern (Western Kashubia) in early 1800s range between 40,000 (Leszek Belzyt) and 25,000 (Jan Mordawski, Zygmunt Szultka). The number declined to between 35,000 and 23,000 (Zygmunt Szultka, Leszek Belzyt) in years 1827\u20131831. In 1850-1860s there were an estimated 23,000 to 17,000 Slavic-speakers left in Pommern, down to 15,000 in 1892 according to Stefan Ramu\u0142t. The number was declining due to Germanisation. The bulk of Slavic population in 19th century Pommern was concentrated in its easternmost counties: especially Byt\u00f3w (B\u00fctow), L\u0119bork (Lauenburg) and S\u0142upsk (Stolp). According to Zygmunt Szultka at the beginning of the 19th century in Provinz Pommern Kashubians were still around 55% of the total population (14,200 people) in county Lauenburg-B\u00fctow (L\u0119bork-Byt\u00f3w) and over 25% of the total population (10,450 people) in county Stolp (S\u0142upsk).\nReichstag elections (1867\u20131912).\nIn all constituencies with significant Catholic Kashubian population (Neustadt in Westpr.-Putzig-Karthaus; Berent-Preu\u00dfisch Stargard-Dirschau; and Konitz-Tuchel), all Reichstag elections in 1867\u20131912 were won by the Polish Party (Polish Party, later Polenpartei).\nOrigin.\nKashubs descend from the Slavic Pomeranian tribes, who had settled between the Oder and Vistula Rivers after the Migration Period, and were at various times Polish and Danish vassals. While most Slavic Pomeranians were assimilated during the medieval German settlement of Pomerania (Ostsiedlung), especially in Eastern Pomerania (Pomerelia) some kept and developed their customs and became known as Kashubians.\nThe tenth century far-traveled Arab writer Al-Masudi \u2013 who had great interest in non-Muslim peoples, including the various Slavs of Eastern Europe \u2013 mentions a people which he calls \"Kuhsabin\", who were probably Kashubians. The oldest known unambiguous mention of \"Kashubia\" dates from 19 March 1238\u00a0\u2013 Pope Gregory IX wrote about Bogislaw I as \"dux Cassubie\"\u00a0\u2013 the Duke of Kashubia. The old one dates from the 13th century (a seal of Barnim I from the House of Pomerania, Duke of Pomerania-Stettin). The Dukes of Pomerania hence used \"Duke of (the) Kashubia(ns)\" in their titles, passing it to the Swedish Crown who succeeded in Swedish Pomerania when the House of Pomerania became extinct.\nAdministrative history of Kashubia.\nThe westernmost (Slovincian) parts of Kashubia, located in the medieval Lands of Schlawe and Stolp and Lauenburg and B\u00fctow Land, were integrated into the Duchy of Pomerania in 1317 and 1455, respectively, and remained with its successors (Brandenburgian Pomerania and Prussian Pomerania) until 1945, when the area became Polish. The bulk of Kashubia since the 12th century was within the medieval Pomerelian duchies, since 1308 in the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, since 1466 within Royal Prussia, an autonomous territory of the Polish Crown, since 1772 within West Prussia, a Prussian province, since 1920 within the Polish Corridor of the Second Polish Republic, since 1939 within the Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia of Nazi Germany, and since 1945 within the People's Republic of Poland, and after within the Third Polish Republic.\nLinguistic and cultural influences.\nGerman Ostsiedlung in Kashubia was initiated by the Pomeranian dukes and focused on the towns, whereas much of the countryside remained Kashubian. An exception was the German settled Vistula delta (Vistula Germans), the coastal regions, and the Vistula valley. Following the centuries of interaction between local German and Kashubian population, Aleksander Hilferding (1862) and Alfons Parczewski (1896) confirmed a progressive language shift in the Kashubian population from their Slavonic vernacular to the local West-Germanic dialect (Low German Ostpommersch, Low German Low Prussian, or High German).\nOn the other hand, Pomerelia since the Middle Ages was assigned to the Kuyavian Diocese of Leslau and thus retained Polish as the church language. Only the Slovincians in 1534 adopted Lutheranism after the Protestant Reformation had reached the Duchy of Pomerania, while the Kashubes in Pomerelia remained Roman Catholic. The Prussian parliament (\"Landtag\") in K\u00f6nigsberg changed the official church language from Polish to German in 1843 but this decision was soon repealed.\nIn the 19th century the Kashubian activist Florian Ceynowa undertook efforts to identify the Kashubian language, and its culture and traditions. Although his efforts did not appeal to locals at the time, Kaszubian activists in the present day have claimed that Ceynowa awakened Kashubian self-identity, thereby opposing both Germanisation and Prussian authority, and Polish nobility and clergy. He believed in a separate Kashubian identity and strove for a Russian-led pan-Slavic federacy, He considered Poles \"born brothers\". Ceynowa was a radical who attempted to take the Prussian garrison in Preussisch Stargard (Starogard Gda\u0144ski) during 1846 (see Greater Poland uprising), but the operation failed when his 100 combatants, armed only with scythes, decided to abandon the site before the attack was carried out. Although some later Kashubian activists tried to push for a separate identity, they further based their ideas on a misrepresented reading of the journalist and activist Hieronim Derdowski: \"There is no Cassubia without Polonia, and no Poland without Cassubia\" (\"Nie ma Kaszeb bez Polonii a bez Kaszeb Polsci\"\"). Further stanzas of Derdowski's tribute also point to the fact that Kaszubs were Poles and could not survive without. The Society of Young Kashubians (Towarzystwo M\u0142odokaszubskie) has decided to follow in this way, and while they sought to create a strong Kashubian identity, at the same time they regarded the Kashubians as \"One branch, of many, of the great Polish nation\".\nThe leader of the movement was Aleksander Majkowski, a doctor educated in Che\u0142mno with the Society of Educational Help in Che\u0142mno. In 1912 he founded the Society of Young Kashubians and started the newspaper \"Gryf\". Kashubs voted for Polish lists in elections, which strengthened the representation of Poles in the Pomerania region.\nBetween 1855 and 1900, about 100,000 Kashubs emigrated to the United States, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia in the so-called Kashubian diaspora, largely for economic reasons. In 1899 the scholar Stefan Ramult named Winona, Minnesota the \"Kashubian Capital of America\" on account of the Kashubian community's size within the city and its activity. Due to their Catholic faith, the Kashubians became subject to Prussia's Kulturkampf between 1871 and 1878. The Kashubians faced Germanification efforts, including those by evangelical Lutheran clergy. These efforts were successful in Lauenburg (L\u0119bork) and Leba (\u0141eba), where the local population used the Gothic alphabet. While resenting the disrespect shown by some Prussian officials and Junkers, Kashubians lived in peaceful coexistence with the local German population until World War II, although during the interbellum, the Kashubian ties to Poland were either overemphasized or neglected by Polish and German authors, respectively, in arguments regarding the Polish Corridor.\nDuring the Second World War, Kashubs were considered by the Nazis as being either of \"German stock\" or \"extraction\", or \"inclined toward Germanness\" and \"capable of Germanisation\", and thus classified third category of Deutsche Volksliste (German ethnic classification list) if ties to the Polish nation could be dissolved. However, Kashubians who were suspected to support the Polish cause, particularly those with higher education, were arrested and executed, the main place of executions being Pia\u015bnica (Gross Plassnitz), where 12,000 were executed. The German administrator of the area Albert Forster considered Kashubians of \"low value\" and did not support any attempts to create Kashubian nationality. Some Kashubians organized anti-Nazi resistance groups, \"Gryf Kaszubski\" (later \"Gryf Pomorski\"), and the exiled \"Zwiazek Pomorski\" in Great Britain.\nWhen integrated into Poland, those envisioning Kashubian autonomy faced a Communist regime striving for ethnic homogeneity and presenting Kashubian culture as merely folklore. Kashubians were sent to Silesian mines, where they met Silesians facing similar problems. Lech B\u0105dkowski from the Kashubian opposition became the first spokesperson of Solidarno\u015b\u0107.\nAs a result of political mistrust and coercion to declare Polish identity many Kashubians turned away from Poland and chose opting for Germany.\nLanguage.\nIn the 2021 Population Census, about 87,600 people declared Kashubian as their language used at home, a decrease from 108,100 in the 2011 Census.\nThe classification of Kashubian as a language or dialect has been controversial. From a diachronic point of view of historical linguistics, Kashubian, like Slovincian, Polabian and Polish, is a Lechitic West Slavic language, while from a synchronic point of view it is a group of Polish dialects. Given the past nationalist interests of Germans and Poles in Kashubia, Barbour and Carmichel state: \"As is always the case with the division of a dialect continuum into separate languages, there is scope here for manipulation.\"\nA \"standard\" Kashubian language does not exist despite attempts to create one, rather a variety of dialects are spoken that differ significantly from each other. The vocabulary is influenced by both German and Polish.\nThere are other traditional Slavic ethnic groups inhabiting Pomerania, including the Kociewiacy, Borowiacy and Krajniacy. These dialects tend to fall between Kashubian and the Polish dialects of Greater Poland and Mazovia, with Krajniak dialect indeed heavily influenced by Kashubian, while Borowiak and Kociewiak dialects much more closer to Greater Polish and Mazovian. No obvious Kashubian substrate or any other influence is visible in Kociewiak dialect. This indicates that they are not only descendants of Pomeranians, but also of settlers who arrived in Pomerania from Greater Poland and Masovia during the Middle Ages, from the 10th century onwards.\nIn the 16th and 17th century Michael Br\u00fcggemann (also known as Pontanus or Micha\u0142 Mostnik), Simon Krofey (Szimon Krofej) and J.M. Sporgius introduced Kashubian into the Lutheran Church. Krofey, pastor in B\u00fctow (Bytow), published a religious song book in 1586, written in Polish but also containing some Kashubian words. Br\u00fcggemann, pastor in Schmolsin, published a Polish translation of some works of Martin Luther (catechism) and biblical texts, also containing Kashubian elements. Other biblical texts were published in 1700 by Sporgius, pastor in Schmolsin. His \"Schmolsiner Perikopen\", most of which is written in the same Polish-Kashubian style as Krofey's and Br\u00fcggemann's books, also contain small passages (\"6th Sunday after Epiphany\") written in pure Kashubian. Scientific interest in the Kashubian language was sparked by Christoph Mrongovius (publications in 1823, 1828), Florian Ceynowa and the Russian linguist Aleksander Hilferding (1859, 1862), later followed by Leon Biskupski (1883, 1891), Gotthelf Bronisch (1896, 1898), Jooseppi Julius Mikkola (1897), Kazimierz Nitsch (1903). Important works are S. Ramult's, \"S\u0142ownik jezyka pomorskiego, czyli kaszubskiego\", 1893, and Friedrich Lorentz, \"Slovinzische Grammatik\", 1903, \"Slovinzische Texte\", 1905, and \"Slovinzisches W\u00f6rterbuch\", 1908. Zdzis\u0142aw Stieber was involved in producing linguistic atlases of Kashubian (1964\u201378).\nThe first activist of the Kashubian national movement was Florian Ceynowa. Among his accomplishments, he documented the Kashubian alphabet and grammar by 1879 and published a collection of ethnographic-historic stories of the life of the Kashubians (\"Sk\u00f3rb kasz\u00e9bsko-slovjnckj\u00e9 m\u00f2v\u00e9\", 1866\u20131868). Another early writer in Kashubian was Hieronim Derdowski. The Young Kashubian movement followed, led by author Aleksander Majkowski, who wrote for the paper \"Zrz\u00ebsz Kasz\u00ebbsk\u00f4\" as part of the \"Zrz\u00ebszinc\u00eb\" group. The group would contribute significantly to the development of the Kashubian literary language. Another important writer in Kashubian was Bernard Sychta (1907\u20131982).\nCultural traditions.\nSimilarly to the traditions in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, pussy willows have been adopted as an alternative to the palm leaves used in Palm Sunday celebrations, which were not obtainable in Kashubia. They were blessed by priests on Palm Sunday, following which parishioners whipped each other with the pussy willow branches, saying \"Wierzba bije, j\u00f4 nie bij\u00e3. Za tidz\u00e9\u0144 wi\u00f4ld\u017ci dz\u00e9\u0144, za noc\u00eb trz\u00eb i trz\u00eb s\u0105 Jastr\u00eb\" ('The willow strikes, it's not me who strikes, in a week, on the great day, in three and three nights, there is the Easter').\nThe pussy willows, blessed by priests, were treated as sacred charms that could prevent lightning strikes, protect animals, and encourage honey production. They were believed to bring health and good fortune to people as well, and it was traditional for one pussy willow bud to be swallowed on Palm Sunday to promote good health.\nAccording to the old tradition, on Easter Monday the Kashub boys chase girls whipping gently their legs with juniper twigs. This is to bring good fortune in love to the chased girls. This was usually accompanied by a boy's chant \"Dyngus, dyngus \u2013 p\u00f2 dwa jaja, Nie chc\u00e3 chleba, leno jaja\" ('Dyngus, dyngus, for two eggs; I don't want bread but eggs'). Sometimes a girl would be whipped when still in her bed. Girls would give boys painted eggs.\nPottery, one of the ancient Kashubians crafts, has survived to the present day. Famous is Kashubian embroidery and Kashubian embroidering Zukowo school is important intangible cultural heritage.\nPope John Paul II visited in June 1987 and appealed to the Kashubians to preserve their traditional values including their language.\nToday.\nIn 2005, Kashubian was for the first time made an official subject on the Polish matura exam (roughly equivalent to the English A-Level and French Baccalaureat). This development was seen as an important step in the official recognition and establishment of the language. Today, in some towns and villages in northern Poland, Kashubian is the second language spoken after Polish, and it is taught in some regional schools.\nSince 2005 Kashubian enjoys legal protection in Poland as an official regional language. It is the only tongue in Poland with this status. It was granted by an act of the Polish Parliament on 6 January 2005. Old Kashubian culture has partially survived in architecture and folk crafts such as pottery, plaiting, embroidery, amber-working, sculpturing and glasspainting.\nIn the 2011 census, 233,000 people in Poland declared their identity as Kashubian, 216,000 declaring it together with Polish and 16,000 as their only national-ethnic identity. Kasz\u00ebbsk\u00f4 Jednota is an association of people who have the latter view.\nAccording to the 2021 census, 179 685 people declared Kashubian identity but only 11 961 (6,7% of total) people declared it as their only identity. A vast majority of 166 839 (92,9% of total) declared it together with Polish identity.\nKashubian cuisine.\nKashubian cuisine contains many elements from the wider European culinary tradition. Local specialities include:\nGenetics.\nAccording to a study published in 2015, by far the most common Y-DNA haplogroup among the Kashubs (n=204) who live in Kashubia, is haplogroup R1a, which is carried by 61.8% of Kashubian males. It is followed in frequency by I1 (13.2%), R1b (9.3%), I2 (4.4%), E1b1b (3.4%), J (2.5%), G (2%) and N1 (1.5%). Other haplogroups are 2%. Another study from 2010 (n=64) discovered similar proportions of most haplogroups (R1a - 68.8%, I1 \u2013 12.5%, R1b - 7.8%, I2 \u2013 3.1%, E1b1b - 3.1%), but found also Q1a in 3.1% of Kashubians. This study reported no significant differences between Kashubians from Poland and other Poles as far as Y chromosome polymorphism is regarded. When it comes to mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, according to a January 2013 study, the most common major mtDNA lineages among the Kashubians, each carried by at least 2.5% of their population, include J1 (12.3%), H1 (11.8%), H* (8.9%), T* (5.9%), T2 (5.4%), U5a (5.4%), U5b (5.4%), U4a (3.9%), H10 (3.9%), H11 (3.0%), H4 (3.0%), K (3.0%), V (3.0%), H2a (2.5%) and W (2.5%). Altogether they account for almost 8/10 of the total Kashubian mtDNA diversity.\nIn a 2013 study, Y-DNA haplogroups among the Polish population indigenous to Kociewie (n=158) were reported as follows:\n56.3% R1a, 17.7% R1b, 8.2% I1, 7.6% I2, 3.8% E1b1b, 1.9% N1, 1.9% J and 2% of other haplogroups.\nDiaspora.\nImmigrant Kashubians kept a distinct identity among Polish Canadians and Polish Americans.\nIn 1858 Polish-Kashubians emigrated to Upper Canada and created the settlement of Wilno, in Renfrew County, Ontario, which still exists. Today Canadian Polish-Kashubians return to Northern Poland in small groups to learn about their heritage.\nKashubian immigrants founded St. Josaphat parish in Chicago's Lincoln Park community in the late 19th century, as well as the parish of Immaculate Heart of Mary in Irving Park, the vicinity of which was dubbed as \"Little Cassubia\". In the 1870s a fishing village was established in Jones Island in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by Kashubian immigrants. The settlers however did not hold deeds to the land, and the government of Milwaukee evicted them as squatters in the 1940s, with the area soon after turned into industrial park. The last trace of this Milwaukee fishing village that had been settled by Kashubians on Jones Island is in the name of the smallest park in the city, \"Kaszube's Park\".\nIn literature.\nImportant for Kashubian literature was \"X\u0105\u017ceczka dlo Kaszebov\" by Doctor Florian Ceynowa (1817\u20131881). Hieronim Derdowski (1852\u20131902) was another significant author who wrote in Kashubian, as was Doctor Aleksander Majkowski (1876\u20131938) from Ko\u015bcierzyna, who wrote the Kashubian national epic The Life and Adventures of Remus. Jan Trepczyk was a poet who wrote in Kashubian, as was Stanis\u0142aw Pestka. Kashubian literature has been translated into Czech, Polish, English, German, Belarusian, Slovene and Finnish. A considerable body of Christian literature has been translated into Kashubian, including the New Testament and Book of Genesis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is characterized by features like poljes above and drainage systems with sinkholes and caves underground. There is some evidence that karst may occur in more weathering-resistant rocks such as quartzite given the right conditions.\nSubterranean drainage may limit surface water, with few if any rivers or lakes. In regions where the dissolved bedrock is covered (perhaps by debris) or confined by one or more superimposed non-soluble rock strata, distinctive karst features may occur only at subsurface levels and can be totally missing above ground.\nThe study of \"paleokarst\" (buried karst in the stratigraphic column) is important in petroleum geology because as much as 50% of the world's hydrocarbon reserves are hosted in carbonate rock, and much of this is found in porous karst systems.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"karst\" was borrowed from German in the late 19th century, which entered German usage much earlier, to describe a number of geological, geomorphological, and hydrological features found within the range of the Dinaric Alps, stretching from the northeastern corner of Italy above the city of Trieste, across the Balkan peninsula along the coast of the eastern Adriatic to Kosovo and North Macedonia, where the massif of the \u0160ar Mountains begins. The karst zone is at the northwesternmost section, described in early topographical research as a plateau between Italy and Slovenia. Languages preserving this form include , , and .\nIn the local South Slavic languages, all variations of the word are derived from a Romanized Illyrian base (yielding , ), later metathesized from the reconstructed form into forms such as and , , first attested in the 18th century, and the adjective form in the 16th century. As a proper noun, the Slovene form was first attested in 1177.\nUltimately, the word is of Mediterranean origin. It has also been suggested that the word may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root 'rock'. The name may also be connected to the oronym \"Kar(u)s\u00e1dios oros\" cited by Ptolemy, and perhaps also to Latin .\nEarly studies.\nJohann Weikhard von Valvasor, a pioneer of the study of karst in Slovenia and a fellow of the Royal Society, London, introduced the word \"karst\" to European scholars in 1689 to describe the phenomenon of underground flows of rivers in his account of Lake Cerknica.\nJovan Cviji\u0107 greatly advanced the knowledge of karst regions to the point where he became known as the \"father of karst geomorphology\". Primarily discussing the karst regions of the Balkans, Cviji\u0107's 1893 publication \"Das Karstph\u00e4nomen\" describes landforms such as karren, dolines and poljes. In a 1918 publication, Cviji\u0107 proposed a cyclical model for karst landscape development.\nKarst hydrology emerged as a discipline in the late 1950s and the early 1960s in France. Previously, the activities of cave explorers, called speleologists, had been dismissed as more of a sport than a science and so the underground karst caves and their associated watercourses were, from a scientific perspective, understudied.\nDevelopment.\nKarst is most strongly developed in dense carbonate rock, such as limestone, that is thinly bedded and highly fractured. Karst is not typically well developed in chalk, because chalk is highly porous rather than dense, so the flow of groundwater is not concentrated along fractures. Karst is also most strongly developed where the water table is relatively low, such as in uplands with entrenched valleys, and where rainfall is moderate to heavy. This contributes to rapid downward movement of groundwater, which promotes dissolution of the bedrock, whereas standing groundwater becomes saturated with carbonate minerals and ceases to dissolve the bedrock.\nChemistry of dissolution.\nThe carbonic acid that causes karst features is formed as rain passes through Earth's atmosphere picking up carbon dioxide (CO2), which readily dissolves in the water. Once the rain reaches the ground, it may pass through soil that provides additional CO2 produced by soil respiration. Some of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the water to form a weak carbonic acid solution, which dissolves calcium carbonate. The primary reaction sequence in limestone dissolution is the following:\n\nIn very rare conditions, oxidation can play a role. Oxidation played a major role in the formation of ancient Lechuguilla Cave in the US state of New Mexico and is presently active in the Frasassi Caves of Italy. \nThe oxidation of sulfides leading to the formation of sulfuric acid can also be one of the corrosion factors in karst formation. As oxygen-rich surface waters seep into deep anoxic karst systems, they bring oxygen, which reacts with sulfide present in the system (pyrite or hydrogen sulfide) to form sulfuric acid (). Sulfuric acid then reacts with calcium carbonate, causing increased erosion within the limestone formation. This chain of reactions is:\n (sulfide oxidation)\n (sulfuric acid dissociation)\n (calcium carbonate dissolution)\n (formation of calcium sulfate)\n (formation of gypsum)\nThis reaction chain forms gypsum.\nMorphology.\nThe karstification of a landscape may result in a variety of large- or small-scale features both on the surface and beneath. On exposed surfaces, small features may include solution flutes (or rillenkarren), runnels, limestone pavement (clints and grikes), kamenitzas collectively called karren or lapiez. Medium-sized surface features may include sinkholes or cenotes (closed basins), vertical shafts, foibe (inverted funnel shaped sinkholes), disappearing streams, and reappearing springs.\nLarge-scale features may include limestone pavements, poljes, and karst valleys. Mature karst landscapes, where more bedrock has been removed than remains, may result in karst towers, or haystack/eggbox landscapes. Beneath the surface, complex underground drainage systems (such as karst aquifers) and extensive caves and cavern systems may form.\nErosion along limestone shores, notably in the tropics, produces karst topography that includes a sharp makatea surface above the normal reach of the sea, and undercuts that are mostly the result of biological activity or bioerosion at or a little above mean sea level. Some of the most dramatic of these formations can be seen in Thailand's Phangnga Bay and at Halong Bay in Vietnam.\nCalcium carbonate dissolved into water may precipitate out where the water discharges some of its dissolved carbon dioxide. Rivers which emerge from springs may produce tufa terraces, consisting of layers of calcite deposited over extended periods of time. In caves, a variety of features collectively called speleothems are formed by deposition of calcium carbonate and other dissolved minerals.\nInterstratal karst.\nInterstratal karst is a karst landscape which is developed beneath a cover of insoluble rocks. Typically this will involve a cover of sandstone overlying limestone strata undergoing solution. In the United Kingdom for example extensive doline fields have developed at Cefn yr Ystrad, Mynydd Llangatwg and Mynydd Llangynidr in South Wales across a cover of Twrch Sandstone which overlies concealed Carboniferous Limestone, the last-named locality having been declared a site of special scientific interest in respect of it.\nKegelkarst, salt karst, and karst forests.\nKegelkarst is a type of tropical karst terrain with numerous cone-like hills, formed by cockpits, mogotes, and poljes and without strong fluvial erosion processes. This terrain is found in Cuba, Jamaica, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, southern China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.\nSalt karst (or 'halite karst') is developed in areas where salt is undergoing solution underground. It can lead to surface depressions and collapses which present a geo-hazard.\nKarst areas tend to have unique types of forests. The karst terrain is difficult for humans to traverse, so that their ecosystems are often relatively undisturbed. The soil tends to have a high pH, which encourages growth of unusual species of orchids, palms, mangroves, and other plants.\nPaleokarst.\nPaleokarst or palaeokarst is a development of karst observed in geological history and preserved within the rock sequence, effectively a fossil karst. There are for example palaeokarst surfaces exposed within the Clydach Valley Subgroup of the Carboniferous Limestone sequence of South Wales which developed as sub-aerial weathering of recently formed limestones took place during periods of non-deposition within the early part of the period. Sedimentation resumed and further limestone strata were deposited on an irregular karst surface, the cycle recurring several times in connection with fluctuating sea levels over prolonged periods.\nPseudokarst.\nPseudokarsts are similar in form or appearance to karst features but are created by different mechanisms. Examples include lava caves and granite tors\u2014for example, Labertouche Cave in Victoria, Australia\u2014and paleocollapse features. Mud Caves are an example of pseudokarst.\nHydrology.\nKarst formations have unique hydrology, resulting in many unusual features. A karst fenster (karst window) occurs when an underground stream emerges onto the surface between layers of rock, cascades some distance, and then disappears back down, often into a sinkhole.\nRivers in karst areas may disappear underground a number of times and spring up again in different places, even under a different name, like Ljubljanica, the \"river of seven names\".\nAnother example of this is the Popo Agie River in Fremont County, Wyoming, where, at a site named \"The Sinks\" in Sinks Canyon State Park, the river flows into a cave in a formation known as the Madison Limestone and then rises again down the canyon in a placid pool.\nA turlough is a unique type of seasonal lake found in Irish karst areas which are formed through the annual welling-up of water from the underground water system.\nAquifers.\nKarst aquifers typically develop in limestone. Surface water containing natural carbonic acid moves down into small fissures in limestone. This carbonic acid gradually dissolves limestone thereby enlarging the fissures. The enlarged fissures allow a larger quantity of water to enter which leads to a progressive enlargement of openings. Abundant small openings store a large quantity of water. The larger openings form a conduit system that drains the aquifer to springs.\nCharacterization of karst aquifers requires field exploration to locate sinkholes, swallets, sinking streams, and springs in addition to studying geological maps. Conventional hydrogeologic methods such as aquifer tests and potentiometric mapping are insufficient to characterize the complexity of karst aquifers, and need to be supplemented with dye traces, measurement of spring discharges, and analysis of water chemistry. U.S. Geological Survey dye tracing has determined that conventional groundwater models that assume a uniform distribution of porosity are not applicable for karst aquifers.\nLinear alignment of surface features such as straight stream segments and sinkholes develop along fracture traces. Locating a well in a fracture trace or intersection of fracture traces increases the likelihood to encounter good water production. Voids in karst aquifers can be large enough to cause destructive collapse or subsidence of the ground surface that can initiate a catastrophic release of contaminants. \nGroundwater flow rate in karst aquifers is much more rapid than in porous aquifers. For example, in the Barton Springs Edwards aquifer, dye traces measured the karst groundwater flow rates from 0.5 to 7 miles per day (0.8 to 11.3\u00a0km/d). The rapid groundwater flow rates make karst aquifers much more sensitive to groundwater contamination than porous aquifers.\nGroundwater in karst areas is also just as easily polluted as surface streams, because Karst formations are cavernous and highly permeable, resulting in reduced opportunity for contaminant filtration.\nWell water may also be unsafe as the water may have run unimpeded from a sinkhole in a cattle pasture, bypassing the normal filtering that occurs in a porous aquifer. Sinkholes have often been used as farmstead or community trash dumps. Overloaded or malfunctioning septic tanks in karst landscapes may dump raw sewage directly into underground channels.\nGeologists are concerned with these negative effects of human activity on karst hydrology which, as of 2007[ [update]], supplied about 25% of the global demand for drinkable water.\nEffects of karst hydrology.\nFarming in karst areas must take into account the lack of surface water. The soils may be fertile enough, and rainfall may be adequate, but rainwater quickly moves through the crevices into the ground, sometimes leaving the surface soil parched between rains.\nThe karst topography also poses peculiar difficulties for human inhabitants. Sinkholes can develop gradually as surface openings enlarge, but progressive erosion is frequently unseen until the roof of a cavern suddenly collapses. Such events have swallowed homes, cattle, cars, and farm machinery. In the United States, sudden collapse of such a cavern-sinkhole swallowed part of the collection of the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky in 2014.\nKarst areas.\nThe world's largest limestone karst is Australia's Nullarbor Plain. Slovenia has the world's highest risk of sinkholes, while the western Highland Rim in the eastern United States is at the second-highest risk of karst sinkholes.\nIn Canada, Wood Buffalo National Park, Northwest Territories contains areas of karst sinkholes. Mexico hosts important karst regions in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Chiapas. The West of Ireland is home to The Burren, a karst limestone area. The South China Karst in the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nList of terms for karst-related features.\nMany karst-related terms derive from South Slavic languages, entering scientific vocabulary through early research in the Western Balkan Dinaric Alpine karst.\nKarst studies.\nThe study of the various aspects of karst regions is called karst studies, karst science, or karstology. This includes biological, chemical, ecological, geomorphological, hydrogeological, hydrological, political, socio-economical, and other processes over a variety of spatial and temporal scales in karst regions, with the purpose of understanding karst aquifers and ecosystems, and the development of the surface and underground structure, so that the environment can be protected and human activities planned effectively. Prominent karst researchers include Jovan Cviji\u0107 and William Morris Davis.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17023", "revid": "13791031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17023", "title": "Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact", "text": "1928 international agreement\nThe Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact or Pact of Paris \u2013 officially the General Treaty for Renunciation of War as an Instrument of National Policy \u2013 is a 1928 international agreement on peace in which signatory states promised not to use war to resolve \"disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them\". The pact was signed by Germany, France, and the United States on 27 August 1928, and by most other states soon after. Sponsored by France and the U.S., the Pact is named after its authors, United States Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg and French foreign minister Aristide Briand. The pact was concluded outside the League of Nations and remains in effect.\nA common criticism is that the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact did not live up to all of its aims but has arguably had some success. It was unable to prevent the Second World War but was the basis for trial and execution of wartime German leaders in 1946. Furthermore, declared wars became very rare after 1945. It has been ridiculed for its moralism, legalism, and lack of influence on foreign policy. The pact had no mechanism for enforcement, and many historians and political scientists see it as mostly irrelevant and ineffective. Nevertheless, the pact served as the legal basis for the concept of a crime against peace, for which the Nuremberg Tribunal and Tokyo Tribunal tried and executed the top leaders responsible for starting World War II.\nSimilar provisions to those in the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact were later incorporated into the Charter of the United Nations and other treaties, which gave rise to a more activist American foreign policy which began with the signing of the pact.\nText.\nThe main text is very short:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article I\nThe High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.\nArticle II\nThe High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.\nParties.\nThe plan was devised by American lawyers Salmon Levinson and James T. Shotwell, and promoted by Senator William E. Borah.\nBorah and U.S. diplomat William Richards Castle Jr., Assistant Secretary of State, played key roles after Kellogg and Briand agreed on a two party treaty between the U.S. and France. It was originally intended as a bilateral treaty, but Castle worked to expand it to a multinational agreement that included practically the entire world. Castle managed to overcome French objections through his discussions with the French ambassador, replacing the narrow Franco-American agreement with a treaty that attracted almost all major and minor nations.\nThe pact was first signed on 27 August 1928 in Paris at the French Foreign Ministry by the representatives from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, the Irish Free State, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, and the United States. It took effect on 24 July 1929.\nBy that date, the following nations had deposited instruments of ratification of the pact:\n12 additional parties joined after that date: Persia, Greece, Honduras, Chile, Luxembourg, Danzig, Costa Rica, Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay, Switzerland and the Dominican Republic for a total of 57 state parties by 1929. Six states joined between 1930 and 1934: Haiti, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Iraq and Brazil. After the Second World War, Barbados declared its accession to the treaty in 1971, followed by Fiji (1973), Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica (both 1988), the Czech Republic and Slovakia (after Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1993), and, as a result of the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Slovenia (1992), Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia (both in 1994). The Free City of Danzig, which had joined the Pact in 1929, ceased to exist in 1939 and became a regular part of Poland after World War II.\nIn the United States, the Senate approved the treaty 85\u20131, with only Wisconsin Republican John J. Blaine voting against over concerns with British imperialism. While the U.S. Senate did not add any reservations to the treaty, it did pass a measure which interpreted the treaty as not infringing upon the United States' right of self-defense and not obliging the nation to enforce it by taking action against those who violated it.\nEffect and legacy.\nThe 1928 Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact was concluded outside the League of Nations and remains in effect. One month following its conclusion, a similar agreement, the General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, was concluded in Geneva, which obliged its signatory parties to establish conciliation commissions in any case of dispute. With the signing of the Litvinov Protocol in Moscow on February 9, 1929, the Soviet Union and its western neighbors, including Romania, agreed to put the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact in effect without waiting for other western signatories to ratify. The Bessarabian question had made agreement between Romania and the Soviet Union challenging and dispute between the nations over Bessarabia continued. The pact's central provisions renouncing the use of war, and promoting peaceful settlement of disputes and the use of collective force to prevent aggression, were incorporated into the United Nations Charter and other treaties. Although civil wars continued, wars between established states have been rare since 1945, with a few major exceptions such as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and various conflicts in the Middle East.\nAs a practical matter, the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact did not live up to its primary aims, but has arguably had some success. It did not end war or stop the rise of militarism, and was unable to keep the international peace in succeeding years. Its legacy remains as a statement of the idealism expressed by advocates for peace in the interwar period. However, it also helped to erase the legal distinction between war and peace, because the signatories, having renounced the use of war, began to wage wars without declaring them, as in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935, the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939, and the German and Soviet invasions of Poland.\nThe popular perception of the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact was best summarized by Eric Sevareid who, in a nationally televised series on American diplomacy between the two world wars, referred to the pact as a \"worthless piece of paper\". In his history of Europe from 1914 to 1948, historian Ian Kershaw referred to the Pact as \"vacuous\" and said that it was \"a dead letter from the moment it was signed.\"\nWhile the Pact has been ridiculed for its moralism and legalism and lack of influence on foreign policy, it did lead to a more activist American foreign policy. Legal scholars Scott J. Shapiro and Oona A. Hathaway have argued that the Pact inaugurated \"a new era of human history\" characterized by the decline of inter-state war as a structuring dynamic of the international system. According to Shapiro and Hathaway one reason for the historical insignificance of the pact was the absence of an enforcement mechanism to compel compliance from signatories, since the pact only calls for violators to \"be denied of the benefits furnished by [the] treaty\". They also said that the Pact appealed to the West because it promised to secure and protect previous conquests, thus securing their place at the head of the international legal order indefinitely. They wrote in 2017:\nAs its effects reverberated across the globe, it reshaped the world map, catalyzed the human rights revolution, enabled the use of economic sanctions as a tool of law enforcement, and ignited the explosion in the number of international organizations that regulate so many aspects of our daily lives.\nHathaway and Shapiro show that between 1816 and 1928 there was on average one military conquest every ten months. After 1945, in very sharp contrast, the number of such conflicts declined to one in every four years.\nThe pact, in addition to binding the particular nations that signed it, has also served as one of the legal bases establishing the international norms that the threat or use of military force in contravention of international law, as well as the territorial acquisitions resulting from it, are unlawful. The interdiction of aggressive war was confirmed and broadened by the United Nations Charter, which provides in article 2, paragraph 4, that \"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\" One legal consequence is that it is unlawful to annex territory by force, although other forms of annexation have not been prevented. More broadly, there is now a strong presumption against the legality of using, or threatening, military force against another country. Nations that have resorted to the use of force since the Charter came into effect have typically invoked self-defense or the right of collective defense.\nNotably, the pact also served as the legal basis for the concept of a crime against peace. It was for committing this crime that the Nuremberg Tribunal and Tokyo Tribunal tried and executed the top leaders responsible for starting World War II.\nPolitical scientists Julie Bunck and Michael Fowler in 2018 argued that the Pact was:\nan important early venture in multilateralism. ... [I]nternational law evolved to circumscribe the use of armed force with legal restrictions. The forcible acquisition of territory by conquest became illegitimate and individual criminal liability might attach to those who pursued it. In criminalizing war Kellogg\u2013Briand played a role in the development of a new norm of behavior in international relations, a norm that continues to play a role in our current international order.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

{"id": "17025", "revid": "35751661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17025", "title": "Kidney", "text": "Organ of the urinary system\nIn humans, the kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped blood-filtering organs that are a multilobar, multipapillary form of mammalian kidneys, usually without signs of external lobulation. They are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans are about in length. They receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder.\nThe kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluids, fluid osmolality, acid\u2013base balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins. Filtration occurs in the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. Examples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free water, sodium, bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids. Examples of substances secreted are hydrogen, ammonium, potassium and uric acid. The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each adult human kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons. The kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephrons. For example, they convert a precursor of vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol; and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a leading public health problem worldwide. The global estimated prevalence of CKD is 13.4%, and patients with kidney failure needing renal replacement therapy are estimated between 5 and 7 million. Procedures used in the management of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine (urinalysis), measurement of kidney function by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the serum creatinine; and kidney biopsy and CT scan to evaluate for abnormal anatomy. Dialysis and kidney transplantation are used to treat kidney failure; one (or both sequentially) of these are almost always used when renal function drops below 15%. Nephrectomy is frequently used to cure renal cell carcinoma.\nRenal physiology is the study of kidney function. Nephrology is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney \"function\": these include CKD, nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, acute kidney injury, and pyelonephritis. Urology addresses diseases of kidney (and urinary tract) \"anatomy\": these include cancer, renal cysts, kidney stones and ureteral stones, and urinary tract obstruction.\nThe word \"renal\" is an adjective meaning \"relating to the kidneys\", and its roots are French or late Latin. Whereas according to some opinions, \"renal\" should be replaced with \"kidney\" in scientific writings such as \"kidney artery\", other experts have advocated preserving the use of \"renal\" as appropriate including in \"renal artery\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStructure.\nIn humans, the kidneys are located high in the abdominal cavity, one on each side of the spine, and lie in a retroperitoneal position at a slightly oblique angle. The asymmetry within the abdominal cavity, caused by the position of the liver, typically results in the right kidney being slightly lower and smaller than the left, and being placed slightly more to the middle than the left kidney. The left kidney is approximately at the vertebral level T12 to L3, and the right is slightly lower. The right kidney sits just below the diaphragm and posterior to the liver. The left kidney sits below the diaphragm and posterior to the spleen. On top of each kidney is an adrenal gland. The upper parts of the kidneys are partially protected by the 11th and 12th ribs. Each kidney, with its adrenal gland is surrounded by two layers of fat: the perirenal fat present between renal fascia and renal capsule and pararenal fat superior to the renal fascia.\nThe human kidney is a bean-shaped structure with a convex and a concave border. A recessed area on the concave border is the renal hilum, where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein and ureter leave. The kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the renal capsule, which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal fat. The anterior (front) surface of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior (rear) surface is the transversalis fascia.\nThe superior pole of the right kidney is adjacent to the liver. For the left kidney, it is next to the spleen. Both, therefore, move down upon inhalation.\nA Danish study measured the median renal length to be on the left side and on the right side in adults. Median renal volumes were on the left and on the right.\nGross anatomy.\nThe functional substance, or parenchyma, of the human kidney is divided into two major structures: the outer renal cortex and the inner renal medulla. Grossly, these structures take the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped renal lobes, each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid. Between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called renal columns.\nThe tip, or papilla, of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx; minor calyces empty into major calyces, and major calyces empty into the renal pelvis. This becomes the ureter. At the hilum, the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney and the renal artery enters. Hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes surround these structures. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the renal sinus. The renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue.\nThe kidneys possess no overtly moving structures.\nBlood supply.\nThe kidneys receive blood from the renal arteries, left and right, which branch directly from the abdominal aorta. The kidneys receive approximately 20\u201325% of cardiac output in adult human. Each renal artery branches into segmental arteries, dividing further into interlobar arteries, which penetrate the renal capsule and extend through the renal columns between the renal pyramids. The interlobar arteries then supply blood to the arcuate arteries that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla. Each arcuate artery supplies several interlobular arteries that feed into the afferent arterioles that supply the glomeruli.\nBlood drains from the kidneys, ultimately into the inferior vena cava. After filtration occurs, the blood moves through a small network of small veins (venules) that converge into interlobular veins. As with the arteriole distribution, the veins follow the same pattern: the interlobular provide blood to the arcuate veins then back to the interlobar veins, which come to form the renal veins which exit the kidney.\nNerve supply.\nThe kidney and nervous system communicate via the renal plexus, whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney. Input from the sympathetic nervous system triggers vasoconstriction in the kidney, thereby reducing renal blood flow. The kidney also receives input from the parasympathetic nervous system, by way of the renal branches of the vagus nerve; the function of this is yet unclear. Sensory input from the kidney travels to the T10\u201311 levels of the spinal cord and is sensed in the corresponding dermatome. Thus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.\nMicroanatomy.\nRenal histology is the study of the microscopic structure of the kidney. The adult human kidney contains at least 26 distinct cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, stromal and smooth muscle cells. Distinct cell types include:\nGene and protein expression.\nIn humans, about 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and almost 70% of these genes are expressed in normal, adult kidneys. Just over 300 genes are more specifically expressed in the kidney, with only some 50 genes being highly specific for the kidney. Many of the corresponding kidney specific proteins are expressed in the cell membrane and function as transporter proteins. The highest expressed kidney specific protein is uromodulin, the most abundant protein in urine with functions that prevent calcification and growth of bacteria. Specific proteins are expressed in the different compartments of the kidney with podocin and nephrin expressed in glomeruli, Solute carrier family protein SLC22A8 expressed in proximal tubules, calbindin expressed in distal tubules and aquaporin 2 expressed in the collecting duct cells.\nDevelopment.\nThe mammalian kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm. Kidney development, also called \"nephrogenesis\", proceeds through a series of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.\nFunction.\nThe kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by metabolism into the urine. The microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. It processes the blood supplied to it via filtration, reabsorption, secretion and excretion; the consequence of those processes is the production of urine. These include the nitrogenous wastes urea, from protein catabolism, and uric acid, from nucleic acid metabolism. The ability of mammals and some birds to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine much smaller than the volume of blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate countercurrent multiplication mechanism. This requires several independent nephron characteristics to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop, and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb. In addition, passive countercurrent exchange by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the nephron is essential for enabling this function.\nThe kidney participates in whole-body homeostasis, regulating acid\u2013base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs, particularly those of the endocrine system. Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions; these include renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.\nFormation of urine.\nFiltration.\nFiltration, which takes place at the renal corpuscle, is the process by which cells and large proteins are retained while materials of smaller molecular weights are filtered from the blood to make an ultrafiltrate that eventually becomes urine. The adult human kidney generates approximately 180 liters of filtrate a day, most of which is reabsorbed. The normal range for a twenty four hour urine volume collection is 800 to 2,000 milliliters per day. The process is also known as hydrostatic filtration due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the capillary walls.\nReabsorption.\nReabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the peritubular capillary network that surrounds the nephron tubules. It is accomplished via selective receptors on the luminal cell membrane. Water is 55% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Glucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The mechanism for this is the Na+/glucose cotransporter. A plasma level of 350\u00a0mg/dL will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost in the urine. A plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.\nAmino acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule. Hartnup disease is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter, which results in pellagra.\nSecretion.\nSecretion is the reverse of reabsorption: molecules are transported from the peritubular capillary through the interstitial fluid, then through the renal tubular cell and into the ultrafiltrate.\nExcretion.\nThe last step in the processing of the ultrafiltrate is \"excretion\": the ultrafiltrate passes out of the nephron and travels through a tube called the \"collecting duct\", which is part of the collecting duct system, and then to the ureters where it is renamed \"urine\". In addition to transporting the ultrafiltrate, the collecting duct also takes part in reabsorption.\nHormone secretion.\nThe kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, calcitriol, and renin. Erythropoietin (EPO) is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. Calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate. Renin is an enzyme which regulates angiotensin and aldosterone levels.\nBlood pressure regulation.\nAlthough the kidney cannot directly sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly depends upon the kidney. This primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration. Renin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make up the renin\u2013angiotensin system. Changes in renin ultimately alter the output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone. Each hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment and raising blood pressure. When renin levels are elevated, the concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase in blood pressure. Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment, and decreasing blood pressure.\nAcid\u2013base balance.\nThe two organ systems that help regulate the body's acid\u2013base balance are the kidneys and lungs. Acid\u2013base homeostasis is the maintenance of pH around a value of 7.4. The lungs are the part of respiratory system which helps to maintain acid\u2013base homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the blood. The respiratory system is the first line of defense when the body experiences and acid\u2013base problem. It attempts to return the body pH to a value of 7.4 by controlling the respiratory rate. When the body is experiencing acidic conditions, it will increase the respiratory rate which in turn drives off CO2 and decreases the H+ concentration, therefore increasing the pH. In basic conditions, the respiratory rate will slow down so that the body holds onto more CO2 and increases the H+ concentration and decreases the pH.\nThe kidneys have two cells that help to maintain acid-base homeostasis: intercalated A and B cells. The intercalated A cells are stimulated when the body is experiencing acidic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the high concentration of CO2 in the blood creates a gradient for CO2 to move into the cell and push the reaction HCO3 + H \u2194 H2CO3 \u2194 CO2 + H2O to the left. On the luminal side of the cell there is a H+ pump and a H/K exchanger. These pumps move H+ against their gradient and therefore require ATP. These cells will remove H+ from the blood and move it to the filtrate which helps to increase the pH of the blood. On the basal side of the cell there is a HCO3/Cl exchanger and a Cl/K co-transporter (facilitated diffusion). When the reaction is pushed to the left it also increases the HCO3 concentration in the cell and HCO3 is then able to move out into the blood which additionally raises the pH. The intercalated B cell responds very similarly, however, the membrane proteins are flipped from the intercalated A cells: the proton pumps are on the basal side and the HCO3/Cl exchanger and K/Cl co-transporter are on the luminal side. They function the same, but now release protons into the blood to decrease the pH.\nRegulation of osmolality.\nThe kidneys help maintain the water and salt level of the body. Any significant rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.\nMeasuring function.\nVarious calculations and methods are used to try to measure kidney function. Renal clearance is the volume of plasma from which the substance is completely cleared from the blood per unit time. The filtration fraction is the amount of plasma that is actually filtered through the kidney. This can be defined using the equation. The kidney is a very complex organ and mathematical modelling has been used to better understand kidney function at several scales, including fluid uptake and secretion.\nClinical significance.\nNephrology is the subspeciality under Internal Medicine that deals with kidney function and disease states related to renal malfunction and their management including dialysis and kidney transplantation. Urology is the specialty under Surgery that deals with kidney structure abnormalities such as kidney cancer and cysts and problems with urinary tract. Nephrologists are internists, and urologists are surgeons, whereas both are often called \"kidney doctors\". There are overlapping areas that both nephrologists and urologists can provide care such as kidney stones and kidney related infections.\nThere are many causes of kidney disease. Some causes are acquired over the course of life, such as diabetic nephropathy whereas others are congenital, such as polycystic kidney disease.\nMedical terms related to the kidneys commonly use terms such as \"renal\" and the prefix \"nephro-\". The adjective \"renal\", meaning related to the kidney, is from the Latin \"r\u0113n\u0113s\", meaning kidneys; the prefix \"nephro-\" is from the Ancient Greek word for kidney, \"nephros (\u03bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2)\". For example, surgical removal of the kidney is a \"nephrectomy\", while a reduction in kidney function is called \"renal dysfunction\".\nKidney injury and failure.\nGenerally, humans can live normally with just one kidney, as one has more functioning renal tissue than is needed to survive. Only when the amount of functioning kidney tissue is greatly diminished does one develop chronic kidney disease. Renal replacement therapy, in the form of dialysis or kidney transplantation, is indicated when the glomerular filtration rate has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction leads to severe symptoms.\nDialysis.\nDialysis is a treatment that substitutes for the function of normal kidneys. Dialysis may be instituted when approximately 85%\u201390% of kidney function is lost, as indicated by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 15. Dialysis removes metabolic waste products as well as excess water and sodium (thereby contributing to regulating blood pressure); and maintains many chemical levels within the body. Life expectancy is 5\u201310 years for those on dialysis; some live up to 30 years. Dialysis can occur via the blood (through a catheter or arteriovenous fistula), or through the peritoneum (peritoneal dialysis). Hemodialysis is typically administered three times a week for several hours at free-standing dialysis centers, allowing recipients to lead an otherwise essentially normal life.\nDiagnosis.\nMany renal diseases are diagnosed on the basis of a detailed medical history, and physical examination. The medical history takes into account present and past symptoms, especially those of kidney disease; recent infections; exposure to substances toxic to the kidney; and family history of kidney disease.\nKidney function is tested by using blood tests and urine tests. The most common blood tests are creatinine, urea and electrolytes. Urine tests such as urinalysis can evaluate for pH, protein, glucose, and the presence of blood. Microscopic analysis can also identify the presence of urinary casts and crystals. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be directly measured (\"measured GFR\", or mGFR) but this rarely done in everyday practice. Instead, special equations are used to calculate GFR (\"estimated GFR\", or eGFR).\nImaging.\nRenal ultrasonography is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. Other modalities, such as CT and MRI, should always be considered as supplementary imaging modalities in the assessment of renal disease.\nBiopsy.\nThe role of the renal biopsy is to diagnose renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies). In general, a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data, ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis. A renal pathologist is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens.\nIdeally, multiple core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy (presence of glomeruli) intraoperatively. A pathologist/pathology assistant divides the specimen(s) for submission for light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy.\nThe pathologist will examine the specimen using light microscopy with multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin/H&amp;E, PAS, trichrome, silver stain) on multiple level sections. Multiple immunofluorescence stains are performed to evaluate for antibody, protein and complement deposition. Finally, ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities that may suggest an etiology for the patient's renal disease.\nOther animals.\nIn the majority of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult, albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying a significant portion of the trunk. The collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into an \"archinephric duct\", which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes. However, the situation is not always so simple; in cartilaginous fish and some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter, which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. Indeed, in many cartilaginous fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function altogether in the adult.\nIn the most primitive vertebrates, the hagfish and lampreys, the kidney is unusually simple: it consists of a row of nephrons, each emptying directly into the archinephric duct. Invertebrates may possess excretory organs that are sometimes referred to as \"kidneys\", but, even in \"Amphioxus\", these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates, and are more accurately referred to by other names, such as nephridia. In amphibians, kidneys and the urinary bladder harbour specialized parasites, monogeneans of the family Polystomatidae.\nThe kidneys of reptiles consist of a number of lobules arranged in a broadly linear pattern. Each lobule contains a single branch of the ureter in its centre, into which the collecting ducts empty. Reptiles have relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly because of their lower metabolic rate.\nBirds have relatively large, elongated kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct lobes. The lobes consists of several small, irregularly arranged, lobules, each centred on a branch of the ureter. Birds have small glomeruli, but about twice as many nephrons as similarly sized mammals.\nThe human kidney is fairly typical of that of mammals. Distinctive features of the mammalian kidney, in comparison with that of other vertebrates, include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids and a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla. The latter feature is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle; these are much shorter in birds, and not truly present in other vertebrates (although the nephron often has a short \"intermediate segment\" between the convoluted tubules). It is only in mammals that the kidney takes on its classical \"kidney\" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds and cetaceans.\nEvolutionary adaptation.\nKidneys of various animals show evidence of evolutionary adaptation and have long been studied in ecophysiology and comparative physiology. Kidney morphology, often indexed as the relative medullary thickness, is associated with habitat aridity among species of mammals and diet (e.g., carnivores have only long loops of Henle).\nSociety and culture.\nSignificance.\nEgyptian.\nIn ancient Egypt, the kidneys, like the heart, were left inside the mummified bodies, unlike other organs which were removed. Comparing this to the biblical statements, and to drawings of human body with the heart and two kidneys portraying a set of scales for weighing justice, it seems that the Egyptian beliefs had also connected the kidneys with judgement and perhaps with moral decisions.\nHebrew.\nAccording to studies in modern and ancient Hebrew, various body organs in humans and animals served also an emotional or logical role, today mostly attributed to the brain and the endocrine system. The kidney is mentioned in several biblical verses in conjunction with the heart, much as the bowels were understood to be the \"seat\" of emotion \u2013 grief, joy and pain. Similarly, the Talmud (\"Berakhoth\" 61.a) states that one of the two kidneys counsels what is good, and the other evil.\nIn the sacrifices offered at the biblical Tabernacle and later on at the temple in Jerusalem, the priests were instructed to remove the kidneys and the adrenal gland covering the kidneys of the sheep, goat and cattle offerings, and to burn them on the altar, as the holy part of the \"offering for God\" never to be eaten.\nIndia: Ayurvedic system.\nIn ancient India, according to the Ayurvedic medical systems, the kidneys were considered the beginning of the excursion channels system, the 'head' of the \"Mutra Srota\"s, receiving from all other systems, and therefore important in determining a person's health balance and temperament by the balance and mixture of the three 'Dosha's \u2013 the three health elements: Vatha (or Vata) \u2013 air, Pitta \u2013 bile, and Kapha \u2013 mucus. The temperament and health of a person can then be seen in the resulting color of the urine.\nModern Ayurveda practitioners, a practice which is characterized as pseudoscience, have attempted to revive these methods in medical procedures as part of Ayurveda Urine therapy. These procedures have been called \"nonsensical\" by skeptics.\nMedieval Christianity.\nThe Latin term \"renes\" is related to the English word \"reins\", a synonym for the kidneys in Shakespearean English (e.g. \"Merry Wives of Windsor\" 3.5), which was also the time when the King James Version of the Bible was translated. Kidneys were once popularly regarded as the seat of the conscience and reflection, and a number of verses in the Bible (e.g. Ps. 7:9, Rev. 2:23) state that God searches out and inspects the kidneys, or \"reins\", of humans, together with the heart.\nHistory.\nKidney stones have been identified and recorded about as long as written historical records exist. The urinary tract including the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been described by Galen in the second century AD.\nThe first to examine the ureter through an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was Hampton Young in 1929. This was improved on by VF Marshall who is the first published use of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred in 1964. The insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing the uterers and urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941. Such an approach differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within the urinary system employed during the preceding two millennia.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17027", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17027", "title": "Kermit (protocol)", "text": "File transfer protocol\nKermit is a computer file transfer and management protocol and a set of communications software tools primarily used in the early years of personal computing in the 1980s. It provides a consistent approach to file transfer, terminal emulation, script programming, and character set conversion across many different computer hardware and operating system platforms.\nTechnical.\nThe Kermit protocol supports text and binary file transfers on both full-duplex and half-duplex 8-bit and 7-bit serial connections in a system- and medium-independent fashion, and is implemented on hundreds of different computer and operating system platforms. On full-duplex connections, a sliding window protocol is used with selective retransmission which provides excellent performance and error recovery characteristics. On 7-bit connections, locking shifts provide efficient transfer of 8-bit data. When properly implemented, as in the Columbia University Kermit Software collection, its authors claim performance is equal to or better than other protocols such as ZMODEM, YMODEM, and XMODEM, especially on poor connections. On connections over RS-232 Statistical Multiplexers where some control characters cannot be transmitted, Kermit can be configured to work, unlike protocols like XMODEM that require the connection to be transparent (i.e. all 256 possible values of a byte to be transferable).\nKermit can be used as a means to bootstrap other software, even itself. To distribute Kermit through non 8-bit clean networks Columbia developed .boo, a binary-to-text encoding system similar to BinHex. For instance, IBM PC compatibles and Apple computers with a Compatibility Card installed can connect to otherwise incompatible systems such as a mainframe computer to receive MS-DOS Kermit in .boo format. Users can then type in a \"baby Kermit\" in BASIC on their personal computers that downloads Kermit and converts it into binary.\nSimilarly, CP/M machines use many different floppy disk formats, which means that one machine often cannot read disks from another CP/M machine, and Kermit is used as part of a process to transfer applications and data between CP/M machines and other machines with different operating systems. The CP/M file-copy program PIP can usually access a computer's serial (RS-232) port, and if configured to use a very low baud rate (because it has no built-in error correction) can be used to transfer a small, simple version of Kermit from one machine to another over a null modem cable, or failing that, a very simple version of the Kermit protocol can be hand coded in binary in less than 2K using DDT, the CP/M Dynamic Debugging Tool. Once done, the simple version of Kermit can be used to download a fully functional version. That version can then be used to transfer any CP/M application or data.\nNewer versions of Kermit included scripting language and automation of commands. The Kermit scripting language evolved from its TOPS-20 EXEC-inspired command language and was influenced syntactically and semantically by ALGOL 60, C, BLISS-10, PL/I, SNOBOL, and LISP.\nThe correctness of the Kermit protocol has been verified with formal methods.\nHistory.\nIn the late 1970s, most of Columbia University's mainframe computers had \u226464 kilobytes of total memory to work with. Kermit was developed at the university so students could move files between them and floppy disks at various microcomputers around campus, such as IBM or DEC DECSYSTEM-20 mainframes and Intertec Superbrains running CP/M. IBM mainframes used an EBCDIC character set and CP/M and DEC machines used ASCII, so conversion between the two character sets was one of the early functions built into Kermit.\nThe protocol was originally designed in 1981 by Frank da Cruz and Bill Catchings. The first file transfer with Kermit occurred in April 1981.\nColumbia University coordinated development of versions of Kermit for many different computers at the university and elsewhere, and distributed the software for free; Kermit for the new IBM Personal Computer became especially popular. In 1986 the university founded the Kermit Project, which took over development and started charging fees for commercial use; the project was financially self-sufficient. For non-commercial use, Columbia University stated that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Kermit is for everyone to use and share. Once you get it, feel free to pass it along to your friends and colleagues. Although it is copyrighted and not in the public domain, we only ask that you not attempt to sell it for profit, and that you use it only for peaceful and humane purposes.\nBy 1988 Kermit was available on more than 300 computers and operating systems. The protocol became a de facto data communications standard for transferring files between dissimilar computer systems, and by the early 1990s it could convert multilingual character encodings. Kermit software has been used in many countries, for tasks ranging from simple student assignments to solving compatibility problems aboard the International Space Station. It was ported to a wide variety of mainframe, minicomputer and microcomputer systems down to handhelds and electronic pocket calculators. Most versions had a user interface based on the original TOPS-20 Kermit. Later versions of some Kermit implementations also support network as well as serial connections.\nImplementations that are presently supported include C-Kermit (for Unix and OpenVMS) and Kermit 95 (for versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 onwards and OS/2), but other versions remain available as well.\nAs of 1 July 2011, Columbia University ceased to host this project and released it as open source. In June 2011, the Kermit Project released a beta version of C-Kermit v9.0 under the Revised 3-Clause BSD License.\nAs well as the implementations developed and/or distributed by Columbia University, the Kermit protocol was implemented in a number of third-party communications software packages, among others ProComm and ProComm Plus. The term \"SuperKermit\" was coined by third-party vendors to refer to higher speed Kermit implementations offering features such as full duplex operation, sliding windows, and long packets; however, that term was deprecated by the original Kermit team at Columbia University, who saw these as simply features of the core Kermit protocol.\nNaming and copyright.\nKermit was named after Kermit the Frog from The Muppets, with permission from Henson Associates. The program's icon in the Apple Macintosh version was a depiction of Kermit the Frog. A backronym was created, perhaps to avoid trademark issues, \"KL10\" Error-Free Reciprocal Microprocessor Interchange over TTY lines, but the developers stopped using the backronym after obtaining permission.\nKermit is an open protocol\u2014anybody can base their own program on it, but some Kermit software and source code is copyright by Columbia University. The final license page said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As of version 9.0 (starting with the first Beta test), C-Kermit has an Open Source license, the Revised 3-Clause BSD License. Everybody can use it as they wish for any purpose, including redistribution and resale. It may be included with any operating system where it works or can be made to work, including both free and commercial versions of Unix and Hewlett-Packard (formerly DEC) VMS (OpenVMS). Technical support will be available from Columbia University only through 30 June 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17029", "revid": "35675705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17029", "title": "Kermit the Frog", "text": "Muppet character\nKermit the Frog is a Muppet character created in 1955 and originally performed by Jim Henson. An anthropomorphic green frog, Kermit is the pragmatic everyman protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably as the showrunner and host of the sketch comedy television series \"The Muppet Show\" and a featured role on \"Sesame Street\". He has appeared in other television series, feature films, specials, and public service announcements through the years. He also served as a mascot of The Jim Henson Company and appeared in various Henson projects until 2004, when the character was acquired by The Walt Disney Company.\nKermit performed the hit singles \"Bein' Green\" in 1970 for \"Sesame Street\" and \"Rainbow Connection\" in 1979 for \"The Muppet Movie\", the first feature-length film featuring the Muppets. Kermit's original performance of \"Rainbow Connection\" reached No. 25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry in 2021. Henson performed Kermit until his death in 1990, after which Steve Whitmire performed Kermit from that time until his dismissal in 2016; Kermit has been performed by Matt Vogel since 2017. He was also voiced by Frank Welker in \"Muppet Babies\" and occasionally in other animation projects, and is voiced by Matt Danner in the 2018 reboot of \"Muppet Babies\".\nKermit has remained as a recognizable character in popular culture worldwide for over half a century, starring in several television series and films, and receiving dozens of honors and awards by various organizations. In 2006, the character was credited as the author of \"Before You Leap: A Frog's Eye View of Life's Greatest Lessons\", an \"autobiography\" told from the perspective of the character himself.\nHistory and development.\nKermit the Frog first appeared on local programs and commercials broadcast on WRC-TV, most notably \"Sam and Friends\". This prototype Kermit was created from a discarded turquoise spring coat belonging to Jim Henson's mother and two ping pong ball halves for eyes.\nInitially, Kermit was a vague lizard-like creature. He subsequently made a number of television appearances before his status as a frog was established in the television special \"Hey, Cinderella!\" in 1969. His triangular-pointed collar was added at the time to make him seem more frog-like and to conceal the seam between his head and body. According to Michael K. Frith, the relatively simple construction of the Kermit puppet allows the performer's arm and hand to produce a wide range of expression and gestures.\nNaming.\nThe origin of Kermit's name is a subject of some debate. It is often claimed that Kermit was named after Henson's childhood friend Kermit Scott, from Leland, Mississippi. However, Karen Falk, head archivist and board of directors member for the Jim Henson Legacy organization, denies this claim, stating that Henson merely liked how the named sounded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJoy DiMenna, the only daughter of Kermit Kalman Cohen, who worked as a sound engineer at WBAL-TV during Jim Henson's time with \"Sam and Friends\", recalls that the puppet was named after her father. According to Cohen's obituary, as well as DiMenna and Lenny Levin, a colleague of Cohen's at WBAL:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The late puppeteer had been the host of a show, \"Sam and Friends\", at WRC-TV in Washington when he was invited to tour WBAL's studios. Both were NBC affiliates then, and WBAL carried the show, Mr. Levin said.\nMr. Henson was introduced to members of the sound and camera crew, including Mr. Cohen.\n\"When he heard his name, Jim turned around, snapped his fingers and said to his wife, 'That's what we call the frog \u2013 Kermit.'\"\nAnother common belief is that Kermit was named for Kermit Love, who worked with Henson in designing and constructing Muppets, particularly on \"Sesame Street\". However, Love's association with Henson did not begin until well after Kermit's creation and naming, and he always denied any connection between his name and that of the character.\nAs \"Sesame Street\" is localized for some different markets that speak languages other than English, Kermit is often renamed. In Portugal, he is called \"Cocas, o Sapo\" (\"sapo\" means \"toad\"). In Brazil, his name is similar to his name in Portugal: \"Caco, o Sapo\". In most of Hispanic America, his name is \"la rana Ren\u00e9\" (\"Ren\u00e9 the Frog\"), while in Spain, he is named \"Gustavo\". In the Arabic version, he is known as \"Kamel\", which is a common Arabic male name that means \"perfect\". In Hungary, he is called \"Breki\" (onomatopoetic).\nCharacterization and performers.\nJim Henson originated the character in 1955 on his local television series, \"Sam and Friends\". Jim Henson described Kermit as \"kind of easy-going, very likable...sometimes slightly a wiseguy.\" Frank Oz remarked that Kermit possesses a natural sense of leadership within the Muppets, explaining that \"he has all these zany characters and a world around him and he tries to be the center and hold everything together...sometimes he gets too much and blows his top, but essentially he kind of goes with the flow.\" Brian Henson described his father's performance as Kermit as \"coming out of his own personality\u2014was a wry intelligence, a little bit of a naughtiness, but Kermit always loved everyone around and also loved a good prank.\"\nKermit has often been referred to as Jim Henson's \"soft-spoken alter-ego.\" Many of Jim Henson's colleagues have confirmed how close and inseparable he and Kermit's personalities were. Jim Henson's agent Bernie Brillstein has stated straightforwardly that \"Kermit was Jim\". Author Brian Jay Jones described the relationship accordingly: \"The more Jim performed Kermit, the more the two of them seemed to become intertwined\u2026it was becoming harder to tell where the frog ended and Jim began.\" Jim Henson continued to perform the character until his death in 1990. His last performance as Kermit was for an appearance on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" to promote the television special \"The Muppets at Walt Disney World\". Jim Henson died twelve days after that appearance.\nFollowing his death, veteran Muppet performer Steve Whitmire was named Kermit's new performer. Whitmire claims that Jim Henson had seemingly intended to pass on the role to him before he died, though it was Jane Henson and son Brian who had selected him. Whitmire's first public performance as Kermit was at the end of the television special \"The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson\" in 1990. Whitmire explained that his main intent when he inherited Kermit \"was to make sure the character stayed the same and consistent, but didn't become stale and just a copy.\"\nKermit's personality during Whitmire's tenure was widely described as more wholesome, lighthearted, and Pollyanna-ish than Jim Henson's. Several critics of Whitmire's portrayal have come from the Henson family. Brian Henson stated that while Whitmire's performance was \"sometimes excellent, and always pretty good\", he also elaborated that \"Kermit has, as a character, flattened out over time and has become too square and not as vital as it should have been.\" Cheryl Henson stated that Whitmire performed the character as a \"bitter, angry, depressed, victim\". He remained Kermit's principal performer until October 2016, when he was dismissed by The Muppets Studio and its parent company Disney, which own the rights to Kermit. Disney cited \"unacceptable business conduct\" as reason for the dismissal, while Whitmire claims the decision was made due to creative disagreements over Kermit's characterization and prolonged labor union negotiations that delayed his involvement in Muppet productions.\nDisney announced that Matt Vogel would become Kermit's new performer on July 10, 2017. Vogel's first official appearance as Kermit was in a \"Muppet Thought of the Week\u201d video released on YouTube.\nJohn Kennedy performed Kermit for \"Muppets Ahoy!\", a 2006 Disney Cruise Line stage show (though Whitmire performed Kermit for the first few shows). Muppet performer Artie Esposito briefly performed Kermit in 2009 for a few personal appearances (an appearance on \"America's Got Talent\", the \"MTV Video Music Awards\", and at the 2009 D23 Expo). Voice actor Frank Welker provided the voice of Baby Kermit on the animated Saturday morning cartoon, \"Muppet Babies\". He also provided the voice of an adult Kermit for a short-lived spin-off, \"Little Muppet Monsters\". Brian Cummings voiced Kermit in a 1995 CBS promotion. Wally Wingert provided the voice of Baby Kermit in a \"Muppet Babies\" CD-ROM. Matt Danner voices Baby Kermit on the 2018 reboot of \"Muppet Babies\".\nFictional biography.\nA biography has been developed for Kermit the Frog as if he were an actual living performer rather than a puppet character. According to this fictional biography, he was born in Leland, Mississippi, alongside approximately 2,353 siblings; however, a 2011 \"interview\" on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" has him state that he was from the swamps of Louisiana.\nAs portrayed in the 2002 film \"Kermit's Swamp Years\", at the age of 12, he was the first of his siblings to leave the swamp and one of the first frogs to talk to humans. He is shown in the film encountering a 12-year-old Jim Henson (played by Christian Kebbel) for the first time.\nAccording to \"The Muppet Movie,\" Kermit returned to the swamp, where a passing agent (Dom DeLuise) noted he had talent. Thus inspired, Kermit headed to Hollywood, encountering the rest of the Muppets along the way. Together, they were given a standard \"rich and famous\" contract by Lew Lord (Orson Welles) of Wide World Studios and began their showbiz careers. In \"Before You Leap\", Kermit again references encountering Jim Henson sometime after the events depicted in the course of \"The Muppet Movie\" and details their friendship and their partnership in the entertainment industry, crediting Henson as being the individual to whom he owes his fame. At some point after the events of \"The Muppet Movie\", Kermit and the other Muppets begin \"The Muppet Show\", and the characters remain together as a group, before starring in the other Muppet films and \"Muppets Tonight\", with Kermit usually at the core of the stories as the lead protagonist. Kermit is shown in \"The Muppet Movie\" as stating that the events of the film are \"approximately how it happened\" when asked by his nephew Robin about how the Muppets got started.\nFozzie Bear is portrayed as Kermit's best friend\u2014a fact reiterated by Kermit in \"Before You Leap\"\u2014and the two were frequently seen together during sketches on \"The Muppet Show\" and in other Muppet-related media and merchandise.\nOn August 4, 2015, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy \"announced\" that they had ended their romantic relationship. On September 2, 2015, Kermit was stated to have found a new girlfriend, a pig named Denise, but around February 2016, Denise supposedly broke up with Kermit after almost six months together.\nCareer.\nKermit has been featured prominently on both \"The Muppet Show\" and \"Sesame Street\", and is the only Muppet to do so in that capacity. However, he had a prominent career before \"Sesame Street\"'s debut in 1969, as he starred in \"Sam and Friends\", and numerous Muppets made guest appearances on \"Today\" from 1961 and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" from 1966.\n\"Sesame Street\".\nKermit was one of the original main Muppet characters on \"Sesame Street\". Closely identified with the show, Kermit usually appeared as a lecturer on simple topics, a straight man to another Muppet foil (usually Grover, Herry Monster or Cookie Monster), or a news reporter interviewing storybook characters for Sesame Street News. He sang many songs on the show, including \"Bein' Green\", and was the focus of the 1998 video \"The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street\".\nUnlike the rest of the show's Muppets, Kermit was never the property of Sesame Workshop and has only occasionally been a part of the show's merchandise. When Sesame Workshop bought full ownership of its characters from Henson for $180\u00a0million, Kermit was excluded from the deal. The character now belongs to The Muppets Studio, a division of Disney. His first \"Sesame Street\" appearance since Disney ownership was in an \"Elmo's World\" segment in the show's 40th-season premiere on November 10, 2009. His most recent appearance was in the 2019 television special \"Sesame Street's 50th Anniversary Celebration\", where he performed \"Bein' Green\" with Elvis Costello.\nWith the Muppets.\nIn \"The Muppet Show\" television series, Kermit was the central character, the showrunner, and the long-suffering stage manager of the theater show, trying to keep order amidst the chaos created by the other Muppets. Henson once claimed that Kermit's job on the \"Muppet Show\" was much like his own: \"trying to get a bunch of crazies to actually get the job done.\" It was on this show that the running gag of Kermit being pursued by leading lady Miss Piggy developed.\nOn \"Muppets Tonight\", Kermit was still a main character, although he was the producer rather than frontman. He appeared in many parody sketches such as \"NYPD Green\", \"City Schtickers\", \"Flippers\", and \"The Muppet Odd Squad\", as well as in the \"Psychiatrist's Office\" sketch.\nAs with most Disney characters, Kermit appears at various Disney theme parks. Kermit is featured in \"Muppet*Vision 3D\", an attraction that opened in 1991 and continues to run presently at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The character was also formerly featured in the aforementioned attraction in Disney California Adventure Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California until its closure in 2014. Kermit also appeared in \"The Muppets Present...Great Moments in American History\" at the Magic Kingdom from 2016 to 2020. He also appeared in two parades; Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade which ran at Disney's Hollywood Studios from 2001 to 2008 and Disney's Honorary VoluntEars Cavalcade which was held during 2010 at the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland.\nFilmography.\nKermit the Frog has appeared in almost every Muppet production, as well as making guest appearances in other shows and movies.\nBelow is a list of his more well-known appearances:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCultural impact.\nAccolades and commemorations.\n Kermit was awarded an honorary doctorate of Amphibious Letters (a pun on the more common honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters) on May 19, 1996, at Southampton College, New York, where he also gave a commencement speech. He is also the only \"amphibian\" to have had the honor of addressing the Oxford Union. A statue of Henson and Kermit was erected on the campus of Henson's alma mater, the University of Maryland, College Park in 2003. Kermit gave the commencement speech at the university for its graduating class of 2025.\nKermit was also given the honor of being the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade in 1996. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has featured a Kermit balloon since 1977. Kermit also served as the mascot for The Jim Henson Company, until the sale of the Muppet characters to Disney.\nOn November 14, 2002, Kermit the Frog received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the category of Television. The star is located at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. Kermit has two stars on the Walk of Fame, the other as a member of the collective The Muppets, which they received on March 20, 2012 in the category of Motion Pictures.\nOn Kermit's 50th birthday in 2005, the United States Postal Service released a set of new stamps with photos of Kermit and some of his fellow Muppets on them. The background of the stamp sheet features a photo of a silhouetted Henson sitting in a window well, with Kermit sitting in his lap looking at him.\nKermit was also the grand marshal for Michigan State University's homecoming parade in 2006.\nIn 2013, the original Kermit puppet from \"Sam and Friends\" was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. for display in the pop culture gallery. In 2015, the Leland Chamber of Commerce in Leland, Mississippi opened a small museum containing puppets and memorabilia dedicated to Kermit. A Kermit puppet can be seen at the National Museum of American History.\nKermit's legacy is also deeply entrenched in the science community. One of the famous WP-3D \"Orion\" research platforms flown by the NOAA Hurricane Hunters is named after Kermit. The other is named after Miss Piggy. In 2015, the discovery of the Costa Rican glass frog \"Hyalinobatrachium dianae\" also attracted viral media attention due to the creature's perceived resemblance to Kermit, with researcher Brian Kubicki quoted as saying \"I am glad that this species has ended up getting so much international attention, and in doing so it is highlighting the amazing amphibians that are native to Costa Rica and the need to continue exploring and studying the country's amazing tropical forests\". In 2024, researchers named \"Kermitops gratus\" as a new genus and species of fossil \"proto-amphibian\" from rocks dating to the early Permian period of Texas, US. The genus name, which means \"Kermit face\" in Greek, references the general resemblance of the fossil skull to the Muppets character's head.\nGuest television appearances.\nKermit has made numerous guest appearances on popular television shows, including co-hosting individual episodes of a number of long-running talk shows; among other television media. On April 2, 1979, Kermit guest-hosted \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" to promote \"The Muppet Movie\". From 1983 to 1995, the French political satire show \"Le B\u00e9b\u00eate Show\" used copies of various Muppets to parody key political figures, and Kermit renamed \"Kermitterrand\", embodied President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. On May 21, 2018, Kermit and contestant Maddie Poppe performed \"Rainbow Connection\" live on \"American Idol\".\nA still photo of Kermit sitting in his Director's chair with his megaphone in his hand from \"The Muppet Show\" appeared on a technical difficulties telop graphic on Metromedia owned-and-operated station KTTV Channel 11 in Los Angeles during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nAs an April Fool's joke, Kermit hosted CNN's \"Larry King Live\" in 1994 and interviewed Hulk Hogan. Kermit was also a semi-regular during various incarnations of \"Hollywood Squares\", with other Muppets such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch also making appearances on the original \"Hollywood Squares\".\nIn 2020, Kermit appeared on \"Monday Night Football\" with other Muppets characters as it was briefly rebranded \"Muppet Night Football.\"\nOn March 10, 2021, Kermit was the first celebrity to be unmasked on the fifth season of \"The Masked Singer\", having performed in costume as \"Snail\".\nOn May 7, 2023, Kermit, along with Miss Piggy, was invited to the Coronation Concert of King Charles III. He sat next to Prince Edward, The Duke of Edinburgh.\nMerchandising.\nJim Henson's characters, including the Muppets, have inspired merchandise internationally, with Chris Bensch, chief curator of Rochester, New York's The Strong National Museum of Play, reporting \"There seems to have been a particular craze for Kermit the Frog in Japan,\" likely due to the \"cuteness appeal\". Baby Kermit plush toys became popular in the 1980s after the success of \"Muppet Babies.\"\nIn 1991, one year after Jim Henson died, merchandise featuring Kermit and other Muppet characters was being sold at Disney theme parks, causing Henson Associates to file a lawsuit against Disney for copyright infringement. Henson alleged that the \"counterfeit merchandise\" falsely indicated that the characters belonged to Disney, although the latter company had the right to exercise use of the characters due to an earlier licensing agreement. The Henson Associates highlighted a T-shirt displaying Kermit, the Disney brand, and a copyright symbol. Disney representative Erwin Okun said the lawsuit was \"outrageous\" and \"an unfortunate break with the legacy of a fine relationship with Disney that Jim Henson left behind\". Disney later acquired the Muppets, and thusly, clothes, toys and souvenirs depicting Kermit and the Muppets continued to be sold at Disney theme parks and stores.\nThe Leland Chamber of Commerce's small Kermit-themed museum set out to preserve some of the dolls and merchandise. In 2016, \"The New Zealand Herald\" reported a hat featuring Kermit sipping Lipton tea, associated with the \"But That's None of My Business\" Internet meme, became a popular seller after basketball player LeBron James drew attention for wearing one.\nKermit in Internet culture.\nIn March 2007, \"Sad Kermit\", an unofficial parody, was uploaded to the website YouTube, showing a store-bought Kermit puppet performing a version of the Nine Inch Nails song \"Hurt\" in a style similar to Johnny Cash's famous cover version. In contrast to the real Kermit character's usual family-friendly antics, the video shows the puppet engaging in drug abuse, smoking, alcoholism, performing oral sex on Rowlf the Dog, smashing a picture of Miss Piggy (with a breast exposed) and attempting suicide. The video became an Internet meme. The \"Victoria Times Colonist\" called it an \"online sensation\". The \"Chicago Sun-Times\" said it \"puts the high in 'Hi-ho!'\" The \"London Free Press\" said \"Sad Kermit is in a world of pain\". The \"Houston Press\" described it as the \"world's most revolting web phenomenon\". SF Weekly described the unauthorized video as \"ironic slandering\". Clips have been featured on the Canadian television series \"The Hour\", where host George Stroumboulopoulos speculated that the Kermit version of \"Hurt\" was inspired by the Cash version rather than that of Nine Inch Nails.\nKermit has also appeared in a popular meme in which he is shown sipping tea, \"one used when you sassily point something out, and then slyly back away, claiming that it's not [your] business\". The photo is taken from \"Be More Kermit,\" a Lipton advertisement that aired in 2014, and was adapted into the \"But That's None of My Business\" meme by African American comedians on the Tumblr blog Kermit the Snitch, making appearances on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Charles Pulliam-Moore of the TV station \"Fusion\" praised \"But That's None of My Business\" as \"a symbol for the comedic brilliance born out of black communities on the internet\", but Stephanie Hayes of \"Bustle\" magazine criticized the memes as racist and obscene.\nIn 2016, a \"Good Morning America\" post on Twitter referred to the \"But That's None of My Business\" meme as \"Tea Lizard\", becoming the subject of viral online derision. \"New York\" magazine replied that, \"Kermit is a frog. A frog is an amphibian. A lizard is a reptile. It's just so insulting. Beyond a frog and a lizard both being clearly ectothermic, they couldn't be any more different. Not all green things are the same, you ignorant bastards\". \"Popular Science\" also addressed the misnomer, writing \"Frogs, which are amphibians, have quite a few significant differences from reptiles in how they breathe, their life cycles, whether they have scales or not... there's a lot to absorb here.\"\nIn November 2016, a new meme surfaced of Kermit talking to a hooded version of himself which represents the self and its dark inner thoughts. It involves captioning of a screenshot taken from the \"Muppets Most Wanted\" movie of Kermit and Constantine looking at each other.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

However, observers have stated it was incompetent with Afghan leaders since it was ineffective as they preferred to use their personal connections instead. Sardar Abdul Wali, the commander of the 1st Central Army Corps, additionally had his own espionage and secret intelligence network where he prosecuted leftist groups such as the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and the supporters of Mohammad Daoud Khan. General Ismail Khan was also noted to have been a part of the Civil Secret Agency (CSA) during the \u201cDecade of Constitution\u201d and reign of Mohammad Zahir Shah.\nAfter the events of the Saur Revolution, the PDPA established AGSA (\"Da Afghanistan da Gato da Saatane Adara\" or Afghan Agency for Safeguarding National Interest) as its domestic/foreign intelligence agency with Assadullah Sarwari serving as its first director. Sarwari was known for torturing anyone who disagreed with the PDPA. AGSA operations eventually led to an anti-PDPA insurgency. AGSA additionally had a secret code between members Meera Jan, Fazil Qadir and the head of AGSA\u2019s investigation committee which was intercepted by Rahmatullah Omid, used for killing anyone who the Khalq deemed an enemy. The killings would take place at night. The code was used via telephone and was in the Russian language, with the transcript reading \u201cHow\u2019s the weather like? Are we going to shoot, are we going to kill?\u201d.\nAGSA was additionally involved in the hangings of Parcham members in 1978 and the executions of the following people:\nIn September 1979, AGSA was replaced with KAM (\"Komite-ye Amniyat-e Melli\" or National Security Committee) under Hafizullah Amin's direction. Several AGSA officials were either placed under surveillance or were arrested. KAM had a total of 7000 employees.\nAziz Ahmed Akbari was called in to take over from Sarwari when he took refuge in the Soviet Embassy. After two months, Assadullah Amin was appointed by his uncle to lead KAM. KAM did not last long after the Soviets officially entered Afghanistan in 1979.\nKhAD (1980-1986).\nKhAD was created on 10 January 1980 and was officially announced by President Babrak Karmal, with 1,200 personnel inside the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan who took over intelligence responsibilities from KAM in December 1979, with most of them being pro-Parchamites. The group was known as \u201cthe activists\u201d and was active until March 1980, being initially headed by Mohammad Najibullah, alongside Dr. Baha who worked on establishing the structure that would later be referred to as KhAD. \nAfter Soviet troops were deployed in Afghanistan, KhAD was expanded with Moscow's assistance, which includes sophisticated torture equipment. Najibullah took the opportunity of his post to rise within the PDPA before Major-General Ghulam Faruq Yaqubi took over KhAD duties in November 1985.\nSoviet advisors were known to work alongside KhAD personnel and major decisions are not made without their input. In some instances, KhAD agents accompanied KGB Kaskad (Cascade) operators on anti-mujahideen infiltration ops. KhAD personnel were also authorised to use any strategies necessary to ensure they did not disclose their identities as officers of the agency, as a former KhAD advisor stated that Pakistanis did not want to capture KhAD Special Forces operatives alive. During an attack on army bases in Keran Valley led by Ahmad Shah Massoud in 1987, a base consisting of 200 soldiers immediately fell whereas 16 KhAD operatives continued to fight to their deaths for six hours. In the aftermath, two leaders committed suicide and one agent was killed which led to 13 operatives finally surrendering.\nThe agency's manpower increased from 1,200 to nearly 70,000 personnel. KhAD was able to turn some mujahideen groups to work with the PDPA by providing incentives such as small arms or money in return for their loyalty by attending loya jirgas and other pro-PDPA activities.\nThey've worked with the KGB to fund and assist Murtaza Bhutto for his involvement in the hijacking of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 326 and with Baluchistan and Sind dissidents, according to files obtained by Vasili Mitrokhin from KGB files. KhAD\u2019s infiltration of various mujahideen groups did help to contribute to some of the infighting. KhAD operatives additionally attempted to assassinate Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in 1987, using a remote-controlled car bomb and wounding two of his bodyguards. Other operations included the kidnapping of one of Massoud\u2019s five brothers in Peshawar, as well as sending KhAD assassination teams (paid in the equivalent of thousands of dollars) into Panjshir Province to assassinate Ahmad Shah Massoud.\nThe 1986 National Reconciliation Act, enacted by President Mohammad Najibullah, meant that the powers of individual KhAD officers were reduced and they would have to consult with local police forces, \"shuras\", and the provincial and district offices of the attorney general if they wanted to make any arrest.\nPost-KhAD (1986-2001).\nOn 9 January 1986, KhAD was changed with its name to WAD (\"Wazarat-e Amaniat-e Dowlati\" or Ministry of State Security), with the agency becoming its own ministry. It was reported that WAD was placed in charge of controlling the Kabul Garrison. Its budget and size were expanded. However WAD would still often be referred to as KhAD by the US government and the CIA. In 1987 KhAD was behind many terrorist attacks on Pakistani soil including the Karachi Car bombing and an attempted car bombing on the US Consulate in Peshawar which ended up killing over 30 people. \nIn 1989, WAD-led forces, more specifically the Special Guard and the 904th Battalion, fought in the Battle of Jalalabad. In March 1990, Lieutenant-General Shahnawaz Tanai attempted a coup, which was suppressed by the WAD-led Afghan National Guard (\"Gard-e-Milli\"), General Khushal Peroz and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar.\nDuring the civil war in the 1990s, Hezb-i-Islami, the Northern Alliance and the Taliban all recruited ex-KhAD officers and agents to act as their moles operating behind enemy territory. KhAD primarily acted as the intelligence arm of the Northern Alliance during the civil war in Afghanistan, even after the fall of the Afghan government in 1992.\nRecruitment.\nBefore KhAD approached potential candidates for the agency\u2019s officer base, they extensively screened the candidate beforehand, as well as secretly probed their entire family. Only PDPA members who were extremely loyal and belonged to pro-government families qualified for admission as officers. Women were also employed as NCOs and officers, although they were underrepresented in senior officer ranks.\nOnce recruited, KhAD NCOs and officers received intensive training known as \"Parawachi\" or \"Parwareshi\" and after the training was completed, recruits went through a trial period known as either \"Azmajchi\" or \"Azmayeshi\", where they\u2019d have to prove their loyalty by spying on their family members, arresting friends, partners and subjecting them to torture. Over time, the tasks seasoned recruits were asked to perform would only become more intense, being ordered to infiltrate the ranks of the Afghan mujahideen. On their first assignment, the recruits were transferred to KhAD/WAD sections actively engaged in tracking down \u201csubversive elements\u201d. Only those who proved their worth were promoted or transferred to sections with more administrative or technical activities. \nPotential applicants may have been prompted to join KhAD as the role of officer provided material benefits, such as a salary ten times higher than that of a government official. KhAD officers were additionally exempt from conscription and had free access to alcohol and even prostitutes. If a KhAD officer was killed in action, their family would also receive financial compensation and benefits from the government. Most KhAD officials came from either Kabul or Parwan, with most of them belonging to the Parcham faction of the PDPA. \nTraining.\nKaskad operators were responsible for training KhAD personnel. KhAD officers had to go through a mandatory training course in Kabul where they were taught about military logistics, how to recruit potential officers, organisation and how to identify covert meetings and networks. KhAD officers, starting from first lieutenant to lieutenant colonel, were given mandatory training at the KGB School at Balashikha, Uzbekistan, and other KGB training facilities. Unlike the mandatory training in Kabul, the course in Tashkent included interrogation and criminal investigation techniques. High-ranking KhAD officers, starting from the rank of colonel and upwards, received additional mandatory training in Moscow. Unlike other techniques taught to officers in Kabul, Balashikha and Uzbekistan, the higher-ranking officers would receive training on management and policy issues, as well as financial affairs.\nPsychological warfare and state-sponsored terrorism.\nProstitution Spy Rings.\nIn mid-1985, the Soviet Union and Kabul launched psychological warfare against Pakistan in an attempt to morally destabilize society. As part of this strategy, the KGB and KhAD deployed hundreds of young girls of Central Asian, and Russian origin to corrupt Pakistani society. This influx initially targeted the major urban centers such as Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Faisalabad, Multan, and Quetta. These groups of prostitutes strategically selected affluent areas in these cities and operated within a well-organized structure. Many of these prostitutes had connections to KGB and KhAD agents, with high-ranking government officials and Pakistan army officers being their primary targets. This led to the emergence of a \"galemjum (prostitute) culture\" in Pakistani society, which attracted professionals, the local commercial class, and frustrated youth in various urban centers.\nState-Sponsored Terrorism.\nAccording to a report by the US Defense Department, approximately 90% of the estimated 777 acts of international terrorism committed worldwide in 1987 took place in Pakistan. By 1988, KGB and KhAD agents were able to penetrate deep inside Pakistan and carry out attacks on mujahideen sanctuaries and guerrilla bases. There was strong circumstantial evidence implicating Moscow-Kabul in the August 1988 assassination of Zia ul-Haq, as the Soviets perceived that Zia wanted to adversely affect the Geneva process. WAD/KhAD has also been suspected behind the assassination of Palestinian jihadist Abdullah Yusuf Azzam alongside his son in 1989.\nAfghanistan's KHAD was one of four secret service agencies accused of perpetrating terrorist bombings in multiple Pakistani cities including Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi during the early 1980s resulting in hundreds of civilian casualties. By the late 1980s, the US State Department blamed WAD for the perpetration of terrorist bombings in Pakistani cities. Between the late 1970s and the early 1990s, Afghanistan security agencies supported the terrorist organization called al-Zulfiqar, the group that hijacked a Pakistan International Airlines plane from Karachi to Kabul in 1981. Notable attacks include the Karachi Car bombing and an attempted car bombing on the US Consulate in Peshawar which ended up killing over 30 people in 1987.\nThe Hathora Murders of Karachi.\nAround 1985, Pakistani police in the city of Karachi were becoming alarmed by an increased number of killings. While the murders took place in different areas of the city, an investigation found these murders were done in the same manner; a single blow to the head with a hathora (the word for \"hammer\" in Urdu). Upon investigation of the victims and their backgrounds, it was found that they were all street urchins or beggars on the streets.\nNone of the victims of the Hathora group survived apart from one person, who described the murderers as men in \u201cwhite suits and black masks\u201d who drove a white Suzuki vehicle. Upon realization that these murders were being committed by a group, newspapers across the nation began to report the victim's story and referred to these men as \"the Hathora Group\" owing to their method of using hammers to murder their victims. Police didn\u2019t know who these men were and what motives they had to do commit these murders. For a while, these cases of murders stopped and then finally resumed around some time in mid-1986. For nearly 2 years, the city of Karachi was terrorised by the horrors of such group, with civilians fearing they would enter their homes and be killed by the Hathora group.\nSome Pakistani newspapers alluded that the Hathora group was actually made up of members of the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, and KHAD, who were striking back due to the Pakistani government backing the Afghan mujahideen against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. A sociologist, when asked about these killings, mentioned that the chaos that was occurring in Karachi was easily manipulated by groups for their own motives. The sociologist strongly believed that these killings were planned to spread more fear in the city, which could be the intention of KHAD and the motive behind the murders, although it is unknown if KHAD was behind these murders.\nStructure.\nKhAD.\nKhAD was known to have the following organizational structures in place:\nProvincial.\nWhile not part of the KHAD structure, militias recruited from tribal and anti-government militias who agreed to work with them, are finally supported by the agency. KhAD also had its own special forces units, attached to each province which included between 250-300 personnel. KhAD-e Nezami, the military intelligence agency of the Afghan Army, additionally had four Afghan spetsnaz battalions under their control, such as the:\nWAD.\nThe WAD was known to have the following organizational structures in place:\nHuman rights abuses.\nKHAD was also accused of human rights abuses in the mid-1980s. These included the use of torture, the use of predetermined \"show trials\" to dispose of political prisoners, and widespread arbitrary arrest and detention. Secret trials and the execution of prisoners without trial were also common. By 1989 KhAD had arrested nearly 150,000 people (although many were released).\nIt was especially active and aggressive in the urban centers, especially in Kabul. Organizations such as Amnesty International continued to publish detailed reports of KhAD's use of torture and of inhumane conditions in the country's prisons and jails. In 1989, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights visited both \"Sedarat\" and \"Shashdarak\", one of many prisons for those arrested by the agency, and found out that the hygienic conditions in these prisons somewhat improved.\nKHAD also operated eight detention centers in the capital, which were located at KHAD headquarters, at the Ministry of the Interior headquarters, and at a location known as the Central Interrogation Office. The most notorious of the Communist-run detention centers was Pul-e-Charkhi prison, where 27,000 political prisoners are thought to have been murdered. Recently mass graves of executed prisoners have been uncovered dating back to the Soviet era.\nOn 29 February 2000, when The Netherlands had no diplomatic mission in Afghanistan, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a disputed report on the involvement of the KhAD on human rights abuses, partly based on secret sources, allegedly biased political sycophants from the side of the Taliban and the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI. Some of its conclusions were already published in the Dutch press before the official publication of the full report. This report, quoted frequently in the cases of Afghan asylum seekers to support the exclusion ground of article 1F of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees in the national refugee policy of the Netherlands, was also published in an English translation on 26 April 2001. In 2008, another report on this matter was published by the UNHCR. In this report, some conclusions of the Dutch report were contested.\nOn 14 October 2005, the District Court in the Hague convicted two high-ranking KhAD officers who sought asylum in the Netherlands in the 1990s. Hesamuddin Hesam and Habibullah Jalalzoy were found guilty of complicity to torture and violations of the laws and customs of war, committed in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Hesam was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. He was the head of the military intelligence service (KhAD-e-Nezamy) and deputy minister of the Ministry of State Security (WAD). Jalalzoy was the head of the unit investigations and interrogations within the military intelligence of the KhAD. He was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment.\nOn 29 January 2007, the Dutch appeal court upheld the sentences. The judgements were confirmed by the Dutch Supreme Court on 10 July 2008.\nOn 25 June 2007, the District Court in the Hague acquitted another senior KhAD officer. General Abdullah Faqirzada was one of the deputy heads of the KhAD-e-Nezamy from 1980 until 1987. Although the court held it plausible that Faqirzada was closely involved with the human rights abuses in the military branch of the KhAD, it concluded there was no evidence for his individual involvement nor his command responsibility for the specific crimes the charge was based upon. On 16 July 2009, the Dutch appeal court upheld the acquittal.\nIn a June 2005 report that was published by the UNCHR, it was stated that members of KhAD were not only at risk of reprisals from those who held positions of power in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, but also the families of those who were affected by human rights abuses committed by KhAD. \nIn popular culture.\nThe unreleased 1991 Afghan film \"Agent\" was based around a KhAD operative hunting down a Narcotics ring. In the Russian war movie \u201c\"Leaving Afghanistan\"\u201d, the character \u201cMajed\u201d is a KhAD intelligence officer. KhAD is also mentioned in the Russian mini series \u201c\"Caravan Hunters\"\u201d and the film \u201c\"Afganets\".\u201d\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a distinctive member of \"Protea\", having the largest flower head in the genus. The species is also known as giant protea, honeypot, or king sugar bush. It is widely distributed in the fynbos region of South Africa, that is, in the southwestern and southern parts of Western Cape. The king protea is the national flower of South Africa. \n\"Protea cynaroides\" is adapted to survive wildfires by its thick underground stem, which contains many dormant buds; these will produce the new growth after the fire.\nThe flower has a long vase life in flower arrangements, and makes for an excellent dried flower.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Protea cynaroides\" is a species of Protea in the huge family Proteaceae. The family comprises about 80 genera with about 1,600 species. It has Gondwanan distribution, which means that it is mainly spread across the Southern Hemisphere, from Southern Africa, across to Australia, to South America, although certain species are also found in equatorial Africa, India, southern Asia, and Oceania as well.\n\"Protea cynaroides\" is further placed within the subfamily Proteoideae, which is found mainly in Southern Africa. This subfamily is defined as those species having cluster roots, solitary ovules and indehiscent fruits. Proteoideae is further divided into four tribes: Conospermeae, Petrophileae, Proteae, and Leucadendreae. The genus \"Protea\", and hence \"P. cynaroides\", is placed under the tribe Proteae. \nEtymology and other names.\nThe name of the plant family Proteaceae as well as the genus \"Protea\", both to which \"P. cynaroides\" belongs to, derive from the name of the Greek god Proteus, a deity that was able to change between many forms. This is an appropriate image, seeing as both the family and the genus are known for their astonishing variety and diversity of flowers and leaves. \nThe specific epithet \"cynaroides\" refers to the artichoke-like appearance of the flower-heads: the artichoke belongs to the genus \"Cynara\". \nIt is also known as the king protea, giant protea, honeypot, or king sugar bush.\nDistribution.\nThe king protea is widely distributed in the southwestern and southern parts of Western Cape.\nDescription.\n\"P. cynaroides\" is a woody shrub with thick stems and large dark green, glossy leaves. Most plants are one metre in height when mature, but may vary according to locality and habitat from in height. The \"flowers\" of \"P. cynaroides\" are actually composite flower heads (termed an inflorescence) with a collection of flowers in the centre, surrounded by large colourful bracts, from about in diameter. Large, vigorous plants produce six to ten flower heads in one season, although some exceptional plants can produce up to forty flower heads on one plant. The colour of the bracts varies from a creamy white to a deep crimson, but the soft pale pink bracts with a silvery sheen are the most prized.\nResearch.\nThe diploid chromosome count is 2n = 24. The genome of king protea has been sequenced and published in 2022, corresponding to the first genome sequenced in the Proteales order.\nEcology.\n\"Protea cynaroides\" grows in a harsh environment with dry, hot summers and wet, cold winters. Several adaptions include tough, leathery leaves, which helps to prevent excessive loss of moisture, and a large taproot which penetrates deep into the soil to reach underground moisture. Like most other Proteaceae, \"P. cynaroides\" has proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in the low-nutrient, phosphorus-deficient soils of its native fynbos habitat.\nThe flowers are fed at by a range of nectarivorous birds, mainly sunbirds and sugarbirds, including the orange-breasted sunbird (\"Anthobaphes violacea\"), southern double-collared sunbird (\"Cinnyris chalybeus\"), malachite sunbird (\"Nectarinia famosa\"), and the Cape sugarbird (\"Promerops cafer\"). In order to reach the nectar, the bird must push its bill into the inflorescence. As it does so, its bill and face gets brushed with pollen, thereby allowing for possible pollination. \nAlong with birds, a host of insects are attracted to the flowerhead, such as bees, for example the Cape honeybee, and various beetle species such as rove beetles and the beetles of the huge family Scarabaeidae such as the protea beetle \"Trichostetha fascicularis\" and monkey beetles.\nLike many other \"Protea\" species, \"P. cynaroides\" is adapted to an environment in which bushfires are essential for reproduction and regeneration. Most \"Protea\" species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: \"reseeders\" are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; \"resprouters\" survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. \"P. cynaroides\" is a resprouter as it shoots up new stems from buds in its thick underground stem after a fire.\nSignificance and uses.\nThe king protea is the national flower of South Africa and as such lends its name to the national cricket team, whose nickname is the Proteas. In the early 1990s, there was a political debate as to if and how the flower should be incorporated onto the national rugby team's shirts, replacing the springbok.\nThe king protea is also the flagship of the Protea Atlas Project, run by the South African National Botanical Institute.\nThe king protea has a long vase life in flower arrangements, and makes for an excellent dried flower. It has several colour forms, and horticulturists have recognised 81 garden varieties, some of which have injudiciously been planted in its natural range. In some varieties the pink of the flower and red borders of leaves are replaced by a creamy yellow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17035", "revid": "237572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17035", "title": "Kantele", "text": "Finnish and Karelian plucked string instrument\nA kantele () or kannel () is a traditional Finnish and Karelian plucked string instrument (chordophone). It belongs to the southeast Baltic box zither family known as the Baltic psaltery, along with the Estonian kannel, the Latvian kokles, the Lithuanian kankl\u0117s, and the Russian gusli.\nConstruction.\nSmall kantele.\nModern instruments with 15 or fewer strings are generally more closely modeled on traditional shapes, and form a category of instrument known as small kantele, in contrast to the concert kantele.\nThe oldest forms of kantele have five or six horsehair strings and a wooden body carved from one piece; more modern instruments have metal strings and a body made from several pieces. The traditional kantele has neither bridge nor nut, the strings run directly from the tuning pegs to a metal bar (\"varras\") set into wooden brackets (\"ponsi\"). Though not acoustically efficient, this construction is part of the distinctive sound of the instrument.\nThe most typical and traditional tuning of the five-string small kantele is just intonation arrived at via five-limit tuning, often in Dmajor or Dminor. This occurs if a kantele is played as a solo instrument or as a part of a folk music ensemble. The major triad is then formed by D1\u2013F\u266f1\u2013A1. In modern variants of small kantele, there are often semitone levers for some strings. The most typical lever for a five-string kantele is a switch between F\u266f1 and F1, which allows most folk music to be played without retuning. Larger versions of the small kantele often have additional semitone levers, allowing a more varied selection of music to be played without retuning.\nConcert kantele.\nA modern concert kantele can have up to 40 strings. The playing positions of the concert kantele and the small kantele are reversed: for a small kantele, the longest, low-pitched strings are furthest away from the musician's body, while for a concert kantele, this side of the instrument is nearest, and the short, high-pitched strings are the furthest away. Concert versions have a switch mechanism (similar to semitone levers on a modern folk harp) for making sharps and flats, an innovation introduced by Paul Salminen in the 1920s.\nPlaying.\nThe kantele has a distinctive bell-like sound. The Finnish kantele generally has a diatonic tuning, though small kanteles with between 5 and 15 strings are often tuned to a gapped mode, missing a seventh and with the lowest pitched strings tuned to a fourth below the tonic, as a drone. Players hold the kantele in their laps or on a small table. There are two main playing techniques, either plucking the strings with the fingers or strumming unstopped strings (sometimes with a matchstick). Small kanteles and concert kanteles have different, though related, repertoires.\nMusic.\nThere have been strong developments for the kantele in Finland since the mid-20th century, beginning with the efforts of modern players such as Martti Pokela in the 1950s and 1960s. Education for playing the instrument starts in schools and music institutes up to conservatories and the Sibelius Academy, the only music university in Finland and the site of significant doctoral research into traditional, western classical and electronic music. A Finnish luthiery, Koistinen Kantele, has also developed an electric kantele, employing pickups similar to those on electric guitars, which has gained popularity amongst Finnish heavy metal musicians such as Amorphis. American harpist Sylvan Grey has recorded two albums of Kantele music featuring her own compositions.\nLegendary history.\nIn Finland's national epic, \"Kalevala\", the mage V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen makes the first kantele from the jawbone of a giant pike and a few hairs from Hiisi's stallion (, ). The music it makes draws all the forest creatures near to wonder at its beauty.\nLater, after grieving at the loss of his kantele, V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen makes another one from birch, strung with the hair of a willing maiden, and its magic proves equally profound. It is the gift the eternal mage leaves behind when he departs Kaleva at the advent of Christianity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their taxonomy is disputed. They were once classified as forming the historical genus \"Fortunella\" or placed within \"Citrus\", . Different classifications have assigned them ranging from a single species, \"Citrus japonica\", to numerous species representing each cultivar. Recent genomic analysis defines three pure species, \"Citrus hindsii\", \"C. margarita\" and \"C. crassifolia\", with \"C.\" \u00d7 \"japonica\" being a hybrid of the last two.\nThe edible fruit closely resembles the orange (\"Citrus x sinensis\") in color, texture, and anatomy, but is much smaller, being approximately the size of a large olive. The kumquat is a fairly cold-hardy citrus.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"kumquat\" is a borrowing of the Cantonese (; ), from 'golden' + 'orange'.\nDescription.\nKumquat plants have thornless branches and extremely glossy leaves. They bear dainty white flowers that occur in clusters or individually inside the leaf axils. The plants can reach a height from , with dense branches, sometimes bearing small thorns. They bear yellowish-orange fruits that are oval or round in shape. The fruits can be in diameter and have a sweet, pulpy skin and slightly acidic inner pulp. The fruit is often eaten whole by humans and has a taste that is sweet and somewhat sour. Kumquat trees are self-pollinating.\nSpecies.\nCitrus taxonomy is complicated and controversial. Different systems place various types of kumquats in different species or unite them into as few as two species. Botanically, many varieties of kumquats are classified as their own species, rather than cultivars. Historically, they were viewed as falling within the genus \"Citrus\", but the Swingle system of citrus taxonomy elevated them to their own genus, \"Fortunella\". Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests they do fall within \"Citrus\". Swingle divided the kumquats into two subgenera, the \"Protocitrus\", containing the primitive Hong Kong kumquat, and \"Eufortunella\", comprising the round, oval kumquat, Meiwa kumquats, to which Tanaka added two others, the Malayan kumquat and the Jiangsu kumquat. Chromosomal analysis suggested that Swingle's \"Eufortunella\" represent a single 'true' species, while Tanaka's additional species were revealed to be likely hybrids of \"Fortunella\" with other \"Citrus\", so-called x\"Citrofortunella\".\nOne recent genomic analysis concluded there was only one true species of kumquat, but the analysis did not include the Hong Kong variety, seen as a distinct species in all earlier analyses. A 2020 review concluded that genomic data were insufficient to reach a definitive conclusion on which kumquat cultivars represented distinct species. In 2022, a genome-level analysis of cultivated and wild varieties drew several conclusions. The authors found support for the division of kumquats into subgenera: \"Protocitrus\", for the wild Hong Kong variety, and \"Eufortunella\" for the cultivated varieties, with a divergence predating the end of the Quaternary glaciation, perhaps between two ancestral populations isolated south and north, respectively, of the Nanling mountain range. Within the latter group, the oval, round, and Meiwa kumquat each showed a level of divergence greater than between other recognized citrus species, such as between pomelo and citron, and hence each merits species-level classification. Though Swingle had speculated that the Meiwa kumquat was a hybrid of oval and round kumquats, the genomic analysis suggested instead that the round kumquat was an oval/Meiwa hybrid.\nHybrids.\nHybrid forms of the kumquat include the following:\nOrigin and distribution.\nThe kumquat plant is native to Southern China. The first historical reference to kumquats appears in literature of China from at least the 12th century. They have been cultivated for centuries in other parts of East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. They were introduced into Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune, collector for the London Horticultural Society, and have spread across the world.\nCultivation.\nKumquats are much hardier than citrus plants such as oranges. Sowing seeds in the spring is ideal because the temperature is pleasant, with more chances of rain and sunshine. This also gives the tree enough time to become well established before winter. Early spring is the best time to transplant a sapling. They do best in direct sunlight (needing 6\u20137 hours a day) and are planted directly in the ground. Kumquats do well in USDA hardy zones 9 and 10 and can survive in temperatures as low as . On trees mature enough, kumquats will form in about 90 days.\nIn cultivation in the UK, \"Citrus japonica\" has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).\nPropagation.\nKumquats do not grow well from seeds and so are vegetatively propagated by using rootstock of another citrus fruit, air layering, or cuttings.\nVarieties.\nThe \"Nordmann seedless\" is a seedless cultivar of the Nagami kumquat (\"Citrus margarita\"). It is similar to Nagami but with a slightly different shape and lighter skin.\nThe C\"entennial Variegated\" is another cultivar of the Nagami kumquat. It originated from the open pollination of a Nagami kumquat tree. The fruits are striped light green and yellow when underripe, and turn orange and lose their stripes when they ripen. They are oval-shaped, necked, 2.5 inches long, and have a smooth rind. They mature in winter. This cultivar arose spontaneously from the oval kumquat (\"Citrus margarita\"). It produces a greater proportion of fruit to peel than the oval kumquat, and the fruit is rounder and sometimes necked. Fruits are distinguishable by their variegation in color, exhibiting bright green and yellow stripes, and by their lack of thorns.\nThe \"Puchimaru kumquat\" is a seedless or virtually seedless Japanese kumquat cultivar. It is resistant to citrus canker and citrus scab. The fruit weighs 11\u201320 grams and is ellipsoid in shape. It has a dark orange rind, which is 4 millimeters thick. The juice content is relatively low. The oil glands are somewhat large and conspicuous. It ripens in January.\nUses.\nNutrition.\nA raw kumquat is 81% water, 16% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw kumquat supplies of food energy and is a rich source of vitamin C (49% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table).\nEssential oil.\nThe essential oil of the kumquat peel contains much of the aroma of the fruit, and is composed principally of limonene, which makes up around 93% of the total. Besides limonene and alpha-pinene (0.34%), both of which are considered monoterpenes, the oil is unusually rich (0.38% total) in sesquiterpenes such as \u03b1-bergamotene (0.021%), caryophyllene (0.18%), \u03b1-humulene (0.07%) and \u03b1-muurolene (0.06%), and these contribute to the spicy and woody flavor of the fruit. Carbonyl compounds make up much of the remainder, and these are responsible for much of the distinctive flavor. These compounds include esters such as isopropyl propanoate (1.8%) and terpinyl acetate (1.26%); ketones such as carvone (0.175%); and a range of aldehydes such as citronellal (0.6%) and 2-methylundecanal. Other oxygenated compounds include nerol (0.22%) and \"trans\"-linalool oxide (0.15%).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the high pressure polymorph of andalusite and sillimanite, and the presence of kyanite in metamorphic rocks generally indicates metamorphism deep in the Earth's crust. Kyanite is also known as disthene or cyanite.\nKyanite is strongly anisotropic, in that its hardness varies depending on its crystallographic direction. In kyanite, this anisotropism can be considered an identifying characteristic, along with its characteristic blue color. Its name comes from the same origin as that of the color cyan, being derived from the Ancient Greek word \u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. This is typically rendered into English as \"kyanos\" or \"kuanos\" and means \"dark blue.\"\nKyanite is used as a raw material in the manufacture of ceramics and abrasives, and it is an important index mineral used by geologists to trace metamorphic zones.\nProperties.\nKyanite is an aluminum silicate mineral, with the chemical formula . It is typically patchy blue in color, though it can range from pale to deep blue and can also be gray or white or, infrequently, light green. It typically forms sprays of bladed crystals, but is less commonly found as distinct euhedral (well-shaped) crystals, which are particularly prized by collectors. It has a perfect {100} cleavage plane, parallel to the long axis of the crystal, and a second good cleavage plane {010} that is at an angle of 79 degrees to the {100} cleavage plane. Kyanite also shows a parting on {001} at an angle of about 85 degrees to the long axis of the crystal. Cleavage surfaces typically display a pearly luster. The crystals are slightly flexible.\nKyanite's elongated, columnar crystals are usually a good first indication of the mineral, as well as its color (when the specimen is blue). Associated minerals are useful as well, especially the presence of the polymorphs of staurolite, which occurs frequently with kyanite. However, the most useful characteristic in identifying kyanite is its anisotropism. If one suspects a specimen to be kyanite, verifying that it has two distinctly different hardness values on perpendicular axes is a key to identification; it has a hardness of 5.5 parallel to {001} and 7 parallel to {100}. Thus, a steel needle will easily scratch a kyanite crystal parallel to its long axis, but the crystal is impervious to being scratched by a steel needle perpendicular to the long axis.\nStructure.\nThe kyanite structure can be visualized as a distorted face centered cubic lattice of oxygen ions, with aluminium ions occupying 40% of the octahedral sites and silicon occupying 10% of the tetrahedral sites. The aluminium octahedra form chains along the length of the crystal, half of which are straight and half of which are zigzag, with silica tetrahedra linking the chains together. There is no direct linkage between the silica tetrahedra, making kyanite a member of the nesosilicate class of silicate minerals.\nOccurrence.\nKyanite\nAndalusite\nSillimanite\n Phase diagram of Al2SiO5\n (aluminosilicates).\nKyanite occurs in biotite gneiss, mica schist, and hornfels, which are metamorphic rocks formed at high pressure during regional metamorphism of a protolith which is rich in aluminium (a \"pelitic\" protolith). Kyanite is also occasionally found in granite and pegmatites and associated quartz veins, and is infrequently found in eclogites. It occurs as detrital grains in sedimentary rocks, although it tends to weather rapidly. It is associated with staurolite, andalusite, sillimanite, talc, hornblende, gedrite, mullite and corundum.\nKyanite is one of the most common minerals, having the composition . Minerals with identical compositions but a different, distinct crystal structure are called \"polymorphs\". There are two polymorphs of kyanite: andalusite and sillimanite. Kyanite is the most stable at high pressure, andalusite is the most stable at lower temperature and pressure, and sillimanite is the most stable at higher temperature and lower pressure. They are all equally stable at the triple point near 4.2 kbar and . This makes the presence of kyanite in a metamorphic rock an indication of metamorphism at high pressure.\nKyanite is often used as an index mineral to define and trace a metamorphic zone that was subject to a particular degree of metamorphism at great depth in the crust. For example, G. M. Barrow defined kyanite zones and sillimanite zones in his pioneering work on the mineralogy of metamorphic rocks. Barrow was characterizing a region of Scotland that had experienced regional metamorphism at depth. By contrast, the metamorphic zones surrounding the Fanad pluton of Ireland, which formed by contact metamorphism at a shallower depth in the crust, include andalusite and sillimanite zones but no kyanite zone.\nKyanite is potentially stable at low temperature and pressure. However, under these conditions, the reactions that produce kyanite, such as:\nnever take place, and hydrous aluminosilicate minerals such as muscovite, pyrophyllite, or kaolinite are found instead of kyanite.\nBladed crystals of kyanite are very common, but individual euhedral crystals are prized by collectors. Kyanite occurs in Manhattan schist, formed under extreme pressure as a result of a continental collision during the assembly of the supercontinent of Pangaea. It is also found in pegmatites of the Appalachian Mountains and in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Splendid specimens are found at Pizzo Forno in Switzerland.\nKyanite can take on an orange color, which notably occurs in Loliondo, Tanzania. The orange color is due to inclusions of small amounts of manganese (Mn3+) in the structure.\nUses.\nKyanite is used primarily in refractory and ceramic products, including porcelain plumbing and dishware. It is also used in electronics, electrical insulators and abrasives.\nAt temperatures above 1100 \u00b0C, kyanite decomposes into mullite and vitreous silica via the following reaction:\nThis transformation results in an expansion. Mullitized kyanite is used to manufacture refractory materials.\nKyanite has been used as a semiprecious gemstone, which may display cat's eye chatoyancy, though this effect is limited by its anisotropism and perfect cleavage. Color varieties include orange kyanite from Tanzania. The orange color is due to inclusions of small amounts of manganese (Mn3+) in the structure.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was drafted by Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas, passed by the 33rd United States Congress, and signed into law by President Franklin Pierce. Douglas introduced the bill intending to open up new lands to develop and facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad. However, the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, stoking national tensions over slavery and contributing to a series of armed conflicts known as \"Bleeding Kansas\".\nThe United States had acquired vast amounts of land in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, and since the 1840s, Douglas had sought to establish a territorial government in a portion of the Louisiana Purchase that was still unorganized. Douglas's efforts were stymied by Senator David Rice Atchison of Missouri and other Southern leaders who refused to allow the creation of territories that banned slavery; slavery would have been banned because the Missouri Compromise outlawed slavery in the territory north of latitude 36\u00b0\u00a030\u2032 north (except for Missouri). To win the support of Southerners like Atchison, Pierce and Douglas agreed to back the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, with the status of slavery instead decided based on \"popular sovereignty\". Under popular sovereignty, the citizens of each territory, rather than Congress, would determine whether slavery would be allowed.\nDouglas's bill to repeal the Missouri Compromise and organize Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory won approval by a wide margin in the Senate, but faced stronger opposition in the House of Representatives. Though Northern Whigs strongly opposed the bill, it passed the House with the support of almost all Southerners and some Northern Democrats. After the passage of the act, pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas to establish a population that would vote for or against slavery, resulting in a series of armed conflicts known as \"Bleeding Kansas\". Douglas and Pierce hoped that popular sovereignty would help bring an end to the national debate over slavery, but the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act outraged Northerners. The division between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces caused by the Act was the death knell for the ailing Whig Party, which broke apart after the Act. Its Northern remnants would give rise to the anti-slavery Republican Party. The Act, and the tensions over slavery it inflamed, were key events leading to the American Civil War.\nBackground.\nIn his 1853 inaugural address, President Franklin Pierce expressed hope that the Compromise of 1850 had settled the debate over the issue of slavery in the territories. For the Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory, lands acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War, the Compromise left the issue of slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty. The Missouri Compromise, which banned slavery in territories north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 parallel, remained in place for the other U.S. territories acquired in the Louisiana Purchase, including a vast unorganized territory often referred to as \"Nebraska\". As settlers poured into the unorganized territory, and commercial and political interests called for a transcontinental railroad through the region, pressure mounted for the organization of the eastern parts of the unorganized territory. Though the organization of the territory was required to develop the region, an organization bill threatened to re-open the contentious debates over slavery in the territories that had taken place during and after the Mexican\u2013American War.\nThe topic of a transcontinental railroad had been discussed since the 1840s. While there were debates over the specifics, especially the route to be taken, there was a public consensus that such a railroad should be built by private interests, and financed by public land grants. In 1845, Stephen A. Douglas, then serving in his first term in the U.S. House of Representatives, had submitted an unsuccessful plan to organize the Nebraska Territory formally, as the first step in building a railroad with its eastern terminus in Chicago. Railroad proposals were debated in all subsequent sessions of Congress with cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, Quincy, Memphis, and New Orleans competing to be the jumping-off point for the construction.\nSeveral proposals in late 1852 and early 1853 had strong support, but they failed because of disputes over whether the railroad would follow a northern or a southern route. In early 1853, the House of Representatives passed a bill 107 to 49 to organize the Nebraska Territory in the land west of Iowa and Missouri. In March, the bill moved to the Senate Committee on Territories, which was headed by Douglas. Missouri Senator David Atchison announced that he would support the Nebraska proposal only if slavery were to be permitted. While the bill was silent on this issue, slavery would have been prohibited under the Missouri Compromise in the territory north of 36\u00b030' latitude and west of the Mississippi River. Other Southern senators were as inflexible as Atchison. By a vote of 23 to 17, the Senate voted to table the motion, with every senator from the states south of Missouri voting to the table.\nDuring the Senate adjournment, the issues of the railroad and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise became entangled in Missouri politics, as Atchison campaigned for re-election against the forces of Thomas Hart Benton. Atchison was maneuvered into choosing between antagonizing the state's railroad interests or its slaveholders. Finally, he took the position that he would rather see Nebraska \"sink in hell\" before he would allow it to be overrun by free soilers.\nRepresentatives then generally found lodging in boarding houses when they were in the nation's capital to perform their legislative duties. Atchison shared lodgings in an F Street house shared by the leading Southerners in Congress. He was the Senate's President pro tempore. His housemates included Robert T. Hunter (from Virginia, chairman of the Finance Committee), James Mason (from Virginia, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee) and Andrew P. Butler (from South Carolina, chairman of the Judiciary Committee). When Congress reconvened on December 5, 1853, the group, termed the F Street Mess, along with Virginian William O. Goode, formed the nucleus that would insist on slaveholder equality in Nebraska. Douglas was aware of the group's opinions and power and knew that he needed to address its concerns. Douglas was also a fervent believer in popular sovereignty\u2014the policy of letting the voters, almost exclusively white males, of a territory decide whether or not slavery should exist in it.\nIowa Senator Augustus C. Dodge immediately reintroduced the same legislation to organize Nebraska that had stalled in the previous session; it was referred to Douglas's committee on December 14. Douglas, hoping to achieve the support of the Southerners, publicly announced that the same principle that had been established in the Compromise of 1850 should apply in Nebraska.\nIn the Compromise of 1850, Utah and New Mexico Territories had been organized without any restrictions on slavery, and many supporters of Douglas argued that the compromise had already superseded the Missouri Compromise. The territories were, however, given the authority to decide for themselves whether they would apply for statehood as either free or slaves states whenever they chose to apply. The two territories, however, unlike Nebraska, had not been part of the Louisiana Purchase and had arguably never been subject to the Missouri Compromise.\nCongressional action.\nIntroduction of Nebraska bill.\nThe bill was reported to the main body of the Senate on January 4, 1854. It had been modified by Douglas, who had also authored the New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory Acts, to mirror the language from the Compromise of 1850. In the bill, a vast new Nebraska Territory was created to extend from Kansas north to the 49th parallel, the US\u2013Canada border. A large portion of Nebraska Territory would soon be split off into Dakota Territory (1861), and smaller portions transferred to Colorado Territory (1861) and Idaho Territory (1863) before the balance of the land became the State of Nebraska in 1867.\nFurthermore, any decisions on slavery in the new lands were to be made \"when admitted as a state or states, the said territory, or any portion of the same, shall be received into the Union, with or without slavery, as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission.\" In a report accompanying the bill, Douglas's committee wrote that the Utah and New Mexico Acts: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe report compared the situation in New Mexico and Utah with the situation in Nebraska. In the first instance, many had argued that slavery had previously been prohibited under Mexican law, just as it was prohibited in Nebraska under the 1820 Missouri Compromise. Just as the creation of New Mexico and Utah territories had not ruled on the validity of Mexican law on the acquired territory, the Nebraska bill was neither \"affirming nor repealing ... the Missouri act\". In other words, popular sovereignty was being established by ignoring, rather than addressing, the problem presented by the Missouri Compromise.\nDouglas's attempt to finesse his way around the Missouri Compromise did not work. Kentucky Whig Archibald Dixon believed that unless the Missouri Compromise was explicitly repealed, slaveholders would be reluctant to move to the new territory until slavery was approved by the settlers, who would most likely oppose slavery. On January 16 Dixon surprised Douglas by introducing an amendment that would repeal the section of the Missouri Compromise that prohibited slavery north of the 36\u00b030' parallel. Douglas met privately with Dixon and in the end, despite his misgivings on Northern reaction, agreed to accept Dixon's arguments.\nA similar amendment was offered in the House by Philip Phillips of Alabama. With the encouragement of the \"F Street Mess\", Douglas met with them and Phillips to ensure that the momentum for passing the bill remained with the Democratic Party. They arranged to meet with President Franklin Pierce to ensure that the issue would be declared a test of party loyalty within the Democratic Party.\nMeeting with Pierce.\nPierce was not enthusiastic about the implications of repealing the Missouri Compromise and had barely referred to Nebraska in his State of the Union message delivered December 5, 1853, just a month before. Close advisors Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan, a proponent of popular sovereignty as far back as 1848 as an alternative to the Wilmot Proviso, and Secretary of State William L. Marcy both told Pierce that repeal would create serious political problems. The full cabinet met and only Secretary of War Jefferson Davis and Secretary of Navy James C. Dobbin supported repeal. Instead, the president and cabinet submitted to Douglas an alternative plan that would have sought out a judicial ruling on the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise. Both Pierce and Attorney General Caleb Cushing believed that the Supreme Court would find it unconstitutional.\nDouglas's committee met later that night. Douglas was agreeable to the proposal, but the Atchison group was not. Determined to offer the repeal to Congress on January 23 but reluctant to act without Pierce's commitment, Douglas arranged through Davis to meet with Pierce on January 22 even though it was a Sunday when Pierce generally refrained from conducting any business. Douglas was accompanied at the meeting by Atchison, Hunter, Phillips, and John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky.\nDouglas and Atchison first met alone with Pierce before the whole group convened. Pierce was persuaded to support repeal, and at Douglas' insistence, Pierce provided a written draft, asserting that the Missouri Compromise had been made inoperative by the principles of the Compromise of 1850. Pierce later informed his cabinet, which concurred with the change of direction. The \"Washington Union\", the communications organ for the administration, wrote on January 24 that support for the bill would be \"a test of Democratic orthodoxy\".\nDebate in Senate.\nOn January 23, a revised bill was introduced in the Senate that repealed the Missouri Compromise and split the unorganized land into two new territories: Kansas and Nebraska. The division was the result of concerns expressed by settlers already in Nebraska as well as the senators from Iowa, who were concerned with the location of the territory's seat of government if such a large territory were created. As well, the bill's proposed border for Kansas was perceived by Southern legislators as the best method to ensure at least one slave state would be created by the law (Kansas was made to only border Missouri, a slave state, and therefore more likely to attract pro-slavery settlers). Existing language to affirm the application of all other laws of the United States in the new territory was supplemented by the language agreed on with Pierce: \"except the eighth section of the act preparatory to the admission of Missouri into the Union, approved March 6, 1820 [the Missouri Compromise], which was superseded by the legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise measures [the Compromise of 1850], and is declared inoperative.\" Identical legislation was soon introduced in the House.\nHistorian Allan Nevins wrote that the country then became convulsed with two interconnected battles over slavery. A political battle was being fought in Congress over the question of slavery in the new states that were coming. At the same time, there was a moral debate. Southerners claimed that slavery was beneficent, endorsed by the Bible, and generally good policy, whose expansion must be supported. The publications and speeches of abolitionists, some of them former slaves themselves, were telling Northerners that the supposed beneficence of slavery was a Southern lie, and that enslaving another person was un-Christian, a horrible sin that must be fought. Both battles were \"fought with a pertinacity, bitterness, and rancor unknown even in Wilmot Proviso days\". The freesoilers were at a distinct disadvantage in Congress. The Democrats held large majorities in each house, and Douglas, \"a ferocious fighter, the fiercest, most ruthless, and most unscrupulous that Congress had perhaps ever known\", led a tightly disciplined party. In the nation at large, the opponents of Nebraska hoped to achieve a moral victory. The \"New York Times\", which had earlier supported Pierce, predicted that this would be the last straw for Northern supporters of the slavery forces and would \"create a deep-seated, intense, and ineradicable hatred of the institution which will crush its political power, at all hazards, and at any cost\".\nThe day after the bill was reintroduced, two Ohioans, Representative Joshua Giddings and Senator Salmon P. Chase, published a free-soil response, \"Appeal of the Independent Democrats in Congress to the People of the United States\": &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We arraign this bill as a gross violation of a sacred pledge; as a criminal betrayal of precious rights; as part and parcel of an atrocious plot to exclude from vast unoccupied region immigrants from the Old World and free laborers from our States, and convert it into a dreary region of despotism, inhabited by masters and slaves.\nDouglas took the appeal personally and responded in Congress, when the debate was opened on January 30 before a full House and packed gallery. Douglas biographer Robert W. Johanssen described part of the speech: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Douglas charged the authors of the \"Appeal\", whom he referred to throughout as the \"Abolitionist confederates\", with having perpetrated a \"base falsehood\" in their protest. He expressed his sense of betrayal, recalling that Chase, \"with a smiling face and the appearance of friendship\", had appealed for a postponement of debate on the ground that he had not yet familiarized himself with the bill. \"Little did I suppose at the time that I granted that act of courtesy\", Douglas remarked, that Chase and his compatriots had published a document \"in which they arraigned me as having been guilty of a criminal betrayal of my trust\", of bad faith, and of plotting against the cause of free government. While other Senators were attending divine worship, they had been \"assembled in a secret conclave\", devoting the Sabbath to their own conspiratorial and deceitful purposes.\nThe debate would continue for four months, as many Anti-Nebraska political rallies were held across the north. Douglas remained the main advocate for the bill while Chase, William Seward, of New York, and Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts, led the opposition. The \"New-York Tribune\" wrote on March 2: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The unanimous sentiment of the North is indignant resistance. ... The whole population is full of it. The feeling in 1848 was far inferior to this in strength and universality.\nThe debate in the Senate concluded on March 4, 1854, when Douglas, beginning near midnight on March 3, made a five-and-a-half-hour speech. The final vote in favor of passage was 37 to 14. Free-state senators voted 14 to 12 in favor, and slave-state senators supported the bill 23 to 2.\nDebate in House of Representatives.\nOn March 21, 1854, as a delaying tactic in the House of Representatives, the legislation was referred by a vote of 110 to 95 to the Committee of the Whole, where it was the last item on the calendar. Realizing from the vote to stall that the act faced an uphill struggle, the Pierce administration made it clear to all Democrats that passage of the bill was essential to the party and would dictate how federal patronage would be handled. Davis and Cushing, from Massachusetts, along with Douglas, spearheaded the partisan efforts. By the end of April, Douglas believed that there were enough votes to pass the bill. The House leadership then began a series of roll call votes in which legislation ahead of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was called to the floor and tabled without debate.\nThomas Hart Benton was among those speaking forcefully against the measure. On April 25, in a House speech that biographer William Nisbet Chambers called \"long, passionate, historical, [and] polemical\", Benton attacked the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, which he \"had stood upon ... above thirty years, and intended to stand upon it to the end\u2014solitary and alone, if need be; but preferring company\". The speech was distributed afterward as a pamphlet when opposition to the action moved outside the walls of Congress.\nIt was not until May 8 that the debate began in the House. The debate was even more intense than in the Senate. While it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that the bill would pass, the opponents went all out to fight it. Historian Michael Morrison wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A filibuster led by Lewis D. Campbell, an Ohio free-soiler, nearly provoked the House into a war of more than words. Campbell, joined by other antislavery northerners, exchanged insults and invectives with southerners, neither side giving quarter. Weapons were brandished on the floor of the House. Finally, bumptiousness gave way to violence. Henry A. Edmundson, a Virginia Democrat, well oiled and well-armed, had to be restrained from making a violent attack on Campbell. Only after the sergeant at arms arrested him, the debate was cut off, and the House adjourned did the melee subside.\nThe floor debate was handled by Alexander Stephens, of Georgia, who insisted that the Missouri Compromise had never been a true compromise but had been imposed on the South. He argued that the issue was whether republican principles, \"that the citizens of every distinct community or State should have the right to govern themselves in their domestic matters as they please\", would be honored.\nThe final House vote in favor of the bill was 113 to 100. Northern Democrats supported the bill 44 to 42, but all 45 northern Whigs opposed it. Southern Democrats voted in favor by 57 to 2, and Southern Whigs supported it by 12 to 7.\nEnactment.\nPresident Franklin Pierce signed the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act into law on May 30, 1854. This act repealed the Missouri Compromise, \"substituting for the ban on slavery what Douglas called 'popular sovereignty' ... arous[ing] a storm of protest throughout the North\".\nAftermath.\nImmediate responses to the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act fell into two classes. The less common response was held by Douglas's supporters, who believed that the bill would withdraw \"the question of slavery from the halls of Congress and the political arena, committing it to the arbitration of those who were immediately interested in, and alone responsible for, its consequences\". In other words, they believed that the Act would leave decisions about whether slavery would be permitted in the hands of the people rather than the Federal government. The far more common response was one of outrage, interpreting Douglas's actions as, in their words, \"part and parcel of an atrocious plot to exclude from a vast unoccupied region emigrant from the Old World, and free laborers from our States, and convert it into a dreary region of despotism, inhabited by masters and slaves\". Especially in the eyes of northerners, the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was aggression and an attack on the power and beliefs of free states. The response led to calls for public action against the South, as seen in broadsides that advertised gatherings in northern states to discuss publicly what to do about the presumption of the Act.\nDouglas and former Illinois Representative Abraham Lincoln aired their disagreement over the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in seven public speeches during September and October 1854. Lincoln gave his most comprehensive argument against slavery and the provisions of the act in Peoria, Illinois, on October 16, in the Peoria Speech. He and Douglas both spoke to the large audience, Douglas first and Lincoln in response, two hours later. Lincoln's three-hour speech presented thorough moral, legal, and economic arguments against slavery and raised Lincoln's political profile for the first time. The speeches set the stage for the Lincoln-Douglas debates four years later, when Lincoln sought Douglas's Senate seat.\nBleeding Kansas.\nBleeding Kansas, Bloody Kansas, or the Border War was a series of violent political confrontations in the United States between 1854 and 1861 involving anti-slavery \"Free-Staters\" and pro-slavery \"Border Ruffian\", or \"Southern\" elements in Kansas. At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would allow or outlaw slavery, and thus enter the Union as a slave state or a free state.\nPro-slavery settlers came to Kansas mainly from neighboring Missouri, successfully vote stacking to form a temporary pro-slavery government prior to statehood. Their influence in territorial elections was often bolstered by resident Missourians who crossed into Kansas solely for voting in such ballots. They formed groups such as the Blue Lodges and were dubbed \"border ruffians\", a term coined by the opponent and abolitionist Horace Greeley. Abolitionist settlers, known as \"jayhawkers\", moved from the East expressly to make Kansas a free state. A clash between the opposing sides was inevitable.\nSuccessive territorial governors, usually sympathetic to slavery, attempted to maintain the peace. The territorial capital of Lecompton, the target of much agitation, became such a hostile environment for Free-Staters that they set up their own, unofficial legislature at Topeka.\nAbolitionist John Brown and his sons gained notoriety in the fight against slavery by murdering five pro-slavery farmers with a broadsword in the 1856 Pottawatomie massacre. Brown also helped defend a few dozen Free-State supporters from several hundred angry pro-slavery supporters at Osawatomie.\nEffect on American Indian tribes.\nBefore the organization of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska territory in 1854, the Kansas and Nebraska Territories were consolidated as part of the Indian Territory. Throughout the 1830s, large-scale relocations of American Indian tribes to the Indian Territory took place, with many Southeastern nations removed to present-day Oklahoma, a process ordered by the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and also known as the Trail of Tears, and many Midwestern nations removed by way of the treaty to present-day Kansas. Among the latter were the Shawnee, Delaware, Kickapoo, Kaskaskia and Peoria, Ioway, and Miami. The passing of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act came into direct conflict with the relocations. White American settlers from both the free-soil North and pro-slavery South flooded the Northern Indian Territory, hoping to influence the vote on slavery that would come following the admittance of Kansas and, to a lesser extent, Nebraska to the United States.\nTo avoid and/or alleviate the reservation-settlement problem, further treaty negotiations were attempted with the tribes of Kansas and Nebraska. In 1854 alone, the U.S. agreed to acquire lands in Kansas or Nebraska from several tribes including the Kickapoo, Delaware, Omaha, Shawnee, Otoe and Missouri, Miami, and Kaskaskia and Peoria. In exchange for their land cessions, the tribes largely received small reservations in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma or Kansas in some cases.\nFor the nations that remained in Kansas beyond 1854, the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act introduced a host of other problems. In 1855, white \"squatters\" built the city of Leavenworth on the Delaware reservation without the consent of either Delaware or the US government. When Commissioner of Indian Affairs George Manypenny ordered military support in removing the squatters, both the military and the squatters refused to comply, undermining both Federal authority and the treaties in place with Delaware. In addition to the violations of treaty agreements, other promises made were not being kept. Construction and infrastructure improvement projects dedicated to nearly every treaty, for example, took a great deal longer than expected. Beyond that, however, the most damaging violation by white American settlers was the mistreatment of American Indians and their properties. Personal maltreatment, destroyed property, and deforestation have all been cited. Furthermore, the squatters' premature and illegal settlement of the Kansas Territory jeopardized the value of the land, and with it the future of the Indian tribes living on them. Because treaties were land cessions and purchases, the value of the land handed over to the Federal government was critical to the payment received by a given Indian nation. Deforestation, destruction of property, and other general injuries to the land lowered the value of the territories that were ceded by the Kansas Territory Indian tribes.\nManypenny's 1856 \"Report on Indian Affairs\" explained the devastating effect on Indian populations of diseases that white settlers brought to Kansas. Without providing statistics, Indian Affairs Superintendent to the area Colonel Alfred Cumming reported at least more deaths than births in most tribes in the area. While noting intemperance, or alcoholism, as a leading cause of death, Cumming specifically cited cholera, smallpox, and measles, none of which the American Indians were able to treat Themselves from. The disastrous epidemics exemplified the Osage people, who lost an estimated 1300 lives to scurvy, measles, smallpox, and scrofula between 1852 and 1856, contributing, in part, to the massive decline in population, from 8000 in 1850 to just 3500 in 1860. The Osage had already encountered epidemics associated with relocation and white settlement. The initial removal acts in the 1830s brought both White American settlers and foreign American Indian tribes to the Great Plains and into contact with the Osage people. Between 1829 and 1843, influenza, cholera, and smallpox killed an estimated 1242 Osage Indians, resulting in a population recession of roughly 20 percent between 1830 and 1850.\nDestruction of the Whig party.\nFrom a political standpoint, the Whig Party had been in decline in the South because of the effectiveness with which it had been hammered by the Democratic Party over slavery. The Southern Whigs hoped that by seizing the initiative on this issue, they would be identified as strong defenders of slavery. Many Northern Whigs broke with them in the Act.\nThe American party system had been dominated by Whigs and Democrats for decades leading up to the Civil War. But the Whig party's increasing internal divisions had made it a party of strange bedfellows by the 1850s. An ascendant anti-slavery wing clashed with a traditionalist and increasingly pro-slavery Southern wing. These divisions came to a head in the 1852 election, where Whig candidate Winfield Scott was trounced by Franklin Pierce. Southern Whigs felt burned by prior Whig president Zachary Taylor, and were unwilling to support another Whig (Taylor, despite being a slave owner himself, had proved willing to stand against slaveholder interests during his presidency). With the loss of Southern Whig support and the loss of votes in the North to the Free Soil Party, Whigs seemed doomed. So they were, as they would never again contest a presidential election.\nThe Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was the final nail in the Whig coffin. It was also the spark that began the Republican Party, which would take in both Whigs and Free Soilers (as well as sympathetic northern Democrats like Fr\u00e9mont) to fill the anti-slavery void that the Whig Party had never seemed willing to fill. The changes in the act were viewed by anti-slavery Northerners as an aggressive, expansionist maneuver by the slave-owning South. Opponents of the Act were intensely motivated and began forming a new party. The party began as a coalition of anti-slavery Conscience Whigs such as Zachariah Chandler and Free Soilers such as Salmon P. Chase.\nThe first anti-Nebraska local meeting where \"Republican\" was suggested as a name for a new anti-slavery party was held in a Ripon, Wisconsin schoolhouse on March 20, 1854. The first statewide convention that formed a platform and nominated candidates under the Republican name was held near Jackson, Michigan, on July 6, 1854. At that convention, the party opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories and selected a statewide slate of candidates. The Midwest took the lead in forming state Republican Party tickets; apart from St. Louis and a few areas adjacent to free states, there were no efforts to organize the Party in the Southern states. So was born the Republican Party\u2014campaigning on the popular, emotional issue of \"free soil\" in the frontier\u2014which would capture the White House just six years later.\nLater developments.\nThe Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act divided the nation and pointed it toward civil war. Congressional Democrats suffered huge losses in the mid-term elections of 1854, as voters provided support to a wide array of new parties that opposed the Democrats and the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. Pierce deplored the new Republican Party, because of its perceived anti-Southern, anti-slavery stance. To Northerners, the President's perceived Southern bias did anything but de-escalate public mood and helped inflame abolitionist anger.\nPartly due to the unpopularity of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, Pierce lost his bid for re-nomination at the 1856 Democratic National Convention to James Buchanan. Pierce was the first elected president who actively sought reelection but was denied his party's nomination for a second term. Republicans nominated John C. Fr\u00e9mont in the 1856 presidential election and campaigned on \"Bleeding Kansas\" and the unpopularity of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. Buchanan won the election, but Fr\u00e9mont carried a majority of the free states. Two days after Buchanan's inauguration, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the \"Dred Scott\" decision, which asserted that Congress had no constitutional power to exclude slavery in the territories. Douglas continued to support the doctrine of popular sovereignty, but Buchanan insisted that Democrats respect the \"Dred Scott\" decision and its repudiation of federal interference with slavery in the territories.\nGuerrilla warfare in Kansas continued throughout Buchanan's presidency and extended into the 1860s, continuing until the American Civil War ended in 1865, with many unjust killings and lootings performed by partisans on either side of the border. Buchanan attempted to admit Kansas as a state under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution, but Kansas voters rejected that constitution in an August 1858 referendum. Anti-slavery delegates won a majority of the elections to the 1859 Kansas constitutional convention, and Kansas won admission as a free state under the anti-slavery Wyandotte Constitution in the final months of Buchanan's presidency.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These reflectors are often enclosed in a tube, usually containing on one end a cell with loose, colored pieces of glass or other transparent (and/or opaque) materials to be reflected into the viewed pattern. Rotation of the cell causes motion of the materials, resulting in an ever-changing view being presented.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"kaleidoscope\" was coined by its Scottish inventor David Brewster. It is derived from the Ancient Greek word (), \"beautiful, beauty\", (), \"form, appearance\" and (), \"to look, to examine\", hence \"observation of beautiful forms\". It was first published in the patent that was granted on July 10, 1817.\nHistory.\nMultiple reflection by two or more reflecting surfaces has been known since antiquity and was described as such by Giambattista della Porta in his \"Magia Naturalis\" (1558\u20131589). In 1646, Athanasius Kircher described an experiment with a construction of two mirrors, which could be opened and closed like a book and positioned in various angles, showing regular polygon figures consisting of reflected aliquot sectors of 360\u00b0. Richard Bradley's \"New Improvements in Planting and Gardening\" (1717) described a similar construction to be placed on geometrical drawings to show an image with multiplied reflection. However, an optimal configuration that produces the full effects of the kaleidoscope was not recorded before 1815.\nIn 1814, Sir David Brewster conducted experiments on light polarization by successive reflections between plates of glass and first noted \"the circular arrangement of the images of a candle round a center, and the multiplication of the sectors formed by the extremities of the plates of glass\". He forgot about it, but noticed a more impressive version of the effect during further experiments in February 1815. A while later, he was impressed by the multiplied reflection of a bit of cement that was pressed through at the end of a triangular glass trough, which appeared more regular and almost perfectly symmetrical in comparison to the reflected objects that had been situated further away from the reflecting plates in earlier experiments. This triggered more experiments to find the conditions for the most beautiful and symmetrically perfect conditions. An early version had pieces of colored glass and other irregular objects fixed permanently and was admired by some Members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, including Sir George Mackenzie who predicted its popularity. A version followed in which some of the objects and pieces of glass could move when the tube was rotated. The last step, regarded as most important by Brewster, was to place the reflecting panes in a draw tube with a concave lens to distinctly introduce surrounding objects into the reflected pattern.\nBrewster thought his instrument to be of great value in \"all the ornamental arts\" as a device that creates an \"infinity of patterns\". Artists could accurately delineate the produced figures of the kaleidoscope by means of the solar microscope (a type of camera obscura device), magic lantern or camera lucida. Brewster believed it would at the same time become a popular instrument \"for the purposes of rational amusement\". He decided to apply for a patent. British patent no.\u00a04136 \"for a new Optical Instrument called \"The Kaleidoscope\" for exhibiting and creating beautiful Forms and Patterns of great use in all the ornamental Arts\" was granted in July 1817. Unfortunately, the manufacturer originally engaged to produce the product had shown one of the patent instruments to London opticians to see if he could get orders from them. Soon the instrument was copied and marketed before the manufacturer had prepared any number of kaleidoscopes for sale. An estimated two hundred thousand kaleidoscopes sold in London and Paris in just three months. Brewster figured at most a thousand of these were authorized copies that were constructed correctly, while the majority of the others did not give a correct impression of his invention. Because so relatively few people had experienced a proper kaleidoscope or knew how to apply it to ornamental arts, he decided to publicize a treatise on the principles and the correct construction of the kaleidoscope.\nIt was thought that the patent was reduced in a Court of Law since its principles were supposedly already known. Brewster stated that the kaleidoscope was different because the particular positions of the object and of the eye, played a very important role in producing the beautiful symmetrical forms. Brewster's opinion was shared by several scientists, including James Watt.\nPhilip Carpenter originally tried to produce his own imitation of the kaleidoscope, but was not satisfied with the results. He decided to offer his services to Brewster as manufacturer. Brewster agreed and Carpenter's models were stamped \"sole maker\". Realizing that the company could not meet the level of demand, Brewster gained permission from Carpenter in 1818 for the device to be made by other manufacturers. In his 1819 \"Treatise on the Kaleidoscope\" Brewster listed more than a dozen manufacturers/sellers of patent kaleidoscopes. Carpenter's company would keep on selling kaleidoscopes for 60 years.\nIn 1987, kaleidoscope artist Thea Marshall, working with the Willamette Science and Technology Center, a science museum located in Eugene, Oregon, designed and constructed a 1,000-square-foot (93\u00a0m2) traveling mathematics and science exhibition titled \"Kaleidoscopes: Reflections of Science and Art\". With funding from the National Science Foundation, and circulated under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), the exhibition appeared in 15 science museums over a three-year period, reaching more than one million visitors in the United States and Canada. Interactive exhibit modules enabled visitors to better understand and appreciate how kaleidoscopes function.\nVariations.\nGeneral variations.\nDavid Brewster defined several variables in his patent and publications:\nDifferent versions suggested by Brewster.\nIn his patent, Brewster perceived two forms for the kaleidoscope:\nIn his \"Treatise on the Kaleidoscope\" (1819) he described the basic form with an object cell:\nBrewster also developed several variations:\nBrewster also imagined another application for the kaleidoscope:\nLater variations.\nManufacturers and artists have created kaleidoscopes with a wide variety of materials and in many shapes. A few of these added elements that were not previously described by inventor David Brewster: \nPublications.\nCozy Baker (d. October 19, 2010)\u2014founder of the Brewster Kaleidoscope Society\u2014collected kaleidoscopes and wrote books about many of the artists making them in the 1970s through 2001. Her book \"Kaleidoscope Artistry\" is a limited compendium of kaleidoscope makers, containing pictures of the interior and exterior views of contemporary artworks. Baker is credited with energizing a renaissance in kaleidoscope-making in the US; she spent her life putting kaleidoscope artists and galleries together so they would know each other and encourage each other.\nIn 1999, a short-lived magazine dedicated to kaleidoscopes\u2014\"Kaleidoscope Review\"\u2014was published, covering artists, collectors, dealers, events, and including how-to articles. This magazine was created and edited by Brett Bensley, at that time a well-known kaleidoscope artist and resource on kaleidoscope information. Changed name to \"The New Kaleidoscope Review\", and then switched to a video presentation on YouTube, \"The Kaleidoscope Maker\".\nCultural impact.\nIn her album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, released September of 2023, Chappell Roan released the song Kaleidoscope, which compares love to the unpredictable nature of the kaleidoscope. This song mentions kaleidoscopes four times. \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17044", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17044", "title": "Common kestrel", "text": "Species of bird\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), also known as the European kestrel, Eurasian kestrel or Old World kestrel, is a species of predatory bird belonging to the kestrel group of the falcon family Falconidae. In the United Kingdom, where no other kestrel species commonly occurs, it is generally just called the \"kestrel\".\nThis species occurs over a large native range. It is widespread in Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as occasionally reaching the east coast of North America. It has colonized a few oceanic islands, but vagrant individuals are generally rare; in the whole of Micronesia for example, the species was only recorded twice each on Guam and Saipan in the Marianas.\nTaxonomy.\nThe common kestrel was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his \"Systema Naturae\" under the current binomial name \"Falco tinnunculus\". Linnaeus specified the type location as Europe but restricted this to Sweden in 1761. The genus name is Late Latin from \"falx\", \"falcis\", a sickle, referencing the claws of the bird. The species name \"tinnunculus\" is Latin for \"kestrel\" from \"tinnulus\", \"shrill\". The Latin name \"tinnunculus\" had been used by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1555. The word \"kestrel\" is derived from the French cr\u00e9cerelle which is diminutive for cr\u00e9celle, which also referred to a bell used by lepers. The word is earlier spelt 'c/kastrel', and is evidenced from the 15th century. The kestrel was once used to drive and keep away pigeons. Archaic names for the kestrel include \"windhover\" and \"windfucker,\" due to its habit of beating the wind (hovering in air).\nThis species is part of a clade that contains the kestrel species with black malar stripes, a feature which apparently was not present in the most ancestral kestrels. They seem to have radiated in the Gelasian (Late Pliocene, roughly 2.5\u20132 mya, probably starting in tropical East Africa, as indicated by mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" sequence data analysis and considerations of biogeography. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 found that the common kestrel's closest relatives were the spotted kestrel \"Falco moluccensis\" and the Nankeen kestrel \"Falco cenchroides\".\nThe rock kestrel (\"F. rupicolus\"), previously considered a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species. The lesser kestrel (\"F. naumanni\"), which much resembles a small common kestrel with no black on the upperside except wing and tail tips, is probably not very closely related to the present species, and the American kestrel (\"F. sparverius\") is apparently not a true kestrel at all. Both species have much grey in their wings in males, which does not occur in the common kestrel or its close living relatives but does in almost all other falcons.\nSubspecies.\nEleven subspecies are recognised. Most differ little, and mainly in accordance with Bergmann's and Gloger's rules. Tropical African forms have less grey in the male plumage.\nThe common kestrels of Europe living during cold periods of the Quaternary glaciation differed slightly in size from the current population; they are sometimes referred to as the paleosubspecies \"F. t. atavus\" (\"see also\" Bergmann's rule). The remains of these birds, which presumably were the direct ancestors of the living \"F. t. tinnunculus\" (and perhaps other subspecies), are found throughout the then-unglaciated parts of Europe, from the Late Pliocene (ELMA Villanyian/ICS Piacenzian, MN16) about 3 million years ago to the Middle Pleistocene Saalian glaciation which ended about 130,000 years ago, when they finally gave way to birds indistinguishable from those living today. Some of the voles the Ice Age common kestrels ate\u2014such as European pine voles (\"Microtus subterraneus\")\u2014were indistinguishable from those alive today. Other prey species of that time evolved more rapidly (like \"M. malei\", the presumed ancestor of today's tundra vole \"M. oeconomus\"), while yet again others seem to have gone entirely extinct without leaving any living descendants\u2014for example \"Pliomys lenki\", which apparently fell victim to the Weichselian glaciation about 100,000 years ago.\nDescription.\nThe common kestrel measures from head to tail, with a wingspan of . The female is noticeably larger, with the adult male weighing , around on average; the adult female weighs , around on average. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most songbirds. Like the other \"Falco\" species, they have long wings as well as a distinctive long tail.\nThe plumage is mainly light chestnut brown with blackish spots on the upperside and buff with narrow blackish streaks on the underside; the remiges are also blackish. Unlike most raptors, they display sexual colour dimorphism with the male having fewer black spots and streaks, as well as a blue-grey cap and tail. The tail is brown with black bars in females, and has a black tip with a narrow white rim in both sexes. All common kestrels have a prominent black malar stripe like their closest relatives.\nThe cere, feet, and a narrow ring around the eye are bright yellow; the toenails, bill and iris are dark. Juveniles look like adult females, but the underside streaks are wider; the yellow of their bare parts is paler. Hatchlings are covered in white down feathers, changing to a buff-grey second down coat before they grow their first true plumage.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nIn the cool-temperate parts of its range, the common kestrel migrates south in winter; otherwise it is sedentary, though juveniles may wander around in search for a good place to settle down as they become mature. It is a diurnal animal of the lowlands and prefers open habitat such as fields, heaths, shrubland and marshland. It does not require woodland to be present as long as there are alternative perching and nesting sites like rocks or buildings. It will thrive in treeless steppe where there are abundant herbaceous plants and shrubs to support a population of prey animals. The common kestrel readily adapts to human settlement, as long as sufficient swathes of vegetation are available, and may even be found in wetlands, moorlands and arid savanna. It is found from the sea to the lower mountain ranges, reaching elevations up to ASL in the hottest tropical parts of its range but only to about in the subtropical climate of the Himalayan foothills.\nGlobally, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN. Its stocks were affected by the indiscriminate use of organochlorines and other pesticides in the mid-20th century, but being something of an r-strategist able to multiply quickly under good conditions it was less affected than other birds of prey. The global population has been fluctuating considerably over the years but remains generally stable; it is roughly estimated at 1\u20132 million pairs or so, about 20% of which are found in Europe. There has been a recent decline in parts of Western Europe such as Ireland. Subspecies \"dacotiae\" is quite rare, numbering less than 1000 adult birds in 1990, when the ancient western Canarian subspecies \"canariensis\" numbered about ten times as many birds.\nFood and feeding.\nWhen hunting, the common kestrel characteristically hovers about above the ground, searching for prey, either by flying into the wind or by soaring using ridge lift. Like most birds of prey, common kestrels have keen eyesight enabling them to spot small prey from a distance. Once prey is sighted, the bird makes a short, steep dive toward the target, unlike the peregrine which relies on longer, higher dives to reach full speed when targeting prey. Kestrels can often be found hunting along the sides of roads and motorways, where the road verges support large numbers of prey. This species is able to see near ultraviolet light, allowing the birds to detect the urine trails around rodent burrows as they shine in an ultraviolet colour in the sunlight. Another favourite (but less conspicuous) hunting technique is to perch a bit above the ground cover, surveying the area. When the bird spots prey animals moving by, it will pounce on them. They also prowl a patch of hunting ground in a ground-hugging flight, ambushing prey as they happen across it.\nThey eat almost exclusively mouse-sized mammals. Voles, shrews and true mice supply up to three-quarters or more of the biomass most individuals ingest. On oceanic islands (where mammals are often scarce), small birds (mainly passerines) may make up the bulk of its diet. Elsewhere, birds are only an important food during a few weeks each summer when inexperienced fledglings abound. Other suitably sized vertebrates like bats, swifts, frogs and lizards are eaten only on rare occasions. However, kestrels are more likely to prey on lizards in southern latitudes. In northern latitudes, the kestrel is found more often to deliver lizards to their nestlings during midday and also with increasing ambient temperature. Seasonally, arthropods may be a main prey item. Generally, invertebrates like camel spiders and even earthworms, but mainly sizeable insects such as beetles, orthopterans and winged termites will be eaten.\nThe common kestrel requires the equivalent of 4\u20138 voles a day, depending on energy expenditure (time of the year, amount of hovering, etc.). They have been known to catch several voles in succession and cache some for later consumption. An individual nestling consumes on average 4.2\u00a0g/h, equivalent to 67.8\u00a0g/d (3\u20134 voles per day).\nBreeding.\nThe common kestrel starts breeding in spring (or the start of the dry season in the tropics), i.e. April or May in temperate Eurasia and some time between August and December in the tropics and southern Africa. It is a cavity nester, preferring holes in cliffs, trees or buildings; in built-up areas, common kestrels will often nest on buildings, and will reuse the old nests of corvids. The diminutive subspecies \"dacotiae\", the \"sarnicolo\" of the eastern Canary Islands is peculiar for nesting occasionally in the dried fronds below the top of palm trees, apparently coexisting with small songbirds which also make their home there. In general, common kestrels will usually tolerate conspecifics nesting nearby, and sometimes a few dozen pairs may be found nesting in a loose colony.\nThe clutch is normally 3\u20137 eggs; more eggs may be laid in total but some will be removed during the laying time. This lasts about 2 days per egg laid. The eggs are abundantly patterned with brown spots, from a wash that tinges the entire surface buffish white to large almost-black blotches. Incubation lasts from 4 weeks to one month, both male and female will take shifts incubating the eggs. After the eggs have hatched, the parents share brooding and hunting duties. Only the female feeds the chicks, by tearing apart prey into manageable chunks. The young fledge after 4\u20135 weeks. The family stays close together for a few weeks, during which time the young learn how to fend for themselves and hunt prey. The young become sexually mature the next breeding season. Female kestrel chicks with blacker plumage have been found to have bolder personalities, indicating that even in juvenile birds plumage coloration can act as a status signal.\nData from Britain shows nesting pairs bringing up about 2\u20133 chicks on average, though this includes a considerable rate of total brood failures; actually, few pairs that do manage to fledge offspring raise less than 3 or 4. Compared to their siblings, first-hatched chicks have greater survival and recruitment probability, thought to be due to the first-hatched chicks obtaining a higher body condition when in the nest. Population cycles of prey, particularly voles, have a considerable influence on breeding success. Most common kestrels die before they reach 2 years of age; mortality up until the first birthday may be as high as 70%. At least females generally breed at one year of age; possibly, some males take a year longer to maturity as they do in related species. The biological lifespan to death from senescence can be 16 years or more, however; one was recorded to have lived almost 24 years.\nIn culture.\nThe kestrel is sometimes seen, like other birds of prey, as a symbol of the power and vitality of nature. In \"Into Battle\" (1915), the war poet Julian Grenfell invokes the superhuman characteristics of the kestrel among several birds, when hoping for prowess in battle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGerard Manley Hopkins (1844\u20131889) writes on the kestrel in his poem \"The Windhover\", exalting in their mastery of flight and their majesty in the sky.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA kestrel is also one of the main characters in \"The Animals of Farthing Wood\".\nBarry Hines' novel \"A Kestrel for a Knave\" - together with the 1969 film based on it, Ken Loach's \"Kes\" - is about a working-class boy in England who befriends a kestrel.\nThe Pathan name for the kestrel, B\u0101d Khurak, means \"wind hover\" and in Punjab it is called Larz\u0101nak or \"little hoverer\". It was once used as a decoy to capture other birds of prey in Persia and Arabia. It was also used to train greyhounds meant for hunting gazelles in parts of Arabia. Young greyhounds would be set after jerboa-rats which would also be distracted and forced to make twists and turns by the dives of a kestrel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is native to the eastern United States. Its range stretches from southern Maine to northern Florida, and west to Indiana and Louisiana. Mountain laurel is the state flower of Connecticut and Pennsylvania. It is the namesake of Laurel County in Kentucky, the city of Laurel, Mississippi, and the Laurel Highlands in southwestern Pennsylvania.\nDescription.\n\"Kalmia latifolia\" is an evergreen shrub growing tall. The leaves are 3\u201312\u00a0cm long and 1\u20134\u00a0cm wide. The flowers are pentagonal, ranging from light pink to white, and occur in clusters. There are several named cultivars that have darker shades of pink, red and maroon. It blooms in May and June. All parts of the plant are poisonous. The roots are fibrous and matted.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Kalmia latifolia\" was named and described by the renowned Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1753. In his description, Linnaeus referred to an earlier description and illustration of \"Chamaedaphne foliis\" published by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in 1743. Catesby's illustration was designated as the lectotype of \"Kalmia latifolia\" L. in 1993.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe plant is naturally found on rocky slopes and mountainous forest areas. It thrives in acid soil, preferring a soil pH in the 4.5 to 5.5 range. The plant often grows in large thickets, covering great areas of forest floor. In the Appalachians, it can become a tree but is a shrub farther north. The species is a frequent component of oak-heath forests. In low, wet areas it grows densely, but in dry uplands has a more sparse form. In the southern Appalachians, laurel thickets are referred to as \"laurel hells\u201d or \u201claurel slicks\u201d because it is nearly impossible to pass through one.\nEcology.\n\"Kalmia latifolia\" has been marked as a pollinator plant, supporting and attracting butterflies and hummingbirds.\nIt is also notable for its unusual method of dispensing its pollen. As the flower grows, the filaments of its stamens are bent and brought into tension. When an insect lands on the flower, the tension is released, catapulting the pollen forcefully onto the insect. Experiments have shown the flower capable of flinging its pollen up to 15\u00a0cm. Physicist Lyman J. Briggs became fascinated with this phenomenon in the 1950s after his retirement from the National Bureau of Standards and conducted a series of experiments in order to explain it.\nEtymology.\n\"Kalmia latifolia\" is also known as ivybush or spoonwood (because Native Americans used to make their spoons out of it).\nThe plant was first recorded in America in 1624, but it was named after the Finnish explorer and botanist Pehr Kalm (1716\u20131779), who sent samples to Linnaeus.\nThe Latin specific epithet \"latifolia\" means \"with broad leaves\" \u2013 as opposed to its sister species \"Kalmia angustifolia\", \"with narrow leaves\".\nDespite the name \"mountain laurel\", \"Kalmia latifolia\" is not closely related to the true laurels of the family Lauraceae.\nCultivation.\nThe plant was originally brought to Europe as an ornamental plant during the 18th century. It is still widely grown for its attractive flowers and year-round evergreen leaves. Elliptic, alternate, leathery, glossy evergreen leaves (to 5\" long) are dark green above and yellow green beneath and reminiscent of the leaves of rhododendrons. All parts of this plant are toxic if ingested. Numerous cultivars have been selected with varying flower color. Many of the cultivars have originated from the Connecticut Experiment Station in Hamden and from the plant breeding of Dr. Richard Jaynes. Jaynes has numerous named varieties that he has created and is considered the world's authority on \"Kalmia latifolia\".\nIn the UK the following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\nWood.\nThe wood of the mountain laurel is heavy and strong but brittle, with a close, straight grain. It has never been a viable commercial crop as it does not grow large enough, yet it is suitable for wreaths, furniture, bowls and other household items. It was used in the early 19th century in wooden-works clocks. Root burls were used for pipe bowls in place of imported briar burls unattainable during World War II. It can be used for handrails or guard rails.\nToxicity.\nMountain laurel is poisonous to several animals, including horses, goats, cattle, deer, monkeys, and humans, due to grayanotoxin and arbutin. The green parts of the plant, flowers, twigs, and pollen are all toxic, including food products made from them, such as toxic honey that may produce neurotoxic and gastrointestinal symptoms in humans eating more than a modest amount. Symptoms of toxicity begin to appear about 6 hours following ingestion. Symptoms include irregular or difficulty breathing, anorexia, repeated swallowing, profuse salivation, watering of the eyes and nose, cardiac distress, incoordination, depression, vomiting, frequent defecation, weakness, convulsions, paralysis, coma, and eventually death. Necropsy of animals who have died from spoonwood poisoning show gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\nUse by Native Americans.\nThe Cherokee use the plant as an analgesic, placing an infusion of leaves on scratches made over location of the pain. They also rub the bristly edges of ten to twelve leaves over the skin for rheumatism, crush the leaves to rub brier scratches, use an infusion as a wash \"to get rid of pests\", use a compound as a liniment, rub leaf ooze into the scratched skin of ball players to prevent cramps, and use a leaf salve for healing. They also use the wood for carving.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name was coined in the 1960s by Norodom Sihanouk to describe his country's heterogeneous, communist-led dissidents, with whom he allied after the 1970 Cambodian coup d'\u00e9tat.\nThe Kampuchea Revolutionary Army was slowly built up in the forests of eastern Cambodia during the late 1960s, supported by the People's Army of Vietnam, the Viet Cong, the Pathet Lao, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Although it originally fought against Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge changed its position and supported Sihanouk following the CCP's advice after he was overthrown in a 1970 coup d'\u00e9tat by Lon Nol who established the pro-American Khmer Republic. Despite a massive American bombing campaign (Operation Freedom Deal) against them, the Khmer Rouge won the Cambodian Civil War when they captured the Cambodian capital and overthrew the Khmer Republic in 1975. Following their victory, the Khmer Rouge\u2014who were led by Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Son Sen, and Khieu Samphan\u2014immediately set about forcibly evacuating the country's major cities. In 1976, they renamed the country Democratic Kampuchea.\nThe Khmer Rouge regime was highly autocratic, totalitarian, and repressive. Many deaths resulted from the regime's social engineering policies and the \"Moha Lout Plaoh\", an imitation of China's Great Leap Forward which had caused the Great Chinese Famine. The Khmer Rouge's attempts at agricultural reform through collectivization similarly led to widespread famine, while its insistence on absolute self-sufficiency, including the supply of medicine, led to the death of many thousands from treatable diseases, such as malaria.\nThe Khmer Rouge regime murdered hundreds of thousands of their perceived political opponents, and their racist emphasis on national purity resulted in the genocide of Cambodian minorities. Its cadres summarily executed and tortured perceived subversive elements, or they killed them during genocidal purges of their own ranks between 1975 and 1979. Ultimately, the Cambodian genocide which took place under the Khmer Rouge regime led to the deaths of 1.5 to 2\u00a0million people, around 25% of Cambodia's population.\nIn the 1970s, the Khmer Rouge was largely supported and funded by the CCP, receiving approval from CCP Chairman Mao Zedong; it is estimated that at least 90% of the foreign aid which was provided to the Khmer Rouge came from China. The regime was removed from power in 1979 when Vietnam invaded Cambodia and quickly destroyed most of its forces. The Khmer Rouge then fled to Thailand, whose government saw them as a buffer force against the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The Khmer Rouge continued to fight against the Vietnamese and the government of the new People's Republic of Kampuchea until the end of the war in 1989. The Cambodian governments-in-exile (including the Khmer Rouge) held onto Cambodia's United Nations seat (with considerable international support) until 1993, when the monarchy was restored and the name of the Cambodian state was changed to the Kingdom of Cambodia. A year later, thousands of Khmer Rouge guerrillas surrendered themselves in a government amnesty.\nIn 1996, a new political party called the Democratic National Union Movement was formed by Ieng Sary, who was granted amnesty, despite his role as the deputy leader of the Khmer Rouge, in exchange for his defection and his role in persuading other Khmer Rouge fighters to surrender. This move helped to further dissolve the Khmer Rouge organization and was a calculated political decision to end the ongoing civil war by incorporating former resistance leaders. The Khmer Rouge was largely dissolved by the mid-1990s and finally surrendered completely in 1999. Ieng Sary was arrested in 2007 and was charged with crimes against humanity but died of heart failure before the case against him could be brought to a verdict. In 2014, two Khmer Rouge leaders, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, were jailed for life by the United Nations-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, which found them guilty of crimes against humanity for their roles in the Khmer Rouge's genocidal campaign.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Khmers rouges\", French for red Khmers, was coined by King Norodom Sihanouk and it was later adopted by English speakers (in the form of the corrupted version Khmer Rouge). It was used to refer to a succession of communist parties in Cambodia which evolved into the Communist Party of Kampuchea and later the Party of Democratic Kampuchea. Its military was known successively as the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea.\nSince the deterioration in relations between Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea, the Vietnamese government no longer recognize the legitimacy of the Khmer Rouge, and as a result, they call the Khmer Rouge the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique () or the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary reactionary clique ().\nIdeology.\nInfluence of Communist thought.\nThe movement's ideology was shaped by a power struggle during 1976 in which the so-called Party Centre, which was led by Pol Pot, the general secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, defeated other regional elements of its leadership. The Party Centre's ideology combined elements of communism with a strongly xenophobic form of Khmer nationalism. Partly because of its secrecy and partly because of changes in how it presented itself, academic interpretations of its political position vary widely, ranging from interpreting it as the \"purest\" Marxist\u2013Leninist movement to characterising it as an anti-Marxist \"peasant revolution\". The first interpretation has been criticized by historian Ben Kiernan, who asserts that it comes from a \"convenient anti-communist perspective\". Its leaders and theorists, most of whom had been exposed to the heavily Stalinist outlook of the French Communist Party during the 1950s, developed a distinctive and eclectic \"post-Leninist\" ideology that drew on elements of Stalinism, Maoism and the postcolonial theory of Frantz Fanon. In the early 1970s, the Khmer Rouge looked to the model of Enver Hoxha's Albania, which they believed was the most advanced communist state which was then in existence.\nMany of the regime's characteristics\u2014such as its focus on the rural peasantry rather than the urban proletariat as the bulwark of revolution, its emphasis on Great Leap Forward-type initiatives, its desire to abolish personal interest in human behaviour, its promotion of communal living and eating, and its focus on perceived common sense over technical knowledge\u2014appear to have been heavily influenced by Maoist ideology; however, the Khmer Rouge displayed these characteristics in a more extreme form. Additionally, non-Khmers, who constituted a significant part of the supposedly favored segment of the peasantry, were singled out because of their race. According to Ben Kiernan, this was \"neither a communist proletarian revolution that privileged the working class, nor a peasant revolution that favored all farmers\".\nWhile the CPK described itself as the \"number 1 Communist state\" once it was in power, some communist regimes, such as Vietnam, saw it as a Maoist deviation from orthodox Marxism. According to author Rebecca Gidley, the Khmer Rouge \"almost immediately erred by implementing a Maoist doctrine rather than following the Marxist\u2013Leninist prescriptions.\" The Maoist and Khmer Rouge belief that human willpower could overcome material and historical conditions was strongly at odds with mainstream Marxism, which emphasised historical materialism and the idea of history as inevitable progression toward communism. In 1981, following the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War, in an attempt to get foreign support, the Khmer Rouge officially renounced communism.\nKhmer nationalism.\nOne of the regime's main characteristics was its form of Khmer nationalism, which combined an idealisation of the Khmer Empire (802\u20131431) and the late Middle Period of Cambodia (1431\u20131863) with an existential fear for the survival of the Cambodian state, which had historically been liquidated during periods of Vietnamese and Siamese intervention. The spillover of Vietnamese fighters from the Vietnamese\u2013American War further aggravated anti-Vietnamese sentiments: the Khmer Republic under Lon Nol, overthrown by the Khmer Rouge, had promoted Mon-Khmer nationalism and was responsible for several anti-Vietnamese pogroms during the 1970s. Some historians such as Ben Kiernan have stated that the importance which the regime gave to race overshadowed its conceptions of class.\nThe Khmer Rouge targeted particular groups of people, among them Buddhist monks, ethnic minorities, and educated elites.\nOnce in power, the Khmer Rouge explicitly targeted the Chinese, the Vietnamese, the Cham minority and even their partially Khmer offspring. The same attitude extended to the party's own ranks, as senior CPK figures of non-Khmer ethnicity were removed from the leadership despite extensive revolutionary experience and were often killed.\nA Vietnamese official called the Khmer Rouge leaders \"Hitlerite-fascists\", while the General Secretary of the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, Pen Sovan, referred to the Khmer Rouge as a \"draconian, dictatorial and fascist regime\".\nEconomy.\nThe goal of Khmer Rouge was to create a communist society through the complete and immediate abolition of money, trade and private property. The new society was to be perfectly egalitarian, which required homogeneity, which Khmer Rouge sought to achieve through the destruction of existing social structures and the uniformisation of the newly emerging socialist society. To this end, the creation of a \"new society\" that would completely break with the existing traditions and cultural heritage of Cambodia was also considered necessary. One of the Khmer Rouge activists stated: \"We must burn the old grass so that new grass can grow.\" For Khmer Rouge, egalitarianism also included the concept of \"levelling down\"\u2014Cambodian society was to be brought to the level of the rural poor and develop from there; anything that was inaccessible to the general public was considered bourgeois and a luxury that had to be destroyed.\nThe leading economic theorist of Khmer Rouge, Hou Yuon, distinguished two types of economic systems: \"natural\" (natural economy) and \"commodity\" (trade-based); in the agricultural conditions of Cambodia, the \"commodity\" economy was considered a parasite on the \"natural\" economy\u2014according to Youn's calculations, rice producers received only 26% of the profits. This formed the basis of Khmer Rouge's hostility towards cities, as urban areas were seen as playing a parasitic role in the pre-industrial society of Cambodia, and even the urban working class was considered a relatively privileged group. Khmer Rouge instead postulated socialism built on agrarianism\u2014the poorest peasants, organized into production cooperatives, were considered the main and in fact the only force of the revolution; one of the Khmer Rouge's slogans was \"agriculture is the basis for further industrial expansion\"\u2014the economy was to be based on agriculture, with the development of industry postponed for the future. The Cambodian economy was also supposed to be self-sufficient along the principle of \"reliance on one's own strength\", which Khmer Rouge considered necessary to ensure the independence of the Cambodian revolution from imperialism and neo-colonialism, even if this entailed technological regression. \nAutarky.\nThe Khmer Rouge's economic policy, which was largely based on the plans of Khieu Samphan, focused on the achievement of national self-reliance through an initial phase of agricultural collectivism. This would then be used as a route to achieve rapid social transformation and industrial and technological development without assistance from foreign powers, a process which the party characterised as a \"Super Great Leap Forward\".\nThe party's General Secretary Pol Pot strongly influenced the propagation of the policy of autarky. He was reportedly impressed with the self-sufficient manner in which the mountain tribes of Cambodia lived, which the party believed was a form of primitive communism. Khmer Rouge theory developed the concept that the nation should take \"agriculture as the basic factor and use the fruits of agriculture to build industry\". In 1975, Khmer Rouge representatives to China said that Pol Pot's belief was that the collectivisation of agriculture was capable of \"[creating] a complete communist society without wasting time on the intermediate steps\". Society was accordingly classified into peasant \"base people\" ( ), who would be the bulwark of the transformation; and urban \"new people\" ( ), who were to be reeducated or liquidated. The focus of the Khmer Rouge leadership on the peasantry as the base of the revolution was according to Michael Vickery a product of their status as \"petty-bourgeois radicals who had been overcome by peasantist romanticism\". The opposition of the peasantry and the urban population in Khmer Rouge ideology was heightened by the structure of the Cambodian rural economy, where small farmers and peasants had historically suffered from indebtedness to urban money-lenders rather than suffering from indebtedness to landlords. The policy of evacuating major towns, as well as providing a reserve of easily exploitable agricultural labour, was likely viewed positively by the Khmer Rouge's peasant supporters as removing the source of their debts.\nRelationship to religion.\nDemocratic Kampuchea was an atheist state, although its constitution stated that everyone had freedom of religion, or freedom not to practice a religion. However, it specified that what it termed \"reactionary religion\" would not be permitted. While in practice religious activity was not tolerated, the relationship of the CPK to the majority Cambodian Theravada Buddhism was complex; several key figures in its history, such as Tou Samouth and Ta Mok, were former monks, along with many lower level cadres, who often proved to be some of the strictest disciplinarians. While there was extreme harassment of Buddhist institutions, the CPK regime had a tendency to internalise and reconfigure the symbolism and language of Cambodian Buddhism so that many revolutionary slogans mimicked the formulae which were learned by young monks during their training. Some cadres who had previously been monks interpreted their change of vocation as a simple movement from a lower to a higher religion, mirroring attitudes around the growth of Cao Dai in the 1920s.\nBuddhist laity were seemingly not singled out for persecution, but the traditional belief in the tutelary spirits, or the \"neak ta\", rapidly eroded as people were forcibly moved from their home areas. The position with Buddhist monks was more complicated: as with Islam, many religious leaders were killed whereas many ordinary monks were sent to remote monasteries where they were subjected to hard physical labour. The same division between rural and urban populations was seen in the regime's treatment of monks. For instance, those from urban monasteries were classified as \"new monks\" and sent to rural areas to live alongside \"base monks\" of peasant background, who were classified as \"proper and revolutionary\". Monks were not ordered to defrock until as late as 1977 in Krati\u00e9 Province, where many monks found that they reverted to the status of lay peasantry as the agricultural work they were allocated to involved regular breaches of monastic rules. While there is evidence of widespread vandalism of Buddhist monasteries, many more than were initially thought survived the Khmer Rouge years in fair condition, as did most Khmer historical monuments, and it is possible that stories of their near-total destruction were propaganda issued by the successor People's Republic of Kampuchea. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that nearly 25,000 Buddhist monks were killed by the regime.\nThe repression of Islam (practised by the country's Cham minority) was extensive. Islamic religious leaders were executed, but some Cham Muslims were probably told that they could continue to perform their devotions in private as long as it did not interfere with work quotas. Mat Ly, a Cham who served as the deputy minister of agriculture under the People's Republic of Kampuchea, stated that Khmer Rouge troops had perpetrated a number of massacres in Cham villages in the Central and Eastern zones where the residents had refused to give up Islamic customs. While Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud stated that Christians were invariably taken away and killed based on the accusation that they had links to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, however, at least some cadres appear to have regarded it as preferable to the \"feudal\" class-based religion of Buddhism. Nevertheless, it remained deeply suspect to the regime thanks to its close links to French colonialism; Phnom Penh cathedral was razed along with other places of worship.\nInterpretations.\nIn analysing the Khmer Rouge regime, scholars place it within historical context. The Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975 through the Cambodian Civil War, where the United States had supported the opposing regime of Lon Nol and heavily bombed Cambodia, primarily targeting communist Vietnamese troops who were allied to the Khmer Rouge, but it gave the Khmer Rouge's leadership a justification to eliminate the pro-Vietnamese faction within the group. The Cambodian genocide was stopped with the Khmer Rouge's overthrow in 1979 by Communist Vietnam. There have been allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge following their overthrow; in September 1979 the United Nations General Assembly voted to continue recognising Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea. Communism in South East Asia was deeply divided, as China supported the Khmer Rouge, while the Soviet Union and Vietnam opposed it.\nThere are three interpretations of the Khmer Rouge: totalitarianism, revisionism, and postrevisionism. Historian Ben Kiernan describes their rule as totalitarian but places it within the context of \"xenophobic European nationalism\", from which came their agrarianism and the establishment of a Great Cambodia, rather than communism or Marxism. Pol Pot's biographers David P. Chandler and Philip Short place more emphasis on their ideological heritage of communism; it was not easy to apply Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin's ideas to Cambodia, and communism was chosen as a way to get rid of French colonialism and transform the feudal society. Another interpretation, as proposed by historian Michael Vickery, is that of a bottom-up, left-wing peasant revolution with the Khmer Rouge as the revolutionaries. The Khmer Rouge was an intellectual group with a middle-class background and a romanticised sympathy for rural poor people but with little to no awareness that their radical policies would lead to such violence; according to this view, the applicability of genocide is rejected and the violence was an unintentional consequence that was beyond the Khmer Rouge's control. For Vickery, communist ideology does not explain the violence any more than those closer to the peasants', such as agrarianism, populism, and nationalism. Vickery wrote of communisms, as different communist factions were opposed to each other and fought against each other, resulting in further escalation of violence.\nA synthesis of both interpretations rejects the totalitarian theory in favor of a bottom-up perspective, which emphasises that the peasants did not have revolutionary ambitions. According to this perspective, the Khmer Rouge was able to effectively manipulate the peasants to mobilise them towards collective goals that they did not understand, or where the revolutionaries had no desire to create a new society, which would require a certain level of support and understanding that the Khmer Rouge was not able to win over, but were mainly motivated to tear down the old one and violence became an end in itself.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nEarly history.\nThe history of the communist movement in Cambodia can be divided into six phases, namely the emergence before World War II of the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP), whose members were almost exclusively Vietnamese; the 10-year struggle for independence from the French, when a separate Cambodian communist party, the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), was established under Vietnamese auspices; the period following the Second Party Congress of the KPRP in 1960, when Saloth Sar gained control of its apparatus; the revolutionary struggle from the initiation of the Khmer Rouge insurgency in 1967\u20131968 to the fall of the Lon Nol government in April 1975; the Democratic Kampuchea regime from April 1975 to January 1979; and the period following the Third Party Congress of the KPRP in January 1979, when Hanoi effectively assumed control over Cambodia's government and communist party.\nIn 1930, Ho Chi Minh founded the Communist Party of Vietnam by unifying three smaller communist movements that had emerged in northern, central and southern Vietnam during the late 1920s. The party was renamed the Indochinese Communist Party, ostensibly so it could include revolutionaries from Cambodia and Laos. Almost without exception, all of the earliest party members were Vietnamese. By the end of World War II, a handful of Cambodians had joined its ranks, but their influence on the Indochinese communist movement as well as their influence on developments within Cambodia was negligible.\nViet Minh units occasionally made forays into Cambodian bases during their war against the French and in conjunction with the leftist government that ruled Thailand until 1947. The Viet Minh encouraged the formation of armed, left-wing Khmer Issarak bands. On 17 April 1950, the first nationwide congress of the Khmer Issarak groups convened, and the United Issarak Front was established. Its leader was Son Ngoc Minh, and a third of its leadership consisted of members of the ICP. According to the historian David P. Chandler, the leftist Issarak groups aided by the Viet Minh occupied a sixth of Cambodia's territory by 1952, and on the eve of the Geneva Conference in 1954, they controlled as much as one half of the country. In 1951, the ICP was reorganized into three national units, namely the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Lao Issara, and the Kampuchean or Khmer People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP). According to a document issued after the reorganization, the Vietnam Workers' Party would continue to \"supervise\" the smaller Laotian and Cambodian movements. Most KPRP leaders and rank-and-file seem to have been either Khmer Krom or ethnic Vietnamese living in Cambodia.\nAccording to Democratic Kampuchea's perspective of party history, the Viet Minh's failure to negotiate a political role for the KPRP at the 1954 Geneva Conference represented a betrayal of the Cambodian movement, which still controlled large areas of the countryside, and which commanded at least 5,000 armed men. Following the conference, about 1,000 members of the KPRP, including Son Ngoc Minh, made a Long March into North Vietnam, where they remained in exile. In late 1954, those who stayed in Cambodia founded a legal political party, the Pracheachon, which participated in the 1955 and the 1958 National Assembly elections. In the September 1955 election, it won about 4% of the vote but did not secure a seat in the legislature. Members of the Pracheachon were subject to harassment and arrests because the party remained outside Sihanouk's political organization, Sangkum. Government attacks prevented it from participating in the 1962 election and drove it underground. Sihanouk habitually labelled local leftists the Khmer Rouge, a term that later came to signify the party and the state headed by Pol Pot, Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and their associates.\nDuring the mid-1950s, KPRP factions, the \"urban committee\" (headed by Tou Samouth) and the \"rural committee\" (headed by Sieu Heng), emerged. In very general terms, these groups espoused divergent revolutionary lines. The prevalent \"urban\" line endorsed by North Vietnam recognized that Sihanouk by virtue of his success in winning independence from the French was a genuine national leader whose neutralism and deep distrust of the United States made him a valuable asset in Hanoi's struggle to \"liberate\" South Vietnam. Advocates of this line hoped that the prince could be persuaded to distance himself from the right-wing and to adopt leftist policies. The other line, supported for the most part by rural cadres who were familiar with the harsh realities of the countryside, advocated an immediate struggle to overthrow the \"feudalist\" Sihanouk.\nParis student group.\nDuring the 1950s, Khmer students in Paris organized their own communist movement which had little, if any, connection to the hard-pressed party in their homeland. From their ranks came the men and women who returned home and took command of the party apparatus during the 1960s, led an effective insurgency against Lon Nol from 1968 until 1975 and established the regime of Democratic Kampuchea. Pol Pot, who rose to the leadership of the communist movement in the 1960s, attended a technical high school in the capital and then went to Paris in 1949 to study radio electronics (other sources say he attended a school for fax machines and also studied civil engineering). Described by one source as a \"determined, rather plodding organizer\", Pol Pot failed to obtain a degree, but according to Jesuit priest Father Fran\u00e7ois Ponchaud he acquired a taste for the classics of French literature as well as an interest in the writings of Karl Marx.\nAnother member of the Paris student group was Ieng Sary, a Chinese-Khmer from South Vietnam. He attended the elite Lyc\u00e9e Sisowath in Phnom Penh before beginning courses in commerce and politics at the Paris Institute of Political Science (more widely known as Sciences Po) in France. Khieu Samphan specialized in economics and politics during his time in Paris. Hou Yuon studied economics and law, Son Sen studied education and literature, and Hu Nim studied law. Two members of the group, Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon, earned doctorates from the University of Paris while Hu Nim obtained his degree from the University of Phnom Penh in 1965. Most came from landowner or civil servant families. Pol Pot and Hou Yuon may have been related to the royal family as an older sister of Pol Pot had been a concubine at the court of King Monivong. Pol Pot and Ieng Sary married Khieu Ponnary and Khieu Thirith, also known as Ieng Thirith, purportedly relatives of Khieu Samphan. These two well-educated women also played a central role in the regime of Democratic Kampuchea.\nAt some time between 1949 and 1951, Pol Pot and Ieng Sary joined the French Communist Party. In 1951, the two men went to East Berlin to participate in a youth festival. This experience is considered to have been a turning point in their ideological development. Meeting with Khmers who were fighting with the Viet Minh (but subsequently judged them to be too subservient to the Vietnamese), they became convinced that only a tightly disciplined party organization and a readiness for armed struggle could achieve revolution. They transformed the Khmer Students Association (KSA), to which most of the 200 or so Khmer students in Paris belonged, into an organization for nationalist and leftist ideas.\nInside the KSA and its successor organizations, there was a secret organization known as the \"Cercle Marxiste\" (Marxist circle). The organization was composed of cells of three to six members with most members knowing nothing about the overall structure of the organization. In 1952, Pol Pot, Hou Yuon, Ieng Sary and other leftists gained notoriety by sending an open letter to Sihanouk calling him the \"strangler of infant democracy\". A year later, the French authorities closed down the KSA, but Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan helped to establish in 1956 a new group, the Khmer Students Union. Inside, the group was still run by the \"Cercle Marxiste\".\nThe doctoral dissertations which were written by Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan express basic themes that would later become the cornerstones of the policy that was adopted by Democratic Kampuchea. The central role of the peasants in national development was espoused by Hou Yuon in his 1955 thesis, \"The Cambodian Peasants and Their Prospects for Modernization\", which challenged the conventional view that urbanization and industrialization are necessary precursors of development. The major argument in Khieu Samphan's 1959 thesis, \"Cambodia's Economy and Industrial Development\", was that the country had to become self-reliant and end its economic dependency on the developed world. In its general contours, Samphan's work reflected the influence of a branch of the dependency theory school which blamed lack of development in the Third World on the economic domination of the industrialized nations.\nPath to power and reign.\nKPRP Second Congress.\nAfter returning to Cambodia in 1953, Pol Pot threw himself into party work. At first, he went to join with forces allied to the Viet Minh operating in the rural areas of Kampong Cham Province. After the end of the war, he moved to Phnom Penh under Tou Samouth's \"urban committee\", where he became an important point of contact between above-ground parties of the left and the underground secret communist movement.\nHis comrades Ieng Sary and Hou Yuon became teachers at a new private high school, the Lyc\u00e9e Kambuboth, which Hou Yuon helped to establish. Khieu Samphan returned from Paris in 1959, taught as a member of the law faculty of the University of Phnom Penh, and started a left-wing French-language publication, \"L'Observateur\". The paper soon acquired a reputation in Phnom Penh's small academic circle. The following year, the government closed the paper, and Sihanouk's police publicly humiliated Samphan by beating, undressing and photographing him in public; as Shawcross notes, \"not the sort of humiliation that men forgive or forget\". Yet the experience did not prevent Samphan from advocating cooperation with Sihanouk in order to promote a united front against United States activities in South Vietnam. Khieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nim were forced to \"work through the system\" by joining the Sangkum and by accepting posts in the prince's government.\nIn late September 1960, twenty-one leaders of the KPRP held a secret congress in a vacant room of the Phnom Penh railroad station. This pivotal event remains shrouded in mystery because its outcome has become an object of contention and considerable historical rewriting between pro-Vietnamese and anti-Vietnamese Khmer communist factions. The question of cooperation with, or resistance to, Sihanouk was thoroughly discussed. Tou Samouth, who advocated a policy of cooperation, was elected general secretary of the KPRP that was renamed the Workers' Party of Kampuchea (WPK). His ally Nuon Chea, also known as Long Reth, became deputy general secretary, but Pol Pot and Ieng Sary were named to the Political Bureau to occupy the third and the fifth highest positions in the renamed party's hierarchy. The name change is significant. By calling itself a workers' party, the Cambodian movement claimed equal status with the Vietnam Workers' Party. The pro-Vietnamese regime of the People's Republic of Kampuchea implied in the 1980s that the September 1960 meeting was nothing more than the second congress of the KPRP.\nOn 20 July 1962, Tou Samouth was murdered by the Cambodian government. At the WPK's second congress in February 1963, Pol Pot was chosen to succeed Tou Samouth as the party's general secretary. Samouth's allies Nuon Chea and Keo Meas were removed from the Central Committee and replaced by Son Sen and Vorn Vet. From then on, Pol Pot and loyal comrades from his Paris student days controlled the party centre, edging out older veterans whom they considered excessively pro-Vietnamese. In July 1963, Pol Pot and most of the central committee left Phnom Penh to establish an insurgent base in Ratanakiri Province in the northeast. Pol Pot had shortly before been put on a list of 34 leftists who were summoned by Sihanouk to join the government and sign statements saying Sihanouk was the only possible leader for the country. Pol Pot and Chou Chet were the only people on the list who escaped. All the others agreed to cooperate with the government and were afterward under 24-hour watch by the police.\nSihanouk and the GRUNK.\nThe region where Pol Pot and the others moved to was inhabited by tribal minorities, the Khmer Loeu, whose rough treatment (including resettlement and forced assimilation) at the hands of the central government made them willing recruits for a guerrilla struggle. In 1965, Pol Pot made a visit of several months to North Vietnam and China. From the 1950s on, Pol Pot had made frequent visits to the People's Republic of China, receiving political and military training\u2014especially on the theory of dictatorship of the proletariat\u2014from the personnel of the CCP. From November 1965 to February 1966, Pol Pot received training from high-ranking CCP officials such as Chen Boda and Zhang Chunqiao, on topics such as the communist revolution in China, class conflicts, and Communist International. Pol Pot was particularly impressed by the lecture on political purge by Kang Sheng. This experience had enhanced his prestige when he returned to the WPK's \"liberated areas\". Despite friendly relations between Sihanouk and the Chinese, the latter kept Pol Pot's visit a secret from Sihanouk.\nIn September 1966, the WPK changed its name to the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK). The change in the name of the party was a closely guarded secret. Lower ranking members of the party and even the Vietnamese were not told of it and neither was the membership until many years later. The party leadership endorsed armed struggle against the government, then led by Sihanouk. In 1968, the Khmer Rouge was officially formed, and its forces launched a national insurgency across Cambodia. Though North Vietnam had not been informed of the decision, its forces provided shelter and weapons to the Khmer Rouge after the insurgency started. Vietnamese support for the insurgency made it impossible for the Cambodian military to effectively counter it. For the next two years, the insurgency grew as Sihanouk did very little to stop it. As the insurgency grew stronger, the party finally openly declared itself to be the Communist Party of Kampuchea.\nThe political appeal of the Khmer Rouge was increased as a result of the situation created by the removal of Sihanouk as head of state in 1970. Premier Lon Nol deposed Sihanouk with the support of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, who was in exile in Beijing, made an alliance with the Khmer Rouge on the advice of CCP, and became the nominal head of a Khmer Rouge\u2013dominated government-in-exile (known by its French acronym GRUNK) backed by China. In 1970 alone, the Chinese reportedly gave 400 tons of military aid to the United Front. Although thoroughly aware of the weakness of Lon Nol's forces and loath to commit American military force to the new conflict in any form other than air power, the Nixon administration supported the newly proclaimed Khmer Republic.\nOn 29 March 1970, the North Vietnamese launched an offensive against the Cambodian army. Documents uncovered from the Soviet Union archives revealed that the invasion was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea. A force of North Vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia reaching to within of Phnom Penh before being pushed back. By June, three months after the removal of Sihanouk, they had swept government forces from the entire northeastern third of the country. After defeating those forces, the North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the local insurgents. The Khmer Rouge also established \"liberated\" areas in the south and the southwestern parts of the country, where they operated independently of the North Vietnamese.\nAfter Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters. Many of the new recruits for the Khmer Rouge were apolitical peasants who fought in support of the king, not for communism, of which they had little understanding. Sihanouk's popular support in rural Cambodia allowed the Khmer Rouge to extend its power and influence to the point that by 1973 it exercised \"de facto\" control over the majority of Cambodian territory, although only a minority of its population. By 1975, with the Lon Nol government running out of ammunition, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the government would collapse. On 17 April 1975, there was the Fall of Phnom Penh, as the Khmer Rouge captured the capital.\nDuring the civil war, unparalleled atrocities were executed on both sides. While the civil war was brutal, its estimated death toll has been revised downwards over time.\nForeign involvement.\nBefore 1975.\nThe relationship between the massive carpet bombing of Cambodia by the United States and the growth of the Khmer Rouge, in terms of recruitment and popular support, has been a matter of interest to historians. Some scholars, including Michael Ignatieff, Adam Jones and Greg Grandin, have cited the United States intervention and bombing campaign (spanning 1965\u20131973) as a significant factor which led to increased support for the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry.\nAccording to Ben Kiernan, the Khmer Rouge \"would not have won power without U.S. economic and military destabilization of Cambodia... It used the bombing's devastation and massacre of civilians as recruitment propaganda and as an excuse for its brutal, radical policies and its purge of moderate communists and Sihanoukists.\" Pol Pot biographer David P. Chandler writes that the bombing \"had the effect the Americans wanted \u2013 it broke the Communist encirclement of Phnom Penh\", but it also accelerated the collapse of rural society and increased social polarization. Peter Rodman and Michael Lind claim that the United States intervention saved the Lon Nol regime from collapse in 1970 and 1973. Craig Etcheson acknowledged that U.S. intervention increased recruitment for the Khmer Rouge but disputed that it was a primary cause of the Khmer Rouge victory. William Shawcross writes that the United States bombing and ground incursion plunged Cambodia into the chaos that Sihanouk had worked for years to avoid.\nBy 1973, Vietnamese support of the Khmer Rouge had largely disappeared. On the other hand, the CCP largely \"armed and trained\" the Khmer Rouge, including Pol Pot, both during the Cambodian Civil War and the years afterward. In 1970 alone, the Chinese reportedly gave 400 tons of military aid to the National United Front of Kampuchea formed by Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge.\n1975\u20131992.\nIn April 1975, the Khmer Rouge seized power in Cambodia, and in January 1976, Democratic Kampuchea was established. During the Cambodian genocide, the CCP was the main international patron of the Khmer Rouge, supplying \"more than 15,000 military advisers\" and most of its external aid. It is estimated that at least 90% of the foreign aid to Khmer Rouge came from China, with 1975 alone seeing US$1 billion in interest-free economic and military aid and US$20\u00a0million gift, which was \"the biggest aid ever given to any one country by China\". In June 1975, Pol Pot and other officials of Khmer Rouge met with Mao Zedong in Beijing, receiving Mao's approval and advice; in addition, Mao also taught Pot his \"Theory of Continuing Revolution under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat\" (). High-ranking CCP officials such as Zhang Chunqiao later visited Cambodia to offer help.\nDemocratic Kampuchea was overthrown by the Vietnamese army in January 1979, and the Khmer Rouge fled to Thailand. However, to counter the power of the Soviet Union and Vietnam, a group of countries\u2014including China, the United States, Thailand, and some other Western nations\u2014supported the Khmer Rouge\u2013dominated Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea in retaining Cambodia's seat in the United Nations, which it held until 1993, after the Cold War had ended. In 2009, China defended its past ties with previous Cambodian governments, including that of Democratic Kampuchea or Khmer Rouge, which at the time had a legal seat at the United Nations and foreign relations with more than 70 countries.\nRegime.\nLeadership.\nThe governing structure of Democratic Kampuchea was split between the state presidium headed by Khieu Samphan, the cabinet headed by Pol Pot (who was also Democratic Kampuchea's prime minister) and the party's own Politburo and Central Committee. All were complicated by a number of political factions which existed in 1975. The leadership of the Party Centre, the faction which was headed by Pol Pot, remained largely unchanged from the early 1960s to the mid-1990s. Its leaders were mostly from middle-class families and had been educated at French universities. The second significant faction was made up of men who had been active in the pre-1960 party and had stronger links to Vietnam as a result; government documents show that there were several major shifts in power between factions during the period in which the regime was in control.\nIn 1975\u20131976, there were several powerful regional Khmer Rouge leaders who maintained their own armies and had different party backgrounds than the members of the Pol Pot clique, particularly So Phim and Nhim Ros, both of whom were vice presidents of the state presidium and members of the Politburo and Central Committee respectively. A possible military coup attempt was made in May 1976, and its leader was a senior Eastern Zone cadre named Chan Chakrey, who had been appointed deputy secretary of the army's General Staff. A reorganisation that occurred in September 1976, during which Pol Pot was demoted in the state presidium, was later presented as an attempted pro-Vietnamese coup by the Party Centre. Over the next two years, So Phim, Nhim Ros, Vorn Vet and many other figures who had been associated with the pre-1960 party were arrested and executed. Phim's execution was followed by that of the majority of the cadres and much of the population of the Eastern Zone that he had controlled. The Party Centre, lacking much in the way of their own military resources, accomplished their seizure of power by forming an alliance with Southwestern Zone leader Ta Mok and Pok, head of the North Zone's troops. Both men were of a purely peasant background and were therefore natural allies of the strongly peasant ideology of the Pol Pot faction.\nThe Standing Committee of the Khmer Rouge's Central Committee during its period of power consisted of the following:\nLife under the Khmer Rouge.\nThe Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from all foreign influences, closing schools, hospitals and some factories, abolishing banking, finance and currency, and collectivising agriculture. Khmer Rouge theorists, who developed the ideas of Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, believed that an initial period of self-imposed economic isolation and national self-sufficiency would stimulate the rebirth of the crafts as well as the rebirth of the country's latent industrial capability.\nEvacuation of the cities.\nIn Phnom Penh and other cities, the Khmer Rouge told residents that they would be moved only about \"two or three kilometers\" away from the city and would return in \"two or three days\". Some witnesses said they were told that the evacuation was because of the \"threat of American bombing\" and they were also told that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would \"take care of everything\" until they returned. If people refused to evacuate, they would immediately be killed and their homes would be burned to the ground. The evacuees were sent on long marches to the countryside, which killed thousands of children, elderly people and sick people. These were not the first evacuations of civilian populations by the Khmer Rouge; similar evacuations of populations without possessions had been occurring on a smaller scale since the early 1970s.\nOn arrival at the villages to which they had been assigned, evacuees were required to write brief autobiographical essays. The essay's content, particularly with regard to the subject's activity during the Khmer Republic regime, was used to determine their fate. Military officers and those occupying elite professional roles were usually sent for reeducation, which in practice meant immediate execution or confinement in a labour camp. Those with specialist technical skills often found themselves sent back to cities to restart production in factories which had been interrupted by the takeover. The remaining displaced urban population (\"new people\"), as part of the regime's drive to increase food production, were placed into agricultural communes alongside the peasant \"base people\" or \"old people\". The latter's holdings were collectivised. Cambodians were expected to produce three tons of rice per hectare, whereas before the Khmer Rouge era the average was one ton per hectare.\nThe lack of agricultural knowledge on the part of the former city dwellers made famine inevitable. The rural peasantry were often unsympathetic, or they were too frightened to assist them. Such acts as picking wild fruit or berries were seen as \"private enterprise\" and punished with death. Labourers were forced to work long shifts without adequate rest or food, resulting in many deaths through exhaustion, illness and starvation. Workers were executed for attempting to escape from the communes, for breaching minor rules, or after being denounced by colleagues. If caught, offenders were taken off to a distant forest or field after sunset and killed. Unwilling to import Western medicines, the regime turned to traditional medicine instead and placed medical care in the hands of cadres who were only given rudimentary training. The famine, forced labour and lack of access to appropriate services led to a high number of deaths.\nEconomic policies.\nKhmer Rouge economic policies took a similarly extreme course. Officially, trade was restricted to bartering between communes, a policy which the regime developed in order to enforce self-reliance. Banks were raided, and all currency and records were destroyed by fire, thus eliminating any claim to funds. After 1976, the regime reinstated discussion of export in the period after the disastrous effects of its planning began to become apparent. Commercial fishing was banned in 1976.\nFamily relations.\nThe regulations made by the Angkar (\u17a2\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u1780\u17b6\u179a, The Organisation, which was the ruling body) also had effects on the traditional Cambodian family unit. The regime was primarily interested in increasing the young population and one of the strictest regulations prohibited sex outside marriage which was punishable by execution. The Khmer Rouge followed a morality based on an idealised conception of the attitudes of prewar rural Cambodia. Marriage required permission from the authorities, and the Khmer Rouge were strict, giving permission to marry only to people of the same class and level of education. Such rules were applied even more strictly to party cadres. While some refugees spoke of families being deliberately broken up, this appears to have referred mainly to the traditional Cambodian extended family unit, which the regime actively sought to destroy in favour of small nuclear units of parents and children.\nThe regime promoted arranged marriages, particularly between party cadres. While some academics such as Michael Vickery have noted that arranged marriages were also a feature of rural Cambodia prior to 1975, those conducted by the Khmer Rouge regime often involved people unfamiliar to each other. As well as reflecting the Khmer Rouge obsession with production and reproduction, such marriages were designed to increase people's dependency on the regime by undermining existing family and other loyalties.\nEducation.\nIt is often concluded that the Khmer Rouge regime promoted functional illiteracy. This statement is not completely incorrect, but it is quite inaccurate. The Khmer Rouge wanted to \"eliminate all traces of Cambodia's imperialist past\", and its previous culture was one of them. The Khmer Rouge did not want the Cambodian people to be completely ignorant, and primary education was provided to them. Nevertheless, the Khmer Rouge's policies dramatically reduced the Cambodian population's cultural inflow as well as its knowledge and creativity. The Khmer Rouge's goal was to gain full control of all of the information that the Cambodian people received and spread revolutionary culture among the masses.\nEducation came to a \"virtual standstill\" in Democratic Kampuchea. Irrespective of central policies, most local cadres considered higher education useless and as a result, they were suspicious of those who had received it. The regime abolished all literary schooling above primary grades, ostensibly focusing on basic literacy instead. In practice, primary schools were not set up in many areas because of the extreme disruptions which had been caused by the regime's takeover, and most ordinary people, especially \"new people\", felt that their children were taught nothing worthwhile in those schools which still existed. The exception was the Eastern Zone, which until 1976 was run by cadres who were closely connected with Vietnam rather than the Party Centre, where a more organised system seems to have existed under which children were given extra rations, taught by teachers who were drawn from the \"base people\" and given a limited number of official textbooks.\nBeyond primary education, technical courses were taught in factories to students who were drawn from the favoured \"base people\". There was a general reluctance to increase people's education in Democratic Kampuchea, and in some districts, cadres were known to kill people who boasted about their educational accomplishments, and it was considered bad form for people to allude to any special technical training. Based on a speech which Pol Pot made in 1978, it appears that he may have ultimately envisaged that illiterate students with approved poor peasant backgrounds could become trained engineers within ten years by doing a lot of targeted studying along with a lot of practical work.\nLanguage reforms.\nThe Khmer language has a complex system of usages to define speakers' rank and social status. During the rule of the Khmer Rouge, these usages were abolished. People were encouraged to call each other \"friend\" (\u1798\u17b7\u178f\u17d2\u178f; \"mitt\") and to avoid traditional signs of deference such as bowing or folding the hands in salutation, known as sampeah. Language was also transformed in other ways. The Khmer Rouge invented new terms. In keeping with the regime's theories on Khmer identity, the majority of new words were coined with reference to Pali or Sanskrit terms, while Chinese and Vietnamese\u2013language borrowings were discouraged. People were told to \"forge\" (\u179b\u178f\u17cb\u178a\u17c6; \"lot dam\") a new revolutionary character, that they were the \"instruments\" (\u17a7\u1794\u1780\u179a\u178e\u17cd; \"opokar\") of the ruling body known as Angkar (\u17a2\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u1780\u17b6\u179a, The Organisation) and that nostalgia for pre-revolutionary times (\u1788\u17ba\u179f\u178f\u17b7\u17a2\u17b6\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1798\u178e\u17cd; \"chheu satek arom\", or \"memory sickness\") could result in execution.\nCrimes against humanity.\nActing through the Santebal, the Khmer Rouge arrested, tortured and eventually executed anyone who was suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed enemies:\nThe Santebal established over 150 prisons for political opponents; Tuol Sleng is a former high school that was turned into the Santebal headquarters and interrogation center for the highest-value political prisoners. Tuol Sleng was operated by the Santebal commander Khang Khek Ieu, more commonly known as Comrade Duch, together with his subordinates Mam Nai and Tang Sin Hean. According to Ben Kiernan, \"all but seven of the twenty thousand Tuol Sleng prisoners\" were executed. The buildings of Tuol Sleng have been preserved as they were left when the Khmer Rouge were driven out in 1979. Several of the rooms are now lined with thousands of black-and-white photographs of prisoners that were taken by the Khmer Rouge.\nOn 7 August 2014, when sentencing two former Khmer Rouge leaders to life imprisonment, Cambodian judge Nil Nonn said there was evidence of \"a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Cambodia\". He said the leaders, Nuon Chea, the regime's chief ideologue and former deputy to late leader Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan, the former head of state, together in a \"joint criminal enterprise\" were involved in murder, extermination, political persecution and other inhumane acts related to the mass eviction of city-dwellers, and executions of enemy soldiers. In November 2018, the trial convicted Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan of crimes against humanity and genocide against the Vietnamese, while Nuon Chea was also found guilty of genocide relating to the Chams.\nNumber of deaths.\nAccording to a 2001 academic source, the most widely accepted estimates of excess deaths under the Khmer Rouge range from 1.5\u00a0million to 2\u00a0million, although figures as low as 1\u00a0million and as high as 3\u00a0million have been cited; conventionally accepted estimates of executions range from 500,000 to 1\u00a0million, \"a third to one half of excess mortality during the period\". A 2013 academic source (citing research from 2009) indicates that execution may have accounted for as much as 60% of the total, with 23,745 mass graves containing approximately 1.3\u00a0million suspected victims of execution.\nHistorian Ben Kiernan estimates that 1.671\u00a0million to 1.871\u00a0million Cambodians died as a result of Khmer Rouge policy, or between 21% and 24% of Cambodia's 1975 population. A study by Polish demographer Marek Sliwinski calculated nearly 2\u00a0million unnatural deaths under the Khmer Rouge out of a 1975 Cambodian population of 7.8\u00a0million; 33.5% of Cambodian men died under the Khmer Rouge compared to 15.7% of Cambodian women. Researcher Craig Etcheson of the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) suggests that the death toll was between 2\u00a0million and 2.5\u00a0million, with a \"most likely\" figure of 2.2\u00a0million. After five years of researching mass grave sites, he estimated that they contained 1.38\u00a0million suspected victims of execution. Although considerably higher than earlier and more widely accepted estimates of Khmer Rouge executions, Etcheson argues that these numbers are plausible, given the nature of the mass grave and DC-Cam's methods, which are more likely to produce an under-count of bodies rather than an over-estimate. Demographer Patrick Heuveline estimated that between 1.17\u00a0million and 3.42\u00a0million Cambodians died unnatural deaths between 1970 and 1979, with between 150,000 and 300,000 of those deaths occurring during the civil war. Heuveline's central estimate is 2.52\u00a0million excess deaths, of which 1.4\u00a0million were the direct result of violence.\nDespite being based on a house-to-house survey of Cambodians, the estimate of 3.3\u00a0million deaths promulgated by the Khmer Rouge's successor regime, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), is generally considered to be an exaggeration; among other methodological errors, the PRK authorities added the estimated number of victims that had been found in the partially exhumed mass graves to the raw survey results, meaning that some victims would have been double-counted. An additional 300,000 Cambodians starved to death between 1979 and 1980, largely as a result of the after-effects of Khmer Rouge policy.\nGenocide.\nWhile the period from 1975 to 1979 is commonly associated with the phrase \"the Cambodian genocide\", scholars debate whether the legal definition of the crime can be applied generally. While two former leaders were convicted of genocide, this was for treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, the Vietnamese and Cham. The death toll of these two groups, approximately 100,000 people, is roughly 5% of the generally accepted total of two million. The treatment of these groups can be seen to fall under the legal definition of genocide, as they were targeted on the basis of their religion or ethnicity. The vast majority of deaths were of the Khmer ethnic group, which was not a target of the Khmer Rouge. The deaths occurring as a result of targeting these Khmer, whether it was the \"new people\" or enemies of the regime, was based on political distinctions rather than ethnic or religious. In an interview conducted in 2018, historian David P. Chandler states that crimes against humanity was the term that best fit the atrocities of the regime and that some attempts to characterise the majority of the killings as genocide was flawed and at times politicised.\nInternal power struggles and purges.\nHou Yuon was one of the first senior leaders to be purged. The Khmer Rouge originally reported that he had been killed in the final battles for Phnom Penh, but he was apparently executed in late 1975 or early 1976. In late 1975, numerous Cambodian intellectuals, professionals and students returned from overseas to support the revolution. These returnees were treated with suspicion and made to undergo reeducation, while some were sent straight to Tuol Sleng. In 1976, the center announced the start of the socialist revolution and ordered the elimination of class enemies. This resulted in the expulsion and execution of numerous people within the party and army who were deemed to be of the wrong class. In mid-1976, Ieng Thirith, minister of social affairs, inspected the northwestern zone. On her return to Phnom Penh, she reported that the zone's cadres were deliberately disobeying orders from the center, blaming enemy agents who were trying to undermine the revolution. During 1976, troops formerly from the eastern zone demanded the right to marry without the party's approval. They were arrested and under interrogation implicated their commander who then implicated eastern zone cadres who were arrested and executed.\nIn September 1976, Keo Meas, who had been tasked with writing a history of the party, was arrested as a result of disputes over the foundation date of the party and its reliance on Vietnamese support. Under torture at Tuol Sleng, he confessed that the date chosen was part of a plot to undermine the party's legitimacy and was then executed. In late 1976, with the Kampuchean economy underperforming, Pol Pot ordered a purge of the ministry of commerce, and Khoy Thoun and his subordinates who he had brought from the northern zone were arrested and tortured before being executed at Tuol Sleng. Khoy Thoun confessed to having been recruited by the CIA in 1958. The center also ordered troops from the eastern and central zones to purge the northern zone, killing or arresting numerous cadres.\nAt the end of 1976, following disappointing rice harvests in the northwestern zone, the party center ordered a purge of the zone. Troops from the western and southwestern zones were ordered into the northwestern zone. Over the next year, troops killed at least 40 senior cadre and numerous lower ranking leaders.\nThe chaos caused by this purge allowed many Khmers to escape the zone and try to seek refuge in Thailand, but was met with gunfire by the Thai army, who then raped the Khmer women and children while they were hiding near the border with their families. The United Nations Border Relief Operation (UNBRO), formed on 1 January 1982, coordinated humanitarian assistance to Cambodian displaced persons along the Thai\u2013Cambodian border.\nIn 1977, the center began purging the returnees, sending 148 to Tuol Sleng and continuing a purge of the ministry of foreign affairs where many returnees and intellectuals were suspected of spying for foreign powers. In January, the center ordered eastern and southeastern zone troops to conduct cross-border raids into Vietnam. In March 1977, the center ordered So Phim, the eastern zone commander, to send his troops to the border; however, with class warfare purges underway in the eastern zone, many units staged a mutiny and fled into Vietnam. Among the troops defecting in this period was Hun Sen. On 10 April 1977 Hu Nim and his wife were arrested. After three months of interrogation at Tuol Sleng, he confessed to working with the CIA to undermine the revolution following which he and his wife were executed. In July 1977, Pol Pot and Duch sent So Phim a list of \"traitors\" in the eastern zone, many of whom were So Phim's trusted subordinates. So Phim disputed the list and refused to execute those listed, for the center this implicated So Phim as a traitor. In October 1977, in order to secure the Thai border while focusing on confrontation with Vietnam, Nhim Ros, the northwestern zone leader, was blamed for clashes on the Thai border, acting on behalf of both the Vietnamese and the CIA.\nIn December 1977, the Vietnamese launched a punitive attack into eastern Cambodia, quickly routing the eastern zone troops including Heng Samrin's Division 4 and further convincing Pol Pot of So Phim's treachery. Son Sen was sent to the eastern zone with center zone troops to aid the defense. In January 1978, following the Vietnamese withdrawal, a purge of the eastern zone began. In March, So Phim called a secret meeting of his closest subordinates advising them that those who had been purged were not traitors and warning them to be wary. During the next month more than 400 eastern zone cadres were sent to Tuol Sleng while two eastern zone division commanders were replaced. During May eastern zone military leaders were called to meetings where they were arrested or killed. So Phim was called to a meeting by Son Sen but refused to attend, instead sending four messengers who failed to return. On 25 May, Son Sen sent two brigades of troops to attack the eastern zone and capture So Phim. Unable to believe he was being purged, So Phim went into hiding and attempted to contact Pol Pot by radio. A meeting was arranged, but instead of Pol Pot, a group of center soldiers arrived, and So Phim committed suicide and the soldiers then killed his family.\nMany of the surviving eastern zone leaders fled into the forests where they hid from and fought center zone troops. In October 1978, Chea Sim led a group of 300 people across the border into Vietnam, and the Vietnamese then launched a raid into the eastern zone that allowed Heng Samrin and his group of 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers and followers to seek refuge in Vietnam. Meanwhile, the center decided that the entire eastern zone was full of traitors and embarked on a large scale purge of the area, with over 10,000 killed by July 1978, while thousands were evacuated to other zones to prevent them from defecting to the Vietnamese. The center also stepped up purges nationwide, killing cadres and their families, \"old people\" and eastern zone evacuees who were regarded as having dubious loyalty.\nIn September 1978, a purge of the ministry of industry was begun, and in November Pol Pot ordered the arrest of Vorn Vet, the deputy premier for the economy, followed by his supporters. Vorn Vet had previously served as the secretary of the zone around Phnom Penh, had established the Santebal and been Duch's immediate superior. Under torture, Vorn Vet admitted to being an agent of the CIA and the Vietnamese. Unable to reach the borders, ministry of industry personnel who could escape the purge went into hiding in Phnom Penh.\nFall.\nWar with Vietnam.\nFearing that Vietnam would attack Cambodia, Pol Pot ordered a pre-emptive invasion of Vietnam on 18 April 1978. His Khmer Rouge forces crossed the border and looted nearby villages, mostly in the border town of Ba Ch\u00fac. Of the 3,157 civilians who had lived in Ba Ch\u00fac, only two survived the massacre. These Khmer Rouge forces were repelled by the Vietnamese.\nAfter several years of border conflict and after a flood of refugees fled from Kampuchea, relations between Kampuchea and Vietnam collapsed by December 1978. On 25 December 1978, the Vietnamese armed forces along with the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation, an organization founded by Heng Samrin that included many dissatisfied former Khmer Rouge members, invaded Cambodia and captured Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979. Despite a traditional Cambodian fear of Vietnamese domination, defecting Khmer Rouge activists assisted the Vietnamese, and with Vietnam's approval, they became the core of the new People's Republic of Kampuchea. The new government was quickly dismissed as a \"puppet government\" by the Khmer Rouge and China.\nAt the same time, the Khmer Rouge retreated west and it continued to control certain areas near the Thai border for the next decade. These included Phnom Malai, the mountainous areas near Pailin in the Cardamom Mountains and Anlong Veng in the D\u00e2ngr\u00eak Mountains. These Khmer Rouge bases were not self-sufficient and were funded by diamond and timber smuggling, military assistance from China channeled by means of the Thai military, and food smuggled from markets across the border in Thailand.\nPlace in the United Nations.\nDespite its deposal, the Khmer Rouge retained its United Nations seat, which was occupied by Thiounn Prasith, an old companion of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary from their student days in Paris and one of the 21 attendees at the 1960 KPRP Second Congress. The seat was retained under the name Democratic Kampuchea until 1982 and then it was retained under the name Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. Western governments voted in favor of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea retaining Cambodia's seat in the organization over the newly installed Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea, even though it included the Khmer Rouge. In 1988, Margaret Thatcher stated: \"So, you'll find that the more reasonable ones of the Khmer Rouge will have to play some part in the future government, but only a minority part. I share your utter horror that these terrible things went on in Kampuchea\". On the contrary, Sweden changed its vote in the United Nations and it withdrew its support for the Khmer Rouge after many Swedish citizens wrote letters to their elected representatives in which they demanded a policy change towards Pol Pot's regime.\nThe origin of the international proxy war between the US and the Soviet Union dates back to the origin of the Cambodian Civil War. The Kingdom of Cambodia was supported by the United States, the Khmer Republic (that eventually took over after the removal of Prince Sihanouk) and South Vietnam. The other side, the National United Front of Kampuchea, was supported by the Khmer Rouge, North Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union. Cambodia became an instrument for the superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. The measures that the US employed in Cambodia were seen as preventative acts which were supposed to stop the communists. These preventative acts included the deployment of military troops and the establishment of other institutions like the UNTAC.\nInsurgency and surrender.\nVietnam's victory was supported by the Soviet Union and had significant ramifications for the region. The People's Republic of China launched a punitive invasion of northern Vietnam but then retreated, with both sides claiming victory. China, the United States and the ASEAN countries sponsored the creation and the military operations of a Cambodian government in exile, known as the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, which included the Khmer Rouge, the republican Khmer People's National Liberation Front and the royalist Funcinpec Party.\nEastern and central Cambodia were firmly under the control of Vietnam and its Cambodian allies by 1980, while the western part of the country continued to be a battlefield throughout the 1980s, and millions of land mines were sown across the countryside. The Khmer Rouge, still led by Pol Pot, was the strongest of the three rebel groups in the Coalition Government, which received extensive military aid from China, Britain and the United States and intelligence from the Thai military. Great Britain and the United States in particular gave aid to the two non-Khmer Rouge members of the coalition.\nIn an attempt to broaden its support base, the Khmer Rouge formed the Patriotic and Democratic Front of the Great National Union of Kampuchea in 1979. In 1981, the Khmer Rouge went so far as to officially renounce communism and somewhat moved their ideological emphasis to nationalism and anti-Vietnamese rhetoric instead. Some analysts argue that this change meant little in practice because according to historian Kelvin Rowley, the \"CPK propaganda had always relied on nationalist rather than revolutionary appeals\". With the need for broader unity against Vietnam, a unity that an explicit communist line would hamper, in December 1981, the Khmer Rouge established the Party of Democratic Kampuchea to replace the CPK and officially abandoned Marxism-Leninism to choose democratic socialism. \nPol Pot relinquished the Khmer Rouge leadership to Khieu Samphan in 1985; however, he continued to be the driving force behind the Khmer Rouge insurgency, giving speeches to his followers. Journalist Nate Thayer, who spent some time with the Khmer Rouge during that period, commented that despite the international community's near-universal condemnation of the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule, a considerable number of Cambodians in Khmer Rouge\u2013controlled areas seemed genuinely to support Pol Pot. While Vietnam proposed to withdraw from Cambodia in return for a political settlement that would exclude the Khmer Rouge from power, the rebel coalition government as well as ASEAN, China and the United States, insisted that such a condition was unacceptable. Nevertheless, Vietnam declared in 1985 that it would complete the withdrawal of its forces from Cambodia by 1990 and it did so in September 1989, having allowed the Cambodian People's Party government that it had installed there to consolidate its rule and gain sufficient military strength.\nAfter a decade of inconclusive conflict, the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government and the rebel coalition signed a treaty in 1991 calling for elections and disarmament. However, the Khmer Rouge resumed fighting in 1992, boycotted the election and in the following year rejected its results. It began fighting the Cambodian coalition government which included the former Vietnamese-backed communists (headed by Hun Sen) as well as the Khmer Rouge's former non-communist and monarchist allies (notably Prince Rannaridh). In 1993, after a transition period and free elections, the Kingdom of Cambodia was restored, replacing the communist regime; however, the Khmer Rouge rebels opposed the new regime and established its own government in 1994.\nIeng Sary led a mass defection from the Khmer Rouge in 1996, with half of its remaining soldiers (about 4,000) switching to the government side and Ieng Sary becoming leader of Pailin Province. A conflict between the two main participants in the ruling coalition caused in 1997 Prince Rannaridh to seek support from some of the Khmer Rouge leaders while refusing to have any dealings with Pol Pot. This resulted in bloody factional fighting among the Khmer Rouge leaders, ultimately leading to Pol Pot's trial and imprisonment by the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot died in April 1998. Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea surrendered in December 1998. On 29 December 1998, leaders of the Khmer Rouge apologised for the 1970s genocide. By 1998, the Khmer Rouge was almost wiped out and it dissolved its government. Its last guerrillas surrendered to the Cambodian government on 9 February 1999, ending the remnants of communism in Cambodia. As a result, the government incorporated the last remnants of the Khmer Rouge into Cambodian army on 12 February.\nLegacy.\nCambodia has been described as the black sheep of Southeast Asia because extremism is condoned in a country which is characterized by very weak economic growth and extensive poverty. Both demographically and economically, Cambodia has gradually recovered from the rule of the Khmer Rouge regime, but the psychological scars affect many Cambodian families and they also affect many \u00e9migr\u00e9 Cambodian communities. It is noteworthy that Cambodia has a very young population, and by 2003, three-quarters of Cambodians were too young to remember the Khmer Rouge era. Nonetheless, their generation is affected by the traumas of the past. Members of this younger generation may know about the Khmer Rouge only through word of mouth from their parents and elders. In part, young Cambodians lack knowledge about the Khmer Rouge because the Cambodian government does not require educators to teach Cambodian children about the Khmer Rouge's atrocities in Cambodian schools; however, Cambodia's Education Ministry started to teach Khmer Rouge history in high schools beginning in 2009.\nExtraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.\nThe Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), also known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, was established as a Cambodian court with international participation and assistance to bring to trial senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge regime. As of 2020, there are three open cases. ECCC's efforts for outreach toward both national and international audience include public trial hearings, study tours, video screenings, school lectures and video archives on the web site.\nAfter claiming to feel great remorse for his part in Khmer Rouge atrocities, Kang Kek Iew\u2014the head of Security Prison 21, where 16,000 men, women and children were sent to their deaths\u2014surprised the court in his trial on 27 November 2009 with a plea for his freedom. His Cambodian lawyer, Kar Savuth, stunned the tribunal further by issuing the trial's first call for an acquittal of his client even after his French lawyer denied seeking such a verdict. On 26 July 2010, he was convicted and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment. Theary Seng responded: \"We hoped this tribunal would strike hard at impunity, but if you can kill 14,000 people and serve only 19 years\u00a0\u2013 11 hours per life taken\u00a0\u2013 what is that? It's a joke\", voicing concerns about political interference. In February 2012, Duch's sentence was increased to life imprisonment following appeals by both the prosecution and defence. In dismissing the defence's appeal, Judge Kong Srim stated that Duch's crimes were \"undoubtedly among the worst in recorded human history\" and deserved \"the highest penalty available\".\nFrom 2007 to 2022, public trial hearings in Phnom Penh were open to all adults including foreigners. The court provided free bus transportation for groups of Cambodians who wanted to visit the court. Since the commencement of the Case 001 trial in 2009 through the end of 2011, 53,287 people participated in the public hearings. The ECCC also has hosted a study tour program to help villagers in rural areas understand the history of the Khmer Rouge regime. The court has provided free transport for them to come to visit the court and meet with court officials to learn about its work, in addition to visits to the genocide museum and the killing fields. ECCC also has visited villages to provide video screenings and school lectures to promote their understanding of the trial proceedings. Furthermore, trials and transcripts are partially available with English translation on the ECCC's website.\nMuseums.\nThe Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum is a former secondary school building, which was transformed into a torture, interrogation and execution center between 1976 and 1979. The Khmer Rouge called the Security Prison 21. Of the estimated 15,000 to 30,000 prisoners, only seven prisoners survived. The Khmer Rouge photographed the vast majority of the inmates and left a photographic archive, which enables visitors to see almost 6,000 S-21 portraits on the walls. Visitors can also learn how the inmates were tortured from the equipment and facilities exhibited in the buildings.\nThe Choeung Ek Killing Fields are located about 15 kilometers outside of Phnom Penh. Most of the prisoners who were held captive at S-21 were taken to the fields to be executed and deposited in one of the approximately 129 mass graves. It is estimated that the graves contain the remains of over 20,000 victims. After the discovery of the site in 1979, the Vietnamese transformed the site into a memorial and stored skulls and bones in an open-walled wooden memorial pavilion. Eventually, these remains were showcased in the memorial's centerpiece Buddhist stupa. \nIn 2025, three sites associated with the Khmer Rouge's atrocities (the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, Choeung Ek, and M-13 prison in Kampong Chhnang province) were designated as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO as part of the Cambodian Memorial Sites.\nPublications.\nThe Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam), an independent research institute, published \"A History of Democratic Kampuchea (1975\u20131979)\", the nation's first textbook on the history of the Khmer Rouge. The 74-page textbook was approved by the government as a supplementary text in 2007. The textbook is aiming at standardising and improving the information students receive about the Khmer Rouge years because the government-issued social studies textbook devotes eight or nine pages to the period. The publication was a part of their genocide education project that includes leading the design of a national genocide studies curriculum with the Ministry of Education, training thousands of teachers and 1,700 high schools on how to teach about genocide and working with universities across Cambodia.\nYouth for Peace, a Cambodian non-governmental organization (NGO) that offers education in peace, leadership, conflict resolution and reconciliation to Cambodia's youth, published a book titled \"Behind the Darkness: Taking Responsibility or Acting Under Orders?\" in 2011. The book is unique in that instead of focusing on the victims as most books do, it collects the stories of former Khmer Rouge, giving insights into the functioning of the regime and approaching the question of how such a regime could take place.\nDialogues.\nWhile the tribunal contributes to the memorialization process at national level, some civil society groups promote memorialization at community level. The International Center for Conciliation (ICfC) began working in Cambodia in 2004 as a branch of the ICfC in Boston. ICfC launched the Justice and History Outreach project in 2007 and has worked in villages in rural Cambodia with the goal of creating mutual understanding and empathy between victims and former members of the Khmer Rouge. Following the dialogues, villagers identify their own ways of memorialization such as collecting stories to be transmitted to the younger generations or building a memorial. Through the process, some villagers are beginning to accept the possibility of an alternative viewpoint to the traditional notions of evil associated with anyone who worked for the Khmer Rouge regime.\nMedia coverage.\nRadio National Kampuchea as well as private radio stations broadcast programmes on the Khmer Rouge and trials. ECCC has its own weekly radio program on RNK which provides an opportunity for the public to interact with court officials and deepen their understanding of cases.\nYouth for Peace, a Cambodian NGO that offers education in peace, leadership, conflict resolution and reconciliation to Cambodian's youth, has broadcast the weekly radio program, \"You Also Have a Chance\" since 2009. Aiming at preventing the passing on of hatred and violence to future generations, the program allows former Khmer Rouge to talk anonymously about their past experience.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike the later gods, these deities were born without any procreation.\nThe three deities that first appeared were:\nA bit later, two more deities came into existence: \nThe next generation of gods that followed was the Kamiyonanayo, which included Izanagi-no-Mikoto and Izanami-no-Mikoto, the patriarch and matriarch of all other Japanese gods, respectively. Afterward, the Kotoamatsukami \"hides away\" as \"hitorigami\".\nThough the Z\u014dkasanshin (three deities of creation) are thought to be genderless, another theory stated Kamimusuhi was the woman and Takamimusubi the man, comparing them with water and fire or with yin and yang.\nThe theologian Hirata Atsutane identified Amenominakanushi as the spirit of the North Star, master of the seven stars of the Big Dipper.\nStrangely, Takamimusubi later reappeared together with Amaterasu as one of the central gods in Takamagahara, and his daughter was the mother of the god Ninigi-no-Mikoto. He also played important roles in the events of the founding of Japan, such as selecting the gods who would tag along with Ninigi and sending the Yatagarasu, the three legged solar crow, to help Emperor Jimmu, who in turn, greatly worshipped him by playing the role of medium priest taking Takami Musubi's identity, in the ceremonies before his Imperial Enthronement. Later, Takamimusubi was worshipped by the Jingi-kan and considered the god of matchmaking. Some Japanese clans also claimed descent from this god, such as the Saeki clan, he is also an Imperial ancestor.\nAs for Kamimusuhi, he (or she) has strong ties with both the Amatsukami (heavenly gods) and the Kunitsukami (earthly gods) of Izumo mythology. Kamimusuhi is also said to have transformed the grains produced by the food goddess \u014cgetsuhime (Ukemochi no kami) after she was slain by Amaterasu's angered brother."}

The resulting illnesses led him to re-take 3rd and 4th grade to recover, listening to Musei Tokugawa and rakugo on the radio. In 1942 the outbreak of war with the US forced his middle school class into a factory producing radiators for the military. He later graduated in 1945 but his family home was destroyed during the Tokyo firebombing.\nAfter his initial ambitions of becoming a cargo sailor were opposed by his mother, Atsumi looked to acting after joining a traveling troop of actors with a friend. He started his career in 1951 as a comedian at a strip-show theater in Asakusa. A bout of tuberculosis resulted in a lobectomy, spending 2 years at a Saitama sanitorium to recover. He made his debut on TV in 1956 and on film in 1957. His vivid performance of a lovable, innocent man in the film \"Dear Mr. Emperor\" (\"Haikei Tenno-Heika-Sama\") in 1963 established his reputation as an actor. He developed a liking to Africa after spending 4 months there to film \"The Song of Bwana Toshi\" in 1965, vacationing to Tanzania multiple times afterwards.\nLater he became the star of the highly popular \"Tora-san series of films\". The original run ended with Tora dying after being bit by a Japanese pit viper. A flood of viewer complaints forced Shochiku to commission a movie, therefore making the show into a series.

In 1991 he was diagnosed with liver cancer which later metastized to his lungs in 1994. He died in August 8, 1996 at Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo. His private funeral included Yoji Yamada and Chieko Baisho as attendees.

His poem \"M\u00e1j\" is among the most important poems in the history of Czech literature.\nBiography.\nM\u00e1cha was born on 16 November 1810 in Prague. He grew up in Prague, the son of a foreman at a mill. He learned Latin and German in school. He went on to study law at Prague University; during that time he also became involved in theatre (as an actor he first appeared in Jan Nepomuk \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek's play \"Czech and German\" in July 1832 in Bene\u0161ov), where he met Eleonora \u0160omkov\u00e1, with whom he had a son out of wedlock. He was fond of travel, enjoying trips into the mountains, and was an avid walker. Eventually he moved to Litom\u011b\u0159ice, a quiet town some 60\u00a0km from Prague, to prepare for law school exams and to write poetry. Three days before he was to be married to \u0160omkov\u00e1, just a few weeks after he had begun working as a legal assistant, M\u00e1cha overexerted himself while helping to extinguish a fire and soon thereafter died. It is not certain what he died of. Some sources state that the cause of his death was pneumonia. The official record lists M\u00e1cha's cause of death as \"Brechdurchfall\", a milder form of cholera characterized by retching and diarrhea. The day after his death had been scheduled as his wedding day in Prague.\nM\u00e1cha was buried in Litom\u011b\u0159ice in a pauper's grave. Recognition came after his death: in 1939, his remains were exhumed, and they were given a formal state burial at the Vy\u0161ehrad Cemetery in Prague.\nHonours and legacy.\nA statue was erected in his honor in Pet\u0159\u00edn Park, Prague. In 1937 a biographical film, \"Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha\", was made by Zet Molas. Lake M\u00e1cha () was named after him in 1961.\nM\u00e1cha was honored on a 50 hal\u00e9\u0159 and a 1 koruna stamp on 30 April 1936, Scott Catalog #213\u2013214. The stamp depicts a statue of M\u00e1cha that is found in Prague and was issued by the postal agency of Czechoslovakia. He was again honored on a 43 koruna postage stamp issued by the postal agency of the Czech Republic on 10 March 2010. This 43 koruna postage stamp is presented on a miniature souvenir sheet. The Scott catalog number for this postage stamp honoring Macha is Scott #3446.\nKarel M\u00e1cha was appointed patron saint of the youth collective \"De Barries\" in 2019.\nWorks.\nHis lyrical epic poem \"M\u00e1j\" (\"May\"), published in 1836 shortly before his death, was judged by his contemporaries as confusing, too individualistic, and not in harmony with the national ideas. Czech playwright Josef Kajet\u00e1n Tyl even wrote a parody of M\u00e1cha's style, \"Rozervanec\" (The Chaotic). \"M\u00e1j\" was rejected by publishers, and was published by a vanity press at M\u00e1cha's own expense, not long before his early death. Josef Bohuslav Foerster set May for choir and orchestra as his Op.159.\nM\u00e1cha's genius was discovered and glorified much later by the poets and novelists of the 1850s (e.g., Jan Neruda, V\u00edt\u011bzslav H\u00e1lek, and Karolina Sv\u011btl\u00e1) and \"M\u00e1j\" is now regarded as the classic work of Czech Romanticism and is considered one of the best Czech poems ever written. It contains forebodings of many of the tendencies of 20th-century literature: existentialism, alienation, isolation, surrealism, and so on.\nM\u00e1cha also authored a collection of autobiographical sketches titled \"Pictures From My Life\", the 1835\u201336 novel \"Cik\u00e1ni\" (Gypsies), and several individual poems, as well as a journal in which, among other things, he detailed his sexual encounters with \u0160omkov\u00e1. The \"Diary of Travel to Italy\" describes his journey to Venice, Trieste, and Ljubljana (where he met the Slovene national poet France Pre\u0161eren) in 1834.

{"id": "17060", "revid": "26649853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17060", "title": "Krupp", "text": "German steel and weapons production company\nFriedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp (formerly Fried. Krupp AG and Friedrich Krupp GmbH), trading as Krupp, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century as well as Germany's premier weapons manufacturer during both world wars. It produced battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities. The company also produced steel used to build railroads in the United States and to cap the Chrysler Building. \nAfter the Nazis seized power in Germany, Krupp supported the regime and was one of many German businesses that profited from slave labor during World War II. Upon the war's end, the head of the company, Alfried Krupp, was tried and convicted as a war criminal for employing prisoners of war, foreign civilians and concentration camp inmates under inhumane conditions in support of the Nazi war effort. Despite being sentenced to imprisonment for twelve years, he served just three and was pardoned (but not acquitted) by John J. McCloy. As a result of this pardon, all of Krupp's holdings were restored. \nIn the years following the Third Reich's collapse, Krupp rose once again to become one of the wealthiest companies in Europe. However, this growth did not last indefinitely. In 1967, an economic recession resulted in significant financial losses for the business. In 1992, the company went public for the first time upon merging with Hoesch AG. In 1999, it merged with Thyssen AG to form the industrial conglomerate ThyssenKrupp AG.\nControversy has dogged the Krupp company. Being a major weapons supplier to multiple sides throughout various conflicts, it was blamed for the wars themselves or the degree of carnage that ensued. It's involvement in Nazi Germany was particularly controversial and widely condemned.\nOverview.\nFriedrich Krupp (1787\u20131826) launched the family's metal-based activities, building a pioneering steel foundry in Essen in 1811. After his death, his sons Alfred and an unidentified brother operated the business in partnership with their mother. An account cited that, on his deathbed, the elder Krupp confided to Alfred, who was then 14 years old, the secret of steel casting. In 1848, Alfred became the sole owner of the foundry. This next generation Krupp (1812\u201387), known as \"the Cannon King\" or as \"Alfred the Great\", invested heavily in new technology to become a significant manufacturer of steel rollers (used to make eating utensils) and railway tyres. He also invested in fluidized hotbed technologies (notably the Bessemer process) and acquired many mines in Germany and France. Initially, Krupp failed to gain profit from the Bessemer process due to the high phosphorus content of German iron ores. His chemists, however, later learned of the problem and constructed a Bessemer plant called C&amp;T Steel. Unusual for the era, he provided social services for his workers, including subsidized housing and health and retirement benefits.\nThe company began to make steel cannons in the 1840s\u2014especially for the Russian, Turkish, and Prussian armies. Low non-military demand and government subsidies meant that the company specialized more and more in weapons: by the late 1880s the manufacture of armaments represented around 50% of Krupp's total output. When Alfred Krupp started with the firm, it had five employees. At his death twenty thousand people worked for Krupp\u2014making it the world's largest industrial company and the largest private company in the German empire.\nKrupp's had a Great Krupp Building with an exhibition of guns at the Columbian Exposition in 1893.\nIn the 20th century the company was headed by Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (1870\u20131950), who assumed the surname of Krupp when he married the Krupp heiress, Bertha Krupp. After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, the Krupp works became the center for German rearmament. In 1943, by a special order from Hitler, the company reverted to a sole-proprietorship, with Gustav and Bertha's eldest son Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (1907\u201367) as proprietor.\nAfter Germany's defeat, Gustav was senile and incapable of standing trial, and the Nuremberg Military Tribunal convicted Alfried as a war criminal in the Krupp Trial for \"plunder\" and for his company's use of slave labor. It sentenced him to 12 years in prison and ordered him to sell 75% of his holdings. In 1951, as the Cold War developed and no buyer came forward, the U.S. occupation authorities released him, and in 1953 he resumed control of the firm.\nIn 1968, the company became an Aktiengesellschaft and ownership was transferred to the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation. In 1999, the Krupp Group merged with its largest competitor, Thyssen AG; the combined company\u2014ThyssenKrupp, became Germany's fifth-largest firm and one of the largest steel producers in the world.\nIn the early 1980s, the company spun off all its operating activities and was restructured as a holding company. VDM Nickel-Technologie was bought in 1989, for high-performance materials, mechanical engineering and electronics. That year, Gerhard Cromme became chairman and chief executive of Krupp. After its hostile takeover of rival steelmaker Hoesch AG in 1990\u20131991, the companies were merged in 1992 as \"Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch Krupp,\" under Cromme. After closing one main steel plant and laying off 20,000 employees, the company had a steelmaking capacity of around eight million metric tons and sales of about 28 billion DM (US$18.9 billion). The new Krupp had six divisions: steel, engineering, plant construction, automotive supplies, trade, and services. After two years of heavy losses, a modest net profit of 40 million DM (US$29.2 million) followed in 1994.\nIn 1997 Krupp attempted a hostile takeover of the larger Thyssen, but the bid was abandoned after resistance from Thyssen management and protests by its workers. Nevertheless, Thyssen agreed to merge the two firms' flat steel operations, and Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG was created in 1997 as a jointly owned subsidiary (60% by Thyssen and 40% by Krupp). About 6,300 workers were laid off. Later that year, Krupp and Thyssen announced a full merger, which was completed in 1999 with the formation of ThyssenKrupp AG. Cromme and Ekkehard Schulz were named co-chief executives of the new company, operating worldwide in three main business areas: steel, capital goods (elevators and industrial equipment), and services (specialty materials, environmental services, mechanical engineering, and scaffolding services).\nRoles played in important historical events.\nFranco-Prussian War.\nThe unexpected victory of Prussia over France (19 July 1870\u00a0\u2013 10 May 1871) demonstrated the superiority of breech-loaded steel cannon over muzzle-loaded brass. Krupp artillery was a significant factor at the battles of Wissembourg and Gravelotte, and was used during the siege of Paris. Krupp's anti-balloon guns were the first anti-aircraft guns. Prussia fortified the major North German ports with batteries that could hit French ships from a distance of , inhibiting invasion.\nVenezuela Crisis.\nKrupp's construction of the Great Venezuela Railway from 1888 to 1894 raised Venezuelan national debt. Venezuela's suspension of debt payments in 1901 led to gunboat diplomacy of the Venezuela Crisis of 1902\u20131903.\nBalkan wars.\nRussia and the Ottoman Empire both bought large quantities of Krupp guns. By 1887, Russia had bought 3,096 Krupp guns, while the Ottomans bought 2,773 Krupp guns. By the start of the Balkan wars the largest export market for Krupp worldwide was Turkey, which purchased 3,943 Krupp guns of various types between 1854 and 1912. The second-largest customer in the Balkans was Romania, which purchased 1,450 guns in the same period, while Bulgaria purchased 517 pieces, Greece 356, Austria-Hungary 298, Montenegro 25, and Serbia just 6 guns.\nWorld War I.\nKrupp produced most of the artillery of the Imperial German Army, including its heavy siege guns: the 1914 420\u00a0mm Big Bertha, the 1916 Langer Max, and the seven Paris Guns in 1917 and 1918. In addition, Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft built German warships and submarines in Kiel. During the war, Krupp also modified the design of an existing Langer Max gun, which they built in Koekelare. The gun called Batterie Pommern was the largest gun in the world in 1917 and was able to shoot shells of \u00b1750\u00a0kg from Koekelare to Dunkirk.\nBefore World War I Krupp had a contract with the British armaments company Vickers and Son Ltd. (formerly Vickers Maxim) to supply Vickers-constructed Maxim machine guns. Conversely, from 1902 Krupp was contracted by Vickers to supply its patented fuses to Vickers bullets. It is known that wounded and deceased German soldiers were found to have spent Vickers bullets with the German inscription \"Krupps patent z\u00fcnder [fuses]\" lying around their bodies.\nWorld War II.\nKrupp received its first order for 135 Panzer I tanks in 1933, and during World War II made tanks, artillery, naval guns, armor plate, munitions and other armaments for the German military. Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft shipyard launched the cruiser \"Prinz Eugen\", as well as many of Germany's U-boats (130 between 1934 and 1945) using preassembled parts supplied by other Krupp factories in a process similar to the construction of the US liberty ships.\nIn the 1930s, Krupp developed two 800\u00a0mm railway guns, the Schwerer Gustav and the Dora. These guns were the biggest artillery pieces ever fielded by an army during wartime, and weighed almost 1,344 tons. They could fire a 7-ton shell over a distance of 37 kilometers. More crucial to the operations of the German military was Krupp's development of the famed 88 mm anti-aircraft cannon which found use as a notoriously effective anti-tank gun.\nIn an address to the Hitler Youth, Adolf Hitler stated \"In our eyes, the German boy of the future must be slim and slender, as fast as a greyhound, tough as leather and hard as Krupp steel\" (\"... der deutsche Junge der Zukunft mu\u00df schlank und rank sein, flink wie Windhunde, z\u00e4h wie Leder und hart wie Kruppstahl.\")\nDuring the war Germany's industry was heavily bombed. The Germans built large-scale night-time decoys like the Krupp decoy site (German: Kruppsche Nachtscheinanlage) which was a German decoy-site of the Krupp steel works in Essen. During World War II, it was designed to divert Allied airstrikes from the actual production site of the arms factory.\nKrupp Industries employed workers conscripted by the Nazi regime from across Europe. These workers were initially paid, but as Nazi fortunes declined they were kept as slave workers. They were abused, beaten, and starved by the thousands, as detailed in the book \"The Arms of Krupp\". Nazi Germany kept two million French POWs captured in 1940 as forced laborers throughout the war. They added compulsory (and volunteer) workers from occupied nations, especially in metal factories. The shortage of volunteers led the Vichy government of France to deport workers to Germany, where they constituted 15% of the labor force by August 1944. The largest number worked in the giant Krupp steel works in Essen. Low pay, long hours, frequent bombings, and crowded air raid shelters added to the unpleasantness of poor housing, inadequate heating, limited food, and poor medical care, all compounded by harsh Nazi discipline. In an affidavit provided at the Nuremberg Trials following the war, Dr. Wilhelm Jaeger, the senior doctor for the Krupp slaves, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sanitary conditions were atrocious. At Kramerplatz only ten children's toilets were available for 1200 inhabitants...Excretion contaminated the entire floors of these lavatories. The Tatars and Kirghiz suffered most; they collapsed like flies [from] bad housing, the poor quality and insufficient quantity of food, overwork and insufficient rest...Countless fleas, bugs and other vermin tortured the inhabitants of these camps...\" The survivors finally returned home in the summer of 1945 after their liberation by the allied armies.\nKrupp industries was prosecuted after the end of war for its support to the Nazi regime and use of forced labour.\nPost\u2013World War II.\nKrupp's trucks were once again produced after the war, but so as to minimize the negative wartime connotations of the Krupp name they were sold as \"S\u00fcdwerke\" trucks from 1946 until 1954, when the Krupp name was considered rehabilitated.\nThe Mustang.\nKrupp also used the name \"Mustang\" for some of their products, causing a problem for Ford Motor Company in 1964 when they desired to export their car of the same name to Germany, especially since American military personnel stationed there wanted the new car. Although Krupp offered to sell the Mustang name to Ford for a reasonable price, Ford declined and as a result, badged all Mustangs destined for Germany \"T-5.\" By 1978 Krupp's rights to the Mustang name expired and all Mustangs exported to Germany henceforth retained the Mustang name.\nOther accomplishments.\nKrupp Steel Works of Essen, Germany, manufactured the spherical pressure chamber of the dive vessel \"Trieste\", the first vessel to take humans to the deepest known point in the oceans, accomplished in 1960. This was a heavy duty replacement for the original pressure sphere (made in Italy by Acciaierie Terni) and was manufactured in three finely machined sections: an equatorial ring and two hemispherical caps. The sphere weighed 13 tonnes in air (net displacement eight tonnes in water) with walls that were 12.7 centimetres (5.0\u00a0in) thick.\nKrupp Steel Works was also contracted in the mid-1960s to construct the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope, which, from 1972 to 2000 was the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world.\nPeacetime activities.\nRailway expansion period.\nKrupp was the first company to patent a seamless, reliable and strong enough railway tyre for rail freight. Krupp received original contracts in the United States and enjoyed a period of technological superiority while also contributing the majority of rail to the new continental railway system. \"Nearly all railroads were using Krupp rails, the New York Central, Illinois Central, Delaware and Hudson, Maine Central, Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, Bangor and Aroostook, Great Northern, Boston and Albany, Florida and East Coast, Texas and Pacific, Southern Pacific, and Mexican National.\"\nDiesel engines.\nIn 1893, a mechanical engineer by the name of Rudolf Diesel approached Gustav with a patent for a \"new kind of internal combustion engine employing autoignition of the fuel\". He also included his text \"\". Four years later, the first 3-horsepower diesel engine was produced.\nPronunciation.\nThe common English pronunciations are or . The common German pronunciations are or . Thus the \"u\" is usually treated as short in both languages, corresponding logically (in either language's regular orthography) with the doubled consonant that follows. A British documentary on the Krupp family and firm included footage of German-speakers of the 1930s who would have had speaking contact with the family, which attests the long , thus or , rather than what would be the regular German spelling pronunciation, or . The documentary's narration used the English equivalent, . This would seem to indicate that the short \"u\" is a spelling pronunciation, but it is nonetheless the most common treatment.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as Prime Minister of the Gold Coast from 1952 until 1957, when it gained independence from Britain. He was then the first prime minister and then the president of Ghana, from 1957 until 1966. An influential advocate of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.\nAfter twelve early years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political philosophy, and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. He formed the Convention People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common voter. He became Prime Minister in 1952 and retained the position when he led Ghana to independence from Britain in 1957, a first in sub-Saharan Africa at the time. In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah as president.\nHis administration was primarily socialist as well as nationalist. It funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and promoted a pan-Africanist culture. Under Nkrumah, Ghana played a leading role in African international relations and the pan-africanist movement during Africa's decolonization period, supporting numerous liberation struggles.\nAfter an alleged assassination plot against him, coupled with increasingly difficult local economic conditions, Nkrumah's government became authoritarian in the 1960s, as he repressed political opposition and conducted elections that were neither free nor fair. In 1964, a constitutional amendment made Ghana a one-party state, with Nkrumah as president for life of both the nation and its party. He fostered a personality cult, forming ideological institutes and adopting the title of 'Osagyefo Dr.' Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 in a coup d'\u00e9tat by the National Liberation Council. Claims of CIA involvement in his overthrow have never been verified. Nkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea, where he was named honorary co-president. In 1999, he was voted BBC African of the millennium.\nEarly life and education.\nGold Coast.\nKwame Nkrumah was born on Tuesday, 21 September 1909 in Nkroful, Nzema East, (now Ellembele), Gold Coast (now Ghana). Nkroful was a small village in the Nzema area, in the southwest of the Gold Coast, close to the frontier with the French colony of the Ivory Coast. His father did not live with the family, but worked in Half Assini where he pursued his goldsmith business until his death. Kwame Nkrumah was raised by his mother and his extended family, who lived together traditionally and had more distant relatives often visiting. He lived a carefree childhood, spent in the village, in the bush, and on the nearby sea. \nDuring his years as a student in the United States, he was known as Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah, Kofi being the Akan name given to males born on Fridays. He later changed his name to Kwame Nkrumah in 1945 in the UK, preferring the name \"Kwame\". According to Ebenezer Obiri Addo in his study of the future president, the name \"Nkrumah\", a name traditionally given to a ninth child, indicates that Kwame probably held that place in the house of his father, who had several wives.\nHis father, Opanyin Kofi Nwiana Ngolomah, came from Nkroful and belonged to the Asona clan of the Akan Tribe. Sources indicated that Ngolomah stayed at Tarkwa-Nsuaem and dealt in the goldsmith business. Ngolomah was respected for his wise counsel by those who sought his advice on traditional issues and domestic affairs. He died in 1927.\nKwame was his mother's only child. She sent him to the elementary school run by a Catholic mission at Half Assini, where he proved an adept student.\nAlthough his mother, whose name was Elizabeth Nyanibah (1877\u20131979), later stated his year of birth as 1912, Nkrumah wrote that he was born on 21 September 1909. His mother hailed from Nsuaem and belonged to the Agona family. She was a fishmonger and petty trader when she married his father. Eight days after his birth, his father named him as Francis Nwia-Kofi after a relative but later his parents named him as Francis Kwame Ngolomah. \nHe progressed through the ten-year elementary programme in eight years. In 1925, he was a student-teacher in the school and was baptized into the Catholic faith. While at the school, he was noticed by the Reverend Alec Garden Fraser, principal of the Government Training College (soon to become Achimota School) in the Gold Coast's capital, Accra. Fraser arranged for Nkrumah to train as a teacher at his school. Here, Columbia-educated deputy headmaster Kwegyir Aggrey exposed him to the ideas of Marcus Garvey and W. E. B. Du Bois. Aggrey, Fraser, and others at Achimota thought that there should be close co-operation between the races in governing the Gold Coast, but Nkrumah, echoing Garvey, soon came to believe that only when the black race governed itself could there be harmony between the races.\nAfter obtaining his teacher's certificate from the Prince of Wales' College at Achimota in 1930, Nkrumah was given a teaching post at the Roman Catholic primary school in Elmina in 1931. During his years at Achimota, Nkrumah was noted for his debating and leadership skills, traits that later shaped his role as a nationalist leader.\nAfter a year there, he was made headmaster of the school at Axim. In Axim, he started to get involved in politics and founded the Nzema Literary Society. In 1933, he was appointed a teacher at the Catholic seminary at Amissano. Although life there was strict, he liked it, and considered becoming a Jesuit. Nkrumah had heard journalist and future Nigerian president Nnamdi Azikiwe speak while a student at Achimota; the two men met and Azikiwe's influence increased Nkrumah's interest in black nationalism. The young teacher decided to further his education. Azikiwe had attended Lincoln University, a historically black college in Chester County, Pennsylvania, west of Philadelphia, and he advised Nkrumah to enroll there. \nNkrumah, who had failed the entrance examination for London University, gained funds for the trip and his education from relatives. He travelled by way of Britain, where he learned, to his outrage, of Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, one of the few independent African nations. He arrived in the United States, in October 1935.\nUnited States.\nAccording to historian John Henrik Clarke in his article on Nkrumah's American sojourn, \"the influence of the ten years that he spent in the United States had a lingering effect on the rest of his life.\" Nkrumah had sought entry to Lincoln University some time before he began his studies there. On Friday, 1 March 1935, he sent the school a letter noting that his application had been pending for more than a year. When he arrived in New York in October 1935, he traveled to Pennsylvania, where he enrolled despite lacking the funds for the full semester. He soon won a scholarship that provided for his tuition at Lincoln University. He remained short of funds through his time in the US. To make ends meet, he did menial jobs on roles such as a wholesaler of fish and poultries, cleaner, dishwasher and others. On Sundays, he visited black Presbyterian churches in Philadelphia and in New York.\nNkrumah completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology in 1939. Lincoln then appointed him an assistant lecturer in philosophy. He began to receive invitations to be a guest preacher in Presbyterian churches in Philadelphia and New York. In 1939, Nkrumah enrolled at Lincoln's seminary and at the Ivy League institution, the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and in 1942, he was initiated into the Mu chapter of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity at Lincoln University. Nkrumah gained a Bachelor of Theology degree from Lincoln in 1942, the top student in the course. He earned from Penn the following year a Master of Arts degree in philosophy and a Master of Science in education. While at Penn, Nkrumah worked with the linguist William Everett Welmers, providing the spoken material that formed the basis of the first descriptive grammar of his native Fante dialect of the Akan language. Nkrumah was also initiated into Prince Hall Freemasonry while living in the United States.\nNkrumah spent his summers in Harlem, a center of black life, thought and culture. He found housing and employment in New York City with difficulty and involved himself in the community. He spent many evenings listening to and arguing with street orators, and according to Clarke, Kwame Nkrumah in his years in America stated;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These evenings were a vital part of Kwame Nkrumah's American education. He was going to a university \u2013 the university of the Harlem Streets. This was no ordinary time and these street speakers were no ordinary men\u00a0 ...The streets of Harlem were open forums, presided over [by] master speakers like Arthur Reed and his protege Ira Kemp. The young Carlos Cook [\"sic\"], founder of the Garvey oriented African Pioneer Movement was on the scene, also bringing a nightly message to his street followers. Occasionally Suji Abdul Hamid [\"sic\"], a champion of Harlem labour, held a night rally and demanded more jobs for blacks in their own community\u00a0 ...This is part of the drama on the Harlem streets as the student Kwame Nkrumah walked and watched.\nNkrumah was an activist student, organizing a group of expatriate African students in Pennsylvania and building it into the African Students Association of America and Canada, becoming its president. Some members felt that the group should aspire for each colony to gain independence on its own; Nkrumah urged a Pan-African strategy. Nkrumah played a major role in the Pan-African conference held in New York in 1944, which urged the United States, at the end of the Second World War, to help ensure Africa became developed and free.\nHis old teacher Aggrey had died in 1929 in the US, and in 1942, Nkrumah led traditional prayers for Aggrey at the graveside. This led to a break between him and Lincoln, though after he rose to prominence in the Gold Coast, he returned in 1951 to accept an honorary degree. Nevertheless, Nkrumah's doctoral thesis remained uncompleted. He had adopted the forename Francis while at the Amissano seminary; in 1945, he took the name Kwame Nkrumah.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJust as in the days of the Egyptians, so today God had ordained that certain among the African race should journey westwards to equip themselves with knowledge and experience for the day when they would be called upon to return to their motherland and to use the learning they had acquired to help improve the lot of their brethren. ...I had not realised at the time that I would contribute so much towards the fulfillment of this prophecy.\n\u2014 Kwame Nkrumah, \"The Autobiography of Kwame Nkrumah\" (1957)\nNkrumah read books about politics and divinity, and tutored students in philosophy. In 1943 Nkrumah met Trinidadian Marxist C. L. R. James, Russian expatriate Raya Dunayevskaya, and Chinese-American Grace Lee Boggs, all of whom were members of an American-based Marxist intellectual cohort. Nkrumah later credited James with teaching him \"how an underground movement worked\". Federal Bureau of Investigation files on Nkrumah, kept from January to May 1945, identify him as a possible communist. Nkrumah was determined to go to London, wanting to continue his education there now that the Second World War had ended. James, in a 1945 letter introducing Nkrumah to Trinidad-born George Padmore in London, wrote: \"This young man is coming to you. He is not very bright, but nevertheless do what you can for him because he's determined to throw Europeans out of Africa.\"\nLondon.\nNkrumah returned to London in May 1945 and enrolled at the London School of Economics as a PhD candidate in Anthropology. He withdrew after one term and the next year enrolled at University College London, with the intent to write a philosophy dissertation on \"Knowledge and Logical Positivism\". His supervisor, A. J. Ayer, declined to rate Nkrumah as a \"first-class philosopher\", saying, \"I liked him and enjoyed talking to him but he did not seem to me to have an analytical mind. He wanted answers too quickly. I think part of the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis. It was a way of marking time until the opportunity came for him to return to Ghana.\" Finally, Nkrumah enrolled in, but did not complete, a study in law at Gray's Inn.\nNkrumah spent his time on political organizations. He and Padmore were among the principal organizers, and co-treasurers, of the Fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester (15\u201319 October 1945). The Congress elaborated a strategy for supplanting colonialism with African socialism. They agreed to pursue a federal United States of Africa, with interlocking regional organizations, governing through separate states of limited sovereignty. They planned to pursue a new African culture without tribalism, democratic within a socialist system, synthesizing traditional aspects with modern thinking, and for this to be achieved by non-violent means if possible. Among those who attended the congress was the venerable W. E. B. Du Bois along with some who later took leading roles in leading their nations to independence, including Hastings Banda of Nyasaland (which became Malawi), Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya and Obafemi Awolowo of Nigeria.\nThe congress sought to establish ongoing African activism in Britain in conjunction with the West African National Secretariat (WANS) to work towards the decolonisation of Africa. Nkrumah became the secretary of WANS. In addition to seeking to organize Africans to gain their nations' freedom, Nkrumah sought to succour the many West African seamen who had been stranded, destitute, in London at the end of the war, and established a Coloured Workers Association to empower and succour them. The U.S. State Department and MI5 watched Nkrumah and the WANS, focusing on their links with Communism. Nkrumah and Padmore established a group called The Circle to lead the way to West African independence and unity; the group aimed to create a Union of African Socialist Republics. A document from The Circle, setting forth that goal was found on Nkrumah upon his arrest in Accra in 1948, and was used against him by the British authorities.\nReturn to the Gold Coast.\nUnited Gold Coast Convention.\nThe 1946 Gold Coast constitution gave Africans a majority on the Legislative Council for the first time. Seen as a major step towards self-government, the new arrangement prompted the colony's first true political party, founded in August 1947, the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC). The UGCC sought self-government as quickly as possible. Since the leading members were all successful professionals, they needed to pay someone to run the party, and their choice fell on Nkrumah at the suggestion of Ako Adjei. Nkrumah hesitated but realized that the UGCC was controlled by conservative interests and noted that the new post could open huge political opportunities for him and accepted. After being questioned by British officials about his communist affiliations, Nkrumah boarded the MV \"Accra\" at Liverpool in November 1947 for the voyage home.\nAfter brief stops in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Ivory Coast, he arrived in the Gold Coast where he briefly stayed and reunited with his mother in Tarkwa. He began work at the party's headquarters in Saltpond on 29 December 1947 where he worked as a general secretary. Nkrumah quickly submitted plans for branches of the UGCC to be established colony-wide, and for strikes if necessary to gain political ends. This activist stance divided the party's governing committee, which was led by J. B. Danquah. Nkrumah embarked on a tour to gain donations for the UGCC and establish new branches.\nAlthough the Gold Coast was more developed politically than Britain's other West African colonies, there was considerable discontent. Postwar inflation had caused public anger at high prices, leading to a boycott of small businesses run by Arabs which began in January 1948. Local cocoa bean farmers were upset because trees exhibiting cacao swollen-shoot virus, but still capable of yielding a crop, were being destroyed by the colonial authorities. There were about 63,000 World War II veterans in the Gold Coast, many of whom had trouble obtaining employment and felt the colonial government was doing nothing to address their grievances. Nkrumah and Danquah addressed a meeting of the Ex-Service men's Union in Accra on 20 February 1948, which was made in advance of a planned march to present a petition to the governor. When the march took place on 28 February, three veterans were killed by police gunfire, prompting the 1948 Accra riots, which spread throughout the country. According to Nkrumah's biographer, David Birmingham, \"West Africa's erstwhile \"model colony\" witnessed a riot and business premises were looted. The African Revolution had begun.\"\nThe colonial government assumed that the UGCC was responsible for the unrest, and arrested six leaders, including Nkrumah and Danquah. The Big Six were incarcerated together in Kumasi, increasing the rift between Nkrumah and the others, who blamed him for the riots and their detention. After the colonial government learned that there were plots to storm the prison, the six were separated, with Nkrumah sent to Lawra; all six were freed in April 1948. Many students and teachers had demonstrated for their release and had been suspended; Nkrumah, using his own funds, began the Ghana National College. This among other activities, led UGCC committee members to accuse him of acting in the party's name without authority. Fearing he would harm them more outside the party than within, they agreed to make him honorary treasurer. Nkrumah's popularity, already large, was increased with his founding of the \"Accra Evening News\", which was not a party organ but was owned by Nkrumah and others. He also founded the Committee on Youth Organization (CYO) as a youth wing for the UGCC. It soon broke away and adopted the motto \"Self-Government Now\". The CYO united students, ex-servicemen, and market women. Nkrumah recounted in his autobiography that he knew that a break with the UGCC was inevitable, and wanted the masses behind him when the conflict occurred. Nkrumah's appeals for \"Free-Dom\" appealed to the great numbers of underemployed youths who had come from the farms and villages to the towns. \"Old hymn tunes were adapted to new songs of liberation which welcomed traveling orators, and especially Nkrumah himself, to mass rallies across the Gold Coast.\"\nAccording to a public speech delivered by Aaron Mike Oquaye, a meeting occurred in Saltpond, a town in the Central region, between Nkrumah and the members of UGCC where Nkrumah was said to have rejected a proposal for the promotion of fundamental human rights.\nConvention People's Party.\nBeginning in April 1949, there was considerable pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party. On 12 June 1949, he announced the formation of the Convention People's Party (CPP), with the word \"convention\" chosen, according to Nkrumah, \"to carry the masses with us\". There were attempts to heal the breach with the UGCC; at one July meeting, it was agreed to reinstate Nkrumah as secretary and disband the CPP. But Nkrumah's supporters would not have it, and persuaded him to refuse the offer and remain at their head.\nThe CPP adopted the red cockerel as its symbol \u2013 a familiar icon for local ethnic groups, and a symbol of leadership, alertness, and masculinity. Party symbols and colours (red, white, and green) appeared on clothing, flags, vehicles and houses. CPP operatives drove red-white-and-green vans across the country, playing music and rallying public support for the party and especially for Nkrumah. These efforts were wildly successful, especially because previous political efforts in the Gold Coast had focused exclusively on the urban intelligentsia.\nThe British convened a selected commission of middle-class Africans, including all of the Big Six except Nkrumah, to draft a new constitution that would give the Gold Coast more self-government. Nkrumah saw, even before the commission reported, that its recommendations would fall short of full dominion status, and began to organize a Positive Action campaign. Nkrumah demanded a constituent assembly to write a constitution. When the governor, Charles Arden-Clarke, would not commit to this, Nkrumah called for positive action, with the unions beginning a general strike to begin on 8 January 1950. The strike quickly led to violence, and Nkrumah and other CPP leaders were arrested on 22 January, and the \"Evening News\" was banned. Nkrumah was sentenced to a total of three years in prison, and he was incarcerated with common criminals in Accra's Fort James.\nNkrumah's assistant, Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, ran the CPP in his absence; the imprisoned leader was able to influence events through smuggled notes written on toilet paper. The British prepared for an election for the Gold Coast under their new constitution, and Nkrumah insisted that the CPP contest all seats. The situation had become calmer once Nkrumah was arrested, and the CPP and the British worked together to prepare electoral rolls. Nkrumah stood, from prison, for a directly elected Accra seat. Gbedemah worked to set up a nationwide campaign organization, using vans with loudspeakers to blare the party's message. The UGCC failed to set up a nationwide structure, and proved unable to take advantage of the fact that many of its opponents were in prison.\nIn the February 1951 legislative election, the first general election to be held under universal franchise in colonial Africa, the CPP was elected in a landslide. The CPP secured 34 of the 38 seats contested on a party basis, with Nkrumah elected for his Accra constituency. The UGCC won three seats, and one was taken by an independent. Arden-Clarke saw that the only alternative to Nkrumah's freedom was the end of the constitutional experiment. Nkrumah was released from prison on 12 February, receiving a rapturous reception from his followers. The following day, Arden-Clarke sent for him and asked him to form a government.\nNkrumah had stolen Arden-Clarke's secretary Erica Powell after she was dismissed and sent home for getting too close to Nkrumah. Powell returned to Ghana in January 1955 to be Nkrumah's private secretary, a position she held for ten years. Powell was very close to him and during their time together she largely wrote Nkrumah's (auto)biography, although this was not admitted until much later.\nLeader of Government Business and Prime Minister.\nNkrumah faced several challenges as he assumed office. He had never served in government, and needed to learn that art. The Gold Coast was composed of four regions, several former colonies amalgamated into one. Nkrumah sought to unite them under one nationality, and bring the country to independence. Key to meeting the challenges was convincing the British that the CPP's programmes were not only practical, but inevitable, and Nkrumah and Arden-Clarke worked closely together. The governor instructed the civil service to give the fledgling government full support, and the three British members of the cabinet took care not to vote against the elected majority.\nPrior to the CPP taking office, British officials had prepared a ten-year plan for development. With demands for infrastructure improvements coming in from all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years. The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely. Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior. The rail system was modernized and expanded. Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun. Construction began on a new harbour at Tema, near Accra, and the existing port, at Takoradi, was expanded. An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun. From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000. Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, the country would be relying on expatriate European civil servants for several years.\nNkrumah's title was Leader of Government Business in a cabinet chaired by Arden-Clarke. Quick progress was made, and in 1952, the governor withdrew from the cabinet, leaving Nkrumah as his prime minister, with the portfolios that had been reserved for expatriates going to Africans. There were accusations of corruption, and of nepotism, as officials, following African custom, attempted to benefit their extended families and their tribes. The recommendations following the 1948 riots had included elected local government rather than the existing system dominated by the chiefs. This was uncontroversial until it became clear that it would be implemented by the CPP. That party's majority in the Legislative Assembly passed legislation in late 1951 that shifted power from the chiefs to the chairs of the councils, though there was some local rioting as rates were imposed.\nNkrumah's re-titling as prime minister had not given him additional power, and he sought constitutional reform that would lead to independence. In 1952, he consulted with the visiting Colonial Secretary, Oliver Lyttelton, who indicated that Britain would look favorably on further advancement, so long as the chiefs and other stakeholders had the opportunity to express their views. Initially skeptical of Nkrumah's socialist policies, Britain's MI5 had compiled large amounts of intelligence on Nkrumah through several sources, including tapping phones and mail interception under the code name of SWIFT. Beginning in October 1952, Nkrumah sought opinions from councils and from political parties on reform, and consulted widely across the country, including with opposition groups. The result the following year was a White Paper on a new constitution, seen as a final step before independence. Published in June 1953, the constitutional proposals were accepted both by the assembly and by the British, and came into force in April of the following year. The new document provided for an assembly of 104 members, all directly elected, with an all-African cabinet responsible for the internal governing of the colony. In the election on 15 June 1954, the CPP won 71, with the regional Northern People's Party forming the official opposition.\nA number of opposition groups formed the National Liberation Movement. Their demands were for a federal, rather than a unitary government for an independent Gold Coast, and for an upper house of parliament where chiefs and other traditional leaders could act as a counter to the CPP majority in the assembly. They drew considerable support in the Northern Territory and among the chiefs in Ashanti, who petitioned the British queen, Elizabeth II, asking for a Royal Commission into what form of government the Gold Coast should have. This was refused by her government, who in 1955 stated that such a commission should only be used if the people of the Gold Coast proved incapable of deciding their own affairs. Amid political violence, the two sides attempted to reconcile their differences, but the NLM refused to participate in any committee with a CPP majority. The traditional leaders were also incensed by a new bill that had just been enacted, which allowed minor chiefs to appeal to the government in Accra, bypassing traditional chiefly authority. The British were unwilling to leave unresolved the fundamental question as to how an independent Gold Coast should be governed, and in June 1956, the Colonial Secretary, Alan Lennox-Boyd announced that there would be another general election in the Gold Coast, and if a \"reasonable majority\" took the CPP's position, Britain would set a date for independence. The results of the July 1956 election were almost identical to those from four years before, and on 3 August the assembly voted for independence under the name Nkrumah had proposed in April, Ghana. In September, the Colonial Office announced independence day would be 6 March 1957.\nThe opposition was not satisfied with the plan for independence, and demanded that power be devolved to the regions. Discussions took place through late 1956 and into 1957. Although Nkrumah did not compromise on his insistence on a unitary state, the nation was divided into five regions, with power devolved from Accra, and the chiefs having a role in their governments. On 21 February 1957, the British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, announced that Ghana would be a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations with effect from 6 March.\nGhanaian independence.\nGhana became independent on 6 March 1957 as the Dominion of Ghana. As the first of Britain's African colonies to gain majority-rule independence, the celebrations in Accra were the focus of world attention; over 100 reporters and photographers covered the events. United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent congratulations and his vice president, Richard Nixon, to represent the U.S. at the event. The Soviet delegation urged Nkrumah to visit Moscow as soon as possible. Political scientist Ralph Bunche, an African American, was there for the United Nations, while the Duchess of Kent represented Queen Elizabeth II. Offers of assistance poured in from across the world. Even without them, the country seemed prosperous, with cocoa prices high and the potential of new resource development.\nAs the fifth of March turned to the sixth, Nkrumah stood before tens of thousands of supporters and proclaimed, \"Ghana will be free forever.\" He spoke at the first session of the Ghana Parliament that Independence Day, telling his new country's citizens that \"we have a duty to prove to the world that Africans can conduct their own affairs with efficiency and tolerance and through the exercise of democracy. We must set an example to all Africa.\"\nAs part of the ceremony, Nkrumah gave a speech to instill hope and ooze assurance.\nNkrumah was hailed as the \u2013 which means \"redeemer\" in the Akan language. This independence ceremony included the Duchess of Kent and Governor General Charles Arden-Clarke. With more than 600 reporters in attendance, Ghanaian independence became one of the most internationally reported news events in modern African history.\nThe flag of Ghana was designed by Theodosia Okoh, inverting Ethiopia's green-yellow-red Lion of Judah flag and replacing the lion with a black star. Red symbolizes bloodshed; green stands for beauty, agriculture, and abundance; yellow represents mineral wealth; and the Black Star represents African freedom. The country's new coat of arms, designed by Amon Kotei, includes eagles, a lion, a St. George's Cross, and a Black Star, with copious gold and gold trim. Philip Gbeho was commissioned to compose the new national anthem, \"God Bless Our Homeland Ghana\".\nAs a monument to the new nation, Nkrumah opened Black Star Square near Osu Castle in the coastal district of Osu, Accra. This square would be used for national symbolism and mass patriotic rallies.\nUnder Nkrumah's leadership, Ghana adopted some social democratic policies and practices. Nkrumah created a welfare system, started various community programs, and established schools.\nGhana's leader (1957\u20131966).\nPolitical developments and presidential election.\nNkrumah had only a short honeymoon before there was unrest among his country's people. The government deployed troops to Togo-land to quell unrest following a disputed plebiscite on membership in the new country. A serious bus strike in Accra stemmed from resentments among the Ga people, who believed members of other tribes were getting preferential treatment in government promotion, and thus resulted in riots there in August. Nkrumah's response was to repress local movements by the Avoidance of Discrimination Act (6 December 1957), which banned regional or tribal-based political parties. Another strike at tribalism fell in Ashanti, where Nkrumah and the CPP got most local chiefs who were not party supporters destooled. These repressive actions concerned the opposition parties, who came together to form the United Party under Kofi Abrefa Busia.\nIn 1958, an opposition MP was arrested on charges of attempting to obtain arms abroad for a planned infiltration of the Ghana Army (GA). Nkrumah was convinced there had been an assassination plot against him, and his response was to have the parliament pass the Preventive Detention Act, allowing for incarceration for up to five years without charge or trial, with only Nkrumah empowered to release prisoners early. According to Nkrumah's biographer, David Birmingham, \"no single measure did more to bring down Nkrumah's reputation than his adoption of internment without trial for the preservation of security.\" Nkrumah intended to bypass the British-trained judiciary, which he saw as opposing his plans when they subjected them to constitutional scrutiny.\nAnother source of irritation was the regional assemblies, which had been organized on an interim basis pending further constitutional discussions. The opposition, which was strong in Ashanti and the north, proposed significant powers for the assemblies; the CPP wanted them to be more or less advisory. In 1959, Nkrumah used his majority in the parliament to push through the Constitutional Amendment Act, which abolished the assemblies and allowed the parliament to amend the constitution with a simple majority.\nQueen Elizabeth II remained sovereign over Ghana from 1957 to 1960. William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel was the Governor-General, and Nkrumah remained Prime Minister. On 6 March 1960, Nkrumah announced plans for a new constitution that would make Ghana a republic, headed by a president with broad executive and legislative powers. The draft included a provision to surrender Ghanaian sovereignty to a Union of African States. On 19, 23, and 27 April 1960 a presidential election and plebiscite on the constitution were held. The constitution was ratified and Nkrumah was elected president over J. B. Danquah, the UP candidate, 1,016,076 to 124,623. Ghana remained a part of the British-led Commonwealth of Nations.\nOpposition to tribalism.\nNkrumah also sought to eliminate \"tribalism\", a source of loyalties held more deeply than those to the nation-state. Thus, as he wrote in \"Africa Must Unite\": \"We were engaged in a kind of war, a war against poverty and disease, against ignorance, against tribalism and disunity. We needed to secure the conditions which could allow us to pursue our policy of reconstruction and development.\" To this end, in 1958, his government passed \"An Act to prohibit organizations using or engaging in racial or religious propaganda to the detriment of any other racial or religious community, or securing the election of persons on account of their racial or religious affiliations, or for other purposes in connection therewith.\" Nkrumah attempted to saturate the country in national flags, and declared a widely disobeyed ban on tribal flags.\nKofi Abrefa Busia of the United Party (Ghana) gained prominence as an opposition leader in the debate over this Act, taking a more classically liberal position and criticizing the ban on tribal politics as repressive. Soon after, he left the country. Nkrumah was also a very flamboyant leader. \"The New York Times\" in 1972 wrote: \"During his high\u2010flying days as the leader of Ghana in the 1950s and early 1960s, Kwame Nkrumah was a flamboyant spellbinder. At home, he created a cult of personality and gloried in the title of . Abroad, he met with the world's leaders as the first man to lead an African colony to independence after World War II.\"\nDuring his tenure as Prime Minister and then first President, Nkrumah succeeded in reducing the political importance of the local chieftaincy (e.g., the Akan chiefs and the Asantehene). These chiefs had maintained authority during colonial rule through collaboration with the British authorities; in fact, they were sometimes favored over the local intelligentsia, who made trouble for the British with organizations like the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society. The Convention People's Party had a strained relationship with the chiefs when it came to power, and this relationship became more hostile as the CPP incited political opposition chiefs and criticized the institution as undemocratic. Acts passed in 1958 and 1959 gave the government more power to dis-stool chiefs directly, and proclaimed government of stool land \u2013 and revenues. These policies alienated the chiefs and led them to looking favorably on the overthrow of Nkrumah and his Party.\nIncreased power of the Convention People's Party.\nIn 1962, three younger members of the CPP were brought up on charges of taking part in a plot to blow up Nkrumah's car in a motorcade. The sole evidence against the alleged plotters was that they rode in cars well behind Nkrumah's car. When the defendants were acquitted, Nkrumah sacked the chief judge of the state security court, then got the CPP-dominated parliament to pass a law allowing a new trial. At this second trial, all three men were convicted and sentenced to death, though these sentences were subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Shortly afterward, the constitution was amended to give the president the power to summarily remove judges at all levels.\nIn 1964, Nkrumah proposed a constitutional amendment that would make the CPP the only legal party, with Nkrumah as president for life of both nation and party. The amendment passed with 99.91 percent of the vote, an implausibly high total that led observers to condemn the vote as \"obviously rigged\". Ghana had effectively been a one-party state since independence. The amendment transformed Nkrumah's presidency into a \"de facto\" legal dictatorship.\nCivil service.\nAfter substantial Africanization of the civil service in 1952\u201360, the number of expatriates rose again from 1960 to 1965. Many of the new outside workers came not from the United Kingdom but from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Italy.\nEducation.\nIn 1951, the CPP created the Accelerated Development Plan for Education. This plan set up a six-year primary course, to be attended as close to universally as possible, with a range of possibilities to follow. All children were to learn arithmetic, as well as gain \"a sound foundation for citizenship with permanent literacy in both English and the vernacular.\" Primary education became compulsory in 1962. The plan also stated that religious schools would no longer receive funding, and that some existing missionary schools would be taken over by government.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe in Ghana, are committed to the building of an industrialised socialist society.\u00a0 We cannot afford to sit still and be mere passive onlookers.\u00a0 We must ourselves take part in the pursuit of scientific and technological research as a means of providing the basis for our socialist society, Socialism without science is void.\u2026\nWe need also to reach out to the mass of the people who have not had the opportunities of formal education.\u00a0 We must use every means of mass communication \u2013 the press, the radio, television and films \u2013 to carry science to the whole population \u2013 to the people. ...\nIt is most important that our people should not only be instructed in science but that they should take part in it, apply it themselves in their own ways.\u00a0 For science is not just a subject to be learned out of a book or from a teacher.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a way of life, a way of tackling any problem which one can only master by using it for oneself.\u00a0 We must have science clubs in which our people can develop their own talents for discovery and invention.\n\u2014 Kwame Nkrumah \"Speech delivered by Osagyefo the President at the Laying of the Foundation Stone of Ghana's Atomic Reactor at Kwabenya on 25th November, 1964\"\nIn 1961, Nkrumah laid the first stones in the foundation of the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute created to train Ghanaian civil servants as well as promote Pan-Africanism. In 1964, all students entering college in Ghana were required to attend a two-week \"ideological orientation\" at the institute. Nkrumah remarked that \"trainees should be made to realize the party's ideology is religion, and should be practiced faithfully and fervently.\"\nIn 1964, Nkrumah brought forth the Seven Year Development Plan for National Reconstruction and Development, which identified education as a key source of development and called for the expansion of secondary technical schools. Secondary education would also include \"in-service training programmes\". As Nkrumah told Parliament: \"Employers, both public and private, will be expected to make a far greater contribution to labour training through individual factory and farm schools, industry-wide training schemes, day release, payment for attendance at short courses and evening classes.\" This training would be indirectly subsidized with tax credits and import allocations.\nIn 1952, the Artisan Trading Scheme, arranged with the Colonial Office and UK Ministry of Labour, provided for a few experts in every field to travel to Britain for technical education. Kumasi Technical Institute was founded in 1956. In September 1960, it added the Technical Teacher Training Centre. In 1961, the CPP passed the Apprentice Act, which created a general Apprenticeship Board along with committees for each industry.\nCulture.\nNkrumah was an ardent promoter of pan-Africanism, seeing the movement as the \"quest for regional integration of the whole of the African continent\". The period of Nkrumah's active political involvement has been described as the \"golden age of high pan-African ambitions\"; the continent had experienced rising nationalist movements and decolonization by most European colonial powers, and historians have noted that \"the narrative of rebirth and solidarity had gained momentum within the pan-Africanist movement\". Reflecting his African heritage, Nkrumah frequently eschewed Western fashion, donning a fugu (a Northern attire) made with Southern-produced Kente cloth, a symbol of his identity as a representative of the entire country. He oversaw the opening of the Ghana Museum on 5 March 1957; the Arts Council of Ghana, a wing of the Ministry of Education and Culture, in 1958; the Research Library on African Affairs in June 1961; and the Ghana Film Corporation in 1964. In 1962, Nkrumah opened the Institute of African Studies.\nA campaign against nudity in the northern part of the country received special attention from Nkrumah, who reportedly deployed Propaganda Secretary Hannah Cudjoe to respond. Cudjoe also formed the Ghana Women's League, which advanced the Party's agenda on nutrition, raising children, and wearing clothing. The League also led a demonstration against the detonation of French nuclear weapons in the Sahara. Cudjoe was eventually demoted with the consolidation of national women's groups, and marginalized within the Party structure.\nLaws passed in 1959 and 1960 designated special positions in parliament to be held by women. Some women were promoted to the CPP Central Committee. Women attended more universities, took up more professions including medicine and law, and went on professional trips to Israel, the Soviet Union, and the Eastern Bloc. Women also entered the army and air force. Most women remained in agriculture and trade; some received assistance from the Co-operative Movement.\nNkrumah's image was widely disseminated, for example, on postage stamps and on money, in the style of monarchs \u2013 providing fodder for accusations of a Nkrumahist personality cult.\nMedia.\nIn 1957, Nkrumah created a well-funded Ghana News Agency to generate domestic news and disseminate it abroad. In ten years time the GNA had 8045\u00a0km of domestic telegraph line, and maintained stations in Lagos, Nairobi, London and New York City.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTo the true African journalist, his newspaper is a collective organiser, a collective instrument of mobilisation and a collective educator\u2014a weapon, first and foremost, to overthrow colonialism and imperialism and to assist total African independence and unity.\n\u2014 Kwame Nkrumah at the Second Conference of African Journalists; Accra, November 11, 1963\nNkrumah consolidated state control over newspapers, establishing the \"Ghanaian Times\" in 1958 and then in 1962 obtaining its competitor, the \"Daily Graphic\", from the Mirror Group of London. As he wrote in \"Africa Must Unite\": \"It is part of our revolutionary credo that within the competitive system of capitalism, the press cannot function in accordance with a strict regard for the sacredness of facts, and that the press, therefore, should not remain in private hands.\" Starting in 1960, he invoked the right of pre-publication censorship of all news.\nThe Gold Coast Broadcasting Service was established in 1954 and revamped as the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC). Many television broadcasts featured Nkrumah, commenting for example on the problematic \"insolence and laziness of boys and girls\". Before celebrations of May Day, 1963, Nkrumah went on television to announce the expansion of Ghana's Young Pioneers, the introduction of a National Pledge, the beginning of a National Flag salute in schools, and the creation of a National Training program to inculcate virtue and the spirit of service among Ghanaian youth. Nkrumah outlined his views on the role of Ghanaian television to Parliament on 15 October 1963 saying, \"Ghana's television will not cater for cheap entertainment or commercialism; its paramount objective will be education in its broadest and purest sense.\"\nAs per the 1965 Instrument of Incorporation of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting had \"powers of direction\" over the media, and the President had the power \"at any time, if he is satisfied that it is in the national interest to do so, take over the control and management of the affairs or any part of the functions of the Corporation,\" hiring, firing, reorganizing, and making other commands at will.\nRadio programmes, designed in part to reach non-reading members of the public, were a major focus of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation. In 1961, the GBC formed an external service broadcasting in English, French, Arabic, Swahili, Portuguese and Hausa. Using four 100-kilowatt transmitters and two 250-kilowatt transmitters, the GBC External Service broadcast 110 hours of Pan-Africanist programming to Africa and Europe each week.\nHe refused advertising in all media, beginning with the \"Evening News\" of 1948.\nEconomic policy.\nThe Gold Coast had been among the wealthiest and most socially advanced areas in Africa, with schools, railways, hospitals, social security, and an advanced economy.\nNkrumah attempted to rapidly industrialize Ghana's economy. He reasoned that if Ghana escaped the colonial trade system by reducing dependence on foreign capital, technology, and material goods, it could become truly independent.\nAfter the Ten Year Development Plan, Nkrumah brought forth the Second Development Plan in 1959. This plan called for the development of manufacturing: 600 factories producing 100 varieties of product.\nThe Statutory Corporations Act, passed in November 1959 and revised in 1961 and 1964, created the legal framework for public corporations, which included state enterprises. This law placed the country's major corporations under the direction of government ministers. The State Enterprises Secretariat office was located in Flagstaff House and under the direct control of the president.\nAfter visiting the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China in 1961, Nkrumah apparently became still more convinced of the need for state control of the economy.\nDuring Nkrumah's time in office, free health care and education were introduced.\nA Seven-Year Plan introduced in 1964 focused on further industrialization, emphasizing domestic substitutes for common imports, modernization of the building materials industry, machine making, electrification and electronics.\nEnergy projects.\nNkrumah's advocacy of industrial development, with help of longtime friend and Minister of Finance, Komla Agbeli Gbedema, led to the Volta River Project: the construction of a hydroelectric power plant, the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River in eastern Ghana. The Volta River Project was the centrepiece of Nkrumah's economic programme. On 20 February 1958, he told the National Assembly: \"It is my strong belief that the Volta River Project provides the quickest and most certain method of leading us towards economic independence.\" Ghana used assistance from the United States, Israel and the World Bank in constructing the dam.\nKaiser Aluminum agreed to build the dam for Nkrumah, but restricted what could be produced using the power generated. Nkrumah borrowed money to build the dam, and placed Ghana in debt. To finance the debt, he raised taxes on the cocoa farmers in the south. This accentuated regional differences and jealousy. The dam was completed and opened by Nkrumah amidst global publicity on 22 January 1966.\nNkrumah initiated the Ghana Nuclear Reactor Project in 1961, created the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission in 1963, and in 1964 laid the first stone in the building of an atomic energy facility.\nCocoa.\nIn 1954 the world price of cocoa rose from \u00a3150 to \u00a3450 per ton. Rather than allowing cocoa farmers to keep the windfall, Nkrumah appropriated the increased revenue via central government levies, then invested the capital into various national development projects. This policy alienated one of the major constituencies that helped him come to power.\nPrices continued to fluctuate. In 1960 one ton of cocoa sold for \u00a3250 in London. By August 1965 this price had dropped to \u00a391, one fifth of its value ten years before. The quick price decline caused the government's reliance on the reserves and forced farmers to take a portion of their earning in bonds.\nForeign and military policy.\nNkrumah actively promoted a policy of Pan-Africanism from the beginning of his presidency. This entailed the creation of a series of new international organizations, which held their inaugural meetings in Accra. These were:\nMeanwhile, Ghana withdrew from colonial organizations including West Africa Airways Corporation, the West African Currency Board, the West African Cocoa Research Institute and the West African Court of Appeal.\nIn the Year of Africa, 1960, Nkrumah negotiated the creation of a Union of African States, a political alliance between Ghana, Guinea, and Mali. Immediately, they formed a women's group called Women of the Union of African States.\nNkrumah was a leading figure in the short-lived Casablanca Group of African leaders, which sought to achieve pan-African unity and harmony through deep political, economic, and military integration of the continent in the early 1960s prior to the establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In 1961, he was a participant in the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, FPR Yugoslavia making Ghana one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nNkrumah was instrumental in the creation of the OAU in Addis Ababa in 1963. He aspired to create a united military force, the African High Command, which Ghana would substantially lead, and committed to this vision in Article 2 of the 1960 Republican Constitution:\"In the confident expectation of an early surrender of sovereignty to a union of African states and territories, the people now confer on Parliament the power to provide for the surrender of the whole or any part of the sovereignty of Ghana.\"\nHe was also a proponent of the United Nations, but critical of the Great Powers' ability to control it.\nNkrumah opposed the entry of African states into the Common Market of the European Economic Community, a status given to many former French colonies and considered by Nigeria. Instead, Nkrumah advocated, in a speech given on 7 April 1960,\nan African common market, a common currency area and the development of communications of all kinds to allow the free flow of goods and services. International capital can be attracted to such viable economic areas, but it would not be attracted to a divided and balkanized Africa, with each small region engaged in senseless and suicidal economic competition with its neighbours.\nNkrumah sought to exploit the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union in order to gain maximum concessions from both sides in their geopolitical attempts to outmanoeuvre one another in West Africa and elsewhere. This was exemplified by the Volta River Dam Project and its back-and-forth oscillation between Soviet and Western financial backing.\nArmed forces.\nIn 1956, the Gold Coast took control of the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF), Gold Coast Regiment, from the British War Office. This force had formerly been deployed to quell internal dissent, and occasionally to fight in wars: most recently, in World War II, against the Japanese in India and Burma. The most senior officers in this force were British, and, although training of African officers began in 1947, only 28 of 212 officers in December 1956 were indigenous Africans. The British officers still received British salaries, which vastly exceeded those allotted to their Ghanaian counterparts. Concerned about a possible military coup, Nkrumah delayed the placement of African officers in top leadership roles.\nNkrumah quickly established the Ghanaian Air Force, acquiring 14 \"Beaver\" airplanes from Canada and setting up a flight school with British instructors. \"Otters\", \"Caribou,\" and \"Chipmunks\" were to follow. Ghana also obtained four Ilyushin-18 aircraft from the Soviet Union. Preparation began in April 1959 with assistance from India and Israel. Nkrumah also established a gliding school led by Hanna Reitsch and J.E.S. de Graft-Hayford.\nThe Ghanaian Navy received two inshore minesweepers with 40mm and 20mm guns, the \"Afadzato\" and the \"Yogaga\", from Britain in December 1959. It subsequently received the \"Elmina\" and the \"Komenda\", seaward defence boats with 40-millimetre guns. The Navy's flagship, and training ship, was the \"Achimota\", a British yacht constructed during World War II. In 1961, the Navy ordered two 600-ton corvettes, the \"Keta\" and \"Kromantse,\" from Vosper &amp; Company and received them in 1967. It also procured four Soviet patrol boats. Naval officers were trained at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. The Ghanaian military budget rose each year, from $9.35 million (US dollars) in 1958 to $47 million in 1965.\nThe first international deployment of the Ghanaian armed forces was to the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville/Kinshasa), where Ghanaian troops were airlifted in 1960 at the beginning of the Congo Crisis. One week after Belgian troops occupied the lucrative mining province of Katanga, Ghana dispatched more than a thousand of its own troops to join a United Nations force. The use of British officers in this context was politically unacceptable, and this event occasioned a hasty transfer of officer positions to Ghanaians. The Congo war was long and difficult. On 19 January 1961 the Third Infantry Battalion mutinied. On 28 April 1961, 43 men were massacred in a surprise attack by the Congolese army.\nGhana also gave military support to rebels fighting against Ian Smith's white-minority government in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), which had unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965.\nRelationship with Communist world.\nIn 1961, Nkrumah went on tour through Eastern Europe, proclaiming solidarity with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Nkrumah's clothing changed to the Chinese-supplied Mao suit.\nIn 1962 Kwame Nkrumah was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union.\n1966 coup d'\u00e9tat.\nIn February 1966, while Nkrumah was on a state visit to North Vietnam and China, his government was overthrown in a violent \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" led by the national military and police forces, with backing from the civil service. The conspirators, led by Joseph Arthur Ankrah, named themselves the National Liberation Council and ruled as a military government for three years. Nkrumah did not learn of the coup until he arrived in China. After the coup, Nkrumah stayed in Beijing for four days, and Premier Zhou Enlai treated him with courtesy.\nNkrumah alluded to American involvement in the coup in his 1969 memoir, \"Dark Days in Ghana\"; he may have based this conclusion on documents shown to him by the KGB. In 1978 John Stockwell, former Chief of the Angola Task Force of the CIA turned critic, wrote that agents at the CIA's Accra station \"maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched\". Afterward, \"inside CIA headquarters the Accra station was given full, if unofficial credit for the eventual coup. ...None of this was adequately reflected in the agency's written records.\" Later that same year, Seymour Hersh, then at \"The New York Times\", defended Stockwell's account, citing \"first hand intelligence sources\". He claimed that \"many CIA operatives in Africa considered the agency's role in the overthrow of Dr.\u00a0Nkrumah to have been pivotal.\" These claims have never been verified.\nFollowing the coup, Ghana realigned itself internationally, cutting its close ties to Guinea and the Eastern Bloc, accepting a new friendship with the Western Bloc, and inviting the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to take a leading role in managing the economy. With this reversal, accentuated by the expulsion of immigrants and a new willingness to negotiate with apartheid South Africa, Ghana lost a good deal of its stature in the eyes of African nationalists.\nIn assessing Nkrumah's legacy, Edward Luttwak argued that he was undone by the growth of political consciousness and his inability to repress potential opponents:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nkrumah, in spite of his eccentricities, was largely defeated by his own success: the by-product of the considerable economic development achieved by Ghana was to stimulate and educate the masses and the new elite; their attitude to Nkrumah's regime became more and more critical in the light of the education the regime itself provided. When this happens, more and more repression and propaganda are needed to maintain political stability. In spite of considerable efforts, Nkrumah was unable to build a sufficiently ruthless police system. The cause of his downfall was not, therefore, the mismanagement of the economy\u2014which was considerable\u2014but rather the success of much of the development effort.\u2014\u200a\nExile and death.\nNkrumah died on 27 April 1972, in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, of an unknown but apparently incurable sickness. Since the coup, he had been living in the Guinean capital of Conakry, lying low.\nTributes and legacy.\nOver his lifetime, Nkrumah was awarded honorary doctorates by many universities including Lincoln University (Pennsylvania), Moscow State University (USSR), Cairo University (Egypt), Jagiellonian University (Poland), and Humboldt University (East Germany).\nIn 2000, he was voted African Man of the Millennium by listeners to the BBC World Service, being described by the BBC as a \"Hero of Independence\", and an \"International symbol of freedom as the leader of the first black African country to shake off the chains of colonial rule.\"\nAccording to intelligence documents released by the U.S. Department of State's Office of the Historian, \"Nkrumah was doing more to undermine [U.S. government] interests than any other black African.\"\nIn September 2009, President John Atta Mills declared 21 September (the 100th anniversary of Kwame Nkrumah's birth) to be Founders' Day, a statutory holiday in Ghana to celebrate the legacy of Kwame Nkrumah. In April 2019, President Akufo-Addo approved the Public Holidays (Amendment) Act 2019 which changed 21 September from Founders' Day to Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Day.\nNkrumah generally took a non-aligned Marxist perspective on economics, and believed capitalism had malignant effects that were going to stay with Africa for a long time. Although he was clear on distancing himself from the African socialism of many of his contemporaries, Nkrumah argued that socialism was the system that would best accommodate the changes that capitalism had brought, while still respecting African values. He specifically addresses these issues and his politics in a 1967 essay entitled \"African Socialism Revisited\":\nWe know that the traditional African society was founded on principles of egalitarianism. In its actual workings, however, it had various shortcomings. Its humanist impulse, nevertheless, is something that continues to urge us towards our all-African socialist reconstruction. We postulate each man to be an end in himself, not merely a means; and we accept the necessity of guaranteeing each man equal opportunities for his development. The implications of this for sociopolitical practice have to be worked out scientifically, and the necessary social and economic policies pursued with resolution. Any meaningful humanism must begin from egalitarianism and must lead to objectively chosen policies for safeguarding and sustaining egalitarianism. Hence, socialism. Hence, also, scientific socialism.\nNkrumah was also best-known politically for his strong commitment to and promotion of pan-Africanism. He was inspired by the writings of black intellectuals such as Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. Du Bois, and George Padmore, and his relationships with them. Much of his understanding and relationship to these men was created during his years in America as a student. Some would argue that his greatest inspiration was Marcus Garvey, although he also had a meaningful relationship with C. L. R. James. Nkrumah looked to these men to craft a general solution to the ills of Africa. To follow in these intellectual footsteps Nkrumah had intended to continue his education in London, but found himself involved in direct activism. Then, motivated by advice from Du Bois, Nkrumah decided to focus on creating peace in Africa. He became a passionate advocate of the \"African Personality\", embodied in the slogan \"Africa for the Africans\", earlier popularised by Edward Wilmot Blyden, and he viewed political independence as a prerequisite for economic independence. Nkrumah's dedications to pan-Africanism in action attracted these intellectuals to his Ghanaian projects. Many Americans, such as Du Bois and Kwame Ture, moved to Ghana to join him in his efforts. Du Bois and Ture are buried there today. His press officer for six years was the Grenadian anticolonialist Sam Morris. Nkrumah's biggest success in this area was his significant influence in the founding of the Organisation of African Unity.\nNkrumah also became a symbol for black liberation in the United States. When in 1958 the Harlem Lawyers Association had an event in Nkrumah's honour, diplomat Ralph Bunche told him:\nWe salute you, Kwame Nkrumah, not only because you are Prime Minister of Ghana, although this is cause enough. We salute you because you are a true and living representation of our hopes and ideals, of the determination we have to be accepted fully as equal beings, of the pride we have held and nurtured in our African origin, of the freedom of which we know we are capable, of the freedom in which we believe, of the dignity imperative to our stature as men.\nIn 1961, Nkrumah delivered a speech called \"I Speak Of Freedom\". During this speech he talked about how \"Africa could become one of the greatest forces for good in the world\". He mentions how Africa is a land of \"vast riches\" with mineral resources from that \"range from gold and diamonds to uranium and petroleum\". Nkrumah says that the reason Africa is not thriving right now is because the European powers have been taking all the wealth for themselves. If Africa could be independent of European rule, he said, then it could truly flourish and contribute positively to the world. In the ending words of this speech Nkrumah calls his people to action by saying \"This is our chance. We must act now. Tomorrow may be too late and the opportunity will have passed, and with it the hope of free Africa's survival\". This rallied the nation in a nationalistic movement.\nIn his honour, an annual event called \"Journey to Nkroful\" was set up to celebrate his birthday. Mausoleum and Museum at Nkroful, Western Region have been named after him that showcase some of the artifacts he used when alive.\nKwame Nkrumah Memorial Park &amp; Museum, Accra has been there to keep memory of him. Also, University of Science and Technology was changed to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology to recognise his support building a strong education system in the country.\nPersonal life.\nKwame Nkrumah married Fathia Ritzk, an Egyptian Coptic bank worker and former teacher, on the evening of her arrival in Ghana: New Year's Eve, 1957\u20131958. Fathia's mother refused to bless their marriage, after another one of her children left with a foreign husband.\nAs a married couple, Fathia and Nkrumah had three children: Gamal (born 1958), Samia (born 1960) and Sekou (born 1964). Gamal is a newspaper journalist, while Samia and Sekou are politicians. Nkrumah also has another son, Francis, a paediatrician (born 1935).\nCultural depictions.\nIn the 2010 book \"The Other Wes Moore,\" Nkrumah, during his time in the United States, is noted to have served as a mentor to the author's grandfather for several months upon the immigration of the author's family into the country.\nNkrumah is played by Danny Sapani in the Netflix television series \"The Crown\" (season 2, episode 8 \"Dear Mrs Kennedy\"). The show's portrayal of the historical significance of the Queen's visit to Ghana and dance with Nkrumah has been described as exaggerated in one source interviewing Nat Nuno-Amarteifio, later mayor of Accra, who was a teenage student at the time.\n\"African's Black Star: The Legacy of Kwame Nkrumah\" is a 2011 film about the rise and fall of this colonial rebellion leader.\nA golden statue of Nkrumah is a centrepiece in Ghanaian rapper Serious Klein's 2021 video \"Straight Outta Pandemic\".\nEven though the state film archive was ordered to be burned after the coup, Nkrumah's personal cameraman Chris Hesse was able to preserve 1300 rolls of film which weren't revealed to the public until he was in his 90s. Hesse's attempts to screen the footage publicly were made into a documentary film, \"The Eyes of Ghana\", that was produced by Barack and Michelle Obama and premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.\nWorks by Kwame Nkrumah.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The essence of neo-colonialism is that the State which is subject to it is, in theory, independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty.

{"id": "17063", "revid": "41631743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17063", "title": "Guanyin", "text": "East Asian interpretation of the bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara\nGuanyin () is a common Chinese name of the bodhisattva associated with compassion known as Avalokite\u015bvara (). Guanyin is short for Guanshiyin, which means \"[The One Who] Perceives the Sounds of the World\". Originally regarded as male in Indian Buddhism, Guanyin has been more commonly depicted as female in China and most of East Asia since about the 12th century. Due to sociogeographical factors, Guanyin may also be historically depicted as genderless or androgynous. On the 19th day of the sixth lunar month, Guanyin's attainment of Buddhahood is celebrated. Guanyin has been incorporated in other religions, including Taoism and Chinese folk religion.\nSome Buddhists believe that when one of their adherents departs from this world, they are placed by Guanyin in the heart of a lotus and then sent to the western pure land of Sukh\u0101vat\u012b. Guanyin is often referred to as the \"most widely beloved Buddhist Divinity\" with miraculous powers to assist all those who pray to her, as is mentioned in the universal gate chapter of the \"Lotus Sutra\" and the \"K\u0101ra\u1e47\u1e0davy\u016bha S\u016btra\".\nSeveral large temples in East Asia are dedicated to Guanyin, including Shaolin Monastery, Longxing Temple, Dule Temple, Puning Temple, Nanhai Guanyin Temple, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple, Shitenn\u014d-ji, Sens\u014d-ji, Kiyomizu-dera, Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, and many others. Guanyin's abode and bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da in India are recorded as being on Mount Potalaka. With the localization of the belief in Guanyin, each area adopted its own Potalaka. In Chinese Buddhism, Mount Putuo is considered the bodhima\u1e47\u1e0da of Guanyin. Naksansa is considered to be the Potalaka of Guanyin in Korea. Japan's Potalaka is located at Fudarakusan-ji. Tibet's is the Potala Palace. Vietnam's Potalaka is the H\u01b0\u01a1ng Temple.\nThere are several pilgrimage centers for Guanyin in East Asia. Putuoshan (Mount Putuo) is the main pilgrimage site in China. There is a 33-temple Guanyin pilgrimage in Korea, which includes Naksansa. In Japan, there are several pilgrimages associated with Guanyin. The oldest one of them is the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, a pilgrimage through 33 temples with Guanyin shrines. Guanyin is beloved by most Buddhist traditions in a nondenominational way and is found in most Tibetan temples under the name \"Chenr\u00e9zik\" ( Wylie: \"Spyan ras gzigs\"). Guanyin is also beloved and worshipped in the temples in Nepal. The Hiranya Varna Mahavihar, located in Patan, is one example. Guanyin is also found in some influential Theravada temples, such as Gangaramaya Temple, Kelaniya, and Natha Devale, near the Temple of the Tooth in Sri Lanka. Guanyin can also be found in Thailand's Temple of the Emerald Buddha, Wat Huay Pla Kang (where the huge statue of her is often mistakenly called the \"Big Buddha\"), and Myanmar's Shwedagon Pagoda. Statues of Guanyin are a widely depicted subject of Asian art and are found in the Asian art sections of most museums in the world.\nEtymology and usage.\nAvalokitasvara.\n\"Gu\u0101ny\u012bn\" is a translation from the Sanskrit \"Avalokitasvara\", the name of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na bodhisattva. Another name for this bodhisattva is \"Gu\u0101nz\u00ecz\u00e0i\" (), from Sanskrit \"Avalokite\u015bvara\". It was initially thought that early translators mistook \"Avalokite\u015bvara\" for \"Avalokitasvara\" and thus mistranslated \"Avalokite\u015bvara\" as \"Gu\u0101ny\u012bn\", which explained why Xuanzang translated \"Avalokite\u015bvara\" as \"Gu\u0101nz\u00ecz\u00e0i\". However, the original form was indeed \"Avalokitasvara\" which contained morpheme \"svara\" (\"sound, noise\") and was a compound meaning \"sound perceiver\", literally \"he who looks down upon sound\" (i.e., the cries of sentient beings who need help). This is the exact equivalent of the Chinese translation \"Gu\u0101ny\u012bn\". This etymology was furthered in the Chinese by the tendency of some Chinese translators, notably Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, to use the variant \"Gu\u0101nsh\u00ecy\u012bn\", literally \" One who perceives the world's lamentations\"\u2014wherein \"lok\" was read as simultaneously meaning both \"to look\" and \"world\" (Skt. \"loka\"; Ch. \u4e16, \"sh\u00ec\").\nDirect translations from the Sanskrit name \"Avalokitasvara\" include:\nAvalokite\u015bvara.\nThe name \"Avalokitasvara\" was later supplanted by the \"Avalokite\u015bvara\" form containing the ending \"-\u012b\u015bvara\", which does not occur in Sanskrit before the seventh century. The original form \"Avalokitasvara\" appears in Sanskrit fragments of the fifth century. The original meaning of the name \"Avalokitasvara\" fits the Buddhist understanding of the role of a bodhisattva.\nWhile some of those who revered \"Avalokite\u015bvara\" upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of any creator god, \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" does cite \"Avalokite\u015bvara\" as the creator god of the world. This position is taken in the widely used \"K\u0101ra\u1e47\u1e0davy\u016bha S\u016btra\" with its well-known mantra O\u1e43 ma\u1e47i padme h\u016b\u1e43. In addition, the Lotus Sutra is the first time the \"Avalokite\u015bvara\" is mentioned. Chapter 25 refers to him as \"Loke\u015bvara\" \"Lord God of all beings\" and \"Lokan\u0101tha\" \"Lord and Protector of all beings\" and ascribes extreme attributes of divinity to him.\nDirect translations from the Sanskrit name Avalokite\u015bvara include:\nNames in other Asian languages.\n Due to the devotional popularity of Guanyin in Asia, she is known by many names, most of which are simply the localised pronunciations of \"Guanyin\" or \"Guanshiyin\":\nIn these same countries, the variant \"Guanzizai\" \"Lord of Contemplation\" and its equivalents are also used, such as in the \"Heart Sutra\", among other sources.\nDepiction.\nLotus S\u016btra.\nThe \"Lotus S\u016btra\" (Sanskrit \"Saddharma Pu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bka S\u016btra\") is generally accepted to be the earliest literature teaching about the doctrines of Avalokite\u015bvara. These are found in the twenty fifth chapter of the Lotus S\u016btra. This chapter is devoted to Avalokitesvara, describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings, and who works tirelessly to help those who call upon his name. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Buddha answered Bodhisattva Ak\u1e63ayamati, saying: \u201cO son of a virtuous family! If innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of ko\u1e6dis of sentient beings who experience suffering hear of Bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara and wholeheartedly chant his name, Bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara will immediately perceive their voices and free them from their suffering\"\u2014\u200a\nThe \"Lotus Sutra\" describes Avalokite\u015bvara as a bodhisattva who can take the form of any type of god including Indra or Brahma; any type of Buddha, any type of king or Chakravartin or even any kind of Heavenly Guardian including Vajrapani and Vaisravana as well as any gender male or female, adult or child, human or non-human being, in order to teach the Dharma to sentient beings. Local traditions in China and other East Asian countries have added many distinctive characteristics and legends to Guanyin c.q. Avalokite\u015bvara. Avalokite\u015bvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva, and therefore wears chest-revealing clothing and may even sport a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists in the Far East, Guanyin is more often depicted as a woman in modern times. Additionally, some people believe that Guanyin is androgynous or perhaps without gender.\nA total of 33 different manifestations of Avalokitasvara are described, including female manifestations, all to suit the minds of various beings. Chapter 25 consists of both a prose and a verse section. This earliest source often circulates separately as its own s\u016btra, called the \"Avalokitasvara S\u016btra\" (Ch. ), and is commonly recited or chanted at Buddhist temples in East Asia. The \"Lotus Sutra\" and its thirty-three manifestations of Guanyin, of which seven are female manifestations, is known to have been very popular in Chinese Buddhism as early as in the Sui and Tang dynasties. Additionally, Tan Chung notes that according to the doctrines of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras themselves, it does not matter whether Guanyin is male, female, or genderless, as the ultimate reality is in emptiness (Skt. \"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\").\nIconography.\nRepresentations of the bodhisattva in China prior to the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) were masculine in appearance. Images which later displayed attributes of both genders are believed to be in accordance with the Lotus Sutra, where Avalokitesvara has the supernatural power of assuming any form required to relieve suffering, and also has the power to grant children. Because this bodhisattva is considered the personification of compassion and kindness, a mother goddess and patron of mothers and seamen, the representation in China was further interpreted in an all-female form around the 12th century. On occasion, Guanyin is also depicted holding an infant in order to further stress the relationship between the bodhisattva, maternity, and birth. In the modern period, Guanyin is most often represented as a beautiful, white-robed woman, a depiction which derives from the earlier \"Pandaravasini\" form.In some Buddhist temples and monasteries, Guanyin's image is occasionally that of a young man dressed in Northern Song Buddhist robes and seated gracefully. He is usually depicted looking or glancing down, symbolising that Guanyin continues to watch over the world.\nIn China, Guanyin is generally portrayed as a young woman wearing a flowing white robe, and usually also necklaces symbolic of Indian or Chinese royalty. In her left hand is a jar containing pure water, and the right holds a willow branch. The crown usually depicts the image of Amit\u0101bha.\nThere are also regional variations of Guanyin depictions. In Fujian, for example, a popular depiction of Guanyin is as a maiden dressed in Tang hanfu carrying a fish basket. A popular image of Guanyin as both Guanyin of the South Sea and Guanyin with a Fish Basket can be seen in late 16th-century Chinese encyclopedias and in prints that accompany the novel \"Golden Lotus\".\nIn Chinese art, Guanyin is often depicted either alone, standing atop a dragon, accompanied by a white cockatoo and flanked by two children or two warriors. The two children are her acolytes who came to her when she was meditating at Mount Putuo. The girl is called Longn\u00fc and the boy Shancai. The two warriors are the historical general Guan Yu from the late Han dynasty (deified and regarded as the Buddhist protector deity Qielan) and the bodhisattva Weituo. The Buddhist tradition also displays Guanyin, or other buddhas and bodhisattvas, flanked with the above-mentioned warriors, but as bodhisattvas who protect the temple and the faith itself. In Pure Land Buddhist traditions, Guanyin is often depicted and venerated with the Buddha Amitabha and the Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta as part of a trio collective called the \"Three Noble Ones of the West\" (Chinese: \u897f\u65b9\u4e09\u8056; Pinyin: X\u012bf\u0101ng s\u0101nsh\u00e8ng).\nIn Chinese mythology, Guanyin (\u89c0\u97f3) is the goddess of mercy and considered to be the physical embodiment of compassion. She is an all-seeing, all-hearing being who is called upon by worshipers in times of uncertainty, despair, and fear. Guanyin is originally based on the bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara. Avalokite\u015bvara's myth spread throughout China during the advent of Buddhism and mixed with local folklore in a process known as syncretism to become the modern day understanding of Guanyin.\nLocalization of Guanyin in East Asia.\nManifestations of Guanyin.\nThe twenty-fifth chapter of the Lotus Sutra, one of the most popular sacred texts in the Buddhist canon, describes thirty-three specific manifestations that Guanyin can assume to assist other beings seeking salvation. These forms encompass a Buddha, a pratyekabuddha, an arhat, King Brahma, Sakra (Indra), Isvara, Mahesvara (Shiva), a great heavenly general, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a, a Cakravartin, a minor king, an elder, a householder, a chief minister, a Brahmin, a bhikkhu, a bhikkhun\u012b, a Up\u0101saka, a Up\u0101sik\u0101, a wife, a young boy, a young girl, a deva, a n\u0101ga, a yaksha, a gandharva, an asura, a garu\u1e0da, a kinnara, a Mahoraga, a human, a non-human and Vajrapani. \nThe \u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama S\u016btra also mentions thirty-two manifestations of Guanyin, which follow closely those in the Lotus Sutra, with the omission of Vajrapani, and the substitution of Vai\u015brava\u1e47a (Heavenly King of the North) with the Four Heavenly Kings. These manifestations of Guanyin have been nativized in China and Japan to form a traditional list of iconographic forms corresponding to each manifestation.\nGuanyin is also venerated in various other forms. In the Chinese Tiantai and Tangmi and the Japanese Shingon and Tendai traditions, Guanyin can take on six forms, each corresponding to a particular realm of samsara. This grouping originates from the \"Mohe Zhiguan\" () written by the Tiantai patriarch Zhiyi (538\u2013597) and are attested to in various other textual sources, such as the Essential Record of The Efficacy of The Three Jewels (). They are:\nIn China, the Thousand-Armed manifestation of Guanyin is the most popular among her different esoteric forms. In the Karandavyuha Sutra, the Thousand-Armed and Thousand-Eyed Guanyin () is described as being superior to all gods and buddhas of the Indian pantheon. The Sutra also states that \"it is easier to count all the leaves of every tree of every forest and all the grains of sand in the universe than to count the blessings and power of Avalokiteshvara\". This version of Guanyin with a thousand arms depicting the power of all gods also shows various buddhas in the crown depicting the wisdom of all buddhas. In temples and monasteries in China, iconographic depictions of this manifestation of Guanyin is often combined with iconographic depiction of her Eleven-Headed manifestation to form statues with a thousand arms as well as eleven heads. The mantra associated with this manifestation, the N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b, is one of the most popular mantras commonly recited in East Asian Buddhism. In Chinese Buddhism, the popularity of the mantra influenced the creation of a repentance ceremony known as the \"Dabei Chan\" (, lit: \"Great Compassion Repentance\") during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) by the Tiantai monk Siming Zhili (), which is still regularly performed in modern Chinese Buddhist temples in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas Chinese communities.\nOne Chinese Buddhist legend from the \"Complete Tale of Guanyin and the Southern Seas\" () recounts how Guanyin almost emptied hell by reforming almost all of its denizens until sent out from there by the Ten Kings. Despite strenuous effort, she realised that there were still many unhappy beings yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, her head split into eleven pieces. The buddha Amit\u0101bha, upon seeing her plight, gave her eleven heads to help her hear the cries of those who are suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokite\u015bvara attempted to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that her two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amit\u0101bha came to her aid and appointed her a thousand arms to let her reach out to those in need. Many Himalayan versions of the tale include eight arms with which Avalokitesvara skillfully upholds the dharma, each possessing its own particular implement, while more Chinese-specific versions give varying accounts of this number. In Japan, statues of this nature can be found at the Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d temple of Kyoto.\nIn both Chinese Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism, Hayagriva Guanyin (lit.\u2009'Horse Headed Guanyin') is venerated as a guardian protector of travel and transportation, especially for cars. His statue is placed at the entrance and exits of some Chinese Buddhist temples to bless visitors. In certain Chinese Buddhist temples, visitors are also allowed to have their license plates enshrined in front of an image of this deity to invoke his protection over their vehicle. He is also counted as one of the 500 Arhats, where he is known as M\u01cet\u00f3u Z\u016bnzh\u011b \u99ac\u982d\u5c0a\u8005 (lit.\u2009'The Venerable Horse Head'). In Taoism, Hayagriva Guanyin was syncretized and incorporated within the Taoist pantheon as the god M\u01ce W\u00e1ng \u99ac\u738b (lit. Horse King), who is associated with fire. In this form, he is usually portrayed with six arms and a third eye on the forehead.\nGuanyin's Cund\u012b manifestation is an esoteric form of Guanyin that is venerated widely in China and Japan. The first textual source of Cund\u012b and the Cund\u012b Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b is the \"K\u0101ra\u1e47\u1e0davy\u016bhas\u016btra\", a s\u016btra centered around the bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara that introduced the popular mantra \"o\u1e43 ma\u1e47ipadme h\u016b\u1e43\". This text is first dated to around the late 4th century CE to the early 5th century CE. Cund\u012b and the Cund\u012b Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b are also featured in the Cund\u012b Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b S\u016btra, which was translated three times from Sanskrit into Chinese in the late 7th century and early 8th century by the Indian esoteric masters Div\u0101kara (685 CE), Vajrabodhi (723 CE), and Amoghavajra (8th century). In iconographic form, she is depicted with eighteen arms, all wielding different implements and weaponry that symbolize skillful means of the Dharma, sitting on a lotus flower. This manifestation is also referred to as the \"Mother of the Seventy Million [Buddhas]\" (Chinese: \u4e03\u4ff1\u80dd\u4f5b\u6bcd; pinyin: \"Q\u012bj\u00f9zh\u012b f\u00f3m\u01d4\"). Her mantra, the Mah\u0101cundi Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b (), is one of the Ten Small Mantras (), which is a collection of dharanis that are commonly recited in most Chinese Buddhist temples during morning liturgical services.\nGuanyin's Cint\u0101ma\u1e47icakra manifestation is also widely venerated in China and Japan. In iconographic form, this manifestation is often portrayed as having six arms, with his first right hand touches the cheek in a pensive mudra, his second right hand holds a wish granting jewel (cintamani), his third right hand holds prayer beads, his first left hand holds Mount Meru, his second left hand holds a lotus flower and the third left hand holds a Dharma wheel (cakra). Her mantra, the Cint\u0101ma\u1e47icakra Dharani (), is also one of the Ten Small Mantras.\nAnother common manifestation of Guanyin is the hungry ghost king Ulk\u0101mukha Pretar\u0101ja, popularly known in Chinese as \"Mianran Dashi\" (Chinese: \u9762\u71c3\u5927\u58eb, pinyin: \"Mi\u00e0nr\u00e1n\" \"D\u00e0sh\u00ec\", lit: \"Burning-Face Mah\u0101sattva\"). According to a s\u016btra, \u0100nanda, one of the Buddha's ten principal disciples, was once meditating in a forest at night when he encountered a ghost king named either \"Mianran\" (\u9762\u71c3, \"Mi\u00e0nr\u00e1n, lit:\" \"Burning Face\") or \"Yankou\" (\u71c4\u53e3, \"Y\u00e0nk\u01d2u\", lit: \"Flaming Mouth\") that warned him about his impending death and rebirth in the realm of hungry ghosts which would happen unless he was able to give one measure of food and drink the size of a bushel used in Magadha to each of the one hundred thousand \"nayutas\" of hungry ghosts and other beings. The encounter prompted \u0100nanda to beg \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha for a way to avert his fate, at which point the Buddha revealed a ritual and a dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b that he had been taught in a past life when he was a brahmin by the Bodhisattva Guanyin. According to the s\u016btra, the performance of the ritual would not only feed the hungry ghosts but would also ensure the longevity of the performing ritualist. The s\u016btra ends with \u0100nanda performing the rite according to the Buddha\u2019s instructions and avoiding the threat of rebirth into the realm of the hungry ghosts. Buddhist traditions hold that he eventually achieved longevity and attained the state of arhathood. Chinese Buddhist tradition regards the ghost king \"Mianran\" as an emanation of Guanyin herself, and suffixes his name with the title \"Dashi\" (Chinese: \u5927\u58eb, pinyin: \"D\u00e0sh\u00ec\"), meaning \"Mah\u0101sattva\". The account in this s\u016btra forms the basis for most ghost-feeding rituals in East Asian Buddhist traditions, and an effigy or statue of \"Mianran Dashi\" is typically enshrined during certain Chinese ghost-feeding rituals in particular as well as during festivals like the Zhongyuan Festival. Other than ghost-feeding rites, the s\u016btra's account was also influential in the development of universal salvation ceremonies such as the Chinese Buddhist Shuilu Fahui and Korean Buddhist Suryukjae. A painting of \"Mianran Dashi\" is typically among the many shuilu ritual paintings enshrined during the Chinese Shuilu Fahui in particular.\nIn China, it is said that fishermen used to pray to her to ensure safe voyages. The titles \"Guanyin of the Southern Ocean\" () and \"Guanyin (of/on) the Island\" stem from this tradition.\nMiaoshan.\nAnother story from the \"Precious Scroll of Fragrant Mountain\" () describes an incarnation of Guanyin as the daughter of a cruel king Miaozhuang Wang who wanted her to marry a wealthy but uncaring man. The story is usually ascribed to the research of the Buddhist monk Jiang Zhiqi during the 11th century. The story is likely to have its origin in Taoism. When Jiang penned the work, he believed that the Guanyin we know today was actually a princess called Miaoshan (), who had a religious following on Fragrant Mountain. Despite this there are many variants of the story in Chinese mythology.\nAccording to the story, after the king asked his daughter Miaoshan to marry the wealthy man, she told him that she would obey his command, so long as the marriage eased three misfortunes.\nThe king asked his daughter what were the three misfortunes that the marriage should ease. Miaoshan explained that the first misfortune the marriage should ease was the suffering people endure as they age. The second misfortune it should ease was the suffering people endure when they fall ill. The third misfortune it should ease was the suffering caused by death. If the marriage could not ease any of the above, then she would rather retire to a life of religion forever.\nWhen her father asked who could ease all the above, Miaoshan pointed out that a doctor was able to do all of these. Her father grew angry as he wanted her to marry a person of power and wealth, not a healer. He forced her into hard labour and reduced her food and drink but this did not cause her to yield.\nEvery day she begged to be able to enter a temple and become a nun instead of marrying. Her father eventually allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the monks to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to work all day and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, she was such a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.\nIn one version of this legend, when Guanyin was executed, a supernatural tiger took her to one of the more hell-like realms of the dead. However, instead of being punished like the other spirits of the dead, Guanyin played music, and flowers blossomed around her. This completely surprised the hell guardian. The story says that Guanyin, by merely being in that Naraka (hell), turned it into a paradise.\nA variant of the legend says that Miaoshan allowed herself to die at the hand of the executioner. According to this legend, as the executioner tried to carry out her father's orders, his axe shattered into a thousand pieces. He then tried a sword which likewise shattered. He tried to shoot Miaoshan down with arrows but they all veered off.\nFinally in desperation he used his hands. Miaoshan, realising the fate that the executioner would meet at her father's hand should she fail to let herself die, forgave the executioner for attempting to kill her. It is said that she voluntarily took on the massive karmic guilt the executioner generated for killing her, thus leaving him guiltless. It is because of this that she descended into the Hell-like realms. While there, she witnessed first-hand the suffering and horrors that the beings there must endure, and was overwhelmed with grief. Filled with compassion, she released all the good karma she had accumulated through her many lifetimes, thus freeing many suffering souls back into Heaven and Earth. In the process, that Hell-like realm became a paradise. It is said that Yama, the ruler of hell, sent her back to Earth to prevent the utter destruction of his realm, and that upon her return she appeared on Fragrant Mountain.\nAnother tale says that Miaoshan never died, but was in fact transported by a supernatural tiger, believed to be the Deity of the Mountain, to Fragrant Mountain.\nThe legend of Miaoshan usually ends with Miaozhuang Wang, Miaoshan's father, falling ill with jaundice. No physician was able to cure him. Then a monk appeared saying that the jaundice could be cured by making a medicine out of the arm and eye of one without anger. The monk further suggested that such a person could be found on Fragrant Mountain. When asked, Miaoshan willingly offered up her eyes and arms. Miaozhuang Wang was cured of his illness and went to the Fragrant Mountain to give thanks to the person. When he discovered that his own daughter had made the sacrifice, he begged for forgiveness. The story concludes with Miaoshan being transformed into the Thousand-Armed Guanyin, and the king, queen and her two sisters building a temple on the mountain for her. She began her journey to a pure land and was about to cross over into heaven when she heard a cry of suffering from the world below. She turned around and saw the massive suffering endured by the people of the world. Filled with compassion, she returned to Earth, vowing never to leave till such time as all suffering has ended.\nAfter her return to Earth, Guanyin was said to have stayed for a few years on the island of Mount Putuo where she practised meditation and helped the sailors and fishermen who got stranded. Guanyin is frequently worshipped as patron of sailors and fishermen due to this. She is said to frequently becalm the sea when boats are threatened with rocks. After some decades Guanyin returned to Fragrant Mountain to continue her meditation.\nGuanyin and Shancai.\nLegend has it that Shancai (also called \"Sudhana\" in Sanskrit) was a disabled boy from India who was very interested in studying the dharma. When he heard that there was a Buddhist teacher on the rocky island of Putuo, he quickly journeyed there to learn. Upon arriving at the island, he managed to find Guanyin despite his severe disability.\nGuanyin, after having a discussion with Shancai, decided to test the boy's resolve to fully study the Buddhist teachings. She conjured the illusion of three sword-wielding pirates running up the hill to attack her. Guanyin took off and dashed to the edge of a cliff, the three illusions still chasing her. Shancai, seeing that his teacher was in danger, hobbled uphill. Guanyin then jumped over the edge of the cliff, and soon after this the three bandits followed. Shancai, still wanting to save his teacher, managed to crawl his way over the cliff edge.\nShancai fell down the cliff but was halted in midair by Guanyin, who now asked him to walk. Shancai found that he could walk normally and that he was no longer crippled. When he looked into a pool of water he also discovered that he now had a very handsome face. From that day forth, Guanyin taught Shancai the entire dharma.\nGuanyin and Longn\u00fc.\nMany years after Shancai became a disciple of Guanyin, a distressing event happened in the South China Sea. The third son of one of the Dragon Kings was caught by a fisherman while swimming in the form of a fish. Being stuck on land, he was unable to transform back into his dragon form. His father, despite being a mighty Dragon King, was unable to do anything while his son was on land. Distressed, the son called out to all of Heaven and Earth.\nHearing this cry, Guanyin quickly sent Shancai to recover the fish and gave him all the money she had. The fish at this point was about to be sold in the market. It was causing quite a stir as it was alive hours after being caught. This drew a much larger crowd than usual at the market. Many people decided that this prodigious situation meant that eating the fish would grant them immortality, and so all present wanted to buy the fish. Soon a bidding war started, and Shancai was easily outbid.\nShancai begged the fish seller to spare the life of the fish. The crowd, now angry at someone so daring, was about to pry him away from the fish when Guanyin projected her voice from far away, saying \"A life should definitely belong to one who tries to save it, not one who tries to take it.\"\nThe crowd, realising their shameful actions and desire, dispersed. Shancai brought the fish back to Guanyin, who promptly returned it to the sea. There the fish transformed back to a dragon and returned home. Paintings of Guanyin today sometimes portray her holding a fish basket, which represents the aforementioned tale.\nAs a reward for Guanyin saving his son, the Dragon King sent his daughter, a girl called Longn\u00fc (\"dragon girl\"), to present Guanyin with the Pearl of Light. The Pearl of Light was a precious jewel owned by the Dragon King that constantly shone. Longn\u00fc, overwhelmed by the presence of Guanyin, asked to be her disciple so that she might study the dharma. Guanyin accepted her offer with just one request: that Longn\u00fc be the new owner of the Pearl of Light.\nIn popular iconography, Longn\u00fc and Shancai are often seen alongside Guanyin as two children. Longn\u00fc is seen either holding a bowl or an ingot, which represents the Pearl of Light, whereas Shancai is seen with palms joined and knees slightly bent to show that he was once crippled.\nGuanyin and the Filial Parrot.\nIn a story first dating to the Ming dynasty, a parrot becomes a disciple of Guanyin. Set during the prosperous Tang dynasty, the story focuses on a family of white parrots who nest in a tree. One young parrot in the family is especially intelligent, and can recite sutras, chant the name of Amit\u0101bha, and in some versions is even able to compose poetry. One day, the father parrot is killed by hunters. When the mother parrot goes to see what happened, she is blinded by the hunters. When the intelligent young parrot goes to find cherries (sometimes specified as lychees) to feed its mother, it is captured by the same hunters. By the time it escapes, its mother has died. After it has mourned the death of its mother and provided her with a proper funeral, the Earth God suggests that the parrot worship Guanyin. Guanyin, moved by the filial piety of the parrot, allows its parents to be reborn in the Pure Land. This story was told in the \"Tale of the Filial Parrot\" () and then retold in the later \"Precious Scroll of the Parrot\" ().\nIn popular iconography, the parrot is coloured white and usually seen hovering to the right side of Guanyin with either a pearl or a prayer bead clasped in its beak. The parrot became a symbol of filial piety.\nGuanyin and Chen Jinggu.\nChen Jinggu is said to be related to Guanyin via the following story. One day in Quanzhou, Fujian, the people needed money to build a bridge. Guanyin turned into an attractive lady and said she would marry any man who could hit her with silver. Many tried, and Guanyin was able to accumulate a lot of silver ingots through this process. Eventually one of the Eight Immortals, L\u00fc Dongbin, helped a merchant hit her hair with some silver.\nThe story continues with how Chen Jinggu grew up, studied at L\u00fcshan, and eventually saved Northern Fujian from drought while defeating the white demon snake, but at the cost of sacrificing her own child. It is said that she died of either miscarriage or hemorrhage from the self-abortion.\nParallels have also been argued between the tale of Chen Jinggu and another Fujian legend, the tale of \"Li Ji slays the Giant Serpent\".\nQuan \u00c2m Th\u1ecb K\u00ednh.\n\"Quan \u00c2m Th\u1ecb K\u00ednh\" () is a Vietnamese verse recounting the life of a woman, Th\u1ecb K\u00ednh. She was accused falsely of having intended to kill her husband, and when she disguised herself as a man to lead a religious life in a Buddhist temple, she was again falsely blamed for having committed sexual intercourse with a girl named Th\u1ecb M\u1ea7u. She was accused of impregnating her, which was strictly forbidden by Buddhist law. However, thanks to her endurance of all indignities and her spirit of self-sacrifice, she could enter into Nirvana and became Goddess of Mercy (Ph\u1eadt B\u00e0 Quan \u00c2m). P. Q. Phan's 2014 opera \"The Tale of Lady Th\u1ecb K\u00ednh\" is based on this story.\nOther manifestations of Guanyin.\nIn China, various native indigenous forms and aspects of Guanyin have been developed, along with associated legends, and portrayed in religious iconography. Aside from religious veneration, many of these manifestations also tended to appear in medieval and modern Chinese Buddhist miracle tales, fantasy fiction novels and plays. Some local forms include:\nSimilarly in Japan, several local manifestations of Guanyin, known there primarily as Kannon or, reflecting an older pronunciation, Kwannon, have also been developed natively, supplanting some Japanese deities, with some having been developed as late as the 20th century. Some local forms include:\nIn Tibet, Guanyin is revered under the name Chenrezig. Unlike much of other East Asia Buddhism where Guanyin is usually portrayed as female or androgynous, Chenrezig is revered in male form. While similarities of the female form of Guanyin with the female buddha or boddhisattva Tara are noted\u2014particularly the aspect of Tara called Green Tara\u2014Guanyin is rarely identified with Tara.\nThrough Guanyin's identity as Avalokitesvara, she is a part of the \"padmakula\" (Lotus family) of buddhas. The buddha of the Lotus family is Amit\u0101bha, whose consort is P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0darav\u0101sin\u012b. Guanyin's female form is sometimes said to have been inspired by P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0darav\u0101sin\u012b.\nRole in East Asian Buddhism.\nIn East Asian Buddhism, Guanyin is the bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara. Among the Chinese, Avalokite\u015bvara is almost exclusively called \"Guanshiyin Pusa\" (). The Chinese translation of many Buddhist sutras has in fact replaced the Chinese transliteration of Avalokitesvara with \"Guanshiyin\" (). \nIn Chinese culture, the popular belief and worship of Guanyin as a goddess by the populace is generally not viewed to be in conflict with the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara's nature. In fact the widespread worship of Guanyin as a \"Goddess of Mercy and Compassion\" is seen by Buddhists as the boundless salvific nature of bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara at work (in Buddhism, this is referred to as Guanyin's \"skillful means\", or upaya). The Buddhist canon states that bodhisattvas can assume whatsoever gender and form is needed to liberate beings from ignorance and dukkha. With specific reference to Avalokitesvara, he is stated both in the \"Lotus Sutra\" (Chapter 25 \"Perceiver of the World's Sounds\" or \"Universal Gateway\"), and the \"\u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama S\u016btra\" to have appeared before as a woman or a goddess to save beings from suffering and ignorance. His salvific power is emphasized in various Chinese Buddhist rituals, such as the tantric Yujia Yankou rite, where the monastic performing the rite practices deity yoga with Guanyin as the yidam in order to facilitate the ultimate liberation of hungry ghosts as well as prolonging the lifespans of the living and warding off disasters.\nGuanyin is immensely popular among Chinese Buddhists, especially those from devotional schools. She is generally seen as a source of unconditional love and, more importantly, as a saviour. In her bodhisattva vow, Guanyin promises to answer the cries and pleas of all sentient beings and to liberate them from their own karmic woes. Based on the Lotus Sutra and the Shurangama sutra, Avalokitesvara is generally seen as a saviour, both spiritually and physically. The sutras state that through his saving grace even those who have no chance of being enlightened can be enlightened, and those deep in negative karma can still find salvation through his compassion.\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, gender is no obstacle to attaining enlightenment (or nirvana). The Buddhist concept of non-duality applies here. The \"Vimalakirti Sutra\"'s \"Goddess\" chapter clearly illustrates an enlightened being who is also a female and deity. In the \"Lotus Sutra\", a maiden became enlightened in a very short time span. The view that Avalokite\u015bvara is also the goddess Guanyin does not seem contradictory to Buddhist beliefs. Guanyin has been a buddha called the \"Tath\u0101gata of Brightness of Correct Dharma\" ().\nIn Pure Land Buddhism, Guanyin is described as the \"Barque of Salvation\". Along with Amit\u0101bha and the bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta, she temporarily liberates beings out of the Wheel of Samsara into the Pure Land, where they will have the chance to accrue the necessary merit so as to be a Buddha in one lifetime. In Chinese Buddhist iconography, Guanyin is often depicted as meditating or sitting alongside one of the Buddhas and usually accompanied by another bodhisattva. The buddha and bodhisattva that are portrayed together with Guanyin usually follow whichever school of Buddhism they represent. In Pure Land Buddhism, for example, Guanyin is frequently depicted on the left of Amit\u0101bha, while on the buddha's right is Mahasthamaprapta. Temples that revere the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha usually depict him meditating beside Amit\u0101bha and Guanyin.\nEven among Chinese Buddhist schools that are non-devotional, Guanyin is still highly venerated. Instead of being seen as an active external force of unconditional love and salvation, the personage of Guanyin is highly revered as the principle of compassion, mercy and love. The act, thought and feeling of compassion and love is viewed as Guanyin. A merciful, compassionate, loving individual is said to be Guanyin. A meditative or contemplative state of being at peace with oneself and others is seen as Guanyin.\nIn the Mahayana canon, the \"Heart Sutra\" is ascribed entirely to Guanyin. This is unique, since most Mahayana Sutras are usually ascribed to Gautama Buddha and the teachings, deeds or vows of the bodhisattvas are described by Shakyamuni Buddha. In the \"Heart Sutra\", Guanyin describes to the arhat Sariputta the nature of reality and the essence of the Buddhist teachings. The famous Buddhist saying \"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form\" () comes from this sutra.\nAssociation with vegetarianism.\nDue to her symbolization of compassion, in East Asia, Guanyin is associated with vegetarianism. Buddhist cuisine is generally decorated with her image and she appears in most Buddhist vegetarian pamphlets and magazines. Also, there is a type of soil named after her that is known for its beneficial properties, such as preventing nausea and diarrhea. Chaoqi (Chinese: \u7092\u797a/\u7092\u7cb8) is a traditional Chinese snack, consisting of dough pieces cooked in Guanyin Soil. The ingredients for Chaoqi dough are flour, eggs, sugar, and salt. Traditionally, it is flavored with five-spice powder, pepper leaf, and sesame, but it can also be flavored with brown sugar and jujube. The snack was traditionally taken on long journeys, as the soil helps preserve the dough.\nRole in other Eastern religions.\nGuanyin is an extremely popular goddess in Chinese folk religion, Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. She is worshiped in many Chinese communities throughout East and Southeast Asia. In Taoism, records claim Guanyin was a Chinese woman who became an immortal, Cihang Zhenren in Shang dynasty or Xingyin (). Some Taoist scriptures give her the title of \"Guanyin Dashi\", sometimes informally \"Guanyin Fozu\".\nGuanyin is revered in the general Chinese population due to her unconditional love and compassion. She is generally regarded by many as the protector of women and children, perhaps due to iconographic confusion with images of Hariti. By this association, she is also seen as a fertility goddess capable of granting children to couples. An old Chinese superstition involves a woman who, wishing to have a child, offers a shoe to Guanyin. In Chinese culture, a borrowed shoe sometimes is used when a child is expected. After the child is born, the shoe is returned to its owner along with a new pair as a thank you gift.\nGuanyin is also seen as the champion of the unfortunate, the sick, the weak, the needy, the disabled, the poor, and those in trouble. Some coastal and river areas of China regard her as the protector of fishermen, sailors, and generally people who are out at sea, thus many have also come to believe that Mazu, the goddess of the sea, is a manifestation of Guanyin. Due to her association with the legend of the Great Flood, where she sent down a dog holding rice grains in its tail after the flood, she is worshiped as an agrarian and agriculture goddess. In some quarters, especially among business people and traders, she is looked upon as a goddess of fortune. In recent years there have been claims of her being the protector of air travelers.\nGuanyin is also a ubiquitous figure found within new religious movements of Asia:\nSimilarity to the Virgin Mary.\nSome Buddhist and Christian observers have commented on the similarity between Guanyin and Mary, mother of Jesus. This can be attributed to the representation of Guanyin holding a child in Chinese art and sculpture; it is believed that Guanyin is the patron saint of mothers and grants parents filial children, this apparition is popularly known as the \"Child-Sending Guanyin\" (). One example of this comparison can be found in Tzu Chi, a Taiwanese Buddhist humanitarian organisation, which noticed the similarity between this form of Guanyin and the Virgin Mary. The organisation commissioned a portrait of Guanyin holding a baby, closely resembling the typical Catholic Madonna and Child painting. Copies of this portrait are now displayed prominently in Tzu Chi affiliated medical centres, especially since Tzu Chi's founder is a Buddhist master and her supporters come from various religious backgrounds.\nDuring the Edo period in Japan, when Christianity was banned and punishable by death, some underground Christian groups venerated Jesus and the Virgin Mary by disguising them as statues of Kannon holding a child; such statues are known as \"Maria Kannon\". Many had a cross hidden in an inconspicuous location.\nIt is suggested the similarity comes from the conquest and colonization of the Philippines by Spain during the 16th century, when Asian cultures influenced engravings of the Virgin Mary, as evidenced, for example, in an ivory carving of the Virgin Mary by a Chinese carver.\nThe statue of Guanyin (Gwanse-eum) in Gilsangsa in Seoul, South Korea was sculpted by Catholic sculptor Choi Jong-tae, who modeled the statue after the Virgin Mary in hopes of fostering religious reconciliation in Korean society.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 2013 Buddhist film \"Avalokitesvara,\" tells the origins of Mount Putuo, the famous pilgrimage site for Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva in China. The motion picture was filmed onsite on Mount Putuo and featured several segments where monks chant the Heart Sutra in Chinese and Sanskrit. Egaku, the protagonist of the film, also chants the Heart Sutra in Japanese.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17064", "revid": "50226858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17064", "title": "Kangaroo", "text": "Marsupial of the family Macropodidae\nKangaroos are marsupials from the subfamily Macropodinae (macropods, meaning \"large foot\"). In common use, the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea. The Australian government estimates that 42.8\u00a0million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2\u00a0million in 2013.\nAs with the terms \"wallaroo\" and \"wallaby\", \"kangaroo\" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species. All three terms refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size. The largest species in the family are called \"kangaroos\" and the smallest are generally called \"wallabies\". The term \"wallaroos\" refers to species of an intermediate size. There are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod which inhabit the upper branches of trees in the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland, and some of the islands in the region. A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be:\nKangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.\nBecause of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.\nThe large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, while kangaroos are relatively plentiful, despite a common misconception to the contrary.\nThe kangaroo along with the koala are symbols of Australia. A kangaroo appears on the Australian coat of arms and on some of its currency, and is used as a logo for some of Australia's most well-known organisations, such as Qantas, and as the roundel of the Royal Australian Air Force. The kangaroo is important to both Australian culture and the national image, and consequently there are numerous popular culture references.\nWild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land. Kangaroo meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos.\nTerminology.\nThe word \"kangaroo\" derives from the Guugu Yimithirr word \"gangurru\", referring to eastern grey kangaroos. The name was first recorded as \"kanguru\" on 12 July 1770 in an entry in the diary of Sir Joseph Banks; this occurred at the site of modern Cooktown, on the banks of the Endeavour River, where under the command of Lieutenant James Cook was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained on the Great Barrier Reef. Cook first referred to kangaroos in his diary entry of 4 August. Guugu Yimithirr is the language of the people of the area.\nA common myth about the kangaroo's English name is that it was a Guugu Yimithirr phrase for \"I don't know\" or \"I don't understand\". According to this legend, Cook and Banks were exploring the area when they happened upon the animal. They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called. The local responded \"kangaroo\", said to mean \"I don't know/understand\", which Cook then took to be the name of the creature. Anthropologist Walter Roth was trying to correct this legend as far back as in 1898, but few took note until 1972 when linguist John B. Haviland in his research with the Guugu Yimithirr people was able to confirm that \"gangurru\" referred to a rare large dark-coloured species of kangaroo. However, when Phillip Parker King visited the Endeavour River region in 1819 and 1820, he maintained that the local word was not \"kangaroo\" but \"menuah\" perhaps referring to a different species of macropod. There are similar, more credible stories of naming confusion, such as with the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nKangaroos are often colloquially referred to as \"roos\". Male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers, jacks, or old men; females are does, flyers, or jills; and the young ones are joeys. The collective noun for a group of kangaroos is a mob, court, or troupe.\nTaxonomy and description.\nThere are four extant species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos:\nIn addition, there are about 50 smaller macropods closely related to the kangaroos in the family Macropodidae. Kangaroos and other macropods share a common ancestor with the Phalangeridae from the Middle Miocene. This ancestor was likely arboreal and lived in the canopies of the extensive forests that covered most of Australia at that time, when the climate was much wetter, and fed on leaves and stems. From the Late Miocene through the Pliocene and into the Pleistocene the climate got drier, which led to a decline of forests and expansion of grasslands. At this time, there was a radiation of macropodids characterised by enlarged body size and adaptation to the low quality grass diet with the development of foregut fermentation. The most numerous early macropods, the Balbaridae and the Bulungamayinae, became extinct in the Late Miocene around 5\u201310 mya. There is dispute over the relationships of the two groups to modern kangaroos and rat-kangaroos. Some argue that the balbarines were the ancestors of rat-kangaroos and the bulungamayines were the ancestors of kangaroos. while others hold the contrary view.\nThe middle to late bulungamayines, \"Ganguroo\" and \"Wanburoo\" lacked digit 1 of the hind foot and digits 2 and 3 were reduced and partly under the large digit 4, much like the modern kangaroo foot. This would indicate that they were bipedal. In addition, their ankle bones had an articulation that would have prohibited much lateral movements, an adaptation for bipedal hopping. Species related to the modern grey kangaroos and wallaroos begin to appear in the Pliocene. The red kangaroo appears to be the most recently evolved kangaroo, with its fossil record not going back beyond the Pleistocene era, 1\u20132 mya.\nThe first kangaroo to be exhibited in the Western world was an example shot by John Gore, an officer on Captain Cook's ship, HMS \"Endeavour\", in 1770. The animal was shot and its skin and skull transported back to England whereupon it was stuffed (by taxidermists who had never seen the animal before) and displayed to the general public as a curiosity. The first glimpse of a kangaroo for many 18th-century Britons was a painting by George Stubbs.\nComparison with wallabies.\nKangaroos and wallabies belong to the same taxonomic family (Macropodidae) and often the same genera, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the four largest species of the family. The term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or a wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise.\nBiology and behaviour.\nLocomotion.\nKangaroos are the only large mammals to use hopping on two legs as their primary means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about , but speeds of up to can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of for nearly . During a hop, the powerful gastrocnemius muscles lift the body off the ground while the smaller plantaris muscle, which attaches near the large fourth toe, is used for push-off. Seventy percent of potential energy is stored in the elastic tendons. At slow speeds, it employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Both pentapedal walking and fast hopping are energetically costly. Hopping at moderate speeds is the most energy efficient, and a kangaroo moving above maintains energy consistency more than similarly sized animals running at the same speed.\nKangaroos can attain considerable height when jumping, according to Guinness the highest recorded jump for a red kangaroo is about , whereas for the eastern grey kangaroo it is .\nDiet.\nKangaroos have single-chambered stomachs quite unlike those of cattle and sheep, which have four compartments. They sometimes regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. However, this is a different, more strenuous, activity than it is in ruminants, and does not take place as frequently.\nDifferent species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, and eats a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species such as the red kangaroo include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. Smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the hot days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.\nAbsence of digestive methane release.\nDespite having herbivorous diets similar to ruminants such as cattle, which release large quantities of digestive methane through exhaling and eructation (burping), kangaroos release virtually none. The hydrogen by-product of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy. Scientists are interested in the possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible for this process from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than carbon dioxide per molecule.\nSocial and sexual behaviour.\nGroups of kangaroos are called \"mobs\", \"courts\" or \"troupes\", which usually have 10 or more kangaroos in them. Living in mobs can provide protection for some of the weaker members of the group. The size and stability of mobs vary between geographic regions, with eastern Australia having larger and more stable aggregations than in arid areas farther west. Larger aggregations display high amounts of interactions and complex social structures, comparable to that of ungulates.\nOne common behaviour is nose touching and sniffing, which mostly occurs when an individual joins a group. The kangaroo performing the sniffing gains much information from smell cues. This behaviour enforces social cohesion without consequent aggression. During mutual sniffing, if one kangaroo is smaller, it will hold its body closer to the ground and its head will quiver, which serves as a possible form of submission. Greetings between males and females are common, with larger males being the most involved in meeting females. Most other non-antagonistic behaviour occurs between mothers and their young. Mother and young reinforce their bond through grooming. A mother will groom her young while it is suckling or after it is finished suckling. A joey will nuzzle its mother's pouch if it wants access to it.\nSexual activity of kangaroos consists of consort pairs. Oestrous females roam widely and attract the attention of males with conspicuous signals. A male will monitor a female and follow her every movement. He sniffs her urine to see if she is in oestrus, a process exhibiting the flehmen response. The male will then proceed to approach her slowly to avoid alarming her. If the female does not run away, the male will continue by licking, pawing, and scratching her, and copulation will follow. After copulation is over, the male will move on to another female. Consort pairing may take several days and the copulation is also long. Thus, a consort pair is likely to attract the attention of a rival male. As larger males are tending bonds with females near oestrus, smaller males will tend to females that are farther from oestrus. Dominant males can avoid having to sort through females to determine their reproductive status by searching for tending bonds held by the largest male they can displace without a fight.\nFighting has been described in all species of kangaroos. Fights between kangaroos can be brief or long and ritualised. In highly competitive situations, such as males fighting for access to oestrous females or at limited drinking spots, the fights are brief. Both sexes will fight for drinking spots, but long, ritualised fighting or \"boxing\" is largely done by males. Smaller males fight more often near females in oestrus, while the large males in consorts do not seem to get involved. Ritualised fights can arise suddenly when males are grazing together. However, most fights are preceded by two males scratching and grooming each other. One or both of them will adopt a high standing posture, with one male issuing a challenge by grasping the other male's neck with its forepaw. Sometimes, the challenge will be declined. Large males often reject challenges by smaller males. During fighting, the combatants adopt a high standing posture and paw at each other's heads, shoulders and chests. They will also lock forearms and wrestle and push each other as well as balance on their tails to kick each other in the abdomen.\nBrief fights are similar, except there is no forearm locking. The losing combatant seems to use kicking more often, perhaps to parry the thrusts of the eventual winner. A winner is decided when a kangaroo breaks off the fight and retreats. Winners are able to push their opponents backwards or down to the ground. They also seem to grasp their opponents when they break contact and push them away. The initiators of the fights are usually the winners. These fights may serve to establish dominance hierarchies among males, as winners of fights have been seen to displace their opponent from resting sites later in the day. Dominant males may also pull grass to intimidate subordinate ones.\nPredators.\nKangaroos have a few natural predators. The thylacine, considered by palaeontologists to have once been a major natural predator of the kangaroo, is now extinct. Other extinct predators included the marsupial lion, \"Megalania\" and \"Wonambi\". However, with the arrival of humans in Australia at least 50,000 years ago and the introduction of the dingo about 5,000 years ago, kangaroos have had to adapt.\nAlong with dingoes, introduced species such as foxes, feral cats, and both domestic and feral dogs, pose a threat to kangaroo populations. Kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if presented with the option. If pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it. Another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs.\nAdaptations.\nKangaroos have developed a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile country and highly variable climate. As with all marsupials, the young are born at a very early stage of development\u2014after a gestation of 31\u201336 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat. In comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be at about 7 weeks gestation (even in a modern intensive care unit, premature babies born at less than 23 weeks gestation are usually not mature enough to survive). When the joey is born, it is about the size of a lima bean. The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about 9 months (180\u2013320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.\nThe female kangaroo is usually pregnant in permanence, except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch. This is known as embryonic diapause and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the new-born and the older joey still in the pouch.\nUnusually, during a dry period, males will not produce sperm and females will conceive only if enough rain has fallen to produce a large quantity of green vegetation.\nKangaroos and wallabies have large, elastic tendons in their hind legs. They store elastic strain energy in the tendons of their large hind legs, providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort. This is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeletons through elastic elements such as tendons, but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos.\nThere is also a link between the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is expelled from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators\u2014the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries\u2014but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.\nNew research has revealed that a kangaroo's tail acts as a third leg rather than just a balancing strut. Kangaroos have a unique three-stage walk where they plant their front legs and tail first, then push off their tail, followed lastly by the back legs. The propulsive force of the tail is equal to that of both the front and hind legs combined and performs as much work as what a human leg walking can at the same speed.\nA DNA sequencing project of the genome of a member of the kangaroo family, the tammar wallaby, was started in 2004. It was a collaboration between Australia (mainly funded by the State of Victoria) and the National Institutes of Health in the US. The tammar's genome was fully sequenced in 2011.&lt;ref name=\"Renfree/Papenfuss\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics, because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: mice are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. The dairy industry could also benefit from this project.\nBlindness.\nEye disease is rare but not new among kangaroos. The first official report of kangaroo blindness took place in 1994, in central New South Wales. The following year, reports of blind kangaroos appeared in Victoria and South Australia. By 1996, the disease had spread \"across the desert to Western Australia\". Australian authorities were concerned the disease could spread to other livestock and possibly humans. Researchers at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories in Geelong detected a virus called the Wallal virus in two species of midges, believed to have been the carriers. Veterinarians also discovered fewer than 3% of kangaroos exposed to the virus developed blindness.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nKangaroo reproduction is similar to that of opossums. The egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the ovary into the uterus. There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. Even in the largest kangaroo species (the red kangaroo), the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. This is known as embryonic diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby (joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time. The lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by the species. Most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild.\nInteraction with humans.\nThe kangaroo has always been a very important animal for Aboriginal Australians, for its meat, hide, bone, and tendon. Kangaroo hides were also sometimes used for recreation; in particular there are accounts of some tribes (Kurnai) using stuffed kangaroo scrotum as a ball for the traditional football game of marngrook. In addition, there were important Dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo. Aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the Northern Territory.\nUnlike many of the smaller macropods, kangaroos have fared well since European settlement. European settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for sheep and cattle grazing, added stock watering points in arid areas, and have substantially reduced the number of dingoes. This overabundance has led to the view that the kangaroo is a pest animal as well as requiring regular culling and other forms of management. There is concern that the current management practices are leading to detrimental consequences for kangaroo welfare, landscape sustainability, biodiversity conservation, resilient agricultural production and Aboriginal health and culture.\nKangaroos are shy and retiring by nature, and in normal circumstances present no threat to humans. In 2003, Lulu, an eastern grey which had been hand-reared, saved a farmer's life by alerting family members to his location when he was injured by a falling tree branch. She received the RSPCA Australia National Animal Valour Award on 19 May 2004.\nThere are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation; however, several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies-like disease possibly affecting the marsupials. Only two reliably documented cases of a fatality from a kangaroo attack have occurred in Australia. The first attack occurred in New South Wales in 1936 when a hunter was killed as he tried to rescue his two dogs from a heated fray. The second attack was inflicted on a 77-year-old man from a domesticated kangaroo in Redmond, Western Australia in September 2022. Other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger. In July 2011, a male red kangaroo attacked a 94-year-old woman in her own backyard as well as her son and two police officers responding to the situation. The kangaroo was capsicum sprayed (pepper sprayed) and later put down after the attack.\nKangaroos, even those that are not domesticated, were observed using their gaze to communicate with humans, alternately looking at researchers and at a box of food, similarly to domestic dogs.\nCollisions with vehicles.\nNine out of ten animal collisions in Australia involve kangaroos. A collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise often leap in front of cars. Since kangaroos in mid-bound can reach speeds of around and are relatively heavy, the force of impact can be severe. Small vehicles may be destroyed, while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage. The risk of harm or death to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact. As a result, \"kangaroo crossing\" signs are commonplace in Australia.\nVehicles that frequent isolated roads, where roadside assistance may be scarce, are often fitted with \"roo bars\" to minimise damage caused by collision. Bonnet-mounted devices, designed to scare wildlife off the road with ultrasound and other methods, have been devised and marketed, but are ineffective.\nIf a female is the victim of a collision, animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey, in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for rehabilitation. Likewise, when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision, a vet, the RSPCA Australia or the National Parks and Wildlife Service can be consulted for instructions on proper care. In New South Wales, rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from WIRES. Council road signs often list phone numbers for callers to report injured animals.\nEmblems and popular culture.\nThe kangaroo is a recognisable symbol of Australia. The kangaroo and emu feature on the Australian coat of arms. Kangaroos have also been featured on coins, most notably the five kangaroos on the Australian one dollar coin. The Australian Made logo consists of a golden kangaroo in a green triangle to show that a product is grown or made in Australia.\nRegistered trademarks of early Australian companies using the kangaroo included Yung, Schollenberger &amp; Co. Walla Walla Brand leather and skins (1890); Arnold V. Henn (1892) whose emblem showed a family of kangaroos playing with a skipping rope; Robert Lascelles &amp; Co. linked the speed of the animal with its velocipedes (1896); while some overseas manufacturers, like that of \"The Kangaroo\" safety matches (made in Japan) of the early 1900s, also adopted the symbol. Even today, Australia's national airline, Qantas, uses a bounding kangaroo for its logo.\nThe kangaroo appears in Rudyard Kipling's \"Just So Stories\", \"The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo\", while the kangaroo is chased by a dingo, he gives Nqong the Big God's advice, that his legs and tail grew longest before five o'clock.\nThe kangaroo and wallaby feature predominantly in Australian sports teams names and mascots. Examples include the Australian national rugby league team (the Kangaroos) and the Australian national rugby union team (the Wallabies). In a nation-wide competition held in 1978 for the XII Commonwealth Games by the Games Australia Foundation Limited in 1982, Hugh Edwards' design was chosen; a simplified form of six thick stripes arranged in pairs extending from along the edges of a triangular centre represent both the kangaroo in full flight, and a stylised \"A\" for Australia.\nKangaroos are well represented in films, television, books, toys and souvenirs around the world. \"Skippy the Bush Kangaroo\" was a popular 1960s Australian children's television series about a fictional pet kangaroo. Kangaroos are featured in the Rolf Harris song \"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\" and several Christmas carols.\nMeat.\nThe kangaroo has been a source of food for indigenous Australians for tens of thousands of years. Kangaroo meat is high in protein and low in fat (about 2%). Kangaroo meat has a high concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) compared with other foods, and is a rich source of vitamins and minerals. Low fat diets rich in CLA have been studied for their potential in reducing obesity and atherosclerosis.\nKangaroo meat is sourced from wild animals and is seen by many as the best source of population control programs as opposed to culling them as pests where carcasses are left in paddocks. Kangaroos are harvested by licensed shooters in accordance with a code of practice and are protected by state and federal legislation.\nKangaroo meat is exported to many countries around the world. However, it is not considered biblically kosher by Jews or Adventists. It is considered halal according to Muslim dietary standards, because kangaroos are herbivorous.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is named after Soviet inventor and researcher of Armenian descent Semyon Kirlian, who, in 1939, accidentally discovered that if an object on a photographic plate is connected to a high-voltage source, an image is produced on the photographic plate.\nThe technique has been variously known as\n\"electrography\",\n\"electrophotography\",\n\"corona discharge photography\" (CDP),\n\"bioelectrography\",\n\"gas discharge visualization (GDV)\",\n\"electrophotonic imaging (EPI)\", and, in Russian literature, \"Kirlianography\".\nKirlian photography has been the subject of scientific research, parapsychology research, and art. Paranormal claims have been made about Kirlian photography, but these claims are rejected by the scientific community. To a large extent, it has been used in alternative medicine research.\nHistory.\nIn 1889, Czech Bartolom\u011bj Navr\u00e1til coined the word \"electrography\". Seven years later in 1896, a French experimenter, Hippolyte Baraduc, created electrographs of hands and leaves.\nIn 1898, Polish-Belarusian engineer Jakub Jodko-Narkiewicz demonstrated electrography at the fifth exhibition of the Russian Technical Society.\nIn 1939, two Czechs, S. Pratt and J. Schlemmer, published photographs showing a glow around leaves. The same year, Soviet electrical engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina developed Kirlian photography after observing a patient in Krasnodar Hospital who was receiving medical treatment from a high-frequency electrical generator. They had noticed that when the electrodes were brought near the patient's skin, there was a glow similar to that of a neon discharge tube.\nThe Kirlians conducted experiments in which photographic film was placed on top of a conducting plate, and another conductor was attached to a hand, a leaf or other plant material. The conductors were energized by a high-frequency high-voltage power source, producing photographic images typically showing a silhouette of the object surrounded by an aura of light.\nIn 1958, the Kirlians reported the results of their experiments for the first time. Their work was virtually unknown until 1970, when two Americans, Lynn Schroeder and Sheila Ostrander, published a book, \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain\". High-voltage electrophotography soon became known to the general public as Kirlian photography. Although little interest was generated among western scientists, Russians held a conference on the subject in 1972 at Kazakh State University.\nKirlian photography was used in the former Eastern Bloc in the 1970s. The corona discharge glow at the surface of an object subjected to a high-voltage electrical field was referred to as a \"Kirlian aura\" in Russia and Eastern Europe. In 1975, soviet scientist Victor Adamenko wrote a dissertation titled \"Research of the structure of High-frequency electric discharge (Kirlian effect) images\". Scientific study of what the researchers called the Kirlian effect was conducted by Victor Inyushin at Kazakh State University.\nEarly in the 1970s, Thelma Moss and Kendall Johnson at the Center for Health Sciences at the UCLA conducted extensive research into Kirlian photography. Moss led an independent and unsupported parapsychology laboratory that was shut down by the university in 1979.\nOverview.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nTypical Kirlian photography setup (cross-section) \nKirlian photography is a technique for creating contact print photographs using high voltage. The process entails placing sheet photographic film on top of a metal discharge plate. The object to be photographed is then placed directly on top of the film. High voltage current is momentarily applied to the object, thus creating an exposure. The corona discharge between the object and the plate due to high-voltage is captured by the film. The developed film results in a Kirlian photograph of the object.\nColor photographic film is calibrated to produce faithful colors when exposed to normal light. Corona discharges can interact with minute variations in the different layers of dye used in the film, resulting in a wide variety of colors depending on the local intensity of the discharge. Film and digital imaging techniques also record light produced by photons emitted during corona discharge (see Mechanism of corona discharge).\nPhotographs of inanimate objects such as a coins, keys and leaves can be made more effectively by grounding the object to the earth, a cold water pipe or to the opposite (polarity) side of the high-voltage source. Grounding the object creates a stronger corona discharge.\nKirlian photography does not require the use of a camera or a lens because it is a contact print process. It is possible to use a transparent electrode in place of the high-voltage discharge plate, for capturing the resulting corona discharge with a standard photo or video camera.\nVisual artists such as Robert Buelteman, Ted Hiebert, and Dick Lane have used Kirlian photography to produce artistic images of a variety of subjects.\nResearch.\nKirlian photography has been a subject of scientific research, parapsychology research and pseudoscientific claims.\nScientific research.\nResults of scientific experiments published in 1976 involving Kirlian photography of living tissue (human finger tips) showed that most of the variations in corona discharge streamer length, density, curvature, and color can be accounted for by the moisture content on the surface of and within the living tissue. \nKonstantin Korotkov developed a technique similar to Kirlian photography called \"gas discharge visualization\" (GDV). Korotkov's GDV camera system consists of hardware and software to directly record, process and interpret GDV images with a computer. Korotkov promotes the device and research in a medical context. Izabela Ciesielska at the Institute of Architecture of Textiles in Poland used Korotkov's GDV camera to evaluate the effects of human contact with various textiles on biological factors such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as corona discharge images. The experiments captured corona discharge images of subjects' fingertips while the subjects wore sleeves of various natural and synthetic materials on their forearms. The results failed to establish a relationship between human contact with the textiles and the corona discharge images and were considered inconclusive.\nParapsychology research.\nIn 1968, Thelma Moss, a psychology professor, headed University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)'s Neuropsychiatric Institute (NPI), which was later renamed the Semel Institute. The NPI had a laboratory dedicated to parapsychology research and staffed mostly with volunteers. The lab was unfunded, unsanctioned and eventually shut down by the university. Toward the end of her tenure at UCLA, Moss became interested in Kirlian photography, a technique that supposedly measured the \"auras\" of a living being. According to Kerry Gaynor, one of her former research assistants, \"many felt Kirlian photography's effects were just a natural occurrence.\"\nParanormal claims of Kirlian photography have not been observed or replicated in experiments by the scientific community. The physiologist Gordon Stein has written that Kirlian photography is a hoax that has \"nothing to do with health, vitality, or mood of a subject photographed.\"\nClaims.\nKirlian believed that images created by Kirlian photography might depict a conjectural energy field, or aura, thought, by some, to surround living things. Kirlian and his wife were convinced that their images showed a life force or energy field that reflected the physical and emotional states of their living subjects. They thought that these images could be used to diagnose illnesses. In 1961, they published their first article on the subject in the Russian \"Journal of Scientific and Applied Photography\". Kirlian's claims were embraced by energy treatments practitioners.\nTorn leaf experiment.\nA typical demonstration used as evidence for the existence of these energy fields involved taking Kirlian photographs of a picked leaf at set intervals. The gradual withering of the leaf was thought to correspond with a decline in the strength of the aura. In some experiments, if a section of a leaf was torn away after the first photograph, a faint image of the missing section sometimes remains when a second photograph was taken. However, if the imaging surface is cleaned of contaminants and residual moisture before the second image is taken, then no image of the missing section will appear.\nThe living aura theory is at least partially repudiated by demonstrating that leaf moisture content has a pronounced effect on the electric discharge coronas; more moisture creates larger corona discharges. As the leaf dehydrates, the coronas will naturally decrease in variability and intensity. As a result, the changing water content of the leaf can affect the so-called Kirlian aura. Kirlian's experiments did not provide evidence for an energy field other than the electric fields produced by chemical processes and the streaming process of coronal discharges.\nThe coronal discharges identified as Kirlian auras are the result of stochastic electric ionization processes and are greatly affected by many factors, including the voltage and frequency of the stimulus, the pressure with which a person or object touches the imaging surface, the local humidity around the object being imaged, how well grounded the person or object is, and other local factors affecting the conductivity of the person or object being imaged. Oils, sweat, bacteria, and other ionizing contaminants found on living tissues can also affect the resulting images.\nQi.\nScientists such as Beverly Rubik have explored the idea of a human biofield using Kirlian photography research, attempting to explain the Chinese discipline of Qigong. Qigong teaches that there is a vitalistic energy called qi (or chi) that permeates all living things.\nRubik's experiments relied on Konstantin Korotkov's GDV device to produce images, which were thought to visualize these qi biofields in chronically ill patients. Rubik acknowledges that the small sample size in her experiments \"was too small to permit a meaningful statistical analysis\". Claims that these energies can be captured by special photographic equipment are criticized by skeptics.\nIn popular culture.\nKirlian photography has appeared as a fictional element in numerous books, films, television series, and media productions, including the 1975 film \"The Kirlian Force\", re-released under the more sensational title \"Psychic Killer\". Kirlian photographs have been used as visual components in various media, such as the sleeve of George Harrison's 1973 album \"Living in the Material World\", which features Kirlian photographs of his hand holding a Hindu medallion on the front sleeve and American coins on the back, shot at Thelma Moss's UCLA parapsychology laboratory.\n\"Multiplanar Kirlian emanations\" are referenced in the 1989 film \"Ghostbusters II\", during a scene where Ray Stantz and Egon Spengler are conducting a spectral analysis of photographs taken of a portrait painting, which is possessed by the malevolent spirit of medieval tyrant Vigo the Carpathian.\nThe artwork of David Bowie's 1997 album \"Earthling\" has reproductions of Kirlian photographs taken by Bowie. The photographs, which show a crucifix Bowie wore around his neck and the imprint of his \"forefinger\" tip, date to April 1975 when Bowie was living in Los Angeles and fascinated with the paranormal. The photographs were taken before consuming cocaine and 30 minutes afterwards. The after photograph apparently shows a substantial increase in the \"aura\" around the crucifix and forefinger.\nThe \"Cluster\" novels by science fiction author Piers Anthony uses the concept of the Kirlian Aura as a way to transfer a person's personality into another body, even an alien body, across light years. The book \"The Anarchistic Colossus\" (1977) by A. E. van Vogt involves an anarchistic society controlled by \u2018Kirlian computers\u2019.\nThe opening credits during the first seven seasons of the television series \"The X-Files\" shows a Kirlian image of a left human hand. The image appears as the 11th clip in the introductory video montage and is formed by a bluish coronal discharge as the primary outline, with only the proximal phalange of the index finger shown cryptically in red. A human silhouette, in white, seemingly falls towards the hand.\nThe Italian electronic darkwave band Kirlian Camera was named after the device used for Kirlian photography.\nBritish industrial band Cabaret Voltaire's first album Mix-Up features a track called Kirlian Photograph.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The island is separated from Turkey by the Chios Strait. Chios is notable for its exports of mastic gum and its nickname is \"the Mastic Island\". Tourist attractions include its medieval villages and the 11th-century monastery of Nea Moni, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nAdministratively, the island forms a separate municipality within the Chios regional unit, which is part of the North Aegean region. The principal town of the island and seat of the municipality is Chios. Locals refer to Chios town as \"Chora\" ( literally means land or country, but usually refers to the capital or a settlement at the highest point of a Greek island).\nThe island was also the site of the Chios massacre, in which tens of thousands of Greeks on the island were massacred, expelled, and enslaved by Ottoman troops during the Greek War of Independence in 1822. Chios remained a part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912.\nGeography.\nChios island is crescent or kidney-shaped, long from north to south, and at its widest, covering an area of . The terrain is mountainous and arid, with a ridge of mountains running the length of the island. The two largest of these mountains, Pelineon () and Epos (), are situated in the north of the island. The center of the island is divided between east and west by a range of smaller peaks, known as Provatas.\nRegions.\nChios can be divided into five regions.\nEast coast.\nMidway up the east coast lie the main population centers, the main town of Chios, and the regions of Vrontados and Kambos. Chios Town, with a population of 32,400, is built around the island's main harbour and medieval castle. The current castle, with a perimeter of , was principally constructed during the time of Genoese and Ottoman rule, although remains have been found dating settlements there back to 2000 B.C. The town was substantially damaged by an earthquake in 1881, and only partially retains its original character.\nNorth of Chios Town lies the large suburb of Vrontados (population 4,500), which claims to be the birthplace of Homer. The suburb lies in the Omiroupoli municipality, and its connection to the poet is supported by an archaeological site known traditionally as \"Teacher's Rock\".\nSouthern region (Mastichoch\u00f3ria).\nIn the southern region of the island are the (literally 'mastic villages'), the seven villages of Mesta (), Pyrgi (), Olympi (), Kalamoti (), Vessa (), Lithi (), and Elata (), which together have controlled the production of mastic gum in the area since the Roman period. The villages, built between the 14th and 16th centuries, have a carefully designed layout with fortified gates and narrow streets to protect against the frequent raids by marauding pirates. Between Chios Town and the Mastichochoria lie a large number of historic villages including Armolia (), Myrmighi (), and Kalimassia (). Along the east coast are the fishing villages of Kataraktis () and to the south, Nenita ().\nInterior.\nDirectly in the centre of the island, between the villages of Avgonyma to the west and Karyes to the east, is the 11th century monastery of Nea Moni, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The monastery was built with funds given by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX, after three monks, living in caves nearby, had petitioned him while he was in exile on the island of Lesbos. The monastery had substantial estates attached, with a thriving community until the massacre of 1822. It was further damaged during the 1881 earthquake. In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a convent.\nClimate.\nThe island's climate is warm and moderate, categorised as temperate, Mediterranean (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"), with modest variation due to the stabilising effect of the surrounding sea. Average temperatures normally range from a summer high of to a winter low of in January, although temperatures of over or below freezing can sometimes be encountered.\nThe island normally experiences steady breezes (average ) throughout the year, with wind direction predominantly northerly (\"Etesian\" Wind\u2014locally called the \"Meltemi\") or southwesterly (Sirocco).\nGeology.\nThe Chios Basin is a hydrographic sub-unit of the Aegean Sea adjacent to the island of Chios. A kind of white dirt found near Pyrgi on the southern part of the island was famed as an astringent and cosmetic since antiquity as Chian earth (; , \"p\u0113lomaiotiko\"). Extracted around May each year, it was considered less valuable than the similar medicinal earth produced by Lemnos given that the Limnian earth was considered protective against venoms and poisons but nonetheless reputed to be \"the greatest of all cosmetics... giv[ing] a whiteness and smoothness to the skin and prevent[ing] wrinkles beyond any of the other substances... for the same purposes.\"\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe ancient writer Pausanias tells us that the poet Ion of Chios believed the island received its name from \"Chios\", the son of Poseidon by a nymph of the island, who was born amidst snowfall ( 'snow'). Other ancient authors attributed the name to a nymph called Chione. Known as Ophioussa (, 'snake island') and Pityoussa (, 'pine-tree island') in antiquity, during the later Middle Ages the island was ruled by a number of non-Greek powers and was known as (Genoese), (Italian) and ( in Ottoman Turkish). The capital during that time was Kastron (, 'castle').\nPrehistoric period.\nArchaeological research on Chios has found evidence of habitation dating back at least to the Neolithic era. The primary sites of research for this period have been cave dwellings at Hagio(n) Galas in the north and a settlement and accompanying necropolis in modern-day Emporeio (also known as Emporio) at the far south of the island. Scholars lack information on this period. The size and duration of these settlements have therefore not been well-established.\nThe British School at Athens under the direction of Sinclair Hood excavated the Emporeio site in 1952\u20131955, and most current information comes from these digs. The Greek Archaeological Service has also been excavating periodically on Chios since 1970, though much of its work on the island remains unpublished.\nThe noticeable uniformity in the size of houses at Emporeio leads some scholars to believe that there may have been little social distinction during the Neolithic era on the island. The inhabitants apparently all benefited from agricultural and livestock farming.\nIt is also widely held by scholars that the island was not occupied by humans during the Middle Bronze Age (2300\u20131600), though researchers have recently suggested that the lack of evidence from this period may only demonstrate the lack of excavations on Chios and the northern Aegean.\nBy at least the 11th century BC the island was ruled by a monarchy, and the subsequent transition to aristocratic (or possibly tyrannic) rule occurred sometime over the next four centuries. Future excavations may reveal more information about this period. 9th-century Euboean and Cypriote presence on the island is attested by ceramics, while a Phoenician presence is noted at Erythrae, the traditional competitor of Chios on the mainland.\nArchaic and Classical periods.\nPherecydes, native to the Aegean, wrote that the island was occupied by the Leleges, Pre-Greeks who were reported to be subjected to the Minoans on Crete. They were eventually driven out by invading Ionians.\nChios was one of the original twelve member states of the Ionian League. As a result, Chios, at the end of the 7th century BC, was one of the first cities to strike or mint coins, establishing the sphinx as its symbol. It maintained this tradition for almost 900 years.\nIn the 6th century BC, Chios' government adopted a constitution similar to that developed by Solon in Athens and later developed democratic elements with a voting assembly and people's magistrates called \"damarchoi\".\nIn 546 BC, Chios was subjected to the Persian Empire. Chios joined the Ionian Revolt against the Persians in 499 BC. The naval power of Chios during this period is demonstrated by the fact that the Chians had the largest fleet (100 ships) of all of the Ionians at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC. At Lade, the Chian fleet doggedly continued to fight the Persian fleet even after the defection of the Samians and others, but the Chians were ultimately forced to retreat and were again subjected to Persian domination.\nThe defeat of Persia at the Battle of Mycale in 479 BC meant the liberation of Chios from Persian rule. When the Athenians formed the Delian League, Chios joined as one of the few members who did not have to pay tribute but who supplied ships to the alliance.\nBy the fifth to fourth centuries BC, the island had grown to an estimated population of over 120,000 (two to three times the estimated population in 2005), based on the huge necropolis at the main city of Chios. It is thought that the majority of the population lived in that area.\nIn 412 BC, during the Peloponnesian War, Chios revolted against Athens, and the Athenians besieged it. Relief only came the following year when the Spartans were able to raise the siege. In the 4th century BC, Chios was a member of the Second Athenian League but revolted against Athens during the Social War (357\u2013355 BC), and Chios became independent again until the rise of Macedonia.\nHellenistic period.\nTheopompus returned to Chios with the other exiles in 333 BC after Alexander had invaded Asia Minor and decreed their return, as well as the exile or trial of Persian supporters on the island. Theopompus was exiled again sometime after Alexander's death and took refuge in Egypt.\nDuring this period, the island also had become the largest exporter of Greek wine, which was noted for being of relatively high quality (see \"Chian wine\"). Chian amphoras, with a characteristic sphinx emblem and bunches of grapes, have been found in nearly every country with whom the ancient Greeks traded. These countries included Gaul, Upper Egypt, and Southern Russia.\nRoman period.\nDuring the Third Macedonian War, thirty-five vessels allied to Rome, carrying about 1,000 Galatian troops, as well as a number of horses, were sent by Eumenes II to his brother Attalus. Leaving from Elaea, they were headed to the harbour of Phanae, planning to disembark from there to Macedonia. However, Perseus's naval commander Antenor intercepted the fleet between Erythrae (on the Western coast of Turkey) and Chios. According to Livy, they were caught completely off-guard by Antenor. Eumenes' officers at first thought the intercepting fleet were friendly Romans, but scattered upon realizing they were facing an attack by their Macedonian enemy, some choosing to abandon ship and swim to Erythrae. Others, crashing their ships into land on Chios, fled toward the city. The Chians however closed their gates, startled at the calamity. And the Macedonians, who had docked closer to the city anyway, cut the rest of the fleet off outside the city gates, and on the road leading to the city. Of the 1,000 men, 800 were killed, 200 taken prisoner.'\nAfter the Roman conquest Chios became part of the province of Asia.\nIn the spring of 14 BC, King Herod of Judaea, known for his extensive architectural projects, funded the construction of a stoa on Chios, which had suffered destruction during the Mithridatic War. Additionally, he settled the outstanding taxes owed by the people of Chios to the Romans.\nPliny remarks upon the islanders' use of variegated marble in their buildings, their appreciation for such stone above murals or other forms of artificial decoration, and the cosmetic properties of the local earth. The marble from Chios, called \"marmor chium\" or \"portasanta\" today, became one of the most desirable and expensive in the Roman world and later. It has a pinkish coloured background containing yellow-orange, brown and grey spots of variable shape and size, separated by whitish or red veins. The name \"portasanta\" derives from the door jambs of St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, being made of this marble.\nAccording to the Acts of the Apostles, Luke the Evangelist, Paul the Apostle and their companions passed Chios during Paul's third missionary journey, on a passage from Lesbos to Samos.\nByzantine period.\nAfter the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, Chios was for seven centuries part of the Byzantine Empire. This came to an end when the island was briefly held (1090\u201397) by Tzachas, a Turkish bey in the region of Smyrna during the first expansion of the Turks to the Aegean coast. However, the Turks were driven back from the Aegean coast by the Byzantines aided by the First Crusade, and the island was restored to Byzantine rule by admiral Constantine Dalassenos.\nThis relative stability was ended by the sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade (1204) and during the turmoil of the 13th century the island's ownership was constantly affected by the regional power struggles. After the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine empire was divided up by the Latin emperors of Constantinople, with Chios nominally becoming a possession of the Republic of Venice. However, defeats for the Latin empire resulted in the island reverting to Byzantine rule in 1225.\nGenoese period (1304\u20131566).\nThe Byzantine rulers had little influence and through the Treaty of Nymphaeum, authority was ceded to the Republic of Genoa (1261). At this time the island was frequently attacked by pirates, and by 1302\u20131303 was a target for the renewed Turkish fleets. To prevent Turkish expansion, the island was reconquered and kept as a renewable concession, at the behest of the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus, by the Genovese Benedetto I Zaccaria (1304), then admiral to Philip of France. Zaccaria installed himself as ruler of the island, founding the short-lived Lordship of Chios. His rule was benign and effective control remained in the hands of the local Greek landowners. Benedetto Zacharia was followed by his son Paleologo and then his grandsons or nephews Benedetto II and Martino. They attempted to turn the island towards the Latin and Papal powers, and away from the predominant Byzantine influence. The locals, still loyal to the Byzantine Empire, responded to a letter from the emperor and, despite a standing army of a thousand infantrymen, a hundred cavalrymen and two galleys, expelled the Zacharia family from the island (1329) and dissolved the fiefdom.\nLocal rule was brief. In 1346, a chartered company or \"Maona\" (the \"Maona di Chio e di Focea\") was set up in Genoa to reconquer and exploit Chios and the neighbouring town of Phocaea in Asia Minor. Although the islanders firmly rejected an initial offer of protection, the island was invaded by a Genoese fleet, led by Simone Vignoso, and the castle besieged. Again rule was transferred peacefully, as on 12 September the castle was surrendered and a treaty signed with no loss of privileges to the local landowners as long as the new authority was accepted. The Maona was controlled by the Giustiniani family.\nThe Genoese, being interested in profit rather than conquest, controlled the trade-posts and warehouses, in particular the trade of mastic, alum, salt and pitch. Other trades such as grain, wine oil and cloth and most professions were run jointly with the locals. After a failed uprising in 1347, and being heavily outnumbered (less than 10% of the population in 1395), the Latins maintained light control over the local population, remaining largely in the town and allowing full religious freedom. In this way the island remained under Genoese control for two centuries. A notable Genoese inhabitant from this period was Christopher Columbus who lived in Chios in the 1470s before his voyages to the Americas. In 1566, when Genoa lost Chios to the Ottoman Empire, there were 12,000 Greeks and 2,500 Genoese (or 17% of the total population) in the island.\nOttoman period: economic prosperity and the Great Destruction.\nIn April 1566, the island of Chios was captured by the Ottoman Empire after the surrender to Piyale Pasha. Subsequently, the Genoans were sent to the capital and after some time upon the request of the French ambassador they were allowed to return with a firman.\nDuring Ottoman rule, the government and tax gathering again remained in the hands of Greeks and the Turkish garrison was small and inconspicuous.\nAs well as the Latin and Turkish influx, documents record a small Jewish population from at least 1049 AD. The original Greek (Romaniote) Jews, thought to have been brought over by the Romans, were later joined by Sephardic Jews welcomed by the Ottomans during the Iberian expulsions of the late 15th century.\nThe mainstay of the island's famous wealth was the mastic crop. Chios was able to make a substantial contribution to the imperial treasury while at the same time maintaining only a light level of taxation. The Ottoman government regarded it as one of the most valuable provinces of the Empire.\nWhen the Greek War of Independence broke out, the island's leaders were reluctant to join the revolutionaries, fearing the loss of their security and prosperity. However, in March 1822, several hundred armed Greeks from the neighbouring island of Samos landed in Chios. They proclaimed the revolution and launched attacks against the Turks, at which point islanders decided to join the struggle.\nOttomans landed a large force on the island consequently and put down the rebellion. The Ottoman massacre of Chios expelled, killed or enslaved thousands of the inhabitants of the island. It wiped out whole villages and affected the Mastichochoria area, the mastic growing villages in the south of the island. It triggered also negative public reaction in Western Europe, as portrayed by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, and in the writing of Lord Byron and Victor Hugo. In 1825, Thomas Barker of Bath painted a fresco depicting the Chios Massacre on the walls of Doric House, Bath, Somerset. Finally, Chios was not included in the modern Greek state and remained under Ottoman rule.\nThe 1881 Chios earthquake, estimated as 6.5 on the moment magnitude scale, damaged a large portion of the island's buildings and resulted in great loss of life. Reports of the time spoke of 5,500\u201310,000 fatalities.\nRemarkably, despite the terrible devastation, in the later 19th century Chios emerged as the motherland of the modern Greek shipping industry. Indicatively, while in 1764, Chios had 6 vessels with 90 sailors on record, in 1875 there were 104 ships with over 60,000 registered tonnes, and in 1889 were recorded 440 sailing ships of various types with 3,050 sailors. The dynamic development of Chian shipping in the 19th century is further attested by the various shipping related services that were present in the island during this time, such as the creation of the shipping insurance companies \"Chiaki Thalassoploia\" (\u03a7\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u0398\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u0390\u03b1), \"Dyo Adelfai\" (\u0394\u03c5\u03bf \u0391\u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03af), \"Omonoia\" (\u039f\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1) and the shipping bank \"Archangelos\" (\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) (1863). The boom of Chian shipping took place with the successful transition from sailing vessels to steam. To this end, Chian ship owners were supported by the strong \"diaspora\" presence of Chian merchants and bankers, and the connections they had developed with the financing centers of the time (Istanbul, London), the establishment in London of shipping businessmen, the creation of shipping academies in Chios and the expertise of Chian personnel on board.\nIn independent Greece.\nChios joined the rest of independent Greece after the First Balkan War (1912). The Greek Navy landed at Chios in November 1912 and took control of the island after a series of clashes that lasted for over a month. The Ottoman Empire recognized Greece's annexation of Chios and the other Aegean islands by signing the Treaty of London (1913).\nAlthough Greece was officially neutral, the island was occupied by the British during World War I, on 17 February 1916. This may have been due to the island's proximity to the Ottoman Empire and the city of \u0130zmir in particular.\nIt was affected also by the population exchange after the Greco\u2013Turkish War of 1919\u20131922, with the incoming Greek refugees settling in Kastro (previously a Turkish neighborhood) and in new settlements hurriedly built south of Chios town.\nThe island saw some local violence during the Greek Civil War setting neighbour against neighbour. This ended when the final band of communist fighters was trapped and killed in the orchards of Kampos and their bodies driven through the main town on the back of a truck. In March 1948, the island was used as an internment camp for female political detainees (communists or relatives of guerillas) and their children, who were housed in military barracks near the town of Chios. Up to 1300 women and 50 children were housed in cramped and degrading conditions, until March 1949 when the camp was closed and the inhabitants moved to Trikeri.\nThe production of mastic was threatened by the Chios forest fire that swept the southern half of the island in August 2012 and destroyed some mastic groves.\nBy 2015, Chios had become a transit point for refugees and asylum seekers entering the EU from Turkey. A reception and identification centre was formed at VIAL near the village of Chalkeio, however, in 2021 the Greek government announced a new closed reception centre will be built in a more isolated location at Akra Pachy near the village of Pantoukios.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment.\nThe present municipality Chios was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 8 former municipalities, that became municipal units:\nEconomy.\nCommerce.\nThe local merchant shipping community transports several locally grown products including mastic, olives, figs, wine, mandarins, and cherries.\nCuisine.\nLocal specialities of the island include:\nAntimony mines.\nSporadically for some time during the early 19th century to 1950s there was mining activity on the island at Keramos Antimony Mines.\nCulture.\nTwin town, sister cities.\nChios is twinned with:\nNotable natives and inhabitants.\nA native of Chios is known in English as a Chian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17068", "revid": "29495465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17068", "title": "Kurds", "text": "Iranic ethnic group\nKurds (), or the Kurdish people, are an Iranic ethnic group from West Asia. They are indigenous to Kurdistan, which is a geographic region spanning southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, and northeastern Syria. Consisting of 30\u201345 million people, the global Kurdish population is largely concentrated in Kurdistan, but significant communities of the Kurdish diaspora exist in parts of West Asia beyond Kurdistan and in parts of Europe, most notably including: Turkey's Central Anatolian Kurds, as well as Istanbul Kurds; Iran's Khorasani Kurds; the Caucasian Kurds, primarily in Azerbaijan and Armenia; and the Kurdish populations in various European countries, namely Germany, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands.\nThe Kurdish languages and the Zaza\u2013Gorani languages, both of which belong to the Western Iranic branch of the Iranic language family, are the native languages of the Kurdish people. Other widely spoken languages among the community are those of their host countries or neighbouring regions, such as Turkish, Persian, or Arabic. The most prevalent religion among Kurds is Sunni Islam, with Shia Islam and Alevism being significant Islamic minorities. Yazidism, which is the ethnic religion of the Kurdish-speaking Yazidi people, is the largest non-Islamic minority religion among the broader Kurdish community, followed by Yarsanism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity.\nAlthough they exercise autonomy in Iraq and in Syria, the Kurds are a stateless nation. The prospect of Kurdish independence, which is rooted in early Kurdish nationalism, has been the source of much ethnic and political tension in West Asia since the 19th century. In the aftermath of World War I and the partition of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Western Allies made territorial provisions for the establishment of a Kurdish state, as outlined in the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres, but it was never ratified after being signed. Three years later, when the Treaty of Lausanne set the boundaries of the Turkish state, the Western Allies ceased their push for Kurdish statehood in the face of certain agreements and guarantees\u2014chiefly Turkey's relinquishing of territorial claims over formerly Ottoman-ruled Arab lands in exchange for the Allies' recognition of Turkish sovereignty over all of Anatolia. As such, since the 20th century, the history of the Kurds has largely been marked by struggles for independence, predominantly in the Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict and the Iraqi\u2013Kurdish conflict, and to a lesser extent in the Iranian\u2013Kurdish conflict and the comparatively recent Syrian\u2013Kurdish conflict.\nEtymology.\nThe exact origins of the name \"Kurd\" are unclear. The underlying toponym is recorded in Assyrian as and in Middle Bronze Age Sumerian as . Assyrian refers to an area in the upper Tigris basin, and it is presumably reflected in corrupted form in Classical Arabic (), re-adopted in Kurdish as . The name would be continued as the first element in the toponym \"Corduene\", mentioned by Xenophon as the tribe who opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the mountains north of Mesopotamia in the 4th century BC.\nThere are, however, dissenting views, which do not derive the name of the Kurds from and \"Corduene\" but opt for derivation from () instead.\nRegardless of its possible roots in ancient toponymy, the ethnonym \"Kurd\" might be derived from a term used in Middle Persian as a common noun to refer to 'nomads' or 'tent-dwellers', which could be applied as an attribute to any Iranic group with such a lifestyle.\nThe term gained the characteristic of an ethnonym following the Muslim conquest of Persia, as it was adopted into Arabic and gradually became associated with an amalgamation of Iranic and Iranicized tribes and groups in the region.\nThe Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland in 1923 claimed that the same way Kerman in Persian was Qarman in Syriac, Kurd in Persian was Qardu in Syriac, stating that \"the Persian gurd or kurd, which seems to have been derived from a common origin with the Babylonian gardu or qardu, signifies 'brave', 'valiant', or 'warlike', and bravery and the love of fighting are the outstanding traits of the Kurdish character. From the Persians it passed into Arabic, whence it became the common European name of the Kurds.\"\nLanguage.\nKurdish (Kurdish: or ) is a collection of related dialects spoken by the Kurds. It is mainly spoken in those parts of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey which comprise Kurdistan. Kurdish holds official status in Iraq as a national language alongside Arabic, is recognized in Iran as a regional language, and in Armenia as a minority language. The Kurds are recognized as a people with a distinct language by Arab geographers such as al-Masudi since the 10th century.\nMany Kurds are either bilingual or multilingual, speaking the language of their respective nation of origin, such as Arabic, Persian, and Turkish as a second language alongside their native Kurdish, while those in diaspora communities often speak three or more languages. Turkified and Arabised Kurds often speak little or no Kurdish.\nAccording to Mackenzie, there are few linguistic features that all Kurdish dialects have in common and that are not at the same time found in other Iranian languages.\nThe Kurdish dialects according to Mackenzie are classified as:\nThe Zaza and Gorani are ethnic Kurds, but the Zaza\u2013Gorani languages are not classified as Kurdish.\nPopulation.\nThe number of Kurds living in Southwest Asia is estimated at between 30 and 45 million, with another one or two million living in the Kurdish diaspora. Kurds comprise anywhere from 18 to 25% of the population in Turkey, 15 to 20% in Iraq; 10% in Iran; and 9% in Syria. Kurds form regional majorities in all four of these countries, \"viz.\" in Turkish Kurdistan, Iraqi Kurdistan, Iranian Kurdistan and Syrian Kurdistan. The Kurds are the fourth largest ethnic group in West Asia after Arabs, Persians, and Turks.\nThe total number of Kurds in 1991 was placed at 22.5\u00a0million, with 48% of this number living in Turkey, 24% in Iran, 18% in Iraq, and 4% in Syria.\nRecent emigration accounts for a population of close to 1.5\u00a0million in Western countries, about half of them in Germany.\nA special case are the Kurdish populations in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia, displaced there mostly in the time of the Russian Empire, who underwent independent developments for more than a century and have developed an ethnic identity in their own right. This group's population was estimated at close to 0.4\u00a0million in 1990.\nReligion.\nIslam.\nMost Kurds are Sunni Muslims who adhere to the Shafi\u02bdi school, while a significant minority adhere to the Hanafi school and also Alevism. Moreover, many Shafi'i Kurds adhere to either one of the two Sufi orders Naqshbandi and Qadiriyya.\nBeside Sunni Islam, Alevism and Shia Islam also have millions of Kurdish followers.\nYazidism.\nYazidism is a monotheistic ethnic religion with roots in a western branch of an Iranic pre-Zoroastrian religion. It is based on the belief of one God who created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings. The leader of this heptad is Taw\u00fbs\u00ea Melek, who is symbolized with a peacock. Its adherents number from 700,000 to 1 million worldwide and are indigenous to the Kurdish regions of Iraq, Syria and Turkey, with some significant, more recent communities in Russia, Georgia and Armenia established by refugees fleeing persecution by Muslims in Ottoman Empire. Yazidism shares with Kurdish Alevism and Yarsanism many similar qualities that date back to the pre-Islamic era.\nYarsanism.\nYarsanism (also known as Ahl-I-Haqq, Ahl-e-Hagh or Kakai) is also one of the religions associated with Kurdistan.\nAlthough most of the sacred Yarsan texts are in the Gorani and all of the Yarsan holy places are located in Kurdistan, followers of this religion are also found in other regions. For example, while there are more than 300,000 Yarsani in Iraqi Kurdistan, there are more than 2 million Yarsani in Iran. However, the Yarsani lack political rights in both countries.\nZoroastrianism.\nThe Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism has had a major influence on the Iranian culture, which Kurds are a part of, and has maintained some effect since the demise of the religion in the Middle Ages. The Iranian philosopher Sohrevardi drew heavily from Zoroastrian teachings. Ascribed to the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster, the faith's Supreme Being is Ahura Mazda. Leading characteristics, such as messianism, the Golden Rule, heaven and hell, and free will influenced other religious systems, including Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam.\nIn 2016, the first official Zoroastrian fire temple of Iraqi Kurdistan opened in Sulaymaniyah. Attendees celebrated the occasion by lighting a ritual fire and beating the frame drum or 'daf'. Awat Tayib, the chief of followers of Zoroastrianism in the Kurdistan region, claimed that many were returning to Zoroastrianism but some kept it secret out of fear of reprisals from Islamists.\nChristianity.\nAlthough historically there have been various accounts of Kurdish Christians, most often these were in the form of individuals, and not as communities. However, in the 19th and 20th century various travel logs tell of Kurdish Christian tribes, as well as Kurdish Muslim tribes who had substantial Christian populations living amongst them. A significant number of these were allegedly originally Armenian or Assyrian, and it has been recorded that a small number of Christian traditions have been preserved. Several Christian prayers in Kurdish have been found from earlier centuries. In recent years some Kurds from Muslim backgrounds have converted to Christianity.\nSegments of the Bible were first made available in the Kurdish language in 1856 in the Kurmanji dialect. The Gospels were translated by Stepan, an Armenian employee of the American Bible Society and were published in 1857. Prominent historical Kurdish Christians include the brothers Zakare and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nThe country \"Kar-da-ka\" is mentioned on a Sumerian clay tablet dated to the 3rd millennium BC. This land was located next to \"the people of Su\", which G. R. Driver placed to the south of Lake Van. A thousand years later, a people who may have been called \"Qur-\u1e6di-e\" (the reading is uncertain), thought by Driver to be related to \"Kar-da-ka\" and located west of Lake Van, are mentioned in the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I. In the late 5th century BC, Xenophon mentioned the Karduchoi, a people living to the east of the Bohtan River; this name survived in later times as \"Qardu\" or \"Corduene\" and other similar toponyms near Mount Judi, on the left bank of the Tigris. The connection between \"Kurd\" and \"Qardu\" and the identification of the Kurds with the Karduchoi, based on the similarity of the names and the correspondence of the inhabited territory, was widely accepted at the beginning of the 20th century, but it was deemed philologically impossible by Martin Hartmann, Theodor N\u00f6ldeke and F. H. Weissbach, who instead identified the Cyrtians, a tribe living in Media and Persia, as the ancestors of the Kurds. Since then, the connection between \"Kurd\" and \"Qardu\" / \"Karduchoi\" has been rejected by many scholars.\nMany Kurds consider themselves descended from the Medes, an ancient Iranian people, and even use a calendar dating from 612 BC, when the Assyrian capital of Nineveh was conquered by the Medes. The claimed Median descent is reflected in the words of the Kurdish national anthem: \"We are the children of the Medes and Cyaxares.\" Both Kurdish and the Median language (about which very little is known) are categorized as Northwestern Iranian languages, but the current scholarly consensus is that there is no attested pre-modern ancestor of the Kurdish languages. The existing evidence suggests that Kurdish is not a descendant of the Median language. D. N. Mackenzie theorized that Kurdish and split off from the linguistic sub-group of Median at an early point and evolved in parallel with Persian. Certain essential similarities exist between Kurdish and Persian, more than other Northwestern Iranian languages, which has led some scholars to conclude that Kurdish developed from early on in close proximity to Persian, with Kurdish speakers later migrating into the Median territory.\nThe term \"Kurd\" is first encountered in Arabic sources of the seventh century. Books from the early Islamic era, including those containing legends such as the \"Shahnameh\" and the Middle Persian \"Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan\", and other early Islamic sources provide early attestation of the name \"Kurd\". The Kurds have ethnically diverse origins.\nDuring the Sassanid era, in \"Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan\", a short prose work written in Middle Persian, Ardashir I is depicted as having battled the Kurds and their leader, Madig. After initially sustaining a heavy defeat, Ardashir I was successful in subjugating the Kurds. In a letter Ardashir I received from his foe, Ardavan V, which is also featured in the same work, he is referred to as being a Kurd himself.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nYou've bitten off more than you can chew\nand you have brought death to yourself.\nO son of a Kurd, raised in the tents of the Kurds,\nwho gave you permission to put a crown on your head?\n&lt;/poem&gt; The usage of the term \"Kurd\" during this time period most likely was a social term, designating Northwestern Iranian nomads, rather than a concrete ethnic group.\nSimilarly, in AD 360, the Sassanid king Shapur II marched into the Roman province Zabdicene, to conquer its chief city, Bezabde, present-day Cizre. He found it heavily fortified and guarded by three legions and a large body of Kurdish archers. After a long and hard-fought siege, Shapur II breached the walls, conquered the city and massacred all its defenders. Thereafter he had the strategically located city repaired, provisioned and garrisoned with his best troops.\nQadishaye, settled by Kavad in Singara, were probably Kurds and worshiped the martyr Abd al-Masih. They revolted against the Sassanids and were raiding the whole Persian territory. Later they, along with Arabs and Armenians, joined the Sassanids in their war against the Byzantines.\nThere is also a 7th-century text by an unidentified author, written about the legendary Christian martyr Mar Qardagh. He lived in the 4th century, during the reign of Shapur II, and during his travels is said to have encountered Mar Abdisho, a deacon and martyr, who, after having been questioned of his origins by Mar Qardagh and his Marzobans, stated that his parents were originally from an Assyrian village called Hazza, but were driven out and subsequently settled in Tamanon, a village in \"the land of the Kurds\", identified as being in the region of Mount Judi.\nMedieval period.\nIn the early Middle Ages, the Kurds sporadically appear in Arabic sources, though the term was still not being used for a specific people; instead, it referred to an amalgam of nomadic western Iranian tribes, who were distinct from Persians. However, in the High Middle Ages, the Kurdish ethnic identity gradually materialized, as one can find clear evidence of the Kurdish ethnic identity and solidarity in texts of the 12th and 13th centuries, though, the term was also still being used in the social sense. Since 10th century, Arabic texts including al-Masudi's works, have referred to Kurds as a distinct linguistic group. From 11th century onward, the term Kurd is explicitly defined as an ethnonym and this does not suggest synonymity with the ethnographic category nomad. Al-Tabari wrote that in 639, Hormuzan, a Sasanian general originating from a noble family, battled against the Islamic invaders in Khuzestan, and called upon the Kurds to aid him in battle. However, they were defeated and brought under Islamic rule.\nIn 838, a Kurdish leader based in Mosul, named Mir Jafar, revolted against the Caliph al-Mu'tasim who sent the commander Itakh to combat him. Itakh won this war and executed many of the Kurds. Eventually, Arabs conquered the Kurdish regions and gradually converted the majority of Kurds to Islam, often incorporating them into the military, such as the Hamdanids whose dynastic family members also frequently intermarried with Kurds.\nIn 934, the Daylamite Buyid dynasty was founded, and subsequently conquered most of present-day Iran and Iraq. During the time of rule of this dynasty, Kurdish chief and ruler, Badr ibn Hasanwaih, established himself as one of the most important emirs of the time.\nIn the 10th\u201312th centuries, a number of Kurdish principalities and dynasties were founded, ruling Kurdistan and neighbouring areas:\nDue to the Turkic invasion of Anatolia and Armenia, the 11th-century Kurdish dynasties crumbled and became incorporated into the Seljuk dynasty. Kurds would hereafter be used in great numbers in the armies of the Zengids. The Ayyubid dynasty was founded by Kurdish ruler Saladin, as succeeding the Zengids, the Ayyubids established themselves in 1171. Saladin led the Muslims to recapture the city of Jerusalem from the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin, also frequently clashing with the Assassins. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted until 1341 when the Ayyubid sultanate fell to Mongolian invasions.\nSafavid period.\nThe Safavid dynasty, established in 1501, also established its rule over Kurdish-inhabited territories. The paternal line of this family actually had Kurdish roots, tracing back to Firuz-Shah Zarrin-Kolah, a dignitary who moved from Kurdistan to Ardabil in the 11th century. The Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 that culminated in what is nowadays Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, marked the start of the Ottoman-Persian Wars between the Iranian Safavids (and successive Iranian dynasties) and the Ottomans. For the next 300 years, many of the Kurds found themselves living in territories that frequently changed hands between Ottoman Turkey and Iran during the protracted series of Ottoman-Persian Wars.\nThe Safavid king Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524) put down a Yezidi rebellion which went on from 1506 to 1510. A century later, the year-long Battle of Dimdim took place, wherein the Safavid king Abbas I (r. 1588\u20131629) succeeded in putting down the rebellion led by the Kurdish ruler Amir Khan Lepzerin. Thereafter, many Kurds were deported to Khorasan, not only to weaken the Kurds, but also to protect the eastern border from invading Afghan and Turkmen tribes. Other forced movements and deportations of other groups were also implemented by Abbas I and his successors, most notably of the Armenians, the Georgians, and the Circassians, who were moved en masse to and from other districts within the Persian empire.\nThe Kurds of Khorasan, numbering around 700,000, still use the Kurmanji Kurdish dialect. Several Kurdish noblemen served the Safavids and rose to prominence, such as Shaykh Ali Khan Zanganeh, who served as the grand vizier of the Safavid shah Suleiman I (r. 1666\u20131694) from 1669 to 1689. Due to his efforts in reforming the declining Iranian economy, he has been called the \"Safavid Amir Kabir\" in modern historiography. His son, Shahqoli Khan Zanganeh, also served as a grand vizier from 1707 to 1716. Another Kurdish statesman, Ganj Ali Khan, was close friends with Abbas I, and served as governor in various provinces and was known for his loyal service.\nZand period.\nAfter the fall of the Safavids, Iran fell under the control of the Afsharid Empire ruled by Nader Shah at its peak. After Nader's death, Iran fell into civil war, with multiple leaders trying to gain control over the country. Ultimately, it was Karim Khan, a Laki general of the Zand tribe who would come to power.\nThe country would flourish during Karim Khan's reign; a strong resurgence of the arts would take place, and international ties were strengthened. Karim Khan was portrayed as being a ruler who truly cared about his subjects, thereby gaining the title \"Vakil-e Ra'aya\" (meaning \"Representative of the People\" in Persian). Though not as powerful in its geopolitical and military reach as the preceding Safavids and Afsharids or even the early Qajars, he managed to reassert Iranian hegemony over its integral territories in the Caucasus, and presided over an era of relative peace, prosperity, and tranquility. In Ottoman Iraq, following the Ottoman\u2013Persian War (1775\u201376), Karim Khan managed to seize Basra for several years.\nAfter Karim Khan's death, the dynasty would decline in favour of the rival Qajars due to infighting between the Khan's incompetent offspring. It was not until Lotf Ali Khan, 10 years later, that the dynasty would once again be led by an adept ruler. By this time however, the Qajars had already progressed greatly, having taken a number of Zand territories. Lotf Ali Khan had multiple successes before ultimately succumbing to the rival faction. Iran and all its Kurdish territories would hereby be incorporated in the Qajar dynasty.\nThe Kurdish tribes present in Baluchistan and some of those in Fars are believed to be remnants of those that assisted and accompanied Lotf Ali Khan and Karim Khan, respectively.\nOttoman period.\nWhen Sultan Selim I, after defeating Shah Ismail I in 1514, annexed Western Armenia and Kurdistan, he entrusted the organisation of the conquered territories to Idris, the historian, who was a Kurd of Bitlis. He divided the territory into \"sanjaks\" or districts, and, making no attempt to interfere with the principle of heredity, installed the local chiefs as governors. He also resettled the rich pastoral country between Erzerum and Erivan, which had lain in waste since the passage of Timur, with Kurds from the Hakkari and Bohtan districts. For the next centuries, from the Peace of Amasya until the first half of the 19th century, several regions of the wide Kurdish homelands would be contested as well between the Ottomans and the neighbouring rival successive Iranian dynasties (Safavids, Afsharids, Qajars) in the frequent Ottoman-Persian Wars.\nThe Ottoman centralist policies in the beginning of the 19th century aimed to remove power from the principalities and localities, which directly affected the Kurdish emirs. Bedirhan Bey was the last emir of the Cizre Bohtan Emirate after initiating an uprising in 1847 against the Ottomans to protect the current structures of the Kurdish principalities. Although his uprising is not classified as a nationalist one, his children played significant roles in the emergence and the development of Kurdish nationalism through the next century.\nThe first modern Kurdish nationalist movement emerged in 1880 with an uprising led by a Kurdish landowner and head of the powerful Shemdinan family, Sheik Ubeydullah, who demanded political autonomy or outright independence for Kurds as well as the recognition of a Kurdistan state without interference from Turkish or Persian authorities. The uprising against Qajar Persia and the Ottoman Empire was ultimately suppressed by the Ottomans and Ubeydullah, along with other notables, were exiled to Istanbul.\nKurdish nationalism of the 20th century.\nKurdish nationalism emerged after World War I with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, which had historically successfully integrated (but not assimilated) the Kurds, through use of forced repression of Kurdish independence movements. Revolts did occur sporadically but only in 1880 with the uprising led by Sheik Ubeydullah did the Kurds as an ethnic group or nation make demands. Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II (r.\u20091876\u00a0\u2013\u00a01909) responded with a campaign of integration by co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents to strengthen Ottoman power with offers of prestigious positions in his government. This strategy appears to have been successful, given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish Hamidiye regiments during World War I.\nThe Kurdish ethno-nationalist movement that emerged following World War I and the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1922 largely represented a reaction to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily to the radical secularization, the centralization of authority, and to the rampant Turkish nationalism in the new Turkish Republic.\nJakob K\u00fcnzler, head of a missionary hospital in Urfa, documented the large-scale ethnic cleansing of both Armenians and Kurds by the Young Turks. He has given a detailed account of the deportation of Kurds from Erzurum and Bitlis in the winter of 1916. The Kurds were perceived to be subversive elements who would take the Russian side in the war. In order to eliminate this threat, Young Turks embarked on a large-scale deportation of Kurds from the regions of \"Djabachdjur\", \"Palu\", \"Musch\", \"Erzurum\" and \"Bitlis\". Around 300,000 Kurds were forced to move southwards to Urfa and then westwards to Aintab and Marasch. In the summer of 1917 Kurds were moved to Konya in central Anatolia. Through these measures, the Young Turk leaders aimed at weakening the political influence of the Kurds by deporting them from their ancestral lands and by dispersing them in small pockets of exiled communities. By the end of World War I, up to 700,000 Kurds had been forcibly deported and almost half of the displaced perished.\nSome of the Kurdish groups sought self-determination and the confirmation of Kurdish autonomy in the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres, but in the aftermath of World War I, Kemal Atat\u00fcrk prevented such a result. Kurds backed by the United Kingdom declared independence in 1927 and established the Republic of Ararat. Turkey suppressed Kurdist revolts in 1925, 1930, and 1937\u20131938, while Iran in the 1920s suppressed Simko Shikak at Lake Urmia and Jaafar Sultan of the Hewraman region, who controlled the region between Marivan and north of Halabja. A short-lived Soviet-sponsored Kurdish Republic of Mahabad (January to December 1946) existed in an area of present-day Iran.\nFrom 1922 to 1924 in Iraq a Kingdom of Kurdistan existed. When Ba'athist administrators thwarted Kurdish nationalist ambitions in Iraq, war broke out in the 1960s. In 1970 the Kurds rejected limited territorial self-rule within Iraq, demanding larger areas, including the oil-rich Kirkuk region.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, several large-scale Kurdish revolts took place in Kurdistan. Following these rebellions, the area of Turkish Kurdistan was put under martial law and many of the Kurds were displaced. The Turkish government also encouraged resettlement of Albanians from Kosovo and Assyrians in the region to change the make-up of the population. These events and measures led to long-lasting mutual distrust between Ankara and the Kurds.\nKurdish officers from the Iraqi army [...] were said to have approached Soviet army authorities soon after their arrival in Iran in 1941 and offered to form a Kurdish volunteer force to fight alongside the Red Army. This offer was declined.\nDuring the relatively open government of the 1950s in Turkey, Kurds gained political office and started working within the framework of the Turkish Republic to further their interests, but this move towards integration was halted with the 1960 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat. The 1970s saw an evolution in Kurdish nationalism as Marxist political thought influenced some in the new generation of Kurdish nationalists opposed to the local feudal authorities who had been a traditional source of opposition to authority; in 1978 Kurdish students would form the militant separatist organization PKK, also known as the Kurdistan Workers' Party in English. The Kurdistan Workers' Party later abandoned Marxism-Leninism.\nKurds are often regarded as \"the largest ethnic group without a state\". Some researchers, such as Martin van Bruinessen, argue that while some level of Kurdish cultural, social, political and ideological heterogeneity may exist, the Kurdish community has long thrived over the centuries as a generally peaceful and well-integrated part of Turkish society, with hostilities erupting only in recent years. Michael Radu, who worked for the United States' Pennsylvania Foreign Policy Research Institute, writes that demands for a Kurdish state come primarily from Kurdish nationalists, Western human-rights activists, and European leftists.\nKurdish communities.\nTurkey.\nAccording to the official data of the 1935 census, the number of people whose mother tongue was Kurdish was 1,480,246 people, or 9.16%, and according to the official data of the 1965 census, it was 2,219,502, or 6.9%. The difference between the 1965 and 1935 censuses was that in the 1935 census, Zazaki was considered a sub-branch of Kurdish, while in the 1965 census it was considered a separate language and was counted separately. According to the \"CIA World Factbook\", Kurds formed approximately 18% of the population in Turkey (approximately 14\u00a0million) in 2008. One Western source estimates that up to 25% of the Turkish population is Kurdish (approximately 18\u201319\u00a0million people). Kurdish sources claim there are as many as 20 or 25\u00a0million Kurds in Turkey.\nIn 1980, \"Ethnologue\" estimated the number of Kurdish-speakers in Turkey at around five million, when the country's population stood at 44\u00a0million. Rudaw, in its report prepared based on T\u00fcrkiye's census data in February 2024, stated that the total population of Kurdish-majority regions in T\u00fcrkiye is around 17 million. Kurds form the largest minority group in Turkey, and they have posed the most serious and persistent challenge to the official image of a homogeneous society. To deny the existence of Kurds, the Turkish Government used several terms. \"Mountain Turks\" was a term was initially used by Abdullah Alpdo\u011fan. In 1961, in a foreword to the book \"Do\u011fu \u0130lleri ve Varto Tarihi\" of Mehmet \u015eerif F\u0131rat, the Turkish president Cemal G\u00fcrsel declared it of utmost importance to prove the Turkishness of the Kurds. Eastern Turk was another euphemism for Kurds from 1980 onwards. Nowadays the Kurds, in Turkey, are still known under the name \"Easterner\" (Do\u011fulu).\nSeveral large-scale Kurdish revolts in 1925, 1930 and 1938 were suppressed by the Turkish government and more than one million Kurds were forcibly relocated between 1925 and 1938. The use of Kurdish language, dress, folklore, and names were banned and the Kurdish-inhabited areas remained under martial law until 1946. The Ararat revolt, which reached its apex in 1930, was only suppressed after a massive military campaign including destruction of many villages and their populations. By the 1970s, Kurdish leftist organizations such as the Kurdistan Socialist Party-Turkey (KSP-T) emerged in Turkey which were against violence and supported civil activities and participation in elections. In 1977, Mehdi Zana a supporter of KSP-T won the mayoralty of Diyarbakir in the local elections. At about the same time, generational fissures gave birth to two new organizations: the National Liberation of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).\nThe words \"Kurds\", \"Kurdistan\", or \"Kurdish\" were officially banned by the Turkish government. Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in public and private life. Many people who spoke, published, or sang in Kurdish were arrested and imprisoned. The Kurds are still not allowed to get a primary education in their mother tongue and they do not have a right to self-determination, even though Turkey has signed the ICCPR. There is ongoing discrimination against and \"otherization\" of Kurds in society.\nThe Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK (Kurdish: \"Partiya Karker\u00ean Kurdistan\u00ea\") is Kurdish militant organization which has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state for cultural and political rights and self-determination for the Kurds. Turkey's military allies the US, the EU, and NATO label the PKK as a terrorist organization while the UN, Switzerland, and Russia have refused to add the PKK to their terrorist list. Some of them have even supported the PKK.\nBetween 1984 and 1999, the PKK and the Turkish military engaged in open war, and much of the countryside in the southeast was depopulated, as Kurdish civilians moved from villages to bigger cities such as Diyarbak\u0131r, Van, and \u015e\u0131rnak, as well as to the cities of western Turkey and even to western Europe. The causes of the depopulation included mainly the Turkish state's military operations, state's political actions, Turkish deep state actions, the poverty of the southeast and PKK atrocities against Kurdish clans which were against them. Turkish state actions have included torture, rape, forced inscription, forced evacuation, destruction of villages, illegal arrests and executions of Kurdish civilians.\nSince the 1970s, the European Court of Human Rights has condemned Turkey for the thousands of human rights abuses. The judgments are related to executions of Kurdish civilians, torturing, forced displacements systematic destruction of villages, arbitrary arrests murdered and disappeared Kurdish journalists.\nLeyla Zana, the first Kurdish female MP from Diyarbakir, caused an uproar in Turkish Parliament after adding the following sentence in Kurdish to her parliamentary oath during the swearing-in ceremony in 1994: \"I take this oath for the brotherhood of the Turkish and Kurdish peoples.\"\nIn March 1994, the Turkish Parliament voted to lift the immunity of Zana and five other Kurdish DEP members: Hatip Dicle, Ahmet Turk, Sirri Sakik, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak. Zana, Dicle, Sadak and Dogan were sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Supreme Court in October 1995. Zana was awarded the Sakharov Prize for human rights by the European Parliament in 1995. She was released in 2004 amid warnings from European institutions that the continued imprisonment of the four Kurdish MPs would affect Turkey's bid to join the EU. The 2009 local elections resulted in 5.7% for Kurdish political party DTP.\nOfficially protected death squads are accused of the disappearance of 3,200 Kurds and Assyrians in 1993 and 1994 in the so-called \"mystery killings\". Kurdish politicians, human-rights activists, journalists, teachers and other members of intelligentsia were among the victims. Virtually none of the perpetrators were investigated nor punished. Turkish government also encouraged Islamic extremist group Kurdish Hezbollah to assassinate suspected PKK members and often ordinary Kurds. Azimet K\u00f6yl\u00fco\u011flu, the state minister of human rights, revealed the extent of security forces' excesses in the autumn of 1994: \"While acts of terrorism in other regions are done by the PKK; in Tunceli it is state terrorism. In Tunceli, it is the state that is evacuating and burning villages. In the southeast there are two million people left homeless.\"\nIran.\nThe Kurdish region of Iran has been a part of the country since ancient times. Nearly all Kurdistan was part of Safavid Iran until its Western part was lost during wars against the Ottoman Empire. Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 Tehran had demanded all lost territories including Turkish Kurdistan, Mosul, and even Diyarbak\u0131r, but demands were quickly rejected by Western powers. This area has been divided by modern Turkey, Syria and Iraq. Today, the Kurds inhabit mostly northwestern territories known as Iranian Kurdistan but also the northeastern region of Khorasan, and constitute approximately 7\u201310% of Iran's overall population (6.5\u20137.9\u00a0million), compared to 10.6% (2\u00a0million) in 1956 and 8% (800,000) in 1850.\nUnlike in other Kurdish-populated countries, there are strong ethnolinguistic and cultural ties between Kurds, Persians and others as Iranian peoples. Some modern Iranian dynasties like the Safavids and Zands are considered to be partly of Kurdish origin. Kurdish literature in all of its forms (Kurmanji, Sorani, and Gorani) has developed within historical Iranian boundaries under strong influence of the Persian language.\nAccording to Philip Kreyenbroek and Stefan Sperl, \"The government of Iran has never employed the same level of brutality against its own Kurds like Turkey or Iraq, but it has always been implacably opposed to any suggestion of Kurdish separatism.\" During and shortly after the First World War the government of Iran was ineffective and had very little control over events in the country and several Kurdish tribal chiefs gained local political power, even established large confederations. At the same time waves of nationalism from the disintegrating Ottoman Empire partly influenced some Kurdish chiefs in border regions to pose as Kurdish nationalist leaders. Prior to this, identity in both countries largely relied upon religion, i.e., Shia Islam in the particular case of Iran. In 19th-century Iran, Shia\u2013Sunni animosity and the describing of Sunni Kurds as an Ottoman fifth column was quite frequent.\nDuring the late 1910s and early 1920s, tribal revolt led by Kurdish chieftain Simko Shikak struck northwestern Iran. Although elements of Kurdish nationalism were present in this movement, historians agree these were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was a major issue in Simko's movement, and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives. Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to suffer in the attacks, the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted. Rebels do not appear to have felt any sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds. Kurdish insurgency and seasonal migrations in the late 1920s, along with long-running tensions between Tehran and Ankara, resulted in border clashes and even military penetrations in both Iranian and Turkish territory. Two regional powers have used Kurdish tribes as tool for own political benefits: Turkey has provided military help and refuge for anti-Iranian Turcophone Shikak rebels in 1918\u20131922, while Iran did the same during Ararat rebellion against Turkey in 1930. Reza Shah's military victory over Kurdish and Turkic tribal leaders initiated a repressive era toward non-Iranian minorities. Government's forced detribalization and sedentarization in 1920s and 1930s resulted with many other tribal revolts in Iranian regions of Azerbaijan, Luristan and Kurdistan. In particular case of the Kurds, this repressive policies partly contributed to developing nationalism among some tribes.\nAs a response to growing Pan-Turkism and Pan-Arabism in region which were seen as potential threats to the territorial integrity of Iran, Pan-Iranist ideology has been developed in the early 1920s. Some of such groups and journals openly advocated Iranian support to the Kurdish rebellion against Turkey. Secular Pahlavi dynasty has endorsed Iranian ethnic nationalism which saw the Kurds as integral part of the Iranian nation. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi has personally praised the Kurds as \"pure Iranians\" or \"one of the most noble Iranian peoples\". Another significant ideology during this period was Marxism which arose among Kurds under influence of USSR. It culminated in the Iran crisis of 1946 which included a separatist attempt of KDP-I and communist groups to establish the Soviet puppet government called Republic of Mahabad. It arose along with Azerbaijan People's Government, another Soviet puppet state. The state itself encompassed a very small territory, including Mahabad and the adjacent cities, unable to incorporate the southern Iranian Kurdistan which fell inside the Anglo-American zone, and unable to attract the tribes outside Mahabad itself to the nationalist cause. As a result, when the Soviets withdrew from Iran in December 1946, government forces were able to enter Mahabad unopposed.\nSeveral nationalist and Marxist insurgencies continued for decades (1967, 1979, 1989\u201396) led by KDP-I and Komalah, but those two organization have never advocated a separate Kurdish state or greater Kurdistan as did the PKK in Turkey. Still, many of dissident leaders, among others Qazi Muhammad and Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, were executed or assassinated. During Iran\u2013Iraq War, Tehran has provided support for Iraqi-based Kurdish groups like KDP or PUK, along with asylum for 1.4 million Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds. Kurdish Marxist groups have been marginalized in Iran since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 2004 new insurrection started by PJAK, separatist organization affiliated with the Turkey-based PKK and designated as terrorist by Iran, Turkey and the United States. Some analysts claim PJAK do not pose any serious threat to the government of Iran. Cease-fire has been established in September 2011 following the Iranian offensive on PJAK bases, but several clashes between PJAK and IRGC took place after it. Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, accusations of \"discrimination\" by Western organizations and of \"foreign involvement\" by Iranian side have become very frequent.\nKurds have been well integrated in Iranian political life under various governments. Kurdish liberal political Karim Sanjabi served as minister of education under Mohammad Mossadegh in 1952. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi some members of parliament and high army officers were Kurds, and there was even a Kurdish cabinet minister. During the reign of the Pahlavis Kurds received many favours from the authorities, for instance to keep their land after the land reforms of 1962. In the early 2000s, presence of thirty Kurdish deputies in the 290-strong parliament has also helped to undermine claims of discrimination. Some of the more influential Kurdish politicians during recent years include former first vice president Mohammad Reza Rahimi and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Mayor of Tehran and second-placed presidential candidate in 2013. The Kurdish language is today used more than at any other time since the Revolution, including in several newspapers and among schoolchildren. Many Iranian Kurds show no interest in Kurdish nationalism, particularly Kurds of the Shia faith who sometimes even vigorously reject idea of autonomy, preferring direct rule from Tehran. The issue of Kurdish nationalism and Iranian national identity is generally only questioned in the peripheral Kurdish dominated regions where the Sunni faith is prevalent.\nIraq.\nKurds constitute approximately 17% of Iraq's population. They are the majority in at least three provinces in northern Iraq. Kurds also have a presence in Kirkuk, Mosul, Khanaqin, and Baghdad. Around 300,000 Kurds live in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, 50,000 in the city of Mosul and around 100,000 elsewhere in southern Iraq.\nKurds led by Mustafa Barzani were engaged in heavy fighting against successive Iraqi regimes from 1960 to 1975. In March 1970, Iraq announced a peace plan providing for Kurdish autonomy. The plan was to be implemented in four years. However, at the same time, the Iraqi regime started an Arabization program in the oil-rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin. The peace agreement did not last long, and in 1974, the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurds. Moreover, in March 1975, Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers Accord, according to which Iran cut supplies to Iraqi Kurds. Iraq started another wave of Arabization by moving Arabs to the oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly those around Kirkuk. Between 1975 and 1978, 200,000 Kurds were deported to other parts of Iraq.\nDuring the Iran\u2013Iraq War in the 1980s, the regime implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a \"de facto\" civil war broke out. Iraq was widely condemned by the international community, but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures such as the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians, the wholesale destruction of thousands of villages and the deportation of thousands of Kurds to southern and central Iraq.\nThe genocidal campaign, conducted between 1986 and 1989 and culminating in 1988, carried out by the Iraqi government against the Kurdish population was called \"Anfal\" (\"Spoils of War\"). The Anfal campaign led to destruction of over two thousand villages and killing of 182,000 Kurdish civilians. The campaign included the use of ground offensives, aerial bombing, systematic destruction of settlements, mass deportation, firing squads, and chemical attacks, including the most infamous attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 that killed 5000 civilians instantly.\nAfter the collapse of the Kurdish uprising in March 1991, Iraqi troops recaptured most of the Kurdish areas and 1.5\u00a0million Kurds abandoned their homes and fled to the Turkish and Iranian borders. It is estimated that close to 20,000 Kurds succumbed to death due to exhaustion, lack of food, exposure to cold and disease. On 5 April 1991, UN Security Council passed resolution 688 which condemned the repression of Iraqi Kurdish civilians and demanded that Iraq end its repressive measures and allow immediate access to international humanitarian organizations. This was the first international document (since the League of Nations arbitration of Mosul in 1926) to mention Kurds by name. In mid-April, the Coalition established \"safe havens\" inside Iraqi borders and prohibited Iraqi planes from flying north of 36th parallel. In October 1991, Kurdish guerrillas captured Erbil and Sulaimaniyah after a series of clashes with Iraqi troops. In late October, Iraqi government retaliated by imposing a food and fuel embargo on the Kurds and stopping to pay civil servants in the Kurdish region. The embargo, however, backfired and Kurds held parliamentary elections in May 1992 and established Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).\nThe Kurdish population welcomed the American troops in 2003 by holding celebrations and dancing in the streets. The authority of the KRG and legality of its laws and regulations were recognized in the articles 113 and 137 of the new Iraqi Constitution ratified in 2005. By the beginning of 2006, the two Kurdish administrations of Erbil and Sulaimaniya were unified. On 14 August 2007, Yazidis were targeted in a series of bombings that became the deadliest suicide attack since the Iraq War began, killing 796 civilians, wounding 1,562.\nSyria.\nKurds account for 9% of Syria's population, a total of around 1.6\u00a0million people. This makes them the largest ethnic minority in the country. They are mostly concentrated in the northeast and the north, but there are also significant Kurdish populations in Aleppo and Damascus. Kurds often speak Kurdish in public, unless all those present do not. According to Amnesty International, Kurdish human rights activists are mistreated and persecuted. No political parties are allowed for any group, Kurdish or otherwise.\nTechniques used to suppress the ethnic identity of Kurds in Syria include various bans on the use of the Kurdish language, refusal to register children with Kurdish names, the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in Arabic, the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names, the prohibition of Kurdish private schools, and the prohibition of books and other materials written in Kurdish. Having been denied the right to Syrian nationality, around 300,000 Kurds have been deprived of any social rights, in violation of international law. As a consequence, these Kurds are in effect trapped within Syria. In March 2011, in part to avoid further demonstrations and unrest from spreading across Syria, the Syrian government promised to tackle the issue and grant Syrian citizenship to approximately 300,000 Kurds who had been previously denied the right.\nOn 12 March 2004, beginning at a stadium in Qamishli (a largely Kurdish city in northeastern Syria), clashes between Kurds and Syrians broke out and continued over a number of days. At least thirty people were killed and more than 160 injured. The unrest spread to other Kurdish towns along the northern border with Turkey, and then to Damascus and Aleppo.\nAs a result of Syrian civil war, since July 2012, Kurds were able to take control of large parts of Syrian Kurdistan from Andiwar in extreme northeast to Jindires in extreme northwest Syria. The Syrian Kurds started the Rojava Revolution in 2013.\nKurdish-inhabited Afrin Canton has been occupied by Turkish Armed Forces and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army since the Turkish military operation in Afrin in early 2018. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people were displaced due to the Turkish intervention.\nIn October 2019, Turkey and the Syrian Interim Government began an offensive into Kurdish-populated areas in Syria, prompting about 100,000 civilians to flee from the area fearing that Turkey would commit an ethnic cleansing.\nTranscaucasus.\nBetween the 1930s and 1980s, Armenia was a part of the Soviet Union, within which Kurds, like other ethnic groups, had the status of a protected minority. Armenian Kurds were permitted their own state-sponsored newspaper, radio broadcasts and cultural events. During the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, many non-Yazidi Kurds were forced to leave their homes since both the Azeri and non-Yazidi Kurds were Muslim.\nIn 1920, two Kurdish-inhabited areas of Jewanshir (capital Kalbajar) and eastern Zangazur (capital Lachin) were combined to form the Kurdistan Okrug (or \"Red Kurdistan\"). The period of existence of the Kurdish administrative unit was brief and did not last beyond 1929. Kurds subsequently faced many repressive measures, including deportations, imposed by the Soviet government. As a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, many Kurdish areas have been destroyed and more than 150,000 Kurds have been deported since 1988 by separatist Armenian forces.\nDiaspora.\nAccording to a report by the Council of Europe, approximately 1.3\u00a0million Kurds live in Western Europe. The earliest immigrants were Kurds from Turkey, who settled in Germany, Austria, the Benelux countries, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France during the 1960s. Successive periods of political and social turmoil in the region during the 1980s and 1990s brought new waves of Kurdish refugees, mostly from Iran and Iraq under Saddam Hussein, came to Europe.\nIn recent years, many Kurdish asylum seekers from both Iran and Iraq have settled in the United Kingdom (especially in the town of Dewsbury and in some northern areas of London), which has sometimes caused media controversy over their right to remain.\nThere have been tensions between Kurds and the established Muslim community in Dewsbury, which is home to very traditional mosques such as the Markazi. Since the beginning of the turmoil in Syria many of the refugees of the Syrian Civil War are Syrian Kurds and as a result many of the current Syrian asylum seekers in Germany are of Kurdish descent.\nThere was substantial immigration of ethnic Kurds in Canada and the United States, who are mainly political refugees and immigrants seeking economic opportunity. According to a 2011 Statistics Canada household survey, there were 11,685 people of Kurdish ethnic background living in Canada, and according to the 2011 Census, 10,325 Canadians spoke Kurdish languages. In the United States, Kurdish immigrants started to settle in large numbers in Nashville in 1976, which is now home to the largest Kurdish community in the United States and is nicknamed \"Little Kurdistan\". Kurdish population in Nashville is estimated to be around 11,000. The total number of ethnic Kurds residing in the United States is estimated by the US Census Bureau to be 20,591. Other sources claim that there are 20,000 ethnic Kurds in the United States.\nCulture.\nKurdish culture is a legacy from the various ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society. As most other Middle Eastern populations, a high degree of mutual influences between the Kurds and their neighbouring peoples are apparent. Therefore, in Kurdish culture elements of various other cultures are to be seen.\nHowever, on the whole, Kurdish culture is closest to that of other Iranian peoples, in particular those who historically had the closest geographical proximity to the Kurds, such as the Persians and Lurs. Kurds, for instance, also celebrate Newroz (21 March) as New Year's Day.\nEducation.\nA madrasa system was used before the modern era. Mele are Islamic clerics and instructors.\nWomen.\nIn general, Kurdish women's rights and equality have improved in the 20th and 21st centuries due to progressive movements within Kurdish society. However, despite the progress, Kurdish and international women's rights organizations still report problems related to gender equality, forced marriages, honor killings, and in Iraq's Erbil, also female genital mutilation (FGM).\nFolklore.\nThe Kurds possess a rich tradition of folklore, which, until recent times, was largely transmitted by speech or song, from one generation to the next. Although some of the Kurdish writers' stories were well known throughout Kurdistan; most of the stories told and sung were only written down in the 20th and 21st centuries. Many of these are, allegedly, centuries old.\nWidely varying in purpose and style, among the Kurdish folklore one will find stories about nature, anthropomorphic animals, love, heroes and villains, mythological creatures and everyday life. A number of these mythological figures can be found in other cultures, like the Simurgh and Kaveh the Blacksmith in the broader Iranian Mythology, and stories of Shahmaran throughout Anatolia. Additionally, stories can be purely entertaining, or have an educational or religious aspect.\nPerhaps the most widely reoccurring element is the fox, which, through cunning and shrewdness triumphs over less intelligent species, yet often also meets his demise. Another common theme in Kurdish folklore is the origin of a tribe.\nStorytellers would perform in front of an audience, sometimes consisting of an entire village. People from outside the region would travel to attend their narratives, and the storytellers themselves would visit other villages to spread their tales. These would thrive especially during winter, where entertainment was hard to find as evenings had to be spent inside.\nCoinciding with the heterogeneous Kurdish groupings, although certain stories and elements were commonly found throughout Kurdistan, others were unique to a specific area; depending on the region, religion or dialect. The Kurdish Jews of Zakho are perhaps the best example of this; their gifted storytellers are known to have been greatly respected throughout the region, thanks to a unique oral tradition. Other examples are the mythology of the Yezidis, and the stories of the Dersim Kurds, which had a substantial Armenian influence.\nDuring the criminalization of the Kurdish language after the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1980, \"dengb\u00eaj\" (singers) and \"\u00e7\u00eerokb\u00eaj\" (tellers) were silenced, and many of the stories had become endangered. In 1991, the language was decriminalized, yet the now highly available radios and TV's had as an effect a diminished interest in traditional storytelling. However, a number of writers have made great strides in the preservation of these tales.\nWeaving.\nKurdish weaving is renowned throughout the world, with fine specimens of both rugs and bags. The most famous Kurdish rugs are those from the Bijar region, in the Kurdistan Province. Because of the unique way in which the Bijar rugs are woven, they are very stout and durable, hence their appellation as the 'Iron Rugs of Persia'. Exhibiting a wide variety, the Bijar rugs have patterns ranging from floral designs, medallions and animals to other ornaments. They generally have two wefts, and are very colorful in design. With an increased interest in these rugs in the last century, and a lesser need for them to be as sturdy as they were, new Bijar rugs are more refined and delicate in design.\nAnother well-known Kurdish rug is the Senneh rug, which is regarded as the most sophisticated of the Kurdish rugs. They are especially known for their great knot density and high-quality mountain wool. They lend their name from the region of Sanandaj. Throughout other Kurdish regions like Kermanshah, Siirt, Malatya and Bitlis rugs were also woven to great extent.\nKurdish bags are mainly known from the works of one large tribe: the Jaffs, living in the border area between Iran and Iraq. These Jaff bags share the same characteristics of Kurdish rugs; very colorful, stout in design, often with medallion patterns. They were especially popular in the West during the 1920s and 1930s.\nHandicrafts.\nOutside of weaving and clothing, there are many other Kurdish handicrafts, which were traditionally often crafted by nomadic Kurdish tribes. These are especially well known in Iran, most notably the crafts from the Kermanshah and Sanandaj regions. Among these crafts are chess boards, talismans, jewelry, ornaments, weaponry, and instruments.\nKurdish blades include a distinct jambiya, with its characteristic I-shaped hilt, and oblong blade. Generally, these possess double-edged blades, reinforced with a central ridge, a wooden, leather or silver decorated scabbard, and a horn hilt, furthermore they are often still worn decoratively by older men. Swords were made as well. Most of these blades in circulation stem from the 19th century.\nAnother distinct form of art from Sanandaj is 'Oroosi', a type of window where stylized wooden pieces are locked into each other, rather than being glued together. These are further decorated with coloured glass, this stems from an old belief that if light passes through a combination of seven colours it helps keep the atmosphere clean.\nAmong Kurdish Jews a common practice was the making of talismans, which were believed to combat illnesses and protect the wearer from malevolent spirits.\nTattoos.\nAdorning the body with tattoos (\"deq\" in Kurdish) is widespread among the Kurds, even though permanent tattoos are not permissible in Sunni Islam. Therefore, these traditional tattoos are thought to derive from pre-Islamic times.\nTattoo ink is made by mixing soot with (breast) milk and the poisonous liquid from the gall bladder of an animal. The design is drawn on the skin using a thin twig and is injected under the skin using a needle. These have a wide variety of meanings and purposes, among which are protection against evil or illnesses; beauty enhancement; and the showing of tribal affiliations. Religious symbolism is also common among both traditional and modern Kurdish tattoos. Tattoos are more prevalent among women than among men, and were generally worn on feet, the chin, foreheads and other places of the body.\nThe popularity of permanent, traditional tattoos has greatly diminished among newer generation of Kurds. However, modern tattoos are becoming more prevalent; and temporary tattoos are still being worn on special occasions (such as henna, the night before a wedding) and as tribute to the cultural heritage.\nMusic and dance.\nTraditionally, there are three types of Kurdish classical performers: storytellers (\"\u00e7\u00eerokb\u00eaj\"), minstrels (\"stranb\u00eaj\"), and bards (\"dengb\u00eaj\"). No specific music was associated with the Kurdish princely courts. Instead, music performed in night gatherings (\"\u015fevbih\u00eark\") is considered classical. Several musical forms are found in this genre. Many songs are epic in nature, such as the popular \"Lawiks\", heroic ballads recounting the tales of Kurdish heroes such as Saladin. \"Heyrans\" are love ballads usually expressing the melancholy of separation and unfulfilled love. One of the first Kurdish female singers to sing \"heyrans\" is Chopy Fatah, while \"Lawje\" is a form of religious music and \"Payizoks\" are songs performed during the autumn. Love songs, dance music, wedding and other celebratory songs (\"d\u00eelok/nar\u00eenk\"), erotic poetry, and work songs are also popular.\nThroughout the Middle East, there are many prominent Kurdish artists. Most famous are Ibrahim Tatlises, Nizamettin Ar\u0131\u00e7, Ahmet Kaya and the Kamkars. In Europe, well-known artists are Darin Zanyar, Sivan Perwer, and Azad.\nCinema.\nThe main themes of Kurdish cinema are the poverty and hardship which ordinary Kurds have to endure. The first films featuring Kurdish culture were actually shot in Armenia. Zare, released in 1927, produced by Hamo Beknazarian, details the story of Zare and her love for the shepherd Seydo, and the difficulties the two experience by the hand of the village elder. In 1948 and 1959, two documentaries were made concerning the Yezidi Kurds in Armenia. These were joint Armenian-Kurdish productions; with H. Kocharyan and Heciye Cindi teaming up for \"The Kurds of Soviet Armenia\", and Ereb Samilov and C. Jamharyan for \"Kurds of Armenia\".\nThe first critically acclaimed and famous Kurdish films were produced by Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney. Initially a popular, award-winning actor in Turkey with the nickname \"\u00c7irkin Kral\" (\"the Ugly King\", after his rough looks), he spent the later part of his career producing socio-critical and politically loaded films. \"S\u00fcr\u00fc\" (1979), \"Yol\" (1982) and \"Duvar\" (1983) are his best-known works, of which the second won Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival of 1982, the most prestigious award in the world of cinema.\nAnother prominent Kurdish film director is Bahman Qubadi. His first feature film was \"A Time for Drunken Horses\", released in 2000. It was critically acclaimed and went on to win multiple awards. Other movies of his would follow this example, making him one of the best-known film producers of Iran of today. Recently, he released \"Rhinos Season\", starring Behrouz Vossoughi, Monica Bellucci and Yilmaz Erdogan, detailing the tumultuous life of a Kurdish poet.\nOther prominent Kurdish film directors that are critically acclaimed include Mahsun K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131g\u00fcl, Hiner Saleem and the aforementioned Yilmaz Erdogan. There's also been a number of films set or filmed in Kurdistan made by non-Kurdish film directors, such as \"The Wind Will Carry Us\", \"Triage\", \"The Exorcist\", and \"\".\nSports.\nThe most popular sport among the Kurds is football. Because the Kurds have no independent state, they have no representative team in FIFA or the AFC; however a team representing Iraqi Kurdistan has been active in the Viva World Cup since 2008. They became runners-up in 2009 and 2010, before ultimately becoming champion in 2012.\nOn a national level, the Kurdish clubs of Iraq have achieved success in recent years as well, winning the Iraqi Premier League four times in the last five years. Prominent clubs are Erbil SC, Duhok SC, Sulaymaniyah FC and Zakho FC.\nIn Turkey, a Kurd named Celal Ibrahim was one of the founders of Galatasaray S.K. in 1905, as well as one of the original players. The most prominent Kurdish-Turkish club is Diyarbakirspor. In the diaspora, the most successful Kurdish club is Dalkurd FF and the most famous player is Eren Derdiyok.\nAnother prominent sport is wrestling. In Iranian Wrestling, there are three styles originating from Kurdish regions: \nFurthermore, the most accredited of the traditional Iranian wrestling styles, the Bachoukheh, derives its name from a local Khorasani Kurdish costume in which it is practised.\nKurdish medalists in the 2012 Summer Olympics were Nur Tatar, Kianoush Rostami and Yezidi Misha Aloyan; who won medals in taekwondo, weightlifting and boxing, respectively.\nArchitecture.\nThe traditional Kurdish village has simple houses, made of mud. In most cases with flat, wooden roofs, and, if the village is built on the slope of a mountain, the roof on one house makes for the garden of the house one level higher. However, houses with a beehive-like roof, not unlike those in Harran, are also present.\nOver the centuries many Kurdish architectural marvels have been erected, with varying styles. Kurdistan boasts many examples from ancient Iranian, Roman, Greek and Semitic origin, most famous of these include Bisotun and Taq-e Bostan in Kermanshah, Takht-e Soleyman near Takab, Mount Nemrud near Adiyaman and the citadels of Erbil and Diyarbakir.\nThe first genuinely Kurdish examples extant were built in the 11th century. Those earliest examples consist of the Marwanid Dicle Bridge in Diyarbakir, the Shadaddid Minuchir Mosque in Ani, and the Hisn al Akrad near Homs.\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries the Ayyubid dynasty constructed many buildings throughout the Middle East, being influenced by their predecessors, the Fatimids, and their rivals, the Crusaders, whilst also developing their own techniques. Furthermore, women of the Ayyubid family took a prominent role in the patronage of new constructions. The Ayyubids' most famous works are the Halil-ur-Rahman Mosque that surrounds the Pool of Sacred Fish in Urfa, the Citadel of Cairo and most parts of the Citadel of Aleppo. Another important piece of Kurdish architectural heritage from the late 12th/early 13th centuries is the Yezidi pilgrimage site Lalish, with its trademark conical roofs.\nIn later periods too, Kurdish rulers and their corresponding dynasties and emirates would leave their mark upon the land in the form mosques, castles and bridges, some of which have decayed, or have been (partly) destroyed in an attempt to erase the Kurdish cultural heritage, such as the White Castle of the Bohtan Emirate. Well-known examples are Hosap Castle of the 17th century, Sherwana Castle of the early 18th century, and the Ellwen Bridge of Khanaqin of the 19th century.\nMost famous is the Ishak Pasha Palace of Dogubeyazit, a structure with heavy influences from both Anatolian and Iranian architectural traditions. Construction of the Palace began in 1685, led by Colak Abdi Pasha, a Kurdish bey of the Ottoman Empire, but the building would not be completed until 1784, by his grandson, Ishak Pasha. Containing almost 100 rooms, including a mosque, dining rooms, dungeons and being heavily decorated by hewn-out ornaments, this Palace has the reputation as being one of the finest pieces of architecture of the Ottoman Period, and of Anatolia.\nIn recent years, the KRG has been responsible for the renovation of several historical structures, such as Erbil Citadel and the Mudhafaria Minaret.\nGenetics.\nA 2005 study genetically examined three different groups of Zaza and Kurmanji speakers in Turkey and Kurmanji speakers in Georgia. In the study, mtDNA HV1 sequences, eleven Y chromosome bi-allelic markers and 9 Y-STR loci were analyzed to investigate lineage relationship among Kurdish groups. When both mtDNA and Y chromosome data are compared with those of the European, Caucasian, West Asian and Central Asian groups, it has been determined that the Kurdish groups are most closely related to West Asians and the furthest to Central Asians. Among the European and Caucasian groups, Kurds were found to be closer to Europeans than Caucasians when considering mtDNA, and the opposite was true for Y chromosome. This indicates a difference in maternal and paternal origins of Kurdish groups. According to the study, Kurdish groups in Georgia went through a genetic bottleneck while migrating to the Caucasus. It has also been revealed that these groups were not influenced by other Caucasian groups in terms of ancestry. Another phenomenon found in the research was that Zazas are closer to Kurdish groups rather than peoples of Northern Iran, where ancestral Zaza language hypothesized to be spoken before its spread to Anatolia.\n11 different Y-DNA haplogroups have been identified in Kurmanji-speaking Kurds in Turkey. Haplogroup I-M170 was the most prevalent with 16.1% of the samples belonging to it, followed by haplogroups J-M172 (13.8%), R1a1 (12.7%), K (12.7%), E (11.5%) and F (11.5%). P1 (8%), P (5.7%), R1 (4.6%), G (2.3%) and C (1.1%) haplogroups were also present in lower proportions. Y-DNA haplogroup diversity were determined to be much lower among Georgian Kurds, as five haplogroups were discovered in total, where the dominant haplogroups were P1 (44%) and J-M172 (32%). The lowest Y-DNA haplogroup diversity was observed in Turkmenistan Kurds with only 4 haplogroups in total; F (41%) and R1 (29%) were dominant in this population.\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In their setup, the vacuum has the usual 3 dimensions of space and one dimension of time but with another microscopic extra spatial dimension in the shape of a tiny circle. Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m had an earlier, similar idea. But in that case, a fifth component was added to the electromagnetic vector potential, representing the Newtonian gravitational potential, and writing the Maxwell equations in five dimensions.\nThe five-dimensional (5D) theory developed in three steps. The original hypothesis came from Theodor Kaluza, who sent his results to Albert Einstein in 1919 and published them in 1921. Kaluza presented a purely classical extension of general relativity to 5D, with a metric tensor of 15 components. Ten components are identified with the 4D spacetime metric, four components with the electromagnetic vector potential, and one component with an unidentified scalar field sometimes called the \"radion\" or the \"dilaton\". Correspondingly, the 5D Einstein equations yield the 4D Einstein field equations, the Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field, and an equation for the scalar field. Kaluza also introduced the \"cylinder condition\" hypothesis, that no component of the five-dimensional metric depends on the fifth dimension. Without this restriction, terms are introduced that involve derivatives of the fields with respect to the fifth coordinate, and this extra degree of freedom makes the mathematics of the fully variable 5D relativity enormously complex. Standard 4D physics seems to manifest this \"cylinder condition\" and, along with it, simpler mathematics.\nIn 1926, Oskar Klein gave Kaluza's classical five-dimensional theory a quantum interpretation, to accord with the then-recent discoveries of Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. Klein introduced the hypothesis that the fifth dimension was curled up and microscopic, to explain the cylinder condition. Klein suggested that the geometry of the extra fifth dimension could take the form of a circle, with the radius of . More precisely, the radius of the circular dimension is 23 times the Planck length, which in turn is of the order of . Klein also made a contribution to the classical theory by providing a properly normalized 5D metric. Work continued on the Kaluza field theory during the 1930s by Einstein and colleagues at Princeton University.\nIn the 1940s, the classical theory was completed, and the full field equations including the scalar field were obtained by three independent research groups: Yves Thiry, working in France on his dissertation under Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz; Pascual Jordan, G\u00fcnther Ludwig, and Claus M\u00fcller in Germany, with critical input from Wolfgang Pauli and Markus Fierz; and Paul Scherrer working alone in Switzerland. Jordan's work led to the scalar\u2013tensor theory of Brans\u2013Dicke; Carl H. Brans and Robert H. Dicke were apparently unaware of Thiry or Scherrer. The full Kaluza equations under the cylinder condition are quite complex, and most English-language reviews, as well as the English translations of Thiry, contain some errors. The curvature tensors for the complete Kaluza equations were evaluated using tensor-algebra software in 2015, verifying results of J. A. Ferrari and R. Coquereaux &amp; G. Esposito-Farese. The 5D covariant form of the energy\u2013momentum source terms is treated by L. L. Williams.\nKaluza hypothesis.\nIn his 1921 article, Kaluza established all the elements of the classical five-dimensional theory: the Kaluza\u2013Klein metric, the Kaluza\u2013Klein\u2013Einstein field equations, the equations of motion, the stress\u2013energy tensor, and the cylinder condition. With no free parameters, it merely extends general relativity to five dimensions. One starts by hypothesizing a form of the five-dimensional Kaluza\u2013Klein metric formula_1, where Latin indices span five dimensions. Let one also introduce the four-dimensional spacetime metric formula_2, where Greek indices span the usual four dimensions of space and time; a 4-vector formula_3 identified with the electromagnetic vector potential; and a scalar field formula_4. Then decompose the 5D metric so that the 4D metric is framed by the electromagnetic vector potential, with the scalar field at the fifth diagonal. This can be visualized as\n formula_5\nOne can write more precisely\n formula_6\nwhere the index formula_7 indicates the fifth coordinate by convention, even though the first four coordinates are indexed with 0, 1, 2, and 3. The associated inverse metric is\n formula_8\nThis decomposition is quite general, and all terms are dimensionless. Kaluza then applies the machinery of standard general relativity to this metric. The field equations are obtained from five-dimensional Einstein equations, and the equations of motion from the five-dimensional geodesic hypothesis. The resulting field equations provide both the equations of general relativity and of electrodynamics; the equations of motion provide the four-dimensional geodesic equation and the Lorentz force law, and one finds that electric charge is identified with motion in the fifth dimension.\nThe hypothesis for the metric implies an invariant five-dimensional length element formula_9:\n formula_10\nField equations from the Kaluza hypothesis.\nThe Kaluza\u2013Klein\u2013Einstein field equations of the five-dimensional theory were never adequately provided by Kaluza or Klein because they ignored the scalar field. The full Kaluza field equations are generally attributed to Thiry, who obtained vacuum field equations, although Kaluza originally provided a stress\u2013energy tensor for his theory, and Thiry included a stress\u2013energy tensor in his thesis. But as described by Gonner, several independent groups worked on the field equations in the 1940s and earlier. Thiry is perhaps best known only because an English translation was provided by Applequist, Chodos, &amp; Freund in their review book. Applequist et al. also provided an English translation of Kaluza's article. Translations of the three (1946, 1947, 1948) Jordan articles can be found on the ResearchGate and Academia.edu archives. The first correct English-language Kaluza field equations, including the scalar field, were provided by Williams.\nTo obtain the 5D Kaluza\u2013Klein\u2013Einstein field equations, the 5D Kaluza\u2013Klein\u2013Christoffel symbols formula_11 are calculated from the 5D Kaluza\u2013Klein metric formula_12, and the 5D Kaluza\u2013Klein\u2013Ricci tensor formula_13 is calculated from the 5D connections.\nThe classic results of Thiry and other authors presume the cylinder condition:\n formula_14\nWithout this assumption, the field equations become much more complex, providing many more degrees of freedom that can be identified with various new fields. Paul Wesson and colleagues have pursued relaxation of the cylinder condition to gain extra terms that can be identified with the matter fields, for which Kaluza otherwise inserted a stress\u2013energy tensor by hand.\nIt has been an objection to the original Kaluza hypothesis to invoke the fifth dimension only to negate its dynamics. But Thiry argued that the interpretation of the Lorentz force law in terms of a five-dimensional geodesic militates strongly for a fifth dimension irrespective of the cylinder condition. Most authors have therefore employed the cylinder condition in deriving the field equations. Furthermore, vacuum equations are typically assumed for which\n formula_15\nwhere\n formula_16\nand\n formula_17\nThe vacuum field equations obtained in this way by Thiry and Jordan's group are as follows.\nThe field equation for formula_4 is obtained from\n formula_19\nwhere formula_20 formula_21 and formula_22 is a standard, 4D covariant derivative. It shows that the electromagnetic field is a source for the scalar field. Note that the scalar field cannot be set to a constant without constraining the electromagnetic field. The earlier treatments by Kaluza and Klein did not have an adequate description of the scalar field and did not realize the implied constraint on the electromagnetic field by assuming the scalar field to be constant.\nThe field equation for formula_23 is obtained from\n formula_24\nIt has the form of the vacuum Maxwell equations if the scalar field is constant.\nThe field equation for the 4D Ricci tensor formula_25 is obtained from\n formula_26\nwhere formula_27 is the standard 4D Ricci scalar.\nThis equation shows the remarkable result, called the \"Kaluza miracle\", that the precise form for the electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor emerges from the 5D vacuum equations as a source in the 4D equations: field from the vacuum. This relation allows the definitive identification of formula_28 with the electromagnetic vector potential. Therefore, the field needs to be rescaled with a conversion constant formula_29 such that formula_30.\nThe relation above shows that we must have\n formula_31\nwhere formula_32 is the gravitational constant, and formula_33 is the permeability of free space. In the Kaluza theory, the gravitational constant can be understood as an electromagnetic coupling constant in the metric. There is also a stress\u2013energy tensor for the scalar field. The scalar field behaves like a variable gravitational constant, in terms of modulating the coupling of electromagnetic stress\u2013energy to spacetime curvature. The sign of formula_34 in the metric is fixed by correspondence with 4D theory so that electromagnetic energy densities are positive. It is often assumed that the fifth coordinate is spacelike in its signature in the metric.\nIn the presence of matter, the 5D vacuum condition cannot be assumed. Indeed, Kaluza did not assume it. The full field equations require evaluation of the 5D Kaluza\u2013Klein\u2013Einstein tensor\n formula_35\nas seen in the recovery of the electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor above. The 5D curvature tensors are complex, and most English-language reviews contain errors in either formula_36 or formula_13, as does the English translation of Thiry. In 2015, a complete set of 5D curvature tensors under the cylinder condition, evaluated using tensor-algebra software, was produced.\nEquations of motion from the Kaluza hypothesis.\nThe equations of motion are obtained from the five-dimensional geodesic hypothesis in terms of a 5-velocity formula_38:\n formula_39\nThis equation can be recast in several ways, and it has been studied in various forms by authors including Kaluza, Pauli, Gross &amp; Perry, Gegenberg &amp; Kunstatter, and Wesson &amp; Ponce de Leon, but it is instructive to convert it back to the usual 4-dimensional length element formula_40, which is related to the 5-dimensional length element formula_9 as given above:\n formula_42\nThen the 5D geodesic equation can be written for the spacetime components of the 4-velocity:\nformula_43\nformula_44\nThe term quadratic in formula_45 provides the 4D geodesic equation plus some electromagnetic terms:\n formula_46\nThe term linear in formula_45 provides the Lorentz force law:\n formula_48\nThis is another expression of the \"Kaluza miracle\". The same hypothesis for the 5D metric that provides electromagnetic stress\u2013energy in the Einstein equations, also provides the Lorentz force law in the equation of motions along with the 4D geodesic equation. Yet correspondence with the Lorentz force law requires that we identify the component of 5-velocity along the fifth dimension with electric charge:\nformula_49\nwhere formula_50 is particle mass, and formula_51 is particle electric charge. Thus electric charge is understood as motion along the fifth dimension. The fact that the Lorentz force law could be understood as a geodesic in five dimensions was to Kaluza a primary motivation for considering the five-dimensional hypothesis, even in the presence of the aesthetically unpleasing cylinder condition.\nYet there is a problem: the term quadratic in formula_52,\n formula_53\nIf there is no gradient in the scalar field, the term quadratic in formula_52 vanishes. But otherwise the expression above implies\n formula_55\nFor elementary particles, formula_56. The term quadratic in formula_52 should dominate the equation, perhaps in contradiction to experience. This was the main shortfall of the five-dimensional theory as Kaluza saw it, and he gives it some discussion in his original article.\nThe equation of motion for formula_52 is particularly simple under the cylinder condition. Start with the alternate form of the geodesic equation, written for the covariant 5-velocity:\n formula_59\nThis means that under the cylinder condition, formula_60 is a constant of the five-dimensional motion:\n formula_61\nKaluza's hypothesis for the matter stress\u2013energy tensor.\nKaluza proposed a five-dimensional matter stress tensor formula_62 of the form\n formula_63\nwhere formula_64 is a density, and the length element formula_9 is as defined above.\nThen the spacetime component gives a typical \"dust\" stress\u2013energy tensor:\n formula_66\nThe mixed component provides a 4-current source for the Maxwell equations:\n formula_67\nJust as the five-dimensional metric comprises the four-dimensional metric framed by the electromagnetic vector potential, the five-dimensional stress\u2013energy tensor comprises the four-dimensional stress\u2013energy tensor framed by the vector 4-current.\nQuantum interpretation of Klein.\nKaluza's original hypothesis was purely classical and extended discoveries of general relativity. By the time of Klein's contribution, the discoveries of Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger, and Louis de Broglie were receiving a lot of attention. Klein's \"Nature\" article suggested that the fifth dimension is closed and periodic, and that the identification of electric charge with motion in the fifth dimension can be interpreted as standing waves of wavelength formula_68, much like the electrons around a nucleus in the Bohr model of the atom. The quantization of electric charge could then be nicely understood in terms of integer multiples of fifth-dimensional momentum. Combining the previous Kaluza result for formula_52 in terms of electric charge, and a de Broglie relation for momentum formula_70, Klein obtained an expression for the 0th mode of such waves:\n formula_71\nwhere formula_72 is the Planck constant. Klein found that formula_73\u00a0cm, and thereby an explanation for the cylinder condition in this small value.\nKlein's \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik\" article of the same year, gave a more detailed treatment that explicitly invoked the techniques of Schr\u00f6dinger and de Broglie. It recapitulated much of the classical theory of Kaluza described above, and then departed into Klein's quantum interpretation. Klein solved a Schr\u00f6dinger-like wave equation using an expansion in terms of fifth-dimensional waves resonating in the closed, compact fifth dimension.\nGroup theory interpretation.\nIn 1926, Oskar Klein proposed that the fourth spatial dimension is curled up in a circle of a very small radius, so that a particle moving a short distance along that axis would return to where it began. The distance a particle can travel before reaching its initial position is said to be the size of the dimension. This extra dimension is a compact set, and construction of this compact dimension is referred to as compactification.\nIn modern geometry, the extra fifth dimension can be understood to be the circle group U(1), as electromagnetism can essentially be formulated as a gauge theory on a fiber bundle, the circle bundle, with gauge group U(1). In Kaluza\u2013Klein theory this group suggests that gauge symmetry is the symmetry of circular compact dimensions. Once this geometrical interpretation is understood, it is relatively straightforward to replace U(1) by a general Lie group. Such generalizations are often called Yang\u2013Mills theories. If a distinction is drawn, then it is that Yang\u2013Mills theories occur on a flat spacetime, whereas Kaluza\u2013Klein treats the more general case of curved spacetime. The base space of Kaluza\u2013Klein theory need not be four-dimensional spacetime; it can be any (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, or even a supersymmetric manifold or orbifold or even a noncommutative space.\nThe construction can be outlined, roughly, as follows. One starts by considering a principal fiber bundle \"P\" with gauge group \"G\" over a manifold M. Given a connection on the bundle, and a metric on the base manifold, and a gauge invariant metric on the tangent of each fiber, one can construct a bundle metric defined on the entire bundle. Computing the scalar curvature of this bundle metric, one finds that it is constant on each fiber: this is the \"Kaluza miracle\". One did not have to explicitly impose a cylinder condition, or to compactify: by assumption, the gauge group is already compact. Next, one takes this scalar curvature as the Lagrangian density, and, from this, constructs the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action for the bundle, as a whole. The equations of motion, the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations, can be then obtained by considering where the action is stationary with respect to variations of either the metric on the base manifold, or of the gauge connection. Variations with respect to the base metric gives the Einstein field equations on the base manifold, with the energy\u2013momentum tensor given by the curvature (field strength) of the gauge connection. On the flip side, the action is stationary against variations of the gauge connection precisely when the gauge connection solves the Yang\u2013Mills equations. Thus, by applying a single idea: the principle of least action, to a single quantity: the scalar curvature on the bundle (as a whole), one obtains simultaneously all of the needed field equations, for both the spacetime and the gauge field.\nAs an approach to the unification of the forces, it is straightforward to apply the Kaluza\u2013Klein theory in an attempt to unify gravity with the strong and electroweak forces by using the symmetry group of the Standard Model, SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1). However, an attempt to convert this interesting geometrical construction into a bona-fide model of reality flounders on a number of issues, including the fact that the fermions must be introduced in an artificial way (in nonsupersymmetric models). Nonetheless, KK remains an important touchstone in theoretical physics and is often embedded in more sophisticated theories. It is studied in its own right as an object of geometric interest in K-theory.\nEven in the absence of a completely satisfying theoretical physics framework, the idea of exploring extra, compactified, dimensions is of considerable interest in the experimental physics and astrophysics communities. A variety of predictions, with real experimental consequences, can be made (in the case of large extra dimensions and warped models). For example, on the simplest of principles, one might expect to have standing waves in the extra compactified dimension(s). If a spatial extra dimension is of radius \"R\", the invariant mass of such standing waves would be \"M\"\"n\" = \"nh\"/\"Rc\" with \"n\" an integer, \"h\" being the Planck constant and \"c\" the speed of light. This set of possible mass values is often called the Kaluza\u2013Klein tower. Similarly, in Thermal quantum field theory a compactification of the euclidean time dimension leads to the Matsubara frequencies and thus to a discretized thermal energy spectrum.\nHowever, Klein's approach to a quantum theory is flawed and, for example, leads to a calculated electron mass in the order of magnitude of the Planck mass.\nExamples of experimental pursuits include work by the CDF collaboration, which has re-analyzed particle collider data for the signature of effects associated with large extra dimensions/warped models.\nRobert Brandenberger and Cumrun Vafa have speculated that in the early universe, cosmic inflation causes three of the space dimensions to expand to cosmological size while the remaining dimensions of space remained microscopic.\nSpace\u2013time\u2013matter theory.\nOne particular variant of Kaluza\u2013Klein theory is space\u2013time\u2013matter theory or induced matter theory, chiefly promulgated by Paul Wesson and other members of the Space\u2013Time\u2013Matter Consortium. In this version of the theory, it is noted that solutions to the equation\n formula_74\nmay be re-expressed so that in four dimensions, these solutions satisfy Einstein's equations\n formula_75\nwith the precise form of the \"T\"\"\u03bc\u03bd\" following from the Ricci-flat condition on the five-dimensional space. In other words, the cylinder condition of the previous development is dropped, and the stress\u2013energy now comes from the derivatives of the 5D metric with respect to the fifth coordinate. Because the energy\u2013momentum tensor is normally understood to be due to concentrations of matter in four-dimensional space, the above result is interpreted as saying that four-dimensional matter is induced from geometry in five-dimensional space.\nIn particular, the soliton solutions of formula_74 can be shown to contain the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric in both radiation-dominated (early universe) and matter-dominated (later universe) forms. The general equations can be shown to be sufficiently consistent with classical tests of general relativity to be acceptable on physical principles, while still leaving considerable freedom to also provide interesting cosmological models.\nGeometric interpretation.\nThe Kaluza\u2013Klein theory has a particularly elegant presentation in terms of geometry. In a certain sense, it looks just like ordinary gravity in free space, except that it is phrased in five dimensions instead of four.\nEinstein equations.\nThe equations governing ordinary gravity in free space can be obtained from an action, by applying the variational principle to a certain action. Let \"M\" be a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, which may be taken as the spacetime of general relativity. If \"g\" is the metric on this manifold, one defines the action \"S\"(\"g\") as\n formula_77\nwhere \"R\"(\"g\") is the scalar curvature, and vol(\"g\") is the volume element. By applying the variational principle to the action\n formula_78\none obtains precisely the Einstein equations for free space:\n formula_79\nwhere \"R\"\"ij\" is the Ricci tensor.\nMaxwell equations.\nBy contrast, the Maxwell equations describing electromagnetism can be understood to be the Hodge equations of a principal formula_80-bundle or circle bundle formula_81 with fiber formula_80. That is, the electromagnetic field formula_83 is a harmonic 2-form in the space formula_84 of differentiable 2-forms on the manifold formula_85. In the absence of charges and currents, the free-field Maxwell equations are\n formula_86\nwhere formula_87 is the Hodge star operator.\nKaluza\u2013Klein geometry.\nTo build the Kaluza\u2013Klein theory, one picks an invariant metric on the circle formula_88 that is the fiber of the U(1)-bundle of electromagnetism. In this discussion, an \"invariant metric\" is simply one that is invariant under rotations of the circle. Suppose that this metric gives the circle a total length formula_89. One then considers metrics formula_90 on the bundle formula_91 that are consistent with both the fiber metric, and the metric on the underlying manifold formula_85. The consistency conditions are:\nThe Kaluza\u2013Klein action for such a metric is given by\n formula_102\nThe scalar curvature, written in components, then expands to\n formula_103\nwhere formula_104 is the pullback of the fiber bundle projection formula_105. The connection formula_106 on the fiber bundle is related to the electromagnetic field strength as\nformula_107\nThat there always exists such a connection, even for fiber bundles of arbitrarily complex topology, is a result from homology and specifically, K-theory. Applying Fubini's theorem and integrating on the fiber, one gets\n formula_108\nVarying the action with respect to the component formula_106, one regains the Maxwell equations. Applying the variational principle to the base metric formula_99, one gets the Einstein equations\n formula_111\nwith the electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor being given by\n formula_112\nThe original theory identifies formula_89 with the fiber metric formula_114 and allows formula_89 to vary from fiber to fiber. In this case, the coupling between gravity and the electromagnetic field is not constant, but has its own dynamical field, the radion.\nGeneralizations.\nIn the above, the size of the loop formula_89 acts as a coupling constant between the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field. If the base manifold is four-dimensional, the Kaluza\u2013Klein manifold \"P\" is five-dimensional. The fifth dimension is a compact space and is called the compact dimension. The technique of introducing compact dimensions to obtain a higher-dimensional manifold is referred to as compactification. Compactification does not produce group actions on chiral fermions except in very specific cases: the dimension of the total space must be 2 mod 8, and the G-index of the Dirac operator of the compact space must be nonzero.\nThe above development generalizes in a more-or-less straightforward fashion to general principal \"G\"-bundles for some arbitrary Lie group \"G\" taking the place of U(1). In such a case, the theory is often referred to as a Yang\u2013Mills theory and is sometimes taken to be synonymous. If the underlying manifold is supersymmetric, the resulting theory is a super-symmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory.\nEmpirical tests.\nNo experimental or observational signs of extra dimensions have been officially reported. Many theoretical search techniques for detecting Kaluza\u2013Klein resonances have been proposed using the mass couplings of such resonances with the top quark. An analysis of results from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in December 2010 severely constrains theories with large extra dimensions.\nThe observation of a Higgs-like boson at the LHC establishes a new empirical test which can be applied to the search for Kaluza\u2013Klein resonances and supersymmetric particles.\nThe loop Feynman diagrams that exist in the Higgs interactions allow any particle with electric charge and mass to run in such a loop. Standard Model particles besides the top quark and W boson do not make big contributions to the cross-section observed in the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay, but if there are new particles beyond the Standard Model, they could potentially change the ratio of the predicted Standard Model H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 cross-section to the experimentally observed cross-section. Hence a measurement of any dramatic change to the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 cross-section predicted by the Standard Model is crucial in probing the physics beyond it.\nAn article from July 2018 gives some hope for this theory; in the article they dispute that gravity is leaking into higher dimensions as in brane theory. However, the article does demonstrate that electromagnetism and gravity share the same number of dimensions, and this fact lends support to Kaluza\u2013Klein theory; whether the number of dimensions is really 3\u00a0+\u00a01 or in fact 4\u00a0+\u00a01 is the subject of further debate.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its summit lies at in a section of the Himalayas, the \"Kangchenjunga Himal\", which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River, in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. It lies in the border region between Koshi Province of Nepal and Sikkim state of India, with the West and Kangbachen peaks located in Nepal's Taplejung District and the Main, Central and South peaks directly on the border.\nUntil 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world. However, precise calculations and meticulous measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga is the third-highest mountain in the world.\nKangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of the Kingdom of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate. The Indian side of the mountain is off limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nEtymology.\n\"Kangchenjunga\" is the official spelling adopted by Douglas Freshfield, Alexander Mitchell Kellas and the Royal Geographical Society, and provides the most accurate English rendition of the Tibetan pronunciation. Freshfield referred to the spelling used by the Indian Government since the late 19th century. Alternative spellings include Kanchenjunga, Khangchendzonga and Kangchendz\u00f6nga.\nThe brothers Hermann, Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit explained the local name 'Kanchinj\u00ednga', meaning \"the five treasures of the high snow\", as originating from the Tibetan words \"gangs\" , meaning snow and ice; \"chen\", meaning great; \"mdzod\", meaning treasure; and \"lnga\", meaning five.\nThe local Lhopo people believe that the treasures are hidden but reveal themselves to the devout when the world is in peril; the treasures comprise salt, gold, turquoise and precious stones, sacred scriptures, invincible armor or ammunition, grain and medicine.\nGeography.\nThe \"Kangchenjunga Himal\" section of the Himalayas lies both in Nepal and India and encompasses 16 peaks over . In the north, it is limited by the Lhonak Chu, Goma Chu and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and Tamur. It lies in the border region between Koshi Province of Nepal and Sikkim state of India, with the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District, and three of the five peaks, namely Main, Central and South, directly on the border.\nKanchenjunga rises about south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range, about east-southeast of Mount Everest in a straight line. South of the southern face of Kanchenjunga runs the high Singalila Ridge that separates Sikkim from Nepal and northern West Bengal. Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain after Everest and K2 of Karakoram.\nKangchenjunga and its satellite peaks form a huge mountain massif. The massif's five highest peaks are listed in the table at the end of this section.\nThe main ridge of the massif runs from north-northeast to south-southwest and forms a watershed to several rivers. The main ridge intersects with other ridges running roughly from east to west to form a giant cross. These ridges contain a host of peaks between . The northern section includes Yalung Kang, Kangchenjunga Central and South, Kangbachen, Kirat Chuli and Gimmigela Chuli, and runs up to the Jongsang La. The eastern ridge in Sikkim includes Siniolchu. The southern section runs along the Nepal\u2013Sikkim border and includes Kabru I to III. This ridge extends southwards to the Singalila Ridge. The western ridge culminates in the Kumbhakarna, also known as Jannu.\nFour main glaciers radiate from the peak, pointing roughly to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. The Zemu glacier in the northeast and the Talung glacier in the southeast drain to the Teesta River; the Yalung glacier in the southwest and the Kangchen glacier in the northwest drain to the Arun River and Kosi River.\nThe glaciers spread over the area above approximately , and the glacialized area covers about in total. There are 120 glaciers in the Kanchenjunga Himal, of which 17 are debris-covered. Between 1958 and 1992, more than half of 57 examined glaciers had retreated, possibly due to global warming.\nKangchenjunga Main is the highest elevation of the Brahmaputra River basin, which forms part of the southeast Asian monsoon regime and is among the globally largest river basins. Kangchenjunga is one of six peaks above located in the basin of the Kosi River, which is among the largest tributaries of the Ganges. The Kangchenjunga massif forms also part of the Ganges Basin.\nAlthough it is the third highest peak in the world, Kangchenjunga is only ranked 29th by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. The key col for Kangchenjunga lies at a height of , along the watershed boundary between Arun and Brahmaputra rivers in Tibet. It is, however, the fourth-most-prominent peak in the Himalayas, after Everest, and the western and eastern anchors of the Himalaya, Nanga Parbat and Namcha Barwa, respectively.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProtected areas.\nThe Kangchenjunga landscape is a complex of three distinct ecoregions: the eastern Himalayan broad-leaved and coniferous forests, the Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands. The Kangchenjunga transboundary landscape is shared by Nepal, India, Bhutan and China, and comprises 14 protected areas with a total of :\nThese protected areas are habitats for many globally significant plant species such as rhododendrons and orchids and many endangered flagship species such as snow leopard (\"Panthera uncia\"), Asian black bear (\"Ursus thibetanus\"), red panda (\"Ailurus fulgens\"), white-bellied musk deer (\"Moschus leucogaster\"), blood pheasant (\"Ithaginis cruentus\") and chestnut-breasted partridge (\"Arborophila mandellii\").\nClimbing routes.\nThere are four climbing routes to reach the summit of Kangchenjunga, three of which are in Nepal from the southwest, northwest, and northeast, and one from northeastern Sikkim in India. To date, the northeastern route from Sikkim has been successfully used only three times. The Indian government has banned expeditions to Kangchenjunga; therefore, this route has been closed since 2000.\nClimbing history.\nFirst ascent.\nIn 1955, Joe Brown and George Band made the first ascent on 25 May, followed by Norman Hardie and Tony Streather on 26 May. The full team also included John Clegg (team doctor), Charles Evans (team leader), John Angelo Jackson, Neil Mather and Tom Mackinnon. The team first made an attempt on the line which John Kempe's party had reconnoitered the previous year. Because of the difficulties on that line they turned to the Yalung Face, which had first been explored by Aleister Crowley's party in 1905. The route starts on the Yalung Glacier to the southwest of the peak, and climbs the Yalung Face, which is high. The main feature of this face is the \"Great Shelf\", a large sloping plateau at around , covered by a hanging glacier. The route is almost entirely on snow, glacier and one icefall; the summit ridge itself can involve a small amount of travel on rock. The first ascent expedition made six camps above their base camp, two below the Shelf, two on it, and two above it. They started on 18 April, and everyone was back to base camp by 28 May. Other members of this expedition included John Angelo Jackson and Tom Mackinnon.\nOther notable ascents.\nDespite improved climbing gear the fatality rate of climbers attempting to summit Kanchenjunga is high. Since the 1990s, more than 20% of people have died while climbing Kanchenjunga's main peak.\nIn myth.\nThe area around Kangchenjunga is said to be home to a mountain deity, called \"Dz\u00f6-nga\" or \"Kangchenjunga Demon\", a type of yeti or rakshasa. A British geological expedition in 1925 spotted a bipedal creature which they asked the locals about, who referred to it as the \"Kangchenjunga Demon\".\nFor generations, there have been legends recounted by the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. These stories are well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the Lepcha people and Limbu people, and those of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as Beyul Demoshong. In 1962, a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga, to \"open the way\" to Beyul Demoshong.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nThe above \"Himalayan Journal\" references were all also reproduced in the \"50th Anniversary of the First Ascent of Kangchenjunga\" The Himalayan Club, Kolkata Section 2005."}
