{"id": "17965", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17965", "title": "Louis Leakey", "text": "British archaeologist and naturalist (1903\u20131972)\nLouis Seymour Bazett Leakey (7 August 1903 \u2013 1 October 1972) was a Kenyan-British palaeoanthropologist and archaeologist whose work was important in demonstrating that humans evolved in Africa, particularly through discoveries made at Olduvai Gorge with his wife, fellow palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey. Having established a programme of palaeoanthropological inquiry in eastern Africa, he also motivated many future generations to continue this scholarly work. Several members of the Leakey family became prominent scholars themselves.\nAnother of Leakey's legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he saw as key to understanding human evolution. He personally focused on three female researchers, Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birut\u0117 Galdikas, calling them \"The Trimates.\" Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology. Leakey also encouraged and supported many other PhD candidates, most notably from the University of Cambridge. As well, Leakey played a role in creating organisations for future research in Africa and for protecting wildlife there.\nBackground.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I think back... of the serval cat and a baboon that I had as pets in my childhood days\u2014and that eventually I had to house in large cages\u2014it makes me sad. It makes me sadder still, however, and also very angry, when I think of the innumerable adult animals and birds deliberately caught and locked up for the so-called 'pleasure' and 'education' of thoughtless human beings.\u2014\u200a\nLeakey's parents, Harry (1868\u20131940) and Mary (May) Bazett Leakey (died 1948), were Church of England missionaries in British East Africa (now Kenya). Harry was the son of James Shirley Leakey (1824\u20131871), one of the eleven children of the portrait painter James Leakey. Harry Leakey was assigned to an established post of the Church Mission Society among the Kikuyu at Kabete, in the highlands north of Nairobi. The station was at that time a hut and two tents. Leakey's earliest home had an earthen floor, a leaky thatched roof, rodents and insects, and no heating system except for charcoal braziers. The facilities slowly improved over time. The mission, a centre of activity, set up a clinic in one of the tents, and later a girls' school. Harry was working on a translation of the Bible into the Gikuyu language. He had a distinguished career in the CMS, becoming canon of the station.\nLeakey had a younger brother, Douglas, and two older sisters, Gladys and Julia. Both sisters married missionaries: Gladys married Leonard Beecher, Anglican Bishop of Mombasa and then Archbishop of East Africa from 1960 to 1970; Julia married Lawrence Barham, the second Bishop of Rwanda and Burundi from 1964 to 1966; their son Ken Barham was later the Bishop of Cyangugu in Rwanda.\nThe Leakey household came to contain Miss Oakes (a governess), Miss Higgenbotham (another missionary), and Mariamu (a Kikuyu nurse). Leakey grew up, played, and learned to hunt with the native Kikuyus. He also learned to walk with the distinctive gait of the Kikuyu and speak their language fluently, as did his siblings. He was initiated into the Kikuyu ethnic group, an event of which he never spoke, as he was sworn to secrecy.\nLeakey requested and was given permission to build and move into a Kikuyu~style hut at the end of the garden. It was home to his personal collection of natural objects, such as birds' eggs and skulls. All the children developed a keen interest in and appreciation of the pristine natural surroundings in which they found themselves. They raised baby animals, later turning them over to zoos. Leakey read a gift book, \"Days Before History\", by H. R. Hall (1907), a juvenile fictional work illustrating the prehistory of Britain. He began to collect tools and was further encouraged in this activity by a role model, Arthur Loveridge, the first curator (1914) of the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, the predecessor of the Coryndon Museum. This interest may have predisposed him toward a career in archaeology. His father was also a role model: Canon Leakey co-founded East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society.\nNeither Harry nor May were of strong constitution. From 1904 to 1906 the entire family lived back in England, at May's mother's house in Reading, Berkshire, while Harry recovered from neurasthenia, and again in 1911\u20131913, while May recovered from general frailty and exhaustion. During the latter stay, Harry bought a house in Boscombe, Hampshire.\nFormative years.\nAttendance at Cambridge.\nIn Britain, the Leakey children attended primary school; in Africa, they had a tutor. The family spent World War I in Africa. When the sea lanes opened again in 1919, they returned to Boscombe, and Leakey was sent to Weymouth College, a private boys' school, when he was 16 years old. He did not do well and, in about three years, complained of bullying and rules that he considered an infringement on his freedom. Advised by one teacher to seek employment in a bank, he secured help from an English teacher in applying to St John's College, Cambridge. He received a scholarship for his high scores on the entrance exams.\nLeakey matriculated at the University of Cambridge, his father's alma mater, in 1922, intending to become a missionary to British East Africa.\nThe resourceful Leakey convinced Cambridge authorities to accept Kikuyu for a modern language requirement, which led to the tall tale that he had \"examined himself\" in the language.\nArchaeological and palaeontological research.\nIn 1922, the British had been awarded German East Africa as part of the settlement of World War I. Within the Tanganyika Territory the Germans had discovered a site rich in dinosaur fossils, Tendaguru. Leakey was told by C. W. Hobley, a friend of the family, that the British Museum of Natural History was going to send a fossil-hunting expedition led by William E. Cutler to the site. Leakey applied and was hired to locate the site and manage the administrative details. In 1924 they departed for Africa. They never found a complete dinosaur skeleton, and Leakey was recalled from the site by Cambridge in 1925.\nLeakey switched his focus to anthropology, and found a new mentor in Alfred Cort Haddon, head of the Cambridge department. In 1926, Leakey graduated with a \"double first\", one of the highest degree results awarded, in archaeology and anthropology. He had used some of his preexisting qualifications; for example, Kikuyu was offered and accepted as the second modern language in which he was required to be proficient, even though no one there could test him on it. The university accepted an affidavit from a Kikuyu chief signed with a thumbprint.\nFrom 1925 on Leakey lectured and wrote on African archaeological and palaeontological topics. On graduation he was such a respected figure that Cambridge sent him to East Africa to study prehistoric African humans. He excavated dozens of sites, undertaking for the first time a systematic study of the artefacts. Some of his names for archaeological cultures are still in use; for example, the Elmenteitan.\nResearch Fellow.\nIn 1927, Leakey received a visit at a site called Gamble's Cave, near Lake Elmenteita, by two women on a holiday, one of whom was Frida Avern (1902\u20131993). Avern had done some coursework in archaeology. Leakey and Frida began a relationship, which continued upon his return to Cambridge. In 1928, they married and continued work near Lake Elmenteita. Finds from Gamble's Cave were donated by Leakey to the British Museum in 1931. At that time he discovered the Acheulean site of Kariandusi, which he excavated in 1928.\nOn the strength of his work there, he obtained a post-graduate research fellowship at St. John's College and returned to Cambridge in 1929 to classify and prepare the finds from Elmenteita. His patron and mentor at Cambridge was now Arthur Keith. While cleaning two skeletons he had found, he noticed a similarity to one found in Olduvai Gorge by Professor Hans Reck, a German national, whom Leakey had met in 1925 in Germany while on business for Keith.\nThe geology of Olduvai was known. In 1913, Reck had extricated a skeleton from Bed II in the gorge wall. He argued that it must have the date of the bed, which was believed to be 600,000 years, in the mid-Pleistocene. Early dates for human evolution were not widely accepted at the time, and Reck became involved in a media uproar. He was barred from going back to settle the question by the war and then the terms of the transfer of Tanganyika from Germany to Britain. In 1929, Leakey visited Berlin to talk to the now sceptical Reck. Noting an Acheulean tool in Reck's collection of artefacts from Olduvai, he bet Reck he could find ancient stone tools at Olduvai within 24 hours.\nLeakey received his PhD in 1930 at the age of 27. His first child, a daughter named Priscilla Muthoni Leakey, was born in 1931. His headaches and epilepsy returned, and he was prescribed Luminal, which he took for the rest of his life.\nReversals of fortune.\nDefence of Reck.\nIn November 1931, Leakey led an expedition to Olduvai whose members included Reck, whom Leakey allowed to enter the gorge first. Leakey had bet Reck that Leakey would find Acheulean tools within the first 24 hours, which he did. These verified the provenance of the 1913 find, now called Olduvai Man. Non-humanoid fossils and tools were extracted from the ground in large numbers. Frida delayed joining her husband and was less enthusiastic about him on behalf of Priscilla. She did arrive eventually, however, and Leakey put her to work. Frida's site became FLK, for Frida Leakey's Karongo (\"gully\").\nIn Cambridge, the sceptics were not impressed. To find additional supporting evidence of the antiquity of Reck's Olduvai Man, Leakey returned to Africa, excavating at Kanam and Kanjera. He easily found more fossils, which he named Homo kanamensis (Now considered a synonym of \"Homo sapiens\"). While he was gone, the opposition worked up some \"evidence\" of the intrusion of Olduvai Man into an earlier layer, evidence that seemed convincing at the time, but is missing and unverifiable now. On his return, Leakey's finds were carefully examined by a committee of 26 scientists and were tentatively accepted as valid.\nScandal.\nFollowing their marriage in 1928, Leakey and Frida lived in Foxton near Cambridge. In November 1932, Frida used an inheritance to purchase a large brick-built house in Girton, which the family named \"The Close\".\nThe following year, Frida was pregnant, suffered from morning sickness most of the time, and was unable to work on the illustrations for Leakey's second book, \"Adam's Ancestors.\" At a dinner party given in his honour, after a lecture of his at the Royal Anthropological Institute, Gertrude Caton-Thompson introduced her own illustrator, the twenty-year-old Mary Nicol. Leakey convinced Mary to take on the illustration of his book, and a few months later companionship turned into an affair. Frida gave birth to Colin in December 1933, and the next month Leakey left her and his newborn son. She would not sue for divorce until 1936.\nA panel at Cambridge investigated his morals. Grants dried up, but his mother raised enough money for another expedition to Olduvai, Kanam, and Kanjera, the latter two on the Winam Gulf. His previous work there was questioned by P. G. H. Boswell, whom he invited to verify the sites for himself. Arriving at Kanam and Kanjera in 1935, they found that the iron markers Leakey had used to mark the sites had been removed by the Luo tribe for use as spears and the sites could not now be located. To make matters worse, all the photographs Leakey took were ruined by a light leak in the camera. After a frustrating and fruitless two-month search, Boswell left for England, promising, as Leakey understood it, not to publish a word until Leakey returned.\nBoswell immediately set out to publish as much as he was able, beginning with a letter in \"Nature\" dated 9 March 1935, destroying Reck's and Leakey's dates of the fossils and questioning Leakey's competence. Despite the searches for the iron markers, Boswell averred that \"the earlier expedition (of 1931\u201332) neither marked the localities on the ground nor recorded the sites on a map.\" In a field report of March 1935, Leakey accused Boswell of reneging on his word, but Boswell asserted he had made no such promise, and now having public opinion on his side, warned Leakey to withdraw the claim. Leakey was not only forced to retract the accusation in his final field report in June 1935 but also to recant his support of Reck. Leakey was finished at Cambridge: even his mentors turned on him.\nOn the road in Africa.\nMeeting Mary in Africa, he proceeded to Olduvai with a small party. Leakey's parents continued to urge him to return to Frida, and would pay for everyone in the party but Mary. Mary joined him under a stigma but her skill and competence eventually won over the other participants. Leakey and his associates did the groundwork for future excavation at Olduvai, uncovering dozens of sites for a broad sampling, as was his method. They were named after the excavator: SHK (Sam Howard's karongo), BK (Peter Bell's), SWK (Sam White's), MNK (Mary Nicol's). Leakey and Mary conducted a temporary clinic for the Maasai, made preliminary investigations of Laetoli, and ended by studying the rock paintings at the Kisese/Cheke region.\nReturn to England.\nLeakey and Mary returned to England in 1935 without positions or any place to stay except Mary's mother's apartment. They soon leased Steen Cottage in the hamlet of Nasty in the parish of Great Munden. The couple lived without heating, electricity, or plumbing, fetching water from a well and writing by oil lantern. They lived in poverty for 18 months at this low point of their fortunes, visited at first only by Mary's relatives. Leakey gardened for subsistence and exercise and improved the house and grounds. He appealed at last to the Royal Society, who relented with a small grant to continue work on his collection.\nIn British East Africa.\nReturn to British East Africa.\nLeakey had already involved himself in Kikuyu tribal affairs in 1928, taking a stand against female genital cutting. He got into a shouting match in Kikuyu one evening with Jomo Kenyatta, later the president of Kenya, who was lecturing on the topic. R. Copeland at Oxford recommended he apply to the Rhodes Trust for a grant to write a study of the Kikuyu and it was given late in 1936 along with a salary for two years. In January 1937 the Leakeys travelled to Kenya. Colin would not see his father for 20 years.\nLeakey returned to Kiambaa near Nairobi and persuaded Senior Chief Koinange, who designated a committee of chiefs to help him describe the Kikuyu the way they had been. Mary excavated at Waterfall Cave. She fell ill with double pneumonia and was near death for two weeks in the hospital in Nairobi, during which time her mother was sent for. Contrary to expectation, she recovered and began another excavation at Hyrax Hill and then Njoro River Cave. Leakey got an extension of his grant, which he used partially for fossil-hunting. Leakey discoveries began to appear in the newspapers again.\nTensions between the Kikuyu and the settlers increased alarmingly. Leakey jumped into the fray as an exponent of the middle ground. In \"Kenya: Contrasts and Problems\", he angered the settlers by proclaiming Kenya could never be a \"white man's country.\"\nFossil police.\nThe government offered Leakey work as a policeman in intelligence, which he accepted. He travelled the country as a pedlar, reporting on the talk. In September 1939, when Britain went to war, the Kenyan government drafted Leakey into its African intelligence service. Apart from some bumbling around, during which he and some settlers stalked each other as possible saboteurs of the Sagana Railway Bridge, his first task was to supply and arm Ethiopian guerrillas against the Italian invaders of their country. He created a clandestine network using his childhood friends among the Kikuyu. They also hunted fossils on the sly.\nLeakey conducted interrogations, analysed handwriting, wrote radio broadcasts and took on regular police investigations. He loved a good mystery of any sort. The white leadership of the King's African Rifles used him extensively to clear up many cultural mysteries; for example, he helped an officer remove a curse he had inadvertently put on his men.\nMary continued to find and excavate sites. In 1940, their son Jonathan Leakey was born. Mary worked in the Coryndon Memorial Museum (later called the National Museums of Kenya) where Leakey joined her as an unpaid honorary curator in 1941. Their life was a melange of police work and archaeology. They investigated Rusinga Island and Olorgesailie. At the latter site they were assisted by a team of Italian experts recruited from the prisoners of war and paroled for the purpose.\nIn 1942, the Italian menace ended, but the Japanese began to reconnoitre with a view toward landing in force. Leakey found himself in counter-intelligence work, which he performed with zest and imagination. In the same year, their daughter Deborah was born, but died at the age of three months. They lived in a rundown and bug-infested Nairobi home, provided by the museum. Jonathan was attacked by army ants in his crib.\nTurn of the tide.\nIn 1944 Richard Leakey was born. In 1945 the family's income from police work all but vanished. By now Leakey was getting plenty of job offers but he chose to stay on in Kenya as Curator of the Coryndon Museum, with an annual salary and a house, but more importantly, to continue palaeoanthropological research.\nIn January 1947 Leakey conducted the first Pan-African Congress of Prehistory at Nairobi. Sixty scientists from 26 countries attended, delivering papers and visiting the Leakey sites. The conference restored Leakey to the scientific fold and made him a major figure in it. With the money that now poured in Leakey undertook the famous expeditions of 1948 and beyond at Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, where Mary discovered the most complete Proconsul fossil up to that time.\nCharles Watson Boise donated money for a boat to be used for transport on Lake Victoria, \"The Miocene Lady\". Its skipper, Hassan Salimu, was later to deliver Jane Goodall to Gombe. Philip Leakey was born in 1949. In 1950, Leakey was awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University.\nKenyan affairs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... I sought a personal interview with the governor, hoping to make him appreciate that it was no longer possible to continue along the lines of the old colonial regime. ... Colonial governors and senior civil servants are not easy people to argue with; and, of course, I was not popular, because of my criticism of the colonial service ... Had it been possible to make the government open its eyes to the realities of the situation, I believe that the whole miserable episode of what is frequently spoken of as 'the Mau Mau rebellion' need never have taken place.\u2014\u200a\nWhile the Leakeys were at Lake Victoria, the Kikuyu struck at the European settlers of the Kenyan highlands, who seemed to have the upper hand and were insisting on a \"white\" government of a \"white\" Africa. In 1949 the Kikuyu formed a secret society, the Mau Mau, which attacked settlers and especially loyalist Kikuyu.\nLeakey had attempted to warn Sir Philip Mitchell, governor of the colony, that nocturnal meetings and forced oaths were not Kikuyu customs and foreboded violence, but was ignored. Now he found himself pulled away from anthropology to investigate the Mau Mau. During this period his life was threatened and a reward placed on his head. The Leakeys began to carry pistols, termed \"European National Dress.\" The government placed him under 24-hour guard.\nIn 1952, after a Mau Mau massacre of pro-British chiefs, the government arrested Jomo Kenyatta, president of the Kenya African Union. Leakey was summoned to be a court interpreter, but withdrew after an accusation of mistranslation because of prejudice against the defendant. He returned on request to translate documents only. Because of lack of evidence linking Kenyatta to the Mau Mau, although convicted, he did not receive the death penalty, but was sentenced to several years of hard labour.\nThe government brought in British troops and formed a home guard of 20,000 Kikuyu. During this time, Leakey played a difficult and contradictory role. He sided with the settlers, serving as their spokesman and intelligence officer, helping to ferret out bands of guerrillas. On the other hand, he continued to advocate for the Kikuyu in his 1954 book \"Defeating Mau Mau\" and numerous talks and articles. He recommended a multi-racial government, land reform in the highlands, a wage hike for the Kikuyu, and many other reforms, most of which were eventually adopted.\nThe government then realised the rebellion was being directed from urban centres, instituted martial law and detained the committees. Following Leakey's suggestion, thousands of Kikuyu were placed in re-education camps and resettled in new villages. The rebellion continued from bases under Mount Kenya until 1956, when, deprived of its leadership and supplies, it had to disperse. The state of emergency lasted until 1960. In 1963 Kenya became independent, with Jomo Kenyatta as prime minister.\nWork in palaeoanthropology.\nOlduvai Gorge.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We know from the study of evolution that, again and again, various branches of animal stock have become over-specialized, and that over-specialization has led to their extinction. Present-day \"Homo sapiens\" is in many physical respects still very unspecialized ... But in one thing man, as we know him today, is over-specialized. His brain power is very over-specialized compared to the rest of his physical make-up, and it may well be that this over-specialization will lead, just as surely, to his extinction. ... if we are to control our future, we must first understand the past better.\u2014\u200a\nBeginning in 1951, Leakey and Mary began intensive research at Olduvai Gorge. A trial trench in Bed II at BK in 1951 was followed by a more extensive excavation in 1952. They found what Leakey termed an Oldowan \"slaughter-house\", an ancient bog where animals had been trapped and butchered. Excavations stopped in 1953 but were briefly resumed in 1955 with Jean Brown.\nIn 1959, excavations at Bed I were opened. While Leakey was sick in camp, Mary discovered the fossilized skull OH 5 at FLK, \"Paranthropus boisei\", famously identified as \"Zinjanthropus\" or \"Zinj.\" The question was whether the fossil belonged to a previous genus discovered by Robert Broom, \"Paranthropus\", or a member of a different genus ancestral to humans. Leakey opted for \"Zinjanthropus\", a decision opposed by Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, but one which attracted the attention of Melville Bell Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society. That contact resulted in an article in \"National Geographic\" and a large grant to continue work at Olduvai.\nIn 1960, geophysicists Jack Evernden and Garniss Curtis dated Bed I from 1.89 to 1.75 million years ago, confirming the great antiquity of fossil hominids in Africa.\nIn 1960, Leakey appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai. She brought in a staff of Kamba assistants, including Kamoya Kimeu, who later discovered many of eastern Africa's most famous fossils. At Olduvai, Mary set up Camp 5 and began work with her own staff and associates.\nAt \"Jonny's site\", FLK-NN, Jonathan Leakey discovered two skull fragments without the Australopithecine sagittal crest, which Mary connected with Broom's and Robinson's \"Telanthropus\". The problem with it was its contemporaneity with \"Zinjanthropus\". When mailed photographs, Le Gros Clark retorted casually \"Shades of Piltdown.\" Leakey cabled him immediately and had some strong words at this suggestion that it might be a forgery. Clark apologised.\nNot long afterwards, in 1960, Leakey, his son Philip and Ray Pickering discovered a fossil Leakey termed \"Chellean Man\", (Olduvai Hominid 9), in a context with Oldowan tools. After reconstruction Leakey and Mary called it \"Pinhead.\" It was subsequently identified as \"Homo erectus\", contemporaneous with \"Paranthropus\" at 1.4 million years old.\nIn 1961 Leakey got a salary as well as a grant from the National Geographic Society and turned over the acting directorship of Coryndon to a subordinate. He created the Centre for Prehistory and Palaeontology on the same grounds, moved his collections to it, and appointed himself director. This was his new operations centre. He opened another excavation at Fort Ternan on Lake Victoria. Shortly after, Heselon discovered \"Kenyapithecus wickeri\", named after the owner of the property. Leakey promptly celebrated with George Gaylord Simpson, who happened to be present, aboard the \"Miocene Lady\" with \"Leakey Safari Specials\", a drink made of condensed milk and cognac.\nIn 1962 Leakey was visiting Olduvai when Ndibo Mbuika discovered the first tooth of \"Homo habilis\" at MNK. Leakey and Mary thought it was female and named her Cinderella, or Cindy. Phillip Tobias identified Jonny's Child with it and Raymond Dart came up with the name \"Homo habilis\" at Leakey's request, which Tobias translated as \"handyman.\" It was seen as intermediary between gracile \"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo\".\nCalico Hills.\nIn 1959 Leakey, while at the British Museum of Natural History in London, received a visit from Ruth DeEtte Simpson, an archaeologist from California. Simpson had acquired what looked like ancient scrapers from a site in the Calico Hills and showed it to Leakey.\nIn 1963, Leakey obtained funds from the National Geographic Society and commenced archaeological excavations with Simpson. Excavations at the site carried out by Leakey and Simpson revealed that they had located stone artefacts which were dated 100,000 years or older, suggesting a human presence in North America much earlier than others had estimated.\nThe geologist Vance Haynes had made three visits to the site in 1973 and had claimed that the artefacts found by Leakey were naturally formed geofacts. According to Haynes, the geofacts were formed by stones becoming fractured in an ancient river on the site.\nIn her autobiography, Mary Leakey wrote that because of Leakey's involvement with the Calico Hills site she had lost academic respect for him and that the Calico excavation project was \"catastrophic to his professional career and was largely responsible for the parting of our ways\".\nThe Trimates.\nOne of Leakey's legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he understood as key to unravelling the mysteries of human evolution. He personally chose three female researchers, Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birut\u0117 Galdikas, calling them The Trimates. Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology, immersing themselves in the study of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, respectively. Leakey also encouraged and supported many other PhD candidates, most notably from Cambridge University. Leakey believed that women were better at studying primates than men, as shown in the book \"Primates.\"\nLast years.\nDuring his final years Leakey became famous as a lecturer in the United Kingdom and United States. He did not excavate any longer, as he was impaired by arthritis, for which he had a hip replacement in 1968. He raised funds and directed his family and associates. In Kenya he was a facilitator for hundreds of scientists exploring the East African Rift system for fossils.\nIn 1968, Leakey refused an honorary doctorate from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, primarily because of apartheid in South Africa. Mary accepted one, and they thereafter led separate professional lives.\nIn the last few years Leakey's health began to fail more seriously. He had his first heart attacks and spent six months in the hospital. An empathy over health brought him and Dian Fossey together for a brief romance, which she broke off. Richard began to assume more and more of his father's responsibilities, which Leakey resisted, but in the end was forced to accept.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn 1 October 1972, Leakey had a heart attack in the London apartment of Vanne Goodall (Jane Goodall's mother). Vanne sat up all night with him in St. Stephen's Hospital and left at 9:00\u00a0a.m. He died 30 minutes later at the age of 69.\nMary wanted to cremate Leakey and fly the ashes back to Nairobi. Richard objected, and Leakey's body was flown home and interred at Limuru, near the graves of his parents.\nIn denial, the family did not face the question of a memorial marker for a year. When Richard went to place a stone on the grave he found one already there, courtesy of Leakey's former secretary Rosalie Osborn. The inscription was signed with the letters, \"ILYUA\", \"I'll love you always\", which Rosalie used to place on her letters to him. Richard left it in place.\nProminent family members.\nLouis Leakey was married to Mary Leakey, who made the noteworthy discovery of fossil footprints at Laetoli, Tanzania. Found preserved in volcanic ash, they are the earliest record of bipedal gait.\nLeakey is also the father of palaeoanthropologist Richard Leakey and the botanist Colin Leakey. Leakey's cousin, Nigel Gray Leakey, was a recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War II.\nBooks.\nLeakey's books are listed below. The gaps between books are filled by too many articles to list. It was Leakey who began the Leakey family tradition of publishing in \"Nature\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17967", "revid": "20908161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17967", "title": "Liar paradox", "text": "Paradoxical assertion\nIn philosophy and logic, the classical liar paradox or liar's paradox or antinomy of the liar is the statement of a liar that they are lying: for instance, declaring that \"I am lying\". If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is telling the truth, which means the liar just lied. In \"this sentence is a lie\", the paradox is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the \"liar paradox\" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar making the statement. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary truth value leads to a contradiction.\nAssume that \"this sentence is false\" is true, then we can trust its content, which states the opposite and thus causes a contradiction. Similarly, we get a contradiction when we assume the opposite.\nHistory.\nThe Epimenides paradox (c. 600 BC) has been suggested as an example of the liar paradox, but they are not logically equivalent. The semi-mythical seer Epimenides, a Cretan, reportedly stated that \"All Cretans are liars.\" However, Epimenides' statement that all Cretans are liars can be resolved as false, given that he knows of at least one other Cretan who does not lie (alternatively, it can be taken as merely a statement that all Cretans tell lies, not that they tell \"only\" lies).\nThe paradox's name translates as \"pseud\u00f3menos l\u00f3gos\" (\u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) in Ancient Greek. One version of the liar paradox is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides of Miletus, who lived in the 4th century BC. Eubulides reportedly asked, \"A man says that he is lying. Is what he says true or false?\"\nThe paradox was once discussed by Jerome of Stridon in a sermon:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I said in my alarm, Every man is a liar!\" Is David telling the truth or is he lying? If it is true that every man is a liar, and David's statement, \"Every man is a liar\" is true, then David also is lying; he, too, is a man. But if he, too, is lying, his statement that \"Every man is a liar\", consequently is not true. Whatever way you turn the proposition, the conclusion is a contradiction. Since David himself is a man, it follows that he also is lying; but if he is lying because every man is a liar, his lying is of a different sort.\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) was well aware of a liar paradox which he formulated as \"everything I am saying is false\" (sarvam mithy\u0101 brav\u012bmi). He analyzes this statement together with the paradox of \"unsignifiability\" and explores the boundary between statements that are unproblematic in daily life and paradoxes.\nThere was discussion of the liar paradox in early Islamic tradition for at least five centuries, starting from late 9th century, and apparently without being influenced by any other tradition. Na\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b could have been the first logician to identify the liar paradox as self-referential.\nExplanation and variants.\nThe problem of the liar paradox is that it seems to show that common beliefs about truth and falsity actually lead to a contradiction. Sentences can be constructed that cannot consistently be assigned a truth value even though they are completely in accord with grammar and semantic rules.\nThe simplest version of the paradox is the sentence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;A: This statement (A) is false.\nIf (A) is true, then \"This statement is false\" is true. Therefore, (A) must be false. The hypothesis that (A) is true leads to the conclusion that (A) is false, a contradiction.\nIf (A) is false, then \"This statement is false\" is false. Therefore, (A) must be true. The hypothesis that (A) is false leads to the conclusion that (A) is true, another contradiction. Either way, (A) is both true and false, which is a paradox.\nHowever, that the liar sentence can be shown to be true if it is false and false if it is true has led some to conclude that it is \"neither true nor false\". This response to the paradox is, in effect, the rejection of the claim that every statement has to be either true or false, also known as the principle of bivalence, a concept related to the law of the excluded middle.\nThe proposal that the statement is neither true nor false has given rise to the following, strengthened version of the paradox:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;This statement is not true. (B)\nIf (B) is neither true nor false, then it must be not true. Since this is what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be true. Since initially (B) was not true and is now true, another paradox arises.\nAnother reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as Graham Priest has, that the statement is both true and false. Nevertheless, even Priest's analysis is susceptible to the following version of the liar:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;This statement is only false. (C)\nIf (C) is both true and false, then (C) is only false. But then, it is not true. Since initially (C) was true and is now not true, it is a paradox. However, it has been argued that by adopting a two-valued relational semantics (as opposed to functional semantics), the dialetheic approach can overcome this version of the Liar.\nThere are also multi-sentence versions of the liar paradox. The following is the two-sentence version:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The following statement is true. (D1)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The preceding statement is false. (D2)\nAssume (D1) is true. Then (D2) is true. This would mean that (D1) is false. Therefore, (D1) is both true and false.\nAssume (D1) is false. Then (D2) is false. This would mean that (D1) is true. Thus (D1) is both true and false. Either way, (D1) is both true and false \u2013 the same paradox as (A) above.\nThe multi-sentence version of the liar paradox generalizes to any circular sequence of such statements (wherein the last statement asserts the truth/falsity of the first statement), provided there are an odd number of statements asserting the falsity of their successor; the following is a three-sentence version, with each statement asserting the falsity of its successor:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;E2 is false. (E1)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;E3 is false. (E2)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;E1 is false. (E3)\nAssume (E1) is true. Then (E2) is false, which means (E3) is true, and hence (E1) is false, leading to a contradiction.\nAssume (E1) is false. Then (E2) is true, which means (E3) is false, and hence (E1) is true. Either way, (E1) is both true and false \u2013 the same paradox as with (A) and (D1).\nThere are many other variants, and many complements, possible. In normal sentence construction, the simplest version of the complement is the sentence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;This statement is true. (F)\nIf F is assumed to bear a truth value, then it presents the problem of determining the object of that value. But, a simpler version is possible, by assuming that the single word 'true' bears a truth value. The analogue to the paradox is to assume that the single word 'false' likewise bears a truth value, namely that it is false. This reveals that the paradox can be reduced to the mental act of assuming that the very idea of fallacy bears a truth value, namely that the very idea of fallacy is false: an act of misrepresentation. So, the symmetrical version of the paradox would be:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The following statement is false. (G1)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The preceding statement is false. (G2)\nThere's also a version related to the problem of future contingents which cannot be answered without a contradiction arising:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Will the answer to this question be 'no'?\nIf the answer is 'yes', then the answer to the question is 'no', and if the answer is 'no', then the answer to the question is 'yes'.\nPossible resolutions.\nFuzzy logic.\nIn fuzzy logic, the truth value of a statement can be any real number between 0 and 1 both inclusive, as opposed to Boolean logic, where the truth values may only be the integer values 0 or 1. In this system, the statement \"This statement is false\" is no longer paradoxical as it can be assigned a truth value of 0.5, making it precisely half true and half false. A simplified explanation is shown below.\nLet the truth value of the statement \"This statement is false\" be denoted by formula_1. The statement becomes\n formula_2\nby generalizing the NOT operator to the equivalent Zadeh operator from fuzzy logic, the statement becomes\n formula_3\nfrom which it follows that\n formula_4\nAlfred Tarski.\nAlfred Tarski diagnosed the paradox as arising only in languages that are \"semantically closed\", by which he meant a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate truth (or falsehood) of another sentence in the same language (or even of itself). To avoid self-contradiction, it is necessary when discussing truth values to envision levels of languages, each of which can predicate truth (or falsehood) only of languages at a lower level. So, when one sentence refers to the truth-value of another, it is semantically higher. The sentence referred to is part of the \"object language\", while the referring sentence is considered to be a part of a \"meta-language\" with respect to the object language. It is legitimate for sentences in \"languages\" higher on the semantic hierarchy to refer to sentences lower in the \"language\" hierarchy, but not the other way around. This prevents a system from becoming self-referential.\nHowever, this system is incomplete. One would like to be able to make statements such as \"For every statement in level \"\u03b1\" of the hierarchy, there is a statement at level \"\u03b1\"+1 which asserts that the first statement is false.\" This is a true, meaningful statement about the hierarchy that Tarski defines, but it refers to statements at every level of the hierarchy, so it must be above every level of the hierarchy, and is therefore not possible within the hierarchy (although bounded versions of the sentence are possible). Saul Kripke is credited with identifying this incompleteness in Tarski's hierarchy in his highly cited paper \"Outline of a theory of truth,\" and it is recognized as a general problem in hierarchical languages.\nArthur Prior.\nArthur Prior asserts that there is nothing paradoxical about the liar paradox. His claim (which he attributes to Charles Sanders Peirce and John Buridan) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth.\nThus, for example, the statement \"It is true that two plus two equals four\" contains no more information than the statement \"two plus two equals four\", because the phrase \"it is true that...\" is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase \"it is true that...\" is equivalent to \"this whole statement is true and ...\".\nThus the following two statements are equivalent:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;This statement is false.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;This statement is true and this statement is false.\nThe latter is a simple contradiction of the form \"A and not A\", and hence is false. Therefore, there is no paradox, because the claim that this two-conjunct Liar is false does not lead to a contradiction. Eugene Mills presents a similar answer.\nSaul Kripke.\nSaul Kripke argued that whether a sentence is paradoxical or not can depend upon contingent facts. If the only thing Smith says about Jones is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;A majority of what Jones says about me is false.\nand Jones says only these three things about Smith:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Smith is a big spender.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Smith is soft on crime.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Everything Smith says about me is true.\nIf Smith really is a big spender but is \"not\" soft on crime, then both Smith's remark about Jones and Jones's last remark about Smith are paradoxical.\nKripke proposes a solution in the following manner. If a statement's truth value is ultimately tied up in some evaluable fact about the world, that statement is \"grounded\". If not, that statement is \"ungrounded\". Ungrounded statements do not have a truth value. Liar statements and liar-like statements are ungrounded, and therefore have no truth value.\nJon Barwise and John Etchemendy.\nJon Barwise and John Etchemendy propose that the liar sentence (which they interpret as synonymous with the Strengthened Liar) is ambiguous. They base this conclusion on a distinction they make between a \"denial\" and a \"negation\". If the liar means, \"It is not the case that this statement is true\", then it is denying itself. If it means, \"This statement is not true\", then it is negating itself. They go on to argue, based on situation semantics, that the \"denial liar\" can be true without contradiction while the \"negation liar\" can be false without contradiction. Their 1987 book makes heavy use of non-well-founded set theory.\nDialetheism.\nGraham Priest and other logicians, including J. C. Beall and Bradley Armour-Garb, have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as dialetheism. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized principle of explosion, which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism \u2013 the view that \"all\" propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle. Logics that reject it are called \"paraconsistent\".\nNon-cognitivism.\nAndrew Irvine has argued in favour of a non-cognitivist solution to the paradox, suggesting that some apparently well-formed sentences will turn out to be neither true nor false and that \"formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient\" for resolving the paradox.\nBhartrhari's perspectivism.\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) dealt with paradoxes such as the liar in a section of one of the chapters of his magnum opus the V\u0101kyapad\u012bya. Bhartrhari's solution fits into his general approach to language, thought and reality, which has been characterized by some as \"relativistic\", \"non-committal\" or \"perspectivistic\". With regard to the liar paradox (\"sarvam mithy\u0101 brav\u012bmi\" \"everything I am saying is false\") Bhartrhari identifies a hidden parameter that can change unproblematic situations in daily communication into a stubborn paradox. Bhartrhari's solution can be understood in terms of the solution proposed in 1992 by Julian Roberts: \"Paradoxes consume themselves. But we can keep apart the warring sides of the contradiction by the simple expedient of temporal contextualisation: what is 'true' with respect to one point in time need not be so in another ... The overall force of the 'Austinian' argument is not merely that 'things change', but that rationality is essentially temporal in that we need time in order to reconcile and manage what would otherwise be mutually destructive states.\" According to Robert's suggestion, it is the factor \"time\" which allows us to reconcile the separated \"parts of the world\" that play a crucial role in the solution of Barwise and Etchemendy. The capacity of time to prevent a direct confrontation of the two \"parts of the world\" is here external to the \"liar\". In the light of Bhartrhari's analysis, however, the extension in time that separates two perspectives on the world or two \"parts of the world\" \u2013 the part before and the part after the function accomplishes its task \u2013 is inherent in any \"function\": also the function to signify which underlies each statement, including the \"liar\". The unsolvable paradox \u2013 a situation in which we have either contradiction (\"virodha\") or infinite regress (\"anavasth\u0101\") \u2013 arises, in case of the liar and other paradoxes such as the unsignifiability paradox (Bhartrhari's paradox), when abstraction is made from this function (\"vy\u0101p\u0101ra\") and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (\"apara vy\u0101p\u0101ra\") undoing the previous one.\nLogical structure.\nFor a better understanding of the liar paradox, it is useful to write it down in a more formal way. If \"this statement is false\" is denoted by A and its truth value is being sought, it is necessary to find a condition that restricts the choice of possible truth values of A. Because A is self-referential, it is possible to give the condition by an equation.\nIf some statement, B, is assumed to be false, one writes, \"B = false\". The statement (C) that the statement B is false would be written as \"C = 'B = false'\". Now, the liar paradox can be expressed as the statement A, that A is false:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;A = \"A = false\"\nThis is an equation from which the truth value of A = \"this statement is false\" could hopefully be obtained. In the Boolean domain, \"A = false\" is equivalent to \"not A\" and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both \"true\" and \"false\". Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; Arthur Prior claims that the equation should be \"A = 'A = false and A = true'\" and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, \"I hear what he says; he says what I don't hear\", where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox.\nApplications.\nG\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem.\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems are two fundamental theorems of mathematical logic which state inherent limitations of sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems for mathematics. The theorems were proven by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1931, and are important in the philosophy of mathematics. Roughly speaking, in proving the first incompleteness theorem, G\u00f6del used a modified version of the liar paradox, replacing \"this sentence is false\" with \"this sentence is not provable\", called the \"G\u00f6del sentence G\". His proof showed that for any sufficiently powerful theory T, G is true, but not provable in T. The analysis of the truth and provability of G is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.\nTo prove the first incompleteness theorem, G\u00f6del represented statements by numbers. Then the theory at hand, which is assumed to prove certain facts about numbers, also proves facts about its own statements. Questions about the provability of statements are represented as questions about the properties of numbers, which would be decidable by the theory if it were complete. In these terms, the G\u00f6del sentence states that no natural number exists with a certain, strange property. A number with this property would encode a proof of the inconsistency of the theory. If there were such a number then the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to the consistency hypothesis. So, under the assumption that the theory is consistent, there is no such number.\nIt is not possible to replace \"not provable\" with \"false\" in a G\u00f6del sentence because the predicate \"Q is the G\u00f6del number of a false formula\" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as Tarski's undefinability theorem, was discovered independently by G\u00f6del (when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem) and by Alfred Tarski.\nGeorge Boolos has since sketched an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses Berry's paradox rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula.\nIn popular culture.\nThe liar paradox is occasionally used in fiction to shut down artificial intelligences, who are presented as being unable to process the sentence. In the \"\" episode \"I, Mudd\", the liar paradox is used by Captain Kirk and Harry Mudd to confuse and ultimately disable an android holding them captive. In the 1973 \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Green Death\", the Doctor temporarily stumps the insane computer BOSS by asking it \"If I were to tell you that the next thing I say would be true, but that the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?\" BOSS tries to figure it out but cannot and eventually decides the question is irrelevant and summons security.\nIn the 1967 film \"Bedazzled\", the Devil says to his subject, Stanley Moon, that \"Everything he says is a lie, including this.\".\nThe Thin Lizzy song \"Don't Believe a Word\" contains the lyrics \"Not a word of this is true.\" \nIn the 2011 video game \"Portal 2\", artificial intelligence GLaDOS attempts to use the \"this sentence is false\" paradox to kill another artificial intelligence, Wheatley. However, lacking the intelligence to realize the statement is a paradox, he simply responds, \"Um, true. I'll go with true. There, that was easy.\" and is unaffected. Humorously, all other AIs present barring GLaDOS, all of which are significantly less sentient and lucid than both her and Wheatley, are still killed from hearing the paradox. GLaDOS later notes that she almost killed herself from her own attempt to kill Wheatley using the paradox.\nThe Devo song \"Enough Said\" includes the lyrics \"The next thing I say to you will be true/The last thing I said was false\".\nIn the seventh episode of \"\", titled \"Access Denied\", the main character Jesse and their friends are captured by a supercomputer named PAMA. After PAMA controls two of Jesse's friends, Jesse learns that PAMA stalls when processing and uses a paradox to confuse him and escape with their last friend. One of the paradoxes the player can make Jesse say is the liar paradox.\nRobert Earl Keen's song \"The Road Goes On and On\" mentions the paradox. The song is part of Keen's feud with Toby Keith, who is presumably the \"liar\" Keen refers to.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lederman", "text": "American mathematician and physicist (1922\u20132018)\nLeon Max Lederman (July 15, 1922 \u2013 October 3, 2018) was an American experimental physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988, along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, for research on neutrinos. He also received the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1982, along with Martin Lewis Perl, for research on quarks and leptons. Lederman was director emeritus of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois. He founded the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, in Aurora, Illinois in 1986, where he was resident scholar emeritus from 2012 until his death in 2018.\nAn accomplished scientific writer, he became known for his 1993 book \"The God Particle\" establishing the popularity of the term for the Higgs boson.\nEarly life and education.\nLederman was born in New York City, New York, to Morris and Minna (Rosenberg) Lederman. His parents were Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants from Kyiv and Odesa. Lederman graduated from James Monroe High School in the South Bronx, and received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1943.\nLederman enlisted in the United States Army Signal Corps during World War II, intending to become a physicist after his service. Following his discharge in 1946, he enrolled at Columbia University's graduate school, receiving his Ph.D. in 1951.\nAcademic career.\nLederman became a faculty member at Columbia University, and he was promoted to full professor in 1958 as Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics. In 1960, on leave from Columbia, he spent time at CERN in Geneva as a Ford Foundation Fellow. He took an extended leave of absence from Columbia in 1979 to become director of Fermilab. Resigning from Columbia (and retiring from Fermilab) in 1989, he then taught briefly at the University of Chicago. He then moved to the physics department of the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he served as the Pritzker Professor of Science. In 1992, Lederman served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nLederman, rare for a Nobel Prize winning professor, took it upon himself to teach physics to non-physics majors at The University of Chicago.\nLederman served as president of the board of sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and at the time of his death was chair emeritus. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1989 to 1992, and was a member of the JASON defense advisory group. Lederman was also one of the main proponents of the \"Physics First\" movement. Also known as \"Right-side Up Science\" and \"Biology Last,\" this movement seeks to rearrange the current high school science curriculum so that physics precedes chemistry and biology.\nLederman was an early supporter of Science Debate 2008, an initiative to get the then-candidates for president, Barack Obama and John McCain, to debate the nation's top science policy challenges. In October 2010, Lederman participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students engaged in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Lederman was also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's advisory board.\nAcademic work.\nIn 1956, Lederman worked on parity violation in weak interactions. R. L. Garwin, Leon Lederman, and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment, and they immediately verified the parity violation. They delayed publication of their results until after Wu's group was ready, and the two papers appeared back-to-back in the same physics journal. Among his achievements are the discovery of the muon neutrino in 1962 and the bottom quark in 1977. These helped establish his reputation as among the top particle physicists.\nIn 1976, a group of physicists, the E288 experiment team, led by Lederman announced that a particle with a mass of about 6.0 GeV was being produced by the Fermilab particle accelerator. After taking further data, the group discovered that this particle did not actually exist, and the \"discovery\" was named \"Oops-Leon\" as a pun on the original name, upsilon, and Lederman's first name. The name was reused for the upsilon meson, which the group discovered from subsequent data in 1977 at a higher mass of 9.5 GeV.\nAs the director of Fermilab, Lederman was a prominent supporter of the Superconducting Super Collider project, which was endorsed around 1983, and was a major proponent and advocate throughout its lifetime. Also at Fermilab, he oversaw the construction of the Tevatron, for decades the world's highest-energy particle collider. Lederman later wrote his 1993 popular science book \"\" \u2013 which sought to promote awareness of the significance of such a project \u2013 in the context of the project's last years and the changing political climate of the 1990s. The increasingly moribund project was finally shelved that same year after some $2 billion of expenditures. In \"The God Particle\" he wrote, \"The history of atomism is one of reductionism \u2013 the effort to reduce all the operations of nature to a small number of laws governing a small number of primordial objects\" while stressing the importance of the Higgs boson.\nIn 1988, Lederman received the Nobel Prize for Physics along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger \"for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino\". Lederman also received the National Medal of Science (1965), the Elliott Cresson Medal for Physics (1976), the Wolf Prize for Physics (1982) and the Enrico Fermi Award (1992). In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum \"Making History Award\" for Distinction in Science Medicine and Technology.\nPersonal life.\nLederman's best friend during his college years, Martin J. Klein, convinced him of \"the splendors of physics during a long evening over many beers\". He was known for his sense of humor in the physics community. On August 26, 2008, Lederman was video-recorded by a science focused organization called ScienCentral, on the street in New York City, answering questions from passersby. He answered questions such as \"What is the strong force?\" and \"What happened before the Big Bang?\".\nHe had three children with his first wife, Florence Gordon, and toward the end of his life lived with his second wife, Ellen (Carr), in Driggs, Idaho.\nLederman was an atheist. Lederman began to suffer from memory loss in 2011 and, after struggling with medical bills, he had to sell his Nobel Prize medal for $765,000 to cover the costs in 2015. He died of complications from dementia on October 3, 2018, at a care facility in Rexburg, Idaho, at the age of 96.\nReferences and notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also King of Aquitaine from 781. As the only surviving son of Charlemagne and Hildegard, he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father's death in 814, a position that he held until his death except from November 833 to March 834, when he was deposed.\nDuring his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the empire's southwestern frontier. He conquered Barcelona from the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over Pamplona and the Basques south of the Pyrenees in 812. As emperor, he included his adult sons, Lothair, Pepin and Louis, in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them. The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew Bernard of Italy for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement.\nIn the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons that was only exacerbated by Louis's attempts to include his son Charles by his second wife in the succession plans. Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war. Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father but faced distinctly different problems.\nBirth and rule in Aquitaine.\nLouis was born in 778, while his father Charlemagne was on campaign through the Pyrenees, at the Carolingian villa of Cassinogilum, according to Einhard and the anonymous chronicler called Astronomus; the place is usually identified with Chasseneuil, near Poitiers. He was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife Hildegard. He had a twin brother named Lothair, who died young. Louis and Lothair were given names from the old Merovingian dynasty, possibly to suggest a connection.\nLouis was crowned King of Aquitaine as a three-year-old child in 781. In the following year he was sent to Aquitaine accompanied by regents and a court. Charlemagne constituted this sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his realm after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under Waifar (capitulated c. 768) and later Hunald II, which culminated in the disastrous Battle of Roncesvalles (778). Charlemagne wanted Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, wary of the customs his son may have been assimilating into in Aquitaine, Charlemagne, who had remarried to Fastrada after the death of Hildegard, sent for Louis in 785. Louis presented himself in Saxony at the royal Council of Paderborn dressed in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of Vasconia were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.\nIn 794, Charlemagne gave four former Gallo-Roman villas to Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: Dou\u00e9, Ebreuil, Angeac and the Chasseneuil. Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at a young age. The marches\u2014peripheral principalities\u2014played a vital role as bulwarks against exterior threats to the empire. Louis reigned over the Spanish March. In 797, Barcelona, the largest city of the \"Marca\", fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against C\u00f3rdoba and, failing, handed it to them. The C\u00f3rdoban authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including Gascons with their duke Sancho I of Gascony, Proven\u00e7als under Leibulf, and Goths under Bera, over the Pyrenees and besieged it for seven months, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. King Louis was formally invested with his armour in 791 at the age of fourteen. However, the princes were not given independence from central authority as Charlemagne wished to implant in them the concepts of empire and unity by sending them on remote military expeditions. Louis joined his brother Pippin at the Mezzogiorno campaign in Italy against the Duke Grimoald of Benevento at least once.\nLouis was one of Charlemagne's three legitimate sons to survive infancy. His twin brother, Lothair, died during infancy. According to the Frankish custom of partible inheritance, Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, Charles the Younger, King of Neustria, and Pepin, King of Italy. In the \"Divisio Regnorum\" of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as ruler of the Frankish heartland of Neustria and Austrasia, while giving Pepin the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added Septimania, Provence, and part of Burgundy. However, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died\u2014Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811\u2014and Louis was crowned co-emperor with an already ailing Charlemagne in Aachen on 11 September 813. On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Carolingian Empire and all its possessions (with the sole exception of the kingdom of Italy; although within Louis's empire, in 813 Charlemagne had ordered that Bernard, Pepin's son, be made and called king).\nReign.\nWhile at his palace of Dou\u00e9, Anjou, Louis received news of his father's death. He rushed to Aachen and crowned himself emperor to shouts of \"Vivat Imperator Ludovicus\" by the attending nobles.\nUpon arriving at the imperial court in Aachen in an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety on both sides, Louis's first act was to purge the palace of what he considered undesirable. He destroyed the old Germanic pagan tokens and texts which had been collected by Charlemagne. He further exiled members of the court he deemed morally \"dissolute\", including some of his own relatives.\nHe quickly sent all of his many unmarried (half-)sisters and nieces to nunneries in order to avoid any possible entanglements from overly powerful brothers-in-law. Sparing his illegitimate half-brothers Drogo, Hugh and Theoderic, he forced his father's cousins, Adalard and Wala to be tonsured, sending them into monastic exile at St-Philibert on the island of Noirmoutier and Corbie, respectively, despite the latter's initial loyalty.\nHe made Bernard, margrave of Septimania, and Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims his chief counsellors. The latter, born a serf, was raised by Louis to that office, but betrayed him later. He retained some of his father's ministers, such as Elisachar, abbot of St. Maximin near Trier, and Hildebold, Archbishop of Cologne. Later he replaced Elisachar with Hildwin, abbot of many monasteries.\nHe also employed Benedict of Aniane (the Second Benedict), a Septimanian Visigoth, whom he made abbot of the newly established \"Inden Monastery\" at Aix-la-Chapelle and charged him with the reform of the Frankish church. One of Benedict's primary reforms was to ensure that all religious houses in Louis's realm adhered to the Rule of Saint Benedict, named for its creator, Benedict of Nursia. From the start of his reign, his coinage imitated his father Charlemagne's portrait, which gave it an image of imperial authority and prestige. In 816, Pope Stephen IV, who had succeeded Leo III, visited Reims and again crowned Louis on Sunday 5 October. As a result, most French kings were crowned in Reims, following the custom established by Louis the Pious.\n\"Ordinatio imperii\".\nOn 9 April 817, Maundy Thursday, Louis and his court were crossing a wooden gallery from the cathedral to the palace in Aachen, when the gallery collapsed, killing many. Louis, having barely survived and realizing death was imminent, began planning for his succession. Three months later among the approval of his Aachen court and the clergy he issued an imperial decree of eighteen chapters, the \"Ordinatio Imperii\", that laid out plans for an orderly dynastic succession. The term \"Ordinatio Imperii\" is a modern (19th-century) creation. The decree is called \"divisio imperii\" in the only surviving contemporary manuscript.\nIn 815, Louis had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons Lothair and Pepin to govern Bavaria and Aquitaine, respectively, though without the royal titles. He proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:\nIf one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons. If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom. In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious's younger sons would be chosen to replace him by \"the people\". Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory.\nWith this settlement, Louis attempted to combine his sense for the Empire's unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons. Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share.\nThe decree failed to create order as it omitted Bernard, who immediately began to conspire. When Louis began to issue changes in favor of his second wife Judith's son Charles the Bald, his sons Lothar, Pepin and Louis refused to accept. The rule of sons being favoured over brothers in succession remained also untouched.\nBernard's rebellion and Louis's penance.\nThe \"ordinatio imperii\" of Aachen left Bernard in Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence. Upon hearing of this, Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and headed for Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Intimidated by the emperor's swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered. He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason. Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony. Others also suffered: Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans, in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, dying soon afterwards; it was rumored that he had been poisoned. The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis's conscience for the rest of his life.\nIn 833, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed penance for causing Bernard's death, at his palace of Attigny near Vouziers in the Ardennes, before Pope Paschal I, and a council of clerics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, Hugo whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, Drogo whom he soon made Bishop of Metz, and Theodoric. This act of contrition, partly in emulation of Theodosius I, had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice. He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house.\nFrontier wars.\nAt the start of Louis's reign, the many tribes\u2014Danes, Obotrites, Slovenes, Bretons and Basques\u2014which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor's power and dared not stir up any trouble. In 816, however, the Sorbs rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818. Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace to the Franks in a short time.\nA greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast. There, Ljudevit, duke of Slavs in Lower Pannonia, was harassing the border at the Drava and Sava rivers. The margrave of Friuli, Cadolah, was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margravate was invaded by Slovenes. In 821, an alliance was made with Borna, duke of the Dalmatia, and Liudewit was brought to heel. In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of Bulgaria acknowledged Louis's suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler Omurtag, in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in the March of Pannonia and regained their lands.\nOn the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard princes of Benevento whom Charlemagne had never subjugated. He extracted promises from Princes Grimoald IV and Sico, but to no effect.\nOn the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c. 812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees 'to settle matters' in Pamplona. The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the Basques in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i.e. hostages. S\u00e9guin, duke of Gascony, was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax. Seguin was replaced by Lupus III, who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor. In 820 an assembly at Quierzy-sur-Oise decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827). The counts in charge of the army, Hugh, count of Tours, and Matfrid, count of Orl\u00e9ans, were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught.\nFirst civil war.\nIn 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to Brittany, he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, Ermengarde. Ermengarde was the daughter of Ingerman, the duke of Hesbaye. Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking. It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew's death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event. It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to Judith, daughter of Welf, count of Altdorf. In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named Charles.\nThe birth of this son damaged the \"Partition of Aachen\", as Louis's attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war. At Worms in 829, Louis gave Alemannia to Charles, with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair, whose promised share was thereby diminished. An insurrection was soon at hand.\nWith the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles. Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them. Agobard, Archbishop of Lyon, and Jesse of Amiens, bishop of Amiens, too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels.\nIn 830, at Wala's insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of Gascons, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris. At Verberie, Louis the German joined him. At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself. He marched as far as Compi\u00e8gne, an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin's forces and captured. Judith was incarcerated at Poitiers and Bernard fled to Barcelona.\nThen Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father. When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in Nijmegen, in the heart of Austrasia, the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831). Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy.\nPepin returned to Aquitaine and Judith\u2014after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence\u2014to Louis's court. Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of Lake Geneva. Although Hilduin, abbot of Saint Denis, was exiled to Paderborn and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps, they did not lose their freedom.\nSecond civil war.\nThe next revolt occurred a mere two years later, in 832. The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father's court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father's orders. Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of Slav allies and conquered Swabia before the emperor could react. Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm. At Jonac, he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war. Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father's authority. His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles.\nSoon Lothair, with the support of Pope Gregory IV, whom he had confirmed in office without his father's support, joined the revolt in 833. While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north. Louis marched south. The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld. There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks. Soon much of Louis's army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because \"it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account.\" The resigned emperor was taken to Saint-M\u00e9dard de Soissons, his son Charles to Pr\u00fcm, and the queen to Tortona. The despicable show of disloyalty and disingenuousness earned the site the name Field of Lies, or L\u00fcgenfeld, or Campus Mendacii, \"ubi plurimorum fidelitas exstincta est\".\nOn 13 November 833, Ebbo, with Agobard of Lyon, presided over a synod at the Church of Saint Medard in Soissons which saw Louis undertake public penance for the second time in his reign. The penitential ritual that was undertaken began when Louis arrived at the church and confessed multiple times to the crimes levied against him. The crimes had been historic and recent, with accusations of oath breaking, violation of the public peace and inability to control his adulterous wife, Judith of Bavaria. Afterwards, he threw his sword belt at the base of the altar and received judgement through the imposition of the hands of the bishops. Louis was to live the rest of his life as a penitent, never to hold office again. The penance divided the aristocracy. The anonymous biographer of the \"Vita Hludovici\" criticized the whole affair on the basis that God does not judge twice for sins committed and confessed. Lothair's allies were generously compensated. Ebbo himself received the monastery of St Vaast whilst Pepin was allowed to keep the lands reclaimed from his father.\nMen like Rabanus Maurus, Louis's younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith's sister and Louis the German's new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire. The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compi\u00e8gne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and Saxony against Lothair, and the usurper fled to Burgundy, skirmishing with loyalists near Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834.\nOn Lothair's return to Italy, Wala, Jesse and Matfrid, formerly count of Orl\u00e9ans, died of a pestilence. On 2 February 835 at the palace Thionville, Louis presided over a general council to deal with the events of the previous year. Known as the Synod of Thionville, Louis himself was reinvested with his ancestral garb and the crown, symbols of Carolingian rulership. Furthermore, the penance of 833 was officially reversed and Archbishop Ebbo officially resigned after confessing to a capital crime, whilst Agobard of Lyon and Bartholmew, Archbishop of Narbonne were also deposed. Later that year Lothair fell ill; once again the events turned in Louis favour.\nIn 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of Cr\u00e9mieu. At about that time, the Vikings terrorized and sacked Utrecht and Antwerp. In 837, they went up the Rhine as far as Nijmegen, and their king, Rorik, demanded the weregild of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them. They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts. In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over Frisia, but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839. Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of \"missi dominici\" into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there.\nThird civil war.\nIn 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis's land. Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at Quierzy-sur-Oise, giving all of the young king of Bavaria's lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles. Emperor Louis did not stop there, however. His devotion to Charles knew no bounds. When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son Pepin II. When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out. In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the Loire, and the Danes returned to ravage the Frisian coast (sacking Dorestad for a second time).\nLothair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance. At a final \"placitum\" held at Worms on 20 May, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western. Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles. The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at Clermont-en-Auvergne in 840. Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the Ostmark. The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to Frankfurt am Main, where he disbanded the army. The final civil war of his reign was over.\nDeath.\nLouis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and retreated to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine near his palace at Ingelheim. He died on 20 June 840 in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo as he pardoned his son Louis, proclaimed Lothair emperor and commended the absent Charles and Judith to his protection.\nSoon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into yet another civil war. It lasted until 843 with the signing of the Treaty of Verdun, in which the division of the empire into three souvereign entities was settled. West Francia and East Francia became the kernels of modern France and Germany respectively. Middle Francia, that included Burgundy, the Low Countries and northern Italy among other regions was only short-lived until 855 and later reorganized as Lotharingia. The dispute over the kingship of Aquitaine was not fully settled until 860.\nLouis was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Arnould in Metz.\nMarriage and issue.\nBy his first wife, Ermengarde of Hesbaye (married c. 794), he had three sons and three daughters:\nBy his second wife, Judith of Bavaria, he had a daughter and a son:\nLouis had an illegitimate son and daughter:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, a liquid crystal can flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a common direction as in a solid. There are many types of LC phases, which can be distinguished by their optical properties (such as textures). The contrasting textures arise due to molecules within one area of material (\"domain\") being oriented in the same direction but different areas having different orientations. An LC material may not always be in an LC state of matter (just as water may be ice or water vapour).\nLiquid crystals can be divided into three main types: thermotropic, lyotropic, and metallotropic. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the LC phase as temperature changes. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their LC transition additionally depends on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\nExamples of LCs exist both in the natural world and in technological applications. Lyotropic LCs abound in living systems; many proteins and cell membranes are LCs, as well as the tobacco mosaic virus. LCs in the mineral world include solutions of soap and various related detergents, and some clays. Widespread liquid-crystal displays (LCD) use liquid crystals.\nHistory.\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist Friedrich Reinitzer, working at the Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t, examined the physico-chemical properties of various derivatives of cholesterol which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the freezing point, but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative cholesteryl benzoate were not the most peculiar feature. He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not melt in the same manner as other compounds, but has two melting points. At it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to Otto Lehmann, at that time a \"\" in Aachen. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing crystallites. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of circularly polarized light, and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie.\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist Daniel Vorl\u00e4nder, who from the beginning of the 20th century until he retired in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.\nAfter World War II, work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book \"Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals\" became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125\u00a0\u00b0C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116\u00a0\u00b0C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22\u2013105\u00a0\u00b0C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.\nIn 1969, Hans Keller succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA), which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.\nThese molecules are rod-shaped, some created in the laboratory and some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two new types of LC molecules have been synthesized: disc-shaped (by Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar in India in 1977) and cone or bowl shaped (predicted by Lui Lam in China in 1982 and synthesized in Europe in 1985).\nIn 1991, when liquid crystal displays were already well established, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes working at the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud received the Nobel Prize in physics \"for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers\".\nDesign of liquid crystalline materials.\nA large number of chemical compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotic, conic (bowlic), and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are disc-like molecules consisting of a flat core of adjacent aromatic rings, whereas the core in a conic LC is not flat, but is shaped like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotic and conic LCs. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.\nAn extended, structurally rigid, highly anisotropic shape seems to be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior, and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings.\nLiquid-crystal phases.\nThe various liquid-crystal phases (called mesophases together with plastic crystal phases) can be characterized by the type of ordering. One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction). Liquid crystals are characterized by orientational order, but only partial or completely absent positional order. In contrast, materials with positional order but no orientational order are known as plastic crystals. Most thermotropic LCs will have an isotropic phase at high temperature: heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering and fluid-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant anisotropic orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.\nThe ordering of liquid crystals extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually not to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, such as the use of boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The orientational ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.\nThermotropic liquid crystals.\nThermotropic phases are those that occur in a certain temperature range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, a particular type of LC molecule (called a mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.\nNematic phase.\nThe simplest liquid crystal phase is the nematic. In a nematic phase, calamitic (rod-like) organic molecules lack a crystalline positional order, but do self-align with their long axes roughly parallel. The molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but their orientation is constrained to form a long-range directional order. \nThe word \"nematic\" comes from the Greek (\"\"), which means \"thread\". This term originates from the disclinations: thread-like topological defects observed in nematic phases. \nNematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects. In two dimensions, there are topological defects with topological charges + and -. Due to hydrodynamics, the + defect moves considerably faster than the - defect. When placed close to each other, the defects attract; upon collision, they annihilate. \nMost nematic phases are uniaxial: they have one axis (called a directrix) that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, some liquid crystals are biaxial nematic, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a secondary axis. Nematic crystals have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid-crystal displays (LCD).\nNematic phases are also known in non-molecular systems: at high magnetic fields, electrons flow in bundles or stripes to create an \"electronic nematic\" form of matter.\nSmectic phases.\nThe smectic phases, which are found at lower temperatures than the nematic, form well-defined layers that can slide over one another in a manner similar to that of soap. The word \"smectic\" originates from the Latin word \"smecticus\", meaning cleaning, or having soap-like properties.\nThe smectics are thus positionally ordered along one direction. In the Smectic A phase, the molecules are oriented along the layer normal, while in the Smectic C phase they are tilted away from it. These phases are liquid-like within the layers. There are many different smectic phases, all characterized by different types and degrees of positional and orientational order. Beyond organic molecules, Smectic ordering has also been reported to occur within colloidal suspensions of 2-D materials or nanosheets. One example of smectic LCs is \"p,p\"'-dinonylazobenzene.\nChiral phases or twisted nematics.\nThe chiral nematic phase exhibits chirality (handedness). This phase is often called the \"cholesteric\" phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal, hence they are also called \"twisted nematics\".\nThe \"chiral pitch\", p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360\u00b0 twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0\u00b0 and \u00b1180\u00b0 are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.\nBlue phases.\nBlue phases are liquid crystal phases that appear in the temperature range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.\nAlthough blue phases are of interest for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvins. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60\u00a0K including room temperature (260\u2013326\u00a0K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times of the order of 10\u22124\u00a0s. In May 2008, the first blue phase mode LCD panel had been developed.\nBlue phase crystals, being a periodic cubic structure with a bandgap in the visible wavelength range, can be considered as 3D photonic crystals. Producing ideal blue phase crystals in large volumes is still problematic, since the produced crystals are usually polycrystalline (platelet structure) or the single crystal size is limited (in the micrometer range). Recently, blue phases obtained as ideal 3D photonic crystals in large volumes have been stabilized and produced with different controlled crystal lattice orientations.\nDiscotic phases.\nDisk-shaped LC molecules can orient themselves in a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.\nConic phases.\nConic LC molecules, like in discotics, can form columnar phases. Other phases, such as nonpolar nematic, polar nematic, stringbean, donut and onion phases, have been predicted. Conic phases, except nonpolar nematic, are polar phases.\nLyotropic liquid crystals.\nA lyotropic liquid crystal consists of two or more components that exhibit liquid-crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges. In the lyotropic phases, solvent molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide fluidity to the system. In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, these lyotropics have another degree of freedom of concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases.\nA compound that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts within the same molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock copolymers.\nMetallotropic liquid crystals.\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like ZnCl2 that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature. This class of materials has been named metallotropic.\nLaboratory analysis of mesophases.\nThermotropic mesophases are detected and characterized by two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, in which a small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of mesogen in order to analyze that impact.\nBiological liquid crystals.\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as lipid polymorphism. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, biological membranes and cell membranes are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. phospholipids) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on lipid polymorphism). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by flippases and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT).\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated protein solution that is extruded by a spider to generate silk is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength. DNA and many polypeptides, including actively-driven cytoskeletal filaments, can also form liquid crystal phases. Monolayers of elongated cells have also been described to exhibit liquid-crystal behavior, and the associated topological defects have been associated with biological consequences, including cell death and extrusion. Together, these biological applications of liquid crystals form an important part of current academic research.\nMineral liquid crystals.\nExamples of liquid crystals can also be found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropic. The first discovered was vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase in the case of the smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained an open question for a very long time and was only confirmed recently.\nWith the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is increasing quickly, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene. A lamellar phase was even discovered, H3Sb3P2O14, which exhibits hyperswelling up to ~250\u00a0nm for the interlamellar distance.\nPattern formation in liquid crystals.\nAnisotropy of liquid crystals is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially than those of ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and is so strong that usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.\nTheoretical treatment of liquid crystals.\nMicroscopic theoretical treatment of fluid phases can become quite complicated, owing to the high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be ignored. In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\nDirector.\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the \"director\", is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.\nOrder parameter.\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter, the Q tensor is used to describe the orientational order of the most general biaxial nematic liquid crystal. However, to describe the more common case of uniaxial nematic liquid crystals, a scalar order parameter is sufficient. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second Legendre polynomial:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the \"local director\" (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its \"local optical axis\"). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, \"S\"\u00a0=\u00a00, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, \"S\" is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase. The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, diamagnetism, birefringence, Raman scattering, NMR and EPR can be used to determine S.\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the \"z\"-axis the density formula_3 is often given by:\nformula_4\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as formula_5 and formula_6 the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic formula_7 and for a smectic phase formula_8 will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.\nOnsager hard-rod model.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in physics\nCan the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a universal phase transition?\nMore unsolved problems in physics\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a \"decrease\" in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).\nThe fundamental insight here is that, whilst parallel arrangements of anisotropic objects lead to a decrease in orientational entropy, there is an increase in positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems. An extension of Onsager Theory was proposed by Flory to account for non entropic effects.\nMaier\u2013Saupe mean field theory.\nThis statistical theory, proposed by Alfred Saupe and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a mean-field average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment. Maier-Saupe mean field theory is extended to high molecular weight liquid crystals by incorporating the bending stiffness of the molecules and using the method of path integrals in polymer science.\nMcMillan's model.\nMcMillan's model, proposed by William McMillan, is an extension of the Maier\u2013Saupe mean field theory used to describe the phase transition of a liquid crystal from a nematic to a smectic A phase. It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second Legendre polynomial and the second order parameter is given by:\n formula_9\nThe values \"zi, \u03b8i\", and \"d\" are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\nformula_10\nHere constant \u03b1 quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.\nElastic continuum theory.\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) splay of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) bend of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is an effective tool for modeling liquid crystal devices and lipid bilayers.\nExternal influences on liquid crystals.\nScientists and engineers are able to use liquid crystals in a variety of applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\nElectric and magnetic field effects.\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n formula_11\nwhere formula_12, formula_13 and formula_14 are the components of the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is\n formula_15\n(summation over the doubly appearing index formula_16). In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of formula_17. The most general form to express formula_18 is\n formula_19\n formula_24\n(summation over formula_16). If formula_26 is positive, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when formula_27 and formula_17 are parallel. This means that the system will favor aligning the liquid crystal with the externally applied electric field. If formula_26 is negative, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when formula_27 and formula_17 are perpendicular (in nematics the perpendicular orientation is degenerated, making possible the emergence of vortices).\nThe difference formula_32 is called dielectrical anisotropy and is an important parameter in liquid crystal applications. There are both formula_33 and formula_34 commercial liquid crystals. 5CB and E7 liquid crystal mixture are two formula_33 liquid crystals commonly used. MBBA is a common formula_34 liquid crystal.\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.\nSurface preparations.\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called photoalignment.\nFr\u00e9edericksz transition.\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fr\u00e9edericksz transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\nThe Fr\u00e9edericksz transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\nEffect of chirality.\nAs already described, chiral liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.\nChirality can also be incorporated into a phase by adding a chiral dopant, which may not form LCs itself. Twisted-nematic or super-twisted nematic mixtures often contain a small amount of such dopants.\nQuantum Phenomena in Liquid Crystals.\nThe possibility of generating entangled photon pairs in liquid crystals was theoretically studied in the early 2020s using optical soliton models and anisotropic nonlinear media.\nEntangled Photon Generation for Liquid Crystal Qubits.\nThe generation of entangled photon pairs in a liquid crystal was first theoretically predicted by T. F. Kamalov and a group of researchers in 2022 https://. This effect is described in more detail in https://https://. Experimental confirmation of this effect was published in https://.\nBased on a mathematical model for the generation of entangled front pairs in liquid crystals, an optical element for generating entangled photon pairs was constructed. The conditions for photon formation in a liquid crystal (LC) layer for generating a pair of photons in an entangled quantum state (biphoton) in quantum calculations are considered.\nUsing knowledge of the physical parameters and nonlinear optical properties of liquid crystals, the geometric dimensions of a photon generated by an optical pulse, its dynamics, and stability were estimated. In nematic LCs, single photons with spatial dimensions of several tens of micrometers or even smaller are possible.\nThe formation time of these photons can range from fractions of a millisecond to tens of milliseconds, and their lifetime from fractions of a millisecond to hundreds of milliseconds.\nThe possibility of overlapping adjacent entangled photons (or regions within a liquid crystal layer, whose deformation is caused by the light wave field from successive light pulses) is being explored. This makes it possible to \"encode\" entangled states with a high degree of signal discrimination and perform quantum computing.\nApplications of liquid crystals.\nLiquid crystals find wide use in liquid crystal displays, which rely on the optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in the presence or absence of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 \u03bcm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90\u00b0 to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.\nLiquid crystal tunable filters are used as electro-optical devices, e.g., in hyperspectral imaging.\nThermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies strongly with temperature can be used as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.\nLiquid crystal lenses converge or diverge the incident light by adjusting the refractive index of liquid crystal layer with applied voltage or temperature. Generally, the liquid crystal lenses generate a parabolic refractive index distribution by arranging molecular orientations. Therefore, a plane wave is reshaped into a parabolic wavefront by a liquid crystal lens. The focal length of liquid crystal lenses could be continuously tunable when the external electric field can be properly tuned. Liquid crystal lenses are a kind of adaptive optics. Imaging systems can benefit from focusing correction, image plane adjustment, or changing the range of depth-of-field or depth of focus. The liquid crystal lens is one of the candidates to develop vision correction devices for myopia and presbyopia (e.g., tunable eyeglass and smart contact lenses). Being an optical phase modulator, a liquid crystal lens feature space-variant optical path length (i.e., optical path length as the function of its pupil coordinate). In different imaging system, the required function of optical path length varies from one to another. For example, to converge a plane wave into a diffraction limited spot, for a physically-planar liquid crystal structure, the refractive index of liquid crystal layer should be spherical or paraboloidal under paraxial approximation. As for projecting images or sensing objects, it may be expected to have the liquid crystal lens with aspheric distribution of optical path length across its aperture of interest. Liquid crystal lenses with electrically tunable refractive index (by addressing the different magnitude of electric field on liquid crystal layer) have potentials to achieve arbitrary function of optical path length for modulating incoming wavefront; current liquid crystal freeform optical elements were extended from liquid crystal lens with same optical mechanisms. The applications of liquid crystals lenses includes pico-projectors, prescriptions lenses (eyeglasses or contact lenses), smart phone camera, augmented reality, virtual reality etc.\nLiquid crystal lasers use a liquid crystal in the lasing medium as a distributed feedback mechanism instead of external mirrors. Emission at a photonic bandgap created by the periodic dielectric structure of the liquid crystal gives a low-threshold high-output device with stable monochromatic emission.\nPolymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) sheets and rolls are available as adhesive backed Smart film which can be applied to windows and electrically switched between transparent and opaque to provide privacy.\nMany common fluids, such as soapy water, are in fact liquid crystals.

In small arms, a \"long gun\" or longarm is generally designed to be held by both hands and braced against the shoulder, in contrast to a handgun, which can be fired being held with a single hand. In the context of cannons and mounted firearms, an artillery \"long gun\" would be contrasted with a field gun or howitzer.\nSmall arms.\nThe actual length of the barrels of a long gun is subject to various laws in many jurisdictions, mainly concerning minimum length, sometimes as measured in a specific position or configuration. The National Firearms Act in the United States sets a minimum length of for rifle barrels and for shotgun barrels. Canada sets a minimum of for either. In addition, Canada sets a minimum fireable length for long guns with detachable or folding stocks . In the United States, the minimum length for long guns with detachable or folding stocks is with the stock in the extended position.\nExamples of various classes of small arms generally considered long arms include, but are not limited to shotguns, personal defense weapons, submachine guns, carbines, assault rifles, designated marksman rifles, sniper rifles, anti-material rifles, light machine guns, medium machine guns, and heavy machine guns.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nAlmost all long arms have front grips (forearms) and shoulder stocks, which provide the user the ability to hold the firearm more steadily than a handgun. In addition, the long barrel of a long gun usually provides a longer distance between the front and rear sights, providing the user with more precision when aiming. The presence of a stock makes the use of a telescopic sight or red dot sight easier than with a handgun.\nThe mass of a long gun is usually greater than that of a handgun, making the long gun more expensive to transport, and more difficult and tiring to carry. The increased moment of inertia makes the long gun slower and more difficult to traverse and elevate, and it is thus slower and more difficult to adjust the aim. However, this also results in greater stability in aiming. The greater amount of material in a long gun tends to make it more expensive to manufacture, other factors being equal. The greater size makes it more difficult to conceal, and more inconvenient to use in confined quarters, as well as requiring larger storage space.\nAs long guns include a stock that is braced against the shoulder, the recoil when firing is transferred directly into the body of the user. This allows better control of aim than handguns, which do not include stock, and thus all their recoil must be transferred to the arms of the user. It also makes it possible to manage larger amounts of recoil without damage or loss of control; in combination with the higher mass of long guns, this means more propellant (such as gunpowder) can be used and thus larger projectiles can be fired at higher velocities. This is one of the main reasons for the use of long guns over handguns\u2014faster or heavier projectiles help with penetration and accuracy over longer distances.\nShotguns are long guns that are designed to fire many small projectiles at once. This makes them very effective at close ranges, but with diminished usefulness at long ranges, even with shotgun slugs they are mostly only effective to about .\nNaval long guns.\nIn historical navy usage, a long gun was the standard type of cannon mounted by a sailing vessel, called such to distinguish it from the much shorter carronades. In informal usage, the length was combined with the weight of the shot, yielding terms like \"long 9s\", referring to full-length cannons firing a 9-pound round shot.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, oxygen makes up about 8/9 of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining 1/9 of the mass: the mass of two elements in a compound are always in the same ratio. Along with the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry.\nHistory.\nThe law of definite proportion was given by Joseph Proust in 1797. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I shall conclude by deducing from these experiments the principle I have established at the commencement of this memoir, viz. that iron, like many other metals, is subject to the law of nature which presides at every true combination, that is to say, that it unites with two constant proportions of oxygen. In this respect, it does not differ from tin, mercury, and lead, and, in a word, almost every known combustible.\u2014\u200a\nAt the end of the 18th century, when the concept of a chemical compound had not yet been fully developed, the law was novel. In fact, when first proposed, it was a controversial statement and was opposed by other chemists, most notably Proust's fellow Frenchman Claude Louis Berthollet, who argued that the elements could combine in any proportion. The existence of this debate demonstrates that, at the time, the distinction between pure chemical compounds and mixtures had not yet been fully developed.\nThe law of definite proportions contributed to the atomic theory that John Dalton promoted beginning in 1805, which explained matter as consisting of discrete atoms, that there was one type of atom for each element, and that the compounds were made of combinations of different types of atoms in fixed proportions.\nA related early idea was Prout's hypothesis, formulated by English chemist William Prout, who proposed that the hydrogen atom was the fundamental atomic unit. From this hypothesis was derived the whole number rule, which was the rule of thumb that atomic masses were whole-number multiples of the mass of hydrogen. This was later rejected in the 1820s and 30s following more refined measurements of atomic mass, notably by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius, which revealed in particular that the atomic mass of chlorine was 35.45, which was incompatible with the hypothesis. Since the 1920s, this discrepancy has been explained by the presence of isotopes; the atomic mass of any isotope is very close to satisfying the whole number rule, with the mass defect caused by differing binding energies being significantly smaller.\nNon-stoichiometric compounds and isotopes.\nAlthough very useful in the foundation of modern chemistry, the law of definite proportions is not universally true. There exist non-stoichiometric compounds whose elemental composition can vary from sample to sample. Such compounds follow the law of multiple proportions. An example is the iron oxide w\u00fcstite, which can contain between 0.83 and 0.95 iron atoms for every oxygen atom, and thus contain anywhere between 23% and 25% oxygen by mass. The ideal formula is FeO, but it is about Fe0.95O due to crystallographic vacancies. In general, Proust's measurements were not precise enough to detect such variations.\nIn addition, the isotopic composition of an element can vary depending on its source, hence its contribution to the mass of even a pure stoichiometric compound may vary. This variation is used in radiometric dating since astronomical, atmospheric, oceanic, crustal and deep Earth processes may concentrate some environmental isotopes preferentially. Except for hydrogen and its isotopes, the effect is usually small, but is measurable with modern-day instrumentation.\nMany natural polymers vary in composition (for instance DNA, proteins, carbohydrates) even when \"pure\". Polymers are generally not considered \"pure chemical compounds\" except when their molecular weight is uniform (mono-disperse) and their stoichiometry is constant. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17982", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17982", "title": "Limbo", "text": "Theological concept\nThe unofficial term Limbo (from la \" limbus\"\u00a0'edge, boundary', referring to the edge of Hell) is the afterlife condition in medieval Catholic theology, of those who die in original sin without being assigned to the Hell of the Damned. However, it has become the general term to refer to nothing between time and space in general. \nSome medieval theologians of Western Europe described the underworld (\"hell\", \"hades\", \"infernum\") as divided into three distinct parts: Hell of the Damned, Limbo of the Fathers or Patriarchs, and Limbo of the Infants. \nThe Limbo of the Fathers is the state or place for people who were friends of God but died before the death of Jesus Christ; when Jesus died he descended into hell and rescued the souls of those who had died before him: this is traditionally known as the harrowing of hell.\nThe Limbo of the Infants was the hope that just because a child died before baptism, it does not mean they deserve punishment (or are developed enough to be cognizant of separation from God), though they cannot have full salvation (or experience the Beatific Vision.) The Limbo of the Infants is neither affirmed nor denied by Catholic doctrine.\nLimbo of the Patriarchs.\nThe \"Limbo of the Patriarchs\" or \"Limbo of the Fathers\" (Latin ) is seen as the temporary state of those who, despite the sins they may have committed, died in the friendship of God but could not enter heaven until redemption by Jesus Christ made it possible. The term \"Limbo of the Fathers\" was a medieval name for the part of the underworld (Hades) where the patriarchs of the Old Testament were believed to be kept until Christ's soul descended into it by his death through crucifixion and freed them. \nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Christ's descent into Hell as meaning primarily that \"the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection. This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into Hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead.\" It adds: \"But he descended there as Saviour, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there.\" It does not use the word \"Limbo\".\nThis concept of Limbo affirms that admittance to heaven is possible only through the intervention of Jesus Christ, but does not portray Moses, etc. as being punished eternally in Hell. The concept of Limbo of the Patriarchs is not spelled out in Scripture, but is seen by some as implicit in various references:\nAccording to Saint Thomas Aquinas, unlike Purgatory and Hell, in the Limbo of Patriarchs there was not the penalty of sense (the affliction by fire in which the soul burns after death and also the body after the resurrection of the flesh), but solely the penalty of harm, which is the privation of the beatific vision of God. However, the souls in Limbo of Patriarchs enjoyed the natural knowledge of God and experienced great joy because of the future glory that awaited them in Paradise.\nLimbo of Infants.\nThe Limbo of Infants (Latin or ) is the hypothetical permanent status of the unbaptised who die in infancy, too young to have committed actual sins, but not having been freed from original sin. Recent Catholic theological speculation tends to stress the hope, although not the certainty, that these infants may attain heaven instead of the state of Limbo. Many Catholic priests and prelates say that the souls of unbaptized children must simply be \"entrusted to the mercy of God\", and whatever their status is cannot be known.\nWhile the Catholic Church has a defined doctrine on original sin, it has none on the eternal fate of unbaptised infants, leaving theologians free to propose different theories, which magisterium is free to accept or reject. Nonetheless, according to Catholic dogma, baptism, or at least the desire for it, along with supernatural faith or at least the \"habit of faith\", are necessary for salvation. Hence, it is not immediately clear how to reconcile the mercy of God for unbaptized infants with the necessity of baptism and Catholic faith for salvation. Several theories have been proposed. Limbo is one such theory, although the word \"limbo\" itself is never mentioned in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Nonetheless, the theory of limbo has weighty support in the traditional teaching of the Doctors of the Church, such as Saint Thomas Aquinas, Saint Augustine, and Saint Alphonsus Liguori.\nLatin Fathers.\nIn countering Pelagius, who denied original sin, Saint Augustine of Hippo was led to state that because of original sin, \"such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle says: 'Judgment from one offence to condemnation' (Romans 5:16), and again a little after: 'By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation'.\"\nIn 418, the Council of Carthage, a synod of North African bishops which included Augustine of Hippo, did not explicitly endorse all aspects of Augustine's stern view about the destiny of infants who die without baptism, but stated in some manuscripts \"that there is no intermediate or other happy dwelling place for children who have left this life without Baptism, without which they cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, that is, eternal life\". So great was Augustine's influence in the West, however, that the Latin Fathers of the 5th and 6th centuries (e.g., Jerome, Avitus of Vienne, and Gregory the Great\nMedieval theologians.\nIn the later Medieval period, some theologians continued to hold Augustine's view. In the 12th century, Peter Abelard (1079\u20131142) said that these infants suffered no material torment or positive punishment, just the pain of loss at being denied the beatific vision. Others held that unbaptised infants suffered no pain at all: unaware of being deprived of the beatific vision, they enjoyed a state of natural, not supernatural happiness. This theory was associated with but independent of the term \"Limbo of Infants\", which was coined about the year 1300.\nIf heaven is a state of supernatural happiness and union with God, and Hell is understood as a state of torture and separation from God then, in this view, the Limbo of Infants, although technically part of hell (the outermost part, \"limbo\" meaning 'outer edge' or 'hem') is seen as a sort of intermediate state.\nThe question of Limbo is not treated in the parts of the by Thomas Aquinas, but is dealt with in an appendix to the supplement added after his death compiled from his earlier writings. The Limbo of Infants is there described as an eternal state of natural joy, untempered by any sense of loss at how much greater their joy might have been had they been baptised:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every man who has the use of free-will is adapted to obtain eternal life, because he can prepare himself for grace whereby to merit eternal life; so that if he fails in this, his grief will be very great, since he has lost what he was able to possess. But children were never adapted to possess eternal life, since neither was this due to them by virtue of their natural principles, for it surpasses the entire faculty of nature, nor could they perform acts of their own whereby to obtain so great a good. Hence, they will nowise grieve for being deprived of the divine vision; nay, rather will they rejoice for that they will have a large share of God's goodness and their own natural perfections. Nor can it be said that they were adapted to obtain eternal life, not indeed by their own action, but by the actions of others around them, since they could be baptised by others, like other children of the same condition who have been baptised and obtained eternal life: for this is of superabundant grace that one should be rewarded without any act of one's own. Wherefore the lack of such a grace will not cause sorrow in children who die without Baptism, any more than the lack of many graces accorded to others of the same condition makes a wise man to grieve.\u2014\u200a\nThe natural happiness possessed in this place would consist in the perception of God mediated through creatures. As stated in the International Theological Commission's document on the question:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Because children below the age of reason did not commit actual sin, theologians came to the common view that these unbaptized children feel no pain at all or even that they enjoy a full, though only natural, happiness through their mediated union with God in all natural goods (Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus).\nThe afterdeath life cartography that runs through Christian thought from Bernard of Clairvaux to Aquinas is thus composed of five real and physical places: Paradise, Limbo of Patriarchs, Limbo of the Infants, Purgatory and Hell.\nModern era.\nIn 1442, the Ecumenical Council of Florence spoke of baptism as necessary even for children, and required that they be baptised soon after birth. This had earlier been affirmed at the Council of Carthage in 418. The Council of Florence also stated that those who die in original sin alone go to Hell, but with pains unequal to those suffered by those who had committed actual mortal sins. John Wycliffe's attack on the necessity of infant baptism was condemned by another general council, the Council of Constance. In 1547, the Council of Trent explicitly decreed that baptism (or desire for baptism) was the means by which one is transferred \"from that state wherein man is born a child of the first Adam, to the state of grace, and of the adoption of the sons of God, through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our Saviour. Pope Pius X taught of Limbo's existence in his Catechism.\nHowever, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, individual theologians (Bianchi in 1768, H. Klee in 1835, Caron in 1855, H. Schell in 1893) continued to formulate theories of how children who died unbaptised might still be saved. By 1952 a theologian such as Ludwig Ott could, in a widely used and well-regarded manual, openly teach the possibility that children who die unbaptised might be saved for heaven. He also told about Thomas Cajetan, a major 16th-century theologian, that suggested infants dying in the womb before birth, and so before ordinary sacramental baptism could be administered, might be saved through their mother's wish for their baptism. In its 1980 instruction on children's baptism the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated that \"with regard to children who die without having received baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as indeed she does in the funeral rite established for them\", leaving all theories as to their fate, including Limbo, as viable possibilities. In 1984, when Joseph Ratzinger, then Cardinal Prefect of that Congregation, stated that he rejected the claim that children who die unbaptised cannot attain salvation, he was speaking for many academic theologians of his training and background.\nThe Church's teaching, expressed in the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church, is that \"Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament\", and that \"God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments\". It recalls that, apart from the sacrament, baptism of blood (as in the case of Christian martyrs) and in the case of catechumens who die before receiving the sacrament, explicit desire for baptism, together with Catholic faith, repentance for their sins (specifically perfect contrition, in the case of catechumens) and charity, ensures salvation. It also states that since Christ died for all and all are called to the same divine destiny, \"every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved\", seeing that, if they had known of the necessity of baptism, they would have desired it explicitly. Additionally, at the Council of Trent and in the Vatican's response to Feeneyism in the 1940s, the Church affirmed in every case the necessity of Catholic faith (also called \"supernatural faith\"), or at least the \"habit of faith\", for salvation.\nIt then states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: \"Let the children come to me, do not hinder them\", allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.\nMerely stating that one can \"hope\" in a way of salvation other than baptism, the Church thus urgently reiterates its appeal to baptize infants, the only certain means to \"not prevent\" their \"coming to Christ\" for salvation.\nOn 20 April 2007, the advisory body known as the International Theological Commission released a document, originally commissioned by Pope John Paul II, entitled \"The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized.\" After tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, including that connected with the theory of the Limbo of Infants, and after examining the theological arguments, the document stated its conclusion as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our conclusion is that the many factors that we have considered above give serious theological and liturgical grounds for hope that unbaptized infants who die will be saved and enjoy the beatific vision. We emphasize that these are reasons for prayerful hope, rather than grounds for sure knowledge. There is much that simply has not been revealed to us. We live by faith and hope in the God of mercy and love who has been revealed to us in Christ, and the Spirit moves us to pray in constant thankfulness and joy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What has been revealed to us is that the ordinary way of salvation is by the sacrament of baptism. None of the above considerations should be taken as qualifying the necessity of baptism or justifying delay in administering the sacrament. Rather, as we want to reaffirm in conclusion, they provide strong grounds for hope that God will save infants when we have not been able to do for them what we would have wished to do, namely, to baptize them into the faith and life of the Church.\nPope Benedict XVI authorized publication of this document, indicating that he considers it consistent with the Church's teaching, though it is not an official expression of that teaching. Media reports that by the document \"the Pope closed Limbo\" are thus without foundation. In fact, the document explicitly states that \"the theory of \"limbo\" [...] never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium. Still, that same Magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the Second Vatican Council. It remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis\". The document thus allows the limbo hypothesis to be held as one of the existing theories about the fate of children who die without being baptised, a question on which there is \"no explicit answer\" from Scripture or tradition. The traditional theological alternative to Limbo was not heaven, but rather some degree of suffering in Hell. At any rate, these theories are not the official teaching of the Catholic Church but rather opinions that the Church permits to be held by its members, just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without baptism.\nIn other denominations and religions.\nJudaism.\nWhile Jewish sources are conflicted about what happens to individuals after they die, the concept of limbo does not arise. Furthermore, even the conception of Hell in Judaism is presented as a temporary stage, typically transpiring over a short period of time. According to Talmud, the judgment of the wicked in Gehenna lasts for twelve months. This teaching is attributed to Rabbi Akiva (50-135 AD).\nChristianity.\nProtestant and Eastern Orthodox.\nNeither the Eastern Orthodox Church nor Protestantism accepts the concept of a limbo of infants; but, while not using the expression \"Limbo of the Patriarchs\", the Eastern Orthodox Church lays much stress on the resurrected Christ's action of liberating Adam and Eve and other righteous figures of the Old Testament, such as Abraham and David, from Hades (see Harrowing of Hell).\nSome Protestants have a similar understanding of those who died as believers prior to the crucifixion of Jesus residing in a place that is not Heaven, but not Hell. The doctrine holds that Hades has two \"compartments\", one an unnamed place of torment, the other named \"Abraham's bosom\". Luke 16:19\u201316:26 speaks of a chasm fixed between the two which cannot be crossed. Those in the unnamed \"compartment\" have no hope, and will ultimately be consigned to hell. Those in Abraham's bosom are those of whom it is written of Jesus, \"When He ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives\" (Ephesians 4:8), quoting Psalm 68:18). These individuals, the captives, now reside with God in Heaven. Both \"Compartments\" still exist, but Abraham's bosom is now empty, while the other chamber is not, according to this doctrine.\nNontrinitarian.\nLatter-day Saints teach that \"there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body[...] a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time[...] that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.\" It is also taught that \"all who have died without a knowledge of [the] gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God.\".\nJehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians, and others have taught that the dead are unconscious (or even nonexistent), awaiting their destiny on Judgment Day.\nZoroastrianism.\nThe Zoroastrian concept of \"hamistagan\" is similar to Limbo. Hamistagan is a neutral state in which a soul that was neither good nor evil awaits Judgment Day.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, which denies the existence of original sin in totality, the concept of Limbo exists as , the state that exists after death, prior to the day of resurrection. During this period, sinners are punished and the adequately purified rest in comfort. Children, however, are exempt from this stage, as they are regarded as innocent and are automatically classed as Muslims (despite religious upbringing). After death, they go directly to Heaven, where they are cared for by Abraham. According to Christian Louis Lange, Islam also possesses a (cf. Q.7:46) \"a residual place or limbo\" situated between heaven and hell where there is \"neither punishment nor reward\".\nGreek mythology.\nIn Classical Greek mythology, the section of Hades known as the Fields of Asphodel were a realm much resembling Limbo, to which the vast majority of people who were held to have deserved neither the Elysian Fields (Heaven) nor Tartarus (Hell) were consigned for eternity.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhism, \"Bardo\" (Sanskrit: ) is sometimes described as similar to limbo. It is an intermediate state in which the recently deceased experiences various phenomena before being reborn in another state, including heaven or hell. According to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, the arhat must ultimately embrace the path of the bodhisattva, despite having reached enlightenment. The La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra states that an arhat obtains a ('rapture-body') and is reborn in a lotus in a transitory state of existence, unable to awaken for a whole eon. This is likened to a person intoxicated who must spend a certain period of time before becoming sober.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Classical Greek, the word \"lethe\" (\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b7) literally means \"forgetting\", \"forgetfulness\". The river is also known as Amel\u0113s Potamos, or the \"river of unmindfulness\".\nThe Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness. The river was often associated with Lethe, the personification of forgetfulness and oblivion, who was the daughter of Eris (Strife).\nMythology.\nLethe, the river of forgetfulness, was one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld; the other four are Acheron (the river of sorrow), Cocytus (the river of lamentation), Phlegethon (the river of fire) and Styx (the river that separates Earth and the Underworld). In myth, the shades of the dead were only able to be reincarnated after they drank from the Lethe which would wash away all their memories.\nLocation.\nThe river Lethe was said to be located next to Hades's palace in the underworld under a cypress tree. Orpheus would give some shades a password to tell Hades's servants which would allow them to drink instead from the Mnemosyne (the pool of memory), which was located under a poplar tree. According to Statius, Lethe bordered Elysium, the final resting place of the virtuous. Ovid wrote that the river flowed through the cave of Hypnos, god of sleep, where its murmuring would induce drowsiness.\nRole in religion and philosophy.\nSome ancient Greeks believed that souls were made to drink from the river before being reincarnated, so that they would not remember their past lives. The Myth of Er in Book X of Plato's \"Republic\" tells of the dead arriving at a barren waste called the \"plain of Lethe\", through which the river \"Ameles\" (\"careless\") runs. It states that those who drank from the river would drink until they forgot everything unless they had been \"saved by wisdom.\"\nA few mystery religions taught the existence of another river, the Mnemosyne; those who drank from the Mnemosyne would remember everything and attain omniscience. Initiates were taught that they would receive a choice of rivers to drink from after death, and to drink from Mnemosyne instead of Lethe.\nThese two rivers are attested in several verse inscriptions on gold plates dating to the 4th century BC and onward, found at Thurii in Southern Italy and elsewhere throughout the Greek world. There were rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne at the oracular shrine of Trophonius in Boeotia, from which worshippers would drink before making oracular consultations with the god. An https://, said to be dated from between the second and third century B.C., warns readers to avoid the Lethe and to seek the Mnemosyne instead. Drinkers of the Lethe's water would not be quenched of their thirst, often causing them to drink more than necessary.\nMore recently, Martin Heidegger used \"l\u0113th\u0113\" to symbolize not only the \"concealment of Being\" or \"forgetting of Being\", but also the \"concealment of concealment\", which he saw as a major problem of modern philosophy. Examples are found in his books on Nietzsche (Vol 1, p.\u00a0194) and on Parmenides. Philosophers since, such as William J. Richardson have expanded on this school of thought.\nReal rivers.\nAccording to Strabo, the Lima river, located between modern-day Norte Region, Portugal, and Galicia, Spain was also known as the River of Lethe in antiquity. The river got this name after an expedition made by a group of Celts and the Turduli during which they got into a disagreement and the Celts lost their chieftain (leader) causing them to scatter and settle in place. The river was also said to have the same properties of memory loss as the legendary Lethe River. In 138 BCE, the Roman general Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus sought to dispose of the myth, as it impeded his military campaigns in the area. He was said to have personally crossed the Lima, and then called his soldiers from the other side, one by one, by name. The soldiers, astonished that their general remembered their names, crossed the river as well without fear. This act proved that the Lima was not as dangerous as the local myths described.\nIn C\u00e1diz, Spain, the river Guadalete was originally named \"Lethe\" by local Greek and Phoenician colonists who, about to go to war, solved instead their differences by diplomacy and named the river Lethe to forever forget their former differences. When the Arabs conquered the region much later, their name for the river became Guadalete from the Arabic phrase \"\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0644\u0643\u0629\" (Wadi lakath) meaning \"River of Forgetfulness\".\nIn Alaska, a river which runs through the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is called the River Lethe.

He is best known for his comic novels \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" (1759\u20131767) and \"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\" (1768).\nSterne grew up in a military family, travelling mainly in Ireland but briefly in England. He attended Jesus College, Cambridge, on a sizarship, gaining bachelor's and master's degrees, and was ordained as a priest in 1738. While Vicar of Sutton-on-the-Forest, Yorkshire, he married Elizabeth Lumley in 1741. He briefly wrote political propaganda for the Whigs, but abandoned politics in 1742. In 1759, he wrote an ecclesiastical satire \"A Political Romance\", which embarrassed the church and was burned. Having discovered his talent for comedy, at age 46 he dedicated himself to humour writing as a vocation. Also in 1759, he published the first volume of \"Tristram Shandy\", which was an enormous success and continued for a total of nine volumes. He was a literary celebrity for the rest of his life. In addition to his novels, he published several volumes of sermons. Sterne died in 1768 and was buried in the yard of St George's, Hanover Square.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLaurence Sterne was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary, in the Kingdom of Ireland on 24 November 1713. His father, Roger Sterne, was an ensign in a British regiment recently returned from Dunkirk. Roger's social standing was far lower than that of his recent ancestors: Roger's grandfather Richard Sterne had been the Archbishop of York. Roger was the second son of Richard's second son, and consequently, Roger inherited little of the familial wealth. Roger left his family to join the army at the age of 25; he enlisted uncommissioned, which was unusual for someone from a family of high social position. Roger married Agnes Herbert n\u00e9e Nuttall, the widow of a military captain, in 1711. Laurence was the second of their seven children, one of only three to survive to adulthood.\nThe first decade of Laurence Sterne's life was impoverished and unsettled. After his birth, the family spent six months in Clonmel, then ten months at Roger's mother's estate in Elvington, North Yorkshire, while Roger had no army posting. From 1715 to 1723, the Sternes moved repeatedly (about once a year) between poor family lodgings in army barracks in Britain and Ireland, with brief ownership of a townhouse in Dublin during a particularly prosperous stint from 1717 to 1719. These postings included three separate moves to Dublin, at other times living in Plymouth, the Isle of Wight, Wicklow, Annamoe, and Carrickfergus. In 1723, at the age of ten, Sterne was relocated to his uncle's household in Halifax, on the condition that he would repay his uncle for the cost of his upkeep and education. This arrangement reflected both the poor financial resources of Sterne's father, and the strained relationship he had with his wealthier family members. Sterne never saw his father again, as Roger was next ordered to Jamaica where he died of malaria in 1731.\nEducation and ecclesiastical career.\nSterne attended boarding school at Hipperholme Grammar School in Yorkshire, near his uncle's estate. There, he received a traditional classical education. In July 1733, at the age of twenty, he was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge with a sizarship that allowed him to afford attendance. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in January 1737. Sterne was ordained as a deacon on 6 March 1737 and as a priest on 20 August 1738. He returned to Cambridge in the summer of 1740 to be awarded his Master of Arts. His religion is said to have been the \"centrist Anglicanism of his time\", known as latitudinarianism. A few days after his ordination as a priest, Sterne was awarded the vicarage living of Sutton-on-the-Forest in Yorkshire.\nSterne married Elizabeth Lumley on 30 March 1741, despite both being ill with consumption. Only one of their several children survived infancy, a daughter named Lydia. Throughout their marriage, Sterne had adulterous affairs, and developed \"an unsavoury but deserved reputation as a libertine\".\nIn 1743, he was presented to the neighbouring living of Stillington by Reverend Richard Levett, prebendary of Stillington, who was patron of the living. Subsequently, Sterne did duty both there and at Sutton. Sterne lived in Sutton for 20 years, during which time he continued a close friendship that had begun at Cambridge with John Hall-Stevenson, a witty and accomplished \"bon vivant\", owner of Skelton Hall in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire.\nSterne's life at this time was closely tied with his uncle, Jaques Sterne, the archdeacon of Cleveland and precentor of York Minster. Sterne's uncle was an ardent Whig, and urged Sterne to begin a career of political journalism. Sterne wrote anonymous propaganda in the \"York Gazetteer\" from 1741 to 1742. Sterne's published attacks on the Tory party earned him career favours from the church (including a prebendary of York Minster), but also harsh personal criticism. Sterne abruptly abandoned his political writing, leading to a permanent falling-out with his uncle, and stalling his ecclesiastical career.\nIn 1744, Sterne purchased several pieces of farmland in Sutton, with the hope that raising crops and dairy cattle would supplement his household's foodstores and finances. However, the farm was not particularly successful. Meanwhile, he sought patronage from John Fountayne, a college acquaintance who became Dean of York in 1747. To earn Fountayne's favor, Sterne wrote the Latin sermon which Fountayne preached in order to earn his doctorate of divinity. In 1751, Fountayne granted Sterne a very minor post, the commisaryship of Pocklington and Pickering. In 1758, Sterne gave up directly farming his land, and leased the property out. He relocated to York to assist Fountayne with bureaucratic tasks, in hopes of further preferment.\nWriting.\nIn 1759, Sterne contributed to a pamphlet war related to Fountayne's rivalries within the church. Fountayne was criticized by an ambitious ecclesiastical lawyer, Francis Topham, who complained that he had been unfairly passed over for the commissaryship granted to Sterne. Topham and Fountayne published a series of open letters criticizing each other, which spurred several replies from their acquaintance. Sterne published \"A Political Romance\" in January 1759, a satirical work with unflattering caricatures of Fountayne's critics. Unusually for a pamphlet, Sterne explicitly attached his name to the work. The Archbishop of York was embarrassed by how public the church's internal disputes had become, and ordered all 500 copies of \"A Political Romance\" burned. Sterne complied, but a handful of copies accidentally survived from other owners.\nDespite its lack of success, \"A Political Romance\" was a turning point for Sterne. Reportedly, he later said that before finishing it, \"he hardly knew he could write at all, much less with humour, so as to make his reader laugh.\" At the age of 46, Sterne dedicated himself to writing for the rest of his life. He immediately began work on his best-known novel, \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\", the first volumes of which were published in 1759. Sterne was at work on his celebrated comic novel during the year that his mother died, his wife was seriously ill, and his daughter was also taken ill with a fever. He wrote as fast as he possibly could, composing the first 18 chapters between January and March 1759. Sterne borrowed money for the printing of his novel, suggesting that he was confident in the prospective commercial success of his work.\nThe publication of \"Tristram Shandy\" made Sterne famous in London and on the continent. He was delighted by the attention, famously saying, \"I wrote not [to] be \"fed\" but to be \"famous\".\" He spent part of each year in London, being f\u00eated as new volumes appeared. As Sterne assiduously promoted his book, some of the attention he received was scandal: at the time, it was slightly disreputable for any gentleman to write for financial gain; for a clergyman to appear motivated by money, and to use \"indecent\" humour to pursue it, was doubly questionable. Sterne's bawdiness was criticized in a series of 1760s pamphlets, and he was encouraged to \"mend his style\" by the Bishop of Gloucester. Even after the publication of volumes three and four of \"Tristram Shandy\", Sterne's love of attention (especially as related to financial success) remained undiminished. In one letter, he wrote, \"One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly, as the other half cry it up to the skies \u2014 the best is, they abuse it and buy it, and at such a rate, that we are going on with a second edition, as fast as possible.\" Baron Fauconberg rewarded Sterne by appointing him as the perpetual curate of Coxwold in the North Riding of Yorkshire in March 1760.\nIn 1766, the Black Briton Ignatius Sancho wrote to Sterne, encouraging him to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade. Sterne replied that he had just been at work on \"a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl\", and volume nine included a scene with a Black shop girl too kindhearted to kill flies. Sterne and Sancho's correspondence was widely publicised beginning in 1775, and this scene and their letters became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.\nForeign travel.\nSterne's intensive writing efforts worsened his tuberculosis, and in January 1762 he travelled to France to benefit from the warmer climate. He attached himself to a diplomatic party bound for Turin, as England and France were still adversaries in the Seven Years' War. Sterne was gratified by his reception in France, where reports of the genius of \"Tristram Shandy\" made him a celebrity. After a few months he invited his wife and daughter to join him, since his daughter's health was also suffering. They met him in Paris in July 1762, and made the move to Toulouse. He had several dangerous bouts of illness, including six weeks sick in an epidemic fever, but his daughter's health did improve. In June 1763, Sterne was bored of Toulouse and the family spent some time travelling. In March 1764, Sterne settled his wife and daughter in Montauban and returned to England alone, travelling via Paris and London and finally reaching York in June. There, he continued to delegate his clerical duties to the curate who had performed them during his absence, and focused on fiction writing.\nHe travelled again through France and Italy from 1765 to 1766, departing England in October 1765. He travelled through Paris, Lyons, Turin, and several other Italian cities on his way to Rome. He reached Naples in early 1766. His health improved, though that of his daughter, who had relocated to Tours, did not. He visited them in May 1766 as part of his return journey, and returned to Yorkshire by the end of June.\nWhile travelling, Sterne did not keep a journal, though he told his acquaintances he planned to write a travel narrative of his journey. Aspects of his experiences abroad were incorporated into his second novel, \"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\".\nEliza.\nEarly in 1767, Sterne met Eliza Draper, the wife of an official of the East India Company, while she was staying on her own in London. He was captivated by Eliza's charm and vivacity, and they began a mutual flirtation. They met frequently and exchanged miniature portraits. Sterne's admiration turned into an obsession, which he took no trouble to conceal. To his great distress, Eliza had to return to India three months after their first meeting, and he died a year later without seeing her again. In 1768, Sterne published his \"Sentimental Journey\", which contains some extravagant references to her; and their relationship aroused considerable interest. He also wrote his \"Journal to Eliza\", part of which he sent to her, and the rest of which came to light when it was presented to the British Museum in 1894. After Sterne's death, Eliza allowed ten of his letters to be published under the title \"Letters from Yorick to Eliza\" and succeeded in suppressing her letters to him, though some blatant forgeries were produced in a volume of \"Eliza's Letters to Yorick\".\nDeath.\nLess than a month after \"Sentimental Journey\" was published, Sterne died in his lodgings at 41 Old Bond Street on 18 March 1768, at the age of 54. He was buried in the churchyard of St George's, Hanover Square, on 22 March.\nIt was rumoured that Sterne's body was stolen shortly after it was interred and sold to anatomists at Cambridge University. Circumstantially, it was said that his body was recognised by Charles Collignon, who knew him and discreetly reinterred him back in St George's, in an unknown plot. A year later a group of Freemasons erected a memorial stone with a rhyming epitaph near to his original burial place. A second stone was erected in 1893, correcting some factual errors on the memorial stone. When the churchyard of St. George's was redeveloped in 1969, amongst 11,500 skulls disinterred, several were identified with drastic cuts from anatomising or a post-mortem examination. One was identified to be of a size that matched a bust of Sterne made by Nollekens. The skull was held up to be his, albeit with \"a certain area of doubt\". Along with nearby skeletal bones, these remains were transferred to Coxwold churchyard in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust. The story of the reinterment of Sterne's skull in Coxwold is alluded to in Malcolm Bradbury's novel \"To the Hermitage\".\nWorks.\nThe works of Laurence Sterne are few in comparison to other eighteenth-century authors of comparable stature. Sterne's early works were letters; he had two sermons published (in 1747 and 1750) and tried his hand at satire. He was involved in and wrote about local politics in 1742. His major publication prior to \"Tristram Shandy\" was the satire \"A Political Romance\" (1759), aimed at conflicts of interest within York Minster. A posthumously published piece on the art of preaching, \"A Fragment in the Manner of Rabelais\", appears to have been written in 1759. Rabelais was by far Sterne's favourite author, and in his correspondence, he made clear that he considered himself as Rabelais' successor in humour writing, distancing himself from Jonathan Swift.\nSterne's novel \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" sold widely in England and throughout Europe. Translations of the work began to appear in all the major European languages almost immediately upon its publication. The novel itself starts with the narration, by Tristram, of his own conception. It proceeds mostly by what Sterne calls \"progressive digressions\" so that we do not reach Tristram's birth before the third volume. The novel is rich in characters and humour, and the influences of Rabelais and Miguel de Cervantes are present throughout. The novel ends after 9 volumes, published over a decade, but without anything that might be considered a traditional conclusion. Sterne inserts sermons, essays and legal documents into the pages of his novel; and he explores the limits of typography and print design by including marbled pages and an entirely black page within the narrative.\nEnglish writer and literary critic Samuel Johnson's verdict in 1776 was that \"Nothing odd will do long. \"Tristram Shandy\" did not last.\" This is strikingly different from the views of continental European critics of the day, who praised Sterne and \"Tristram Shandy\" as innovative and superior. Voltaire called it \"clearly superior to Rabelais\", and later Goethe praised Sterne as \"the most beautiful spirit that ever lived\". Swedish translator Johan Rundahl described Sterne as an arch-sentimentalist. Sterne influenced European writers as diverse as Denis Diderot and the German Romanticists. His work also had noticeable influence over Brazilian author Machado de Assis, who made use of the digressive technique in the novel \"The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas\". The Russian Formalist writer Viktor Shklovsky regarded \"Tristram Shandy\" as the archetypal, quintessential novel, \"the most typical novel of world literature.\" Many of the innovations that Sterne introduced, adaptations in form that were an exploration of what constitutes the novel, were highly influential to Modernist writers like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, and more recent writers such as Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace. Italo Calvino referred to \"Tristram Shandy\" as the \"undoubted progenitor of all avant-garde novels of our century\". More recently, scholarly opinions of \"Tristram Shandy\" include those who minimize its significance as an innovation. Since the 1950s, following the lead of D. W. Jefferson, there are those who argue that, whatever its legacy of influence may be, \"Tristram Shandy\" in its original context actually represents a resurgence of a much older, Renaissance tradition of \"Learned Wit\" \u2013 owing a debt to such influences as the Scriblerian approach.\nSterne's final novel, \"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\", has many stylistic parallels with \"Tristram Shandy\", and the narrator is one of the minor characters from the earlier novel. At its first publication, \"A Sentimental Journey\" was warmly received by readers who saw it as more sentimental and less bawdy than \"Tristram Shandy\". From Sterne's death through the nineteenth century, \"A Sentimental Journey\" was considered Sterne's best and most beloved work, and it was more widely reprinted than \"Tristram Shandy\". Today, \"A Sentimental Journey\" is often interpreted by critics as part of the same artistic project to which \"Tristram Shandy\" belongs. In addition to his fiction, two volumes of Sterne's \"Sermons\" were published during his lifetime; more copies of his \"Sermons\" were sold in his lifetime than copies of \"Tristram Shandy\". In the years after Sterne's death, his family published additional sermons, as well as letter collections of his correspondence.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Linear\u00a0A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization. It evolved into Linear B, which was used by the Mycenaeans to write an early form of Greek. It was discovered by the archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in 1900. No texts in Linear A have yet been deciphered. Evans named the script \"Linear\" because its characters consisted simply of lines inscribed in clay, in contrast to the more pictographic characters in Cretan hieroglyphs \u2013 likewise undeciphered \u2013 that were used during the same period.\nLinear A belongs to a group of scripts that evolved independently of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian systems. During the second millennium BC, there were four major branches: Linear\u00a0A, Linear B, Cypro-Minoan, and Cretan hieroglyphic. In the 1950s, Linear B was deciphered and found to have an underlying language of Mycenaean Greek. Linear A shares many glyphs and alloglyphs with Linear\u00a0B, and the syllabic glyphs are thought to notate similar syllabic values, but none of the proposed readings lead to a language that scholars can understand.\nScript.\nLinear A consists of over 300 signs including regional variants and ones which occur only once. Among these, a core group of 90 occur with some frequency throughout the script's geographic and chronological extent.\n&lt;br&gt;\n The complex sign in the top row is formed out of the two on the bottom row.\nAs a logosyllabic writing system, Linear A includes signs which stand for syllables as well as others standing for words or concepts. Linear A's signs could be combined via ligature to form complex signs. Complex signs usually behave as ideograms and most are hapax legomena, meaning that they occur only once in the surviving corpus. Linear A signs are divided into four categories:\nLinear A was usually written left-to-right, but a handful of documents were written right-to-left or boustrophedon.\nSpecial signs.\nFurthermore, the following \u2018supplementary\u2019 syllabograms for more complex syllables can be identified (where in some cases the exact pronunciation is or used to be unknown even for Linear B, hence the use of subscript numbers):\nIdeograms.\nThe following list contains some frequent ideograms/logograms whose meaning is known and uncontroversial and almost all of which are preserved in Linear B. The meaning of many others is debated. Note that some of the ideograms are also used as syllabograms; in such cases, the sound value is indicated in the table before the Bennett number.\nNumerals.\nThese numerals follow a decimal system: units are represented by vertical dashes, tens by horizontal dashes, hundreds by circles, and thousands by circles with rays. There are special symbols to indicate fractions and weights. Specific signs that coincide with numerals are regarded as fractions; these sign combinations are known as \"klasmatograms\".\nIntegers can be read and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are quite straightforward, similarly to Roman numerals.\nFractions.\nThere is a lack of scholarly agreement about signs, generally called klasmatograms, for Linear A fractions. In 2021 Corazza et al. proposed the following values, most of which had been previously suggested:\nOther fractions are composed by addition: the common JE and DD are &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20446), BB = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445, EF = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20448, etc. (and indeed B &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445 looks like it might derive from KK &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u204410). L, Y, and \u03a9 are hapax legomena (only occur once) and it has been proposed that glyph L is spurious.\nSeveral of these values are supported by Linear B. Although Linear B used a different numbering system, several of the Linear A fractions were adopted as fractional units of measurement. For example, Linear B DD and (presumably AA) are &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204412 of a \"lana\", while K is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204410 of the main unit for dry weight.\nCorpus.\nLinear\u00a0A has been found chiefly on Crete, but also at other sites in Greece, as well as Turkey and Israel. The extant corpus, comprising some 1,427 specimens totals 7,362 to 7,396 signs. Linear\u00a0A has been written on various media, such as stone offering tables and vessels, gold and silver hairpins, roundels, and ceramics. The earliest inscriptions of Linear\u00a0A come from Phaistos, in a layer dated at the end of the Middle Minoan\u00a0II period: that is, no later than c.\u00a01700\u00a0BC. Linear\u00a0A inscriptions have been found throughout the island of Crete and also on some Aegean islands (Kythera, Kea, Thera, Melos, Samothrace), in mainland Greece (Ayios Stephanos) in Laconia, on the west coast of Asia Minor (Miletus, Troy), and in the Levant (Tel Haror, Tel Lachish).\nThe first comprehensive compendium of Linear A inscriptions (sometimes referred to as GORILA) was produced by Louis Godart and Jean-Pierre Olivier in multiple volumes between 1976 and 1985. In 2011 work began on a supplement to that compendium. In 2020 a project was begun, called https://, to put all the known Linear A inscriptions online at a single site.\nTablets.\nAlmost all Linear A tablets, most in a fragmentary condition, have been found on the island of Crete, dated to the Neopalatial Period. At that time Crete was divided by mountains and other geographic features into a number of polities, each with its own urban center. These tablets have been found at Hagia Triada (147 tablets), Petras (2 tablets), Phaistos (26 tablets), Knossos (6 tablets), Archanes (7 tablets), Myrtos Pyrgos (2 tablets), Palaikastro (2 tablets), Zakros (31 tablets), Tylissos (2 tablets), Malia (6 tablets), Gournia (1 tablet), and Khania (99 tablets). One Linear\u00a0A tablet was found on Kea in the Cyclades. Three tablet fragments were found on the island of Santorini (Thera). The handful of known Cretan Hieroglyphs tablets (with relatively few signs) were also found on Crete at Malia and Kato Symi.\nSealed documents.\nSeals and clay sealings served the same role of inventory control and ownership as in the ancient Near East and Egypt. Large numbers of sealings have been found, primarily on Crete and in the Late Minoan IB period. The primary sources of sealed documents come from Haghia Triada (1103), Zakros (560), Khania (210), Knossos (125), Phaistos (35), Malia (6), and Tylissos (5). It is not clear what was commonly used to impress the sealing as only a few Linear A inscribed \"seal stones\" have been found. In other regions cylinder seals and stamp seals fulfilled this role.\nSealed documents are divided by archaeologists into four classes:\nLibation tables.\nA group of Minoan finds, usually from sanctuaries, have traditionally been called libation tables. They come in full sized and miniature versions, usually of stone. Because of the findspots, at cultic sites like Mount Juktas, they are usually assumed to be religious in nature though that is not certain. So far about 1000 libation tables have been recovered at 27 different sites on Crete, of which 41 have Linear A inscriptions. These inscriptions follow a standardized \"libation formula\", a formula also found on a few other objects, primarily vessels.\nThe \"libation formula\" has been much studied. A similar construct in Cretan Hieroglyphs, the \"Archanes Formula\", is the main proposed link to Linear\u00a0A.\nOther sources.\nWhile most of the recovered Linear A signs have come from tablets, libation tables and related ritual objects, and sealed documents, a number of very short Linear A inscriptions have been found in the Minoan area of operation, primarily in the form of potmarks and mason's marks. A problem is that it can be difficult to tell if a single-sign (or even doubleton) is Linear A, Linear B, or Cretan Hieroglyphs because of the overlap in sign use. Vessel sherds were found at Traostalos, bearing three signs in total. Four vase sherds were found at Thera with signs, as well as a ostrakon with one sign. A vessel fragment was found at Miletus. Two pithoi with very fragmentary inscriptions were found at Pseira. Graffiti has been found at places like Hagia Triada. A small clay ball with three Linear A signs was found at Mikro Vouni on the island of Samothrace. A small stone tab with two signs was excavated in Ayios Stephanos, Laconia. A silver hair pin and a gold ring, both with fairly long Linear A inscriptions, were found at Mavro Spelio in Knossos. At Armenoi a stone amulet was found in a tholos grave from the Linear Minoan IB period inscribed with a combination of two Linear A ideograms.\nA Linear\u00a0A inscription was said to have been found in southeast Bulgaria. Another, somewhat more solid, find was at Tel Lachish. A Minoan graffito found at Tel Haror on a vessel fragment is either Linear\u00a0A or Cretan hieroglyphs.\nSeveral tablets inscribed in signs similar to Linear\u00a0A were found at Troy in northwestern Anatolia. While their status is disputed, they may be imports, as there is no evidence of Minoan presence in the Troad. Classification of these signs as a unique Trojan script (proposed by contemporary Russian linguist Nikolai Kazansky) is not accepted by other linguists. Two Linear A inscribed clay spindle whorls were also found at Troy.\nChronology.\nThe earliest attestation of Linear\u00a0A begins around 1800\u00a0BC (Middle Minoan\u00a0IB) during the Protopalatial period. It became prominent around 1625\u00a0BC (Middle Minoan\u00a0IIIB) and went out of use around 1450\u00a0BC (Late Minoan\u00a0I) during the Neopalatial period. It was contemporary with and possibly derived from Cretan hieroglyphs, and may be an ancestor of Linear\u00a0B. The Cypro-Minoan syllabary, used between Cyprus and its trading partners around the Mediterranean, was also in use during this period. The sequence and the geographical spread of Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear\u00a0A, and Linear\u00a0B, the three overlapping but distinct writing systems on Bronze Age Crete and the Greek mainland, can be summarized as follows:\nDecipherment.\nLinear A has not been fully deciphered. However, researchers are reasonably confident in the approximate sound values of most syllabic signs and are able to make inferences about the meanings of some texts.\nChallenges to decipherment.\nOne major barrier to its decipherment is the limited surviving corpus. Only around 1400 Linear A inscriptions survive, in contrast to the 6000 available for Linear B. As a result, researchers are stuck with limited sample sizes, making it difficult to reliably detect patterns. Similarly, Linear A inscriptions are often fragmentary, damaged, or otherwise hard to read. It can be difficult to individuate particular signs and to distinguish separate signs from handwriting variants. Finally, Linear A inscriptions tend to be brief and repetitive. Rather than complete sentences, many are lists where each entry consists of a toponym or personal name followed by a logogram and then a numeral. Thus, the surviving corpus contains few spelled-out words and limited evidence of the grammatical structure.\nA second barrier is the scarcity of external evidence. No bilingual inscriptions have been found, preventing the script from being deciphered in the manner that Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered using the Rosetta Stone. The underlying language of Linear A has not been determined, and it is not clear that the same language was used for its entire period of use. The grammatical evidence that can be gleaned from the surviving corpus suggests that it was not a close relative of any known language.\nPhonetic values.\nFor most of Linear A's syllabic signs, approximate sound values can be inferred based on the values of corresponding signs in Linear B. These sound values are widely accepted by current researchers, though they are not considered incontrovertible and many details remain up for debate. This does not amount to a complete decipherment, since it results in words that are uninterpretable.\nThese values are based on the \"homomorphy-homophony principle\" which states that in related writing systems, signs with similar forms will generally have similar phonetic values. Although this principle is not reliable across the board, there are a number of reasons why scholars have concluded that it does generally hold between Linear A and Linear B. \nOne reason is that is already known to hold in many cases between Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, another script which descends from Linear A. This fact is taken as evidence that these signs were inherited by both scripts along with their Linear A phonetic values. For example, the Linear B \ud800\udc2e and Cypriot \ud802\udc29 both have the sound value \"se\", suggesting that the homomorphic Linear A sign \ud801\ude08 had the same sound value. Similarly, since Linear B \ud800\udc1e and Cypriot \ud802\udc1e were both pronounced \"pa\", the homomorphic Linear A sign \ud801\ude02 is likely to have had a similar pronunciation. Among the core syllabic signs, roughly 10 show clear signs of such parallels across the scripts, though additional correspondences have been proposed on the basis of less secure paleographic evidence.\nAnother reason is that many Linear B sign sequences that denote toponyms and personal names appear in Linear A documents as well. This fact would be explained if these sign sequences were pronounced similarly. For example, the Linear A toponym would be read as , corresponding to the placename Phaistos attested in Linear B as . Similar instances have been found for toponyms such as \"se-to-i-ja\" and \"su-ki-ri-ta\", and for personal names such as \"da-i-pi-ta\" and \"pa-ra-ne\". In some cases, Linear A names appear in Linear B with Greek case endings, for instance Linear A \"qa-qa-ru\" corresponding to Linear B \"qa-qa-ro\" and \"di-de-ru\" to \"di-de-ro\". These shared words have been taken as evidence for shared sound values of the signs that appear in them.\nAnother reason is that Linear A words sometimes come in multiple variants whose differences would be phonologically motivated if Linear B sound values are assumed. For example, the Linear A word also comes in the variant , differing only in its initial sign. The alternation between the initial signs would be explained if these signs had a systematic phonological relationship, similar to the method of Kober's Triplets, used in the decipherment of Linear B. Such a relationship would exist if the Linear A signs \ud801\ude07 and \ud801\ude31 were pronounced as \"a\" and \"ja\" respectively, just like the homomorphic Linear B signs \ud800\udc00 and \ud801\ude31. In this case, the words would differ only in the presence of a \"j-\" prefix, while the \"a\" vowel would be preserved. Similar arguments have been made based on other seemingly morphologically related pairs.\nHowever, in particular cases scholars have identified reasons to expect divergence in pronunciation between Linear A and Linear B. Some scholars have argued that Minoan did not really have the vowel /o/ as a phoneme, that it may not have had the labialised velars that the \"q\"-signs express in Mycenaean, and that the only apparent voiced stop, \"d\", was really a dental fricative in Minoan. The latter note is further supported by the principle that \"if a voicing contrast is used at all in a language, it normally runs right across the various categories of consonants\".\nThe following table shows signs that are known to be syllabograms and for which \"provisional\" and \"approximate\" sound values are assumed primarily based on the known pronunciations of identical or similar signs in Linear B.\nWhile many of those assumed to be syllabic signs are similar to ones in Linear B, approximately 80% of Linear A's logograms are unique; the difference in sound values between Linear A and Linear B signs ranges from 9% to 13%.\nUnderlying language.\nLinear A does not encode any known language. The placeholder term \"Minoan language\" is often used, though it is not certain that the texts are all in the same language. Minoan appears to be agglutinative, making copious use of prefixes and suffixes. It has been argued to have had a three vowel system, since it shares Linear B's //, //, and // series, but not all of Linear B's // and // series. Based on regularities in the Linear A Libation Formulas, it has been argued that its word order was Verb Subject Object.\nScholars have noted a number of potential parallels between Minoan and Anatolian languages such as Luwian and Lycian, as well as with Semitic languages such as Phoenician and Ugaritic. However, even if these connections are not coincidental, it is unclear whether Minoan is related to one of these languages or if the parallels arose through language contact.\nUnicode.\nThe Linear A alphabet (U+10600\u2013U+1077F) was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0. Current as of the latest Unicode version, 15.1.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17990", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17990", "title": "Lucasfilm Games", "text": "American video game company\nLucasfilm Games (known as LucasArts between 1990 and 2021) is an American video game licensor, former video game developer and publisher, and a subsidiary of Lucasfilm. It was founded in May 1982 by George Lucas as a video game development group alongside his film company; as part of a larger 1990 reorganization of the Lucasfilm divisions, the video game development division was grouped and rebranded as part of LucasArts. LucasArts became known for its line of adventure games based on its SCUMM engine in the 1990s, including \"Maniac Mansion\", the \"Monkey Island\" series, and several \"Indiana Jones\" titles. A number of influential game developers were alumni of LucasArts from this period, including Brian Moriarty, Tim Schafer, Ron Gilbert, and Dave Grossman. Later, as Lucasfilm regained control over its licensing over the \"Star Wars\" franchise, LucasArts produced numerous action-based \"Star Wars\" titles in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while dropping adventure game development due to waning interest in the genre.\nLucasfilm was wholly acquired by The Walt Disney Company in December 2012, and by April 2013, Disney had announced the shuttering of LucasArts in all but name, keeping the division around to handle licensing of Lucasfilm properties to third-party developers, primarily Electronic Arts (EA), and having any in-house development transferred to Disney Interactive Studios. Disney has, since 2021, revitalized the Lucasfilm Games brand as the licenser of all Lucasfilm-related properties.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 1979, George Lucas wanted to explore other areas of entertainment and created the Lucasfilm Computer Division in 1979, which included a department for computer games (the Games Group) and another for graphics. The graphics department was spun off into its own corporation in 1986, ultimately becoming Pixar.\nThe Lucasfilm Games Group originally cooperated with Atari, Inc., which helped fund the video game group's founding, to produce video games. Though the group had spun out of Lucasfilm, the video game development license for Lucasfilm's \"Star Wars\" was held by Atari at the time, forcing the group to start with original concepts; Ron Gilbert, one of the group's first employees, believed that if the Lucasfilm Games Group had the rights for \"Star Wars\" from the start, they would have never branched into any new intellectual property.\nThe first products from the Games Group were \"Ballblazer\" and \"Rescue on Fractalus!\", developed in 1984 for the Atari 5200 console and Atari 8-bit computers. Beta versions of both games were leaked to pirate bulletin boards exactly one week after Atari had received unprotected copies for a marketing review, and were in wide circulation over a year before the original release date. Planned to be released in the 3rd quarter of 1984 under the Atari/Lucasfilm label, the games were delayed when Warner Communications sold the assets of the consumer division of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel in July of that year, and were ultimately picked up by publisher Epyx and released by May 1985. Lucasfilm's next two games were \"Koronis Rift\" and \"The Eidolon\". Their first games were only developed by Lucasfilm, and a publisher would distribute the games. Atari published their games for Atari systems, Activision and Epyx would do their computer publishing. \"Maniac Mansion\" was the first game to be published and developed by Lucasfilm Games.\nThe early charter of Lucasfilm Games was to make experimental, innovative, and technologically advanced video games. \"Habitat\", an early online role-playing game and one of the first to support a graphical front-end, was one such title. It was only released as a beta test in 1986 by Quantum Link, an online service for the Commodore 64. Quantum Link could not provide the bandwidth at the time to support the game, so the full Habitat was never released outside of the beta test. However, Lucasfilm Games recouped the cost of development by releasing a sized-down version called \"Club Caribe\" in 1988. Lucasfilm later licensed the software to Fujitsu, who released it in Japan as \"Fujitsu Habitat\" in 1990. Fujitsu later licensed Habitat for world-wide distribution, and released an updated version called \"WorldsAway\" in 1995. The latest iteration of Habitat is still called \"WorldsAway\", which can be found at MetroWorlds.\nInitially, the Games Group worked from Lucas' Skywalker Ranch near Nicasio, California. In 1990, in a reorganization of the Lucas companies, the Games Division of Lucasfilm became part of the newly created LucasArts Entertainment Company, which also comprised Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound. Later ILM and Skywalker Sound were consolidated in Lucas Digital Ltd. and LucasArts became the official name of the former Games Division. During this, the division had moved out of Skywalker Ranch to near-by offices in San Rafael, California.\nAlso in 1990, LucasArts started to publish \"The Adventurer\", their own gaming magazine where one could read about their upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The final issue was published in 1996.\nIn the same year, Lucas Learning was created as a subsidiary of LucasArts, providing educational software for classrooms.\niMUSE.\n\"iMUSE\" (\"Interactive MUsic Streaming Engine\") is an interactive music system used in a number of LucasArts video games. It synchronizes music with the visual action in the game, and transitions from one musical theme to another. iMUSE was developed in the early 1990s by composers Michael Land and Peter McConnell while working at LucasArts. The iMUSE system is patented by LucasArts, and was added to the SCUMM game engine in 1991. The first game to use iMUSE was \"\" and it has been used in all LucasArts adventure games since. It has also been used for some non-adventure LucasArts titles, including ' (DOS version), ' (DOS version), and \"\".\nAction side-scrolling games.\nLucasfilm Games also released several side-scrollers during the \"Lucasarts\" era, focusing primarily on run and gun gameplay. A trilogy of games under the name of \"Super Star Wars\" for the SNES, with each game based on each of the three films from the Star Wars original trilogy: \"Super Star Wars\" (1992), ' (1993) and ' (1994). An Indiana Jones game based on the first three films of the franchise titled \"Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures\" (1994) was developed alongside Factor 5, the first of many joint collaborations between the two studios.\nThey also released some games not based on their existing IPs. \"Zombies Ate My Neighbors\" (1993) and its sequel \"Ghoul Patrol\" (1994) were overhead run and gun side-scrollers inspired by classic 1950s Horror B-movies. A spiritual successor called \"Herc's Adventures\" was released in 1997 and was inspired by Greek mythology. \"Metal Warriors\" (1995), a side-scroller inspired by mecha anime, and \"Big Sky Trooper\" were also developed using the same engine as \"Zombies Ate My Neighbors\". Though these games sold poorly, they later garnered a cult following and are now considered to be Cult Classics from the 16-Bit era.\nAdventure games.\nThe first adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games was ' in 1986, based on the Lucasfilm movie of the same name. The 1987 title \"Maniac Mansion\" introduced SCUMM, the scripting language behind most of the company's later adventure offerings. The adventures released in the following years, such as \"Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders\" in 1988, ' in 1989, and the 1990 titles \"Loom\" and \"The Secret of Monkey Island\" helped Lucasfilm Games build a reputation as one of the leading developers in the genre. The original five adventure games created with SCUMM were released in a compilation titled \"LucasArts Classic Adventures\" in 1992.\nLucasArts was often referred to as one of the two big names in the field, competing with Sierra On-line as a developer of high quality adventures. The first half of the 1990s was the heyday for the company's adventure fame, with classic titles such as ' in 1991, \"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\" in 1992, ' and \"Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road\" in 1993, and the 1995 titles \"Full Throttle\" and \"The Dig\".\nIn the latter half of the decade, the popularity of adventure games faded and the costs associated with game development increased as high-resolution art and C.D.-quality audio became standard fare. The PC market wanted titles that would show off expensive new graphics cards to best effect, a change replicated in the home console market as the 3D capabilities of the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64 dictated the nature of the majority of games produced for those platforms. The adventure genre failed to find popularity with the masses of new gamers.\nDespite their declining popularity, LucasArts still continued to release adventure titles. In 1997, \"The Curse of Monkey Island\", the last LucasArts adventure game to retain traditional two-dimensional graphics and point-and-click interface, was released. This was followed by \"Grim Fandango\" in 1998, LucasArts' first attempt to convert a 2D adventure to a 3D environment. The highly stylised visuals, outstanding soundtrack, superb voice acting and sophisticated writing earned Grim Fandango many plaudits, including GameSpot's Game of the Year award. \"Escape from Monkey Island\" (2000), the fourth installment in the \"Monkey Island\" series, featured the same control scheme as Grim Fandango, and was generally well received. It is the last original adventure game the company has released.\nTwo sequels to existing franchises, \"Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels\" and \"\", were announced to be in development but these projects were cancelled, in 2003 and 2004 respectively, before the games were finished. When the rights to the Sam &amp; Max franchise expired in 2005, the creator of Sam &amp; Max, Steve Purcell, regained ownership. He then licensed Sam &amp; Max to Telltale Games to be developed into an episodic game. Telltale Games was made up primarily of former LucasArts employees who had worked on the Sam &amp; Max sequel and were let go after the project was canceled.\nLucasArts halted adventure game development for the next five years, focusing instead on their \"Star Wars\" games. They remained silent and did not rerelease their old games on digital distribution platforms, as other studios were doing at the time. However, in 2002, the company pledged that at least 50% of its releases would have nothing to do with \"Star Wars\". It was not until 2009 that they returned to the genre. On June 1, 2009, LucasArts announced both \"The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition\", a high-definition remake of the original game with revised graphics, music and voice work, and \"Tales of Monkey Island\", a new episodic installment in the \"Monkey Island\" series that was developed by Telltale Games.\nThen, on July 6, 2009, they announced that they would be rereleasing a number of their classic games, including \"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\" and \"LOOM\", on Steam. The rereleases were, for the first time, native versions built for Microsoft Windows. This was the first time in many years that the studio had offered any support for its classic adventure titles.\nThe second game in the Monkey Island series also received a high-definition remake, entitled \"\" in 2010. Both Monkey Island special edition games were released in a compilation, \"Monkey Island Special Edition Collection\", exclusively in Europe in 2011.\nThe release of the unofficial SCUMM virtual machine, ScummVM, has led to something of a resurgence for LucasArts adventure games among present-day gamers. Using ScummVM, legacy adventure titles can easily be run on modern computers and even more unusual platforms such as video game consoles, mobile phones and PDAs.\nSimulation games.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lucasfilm Games developed a series of military vehicle simulation games, the first of which were the naval simulations \"PHM Pegasus\" in 1986 and \"Strike Fleet\" in 1987. These two titles were published by Electronic Arts for a variety of computer platforms, including IBM PC compatibles, Commodore 64 and Apple II.\nIn 1988, \"Battlehawks 1942\" launched a trilogy of World War II air combat simulations, giving the player a chance to fly as an American or Japanese pilot in the Pacific Theater. Battlehawks 1942 was followed by \"\" in 1989, recreating the battle between the \"Luftwaffe\" and RAF for Britain's air supremacy. The trilogy ended with \"Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe\" in 1991, in which the player could choose to fly on either the American or German side. The trilogy was lauded for its historical accuracy and detailed supplementary material\u2014Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe, for instance, was accompanied by a 224-page historical manual. The World War II trilogy was released with cover art by illustrator Marc Ericksen, in a compilation titled \"Air Combat Classics\" in 1994.\nThe World War II trilogy was created by a team led by Lawrence Holland, a game designer who later founded Totally Games. Totally Games would continue to develop games almost exclusively to LucasArts for a decade, with the most noted outcome of the symbiosis being . They were also responsible for LucasArts' 2003 return to the aerial battles of World War II with \"Secret Weapons Over Normandy\", a title released on PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC\nIn 1996, LucasArts released \"Afterlife\", a simulator in which players build their own Heaven and Hell, with several jokes and puns (such as a prison in Hell called San Quentin Tarantino).\nFirst \"Star Wars\" games.\nEven though LucasArts had created games based on other Lucasfilm properties before (\"Labyrinth\", \"Indiana Jones\"), they did not use the \"Star Wars\" license until the early 1990s, as it had been held by Broderbund before reverting to Lucasfilm in 1992. The first in-house development was the space combat simulator \"\", developed by Larry Holland's independent team, which went on to spawn a .\nThe CD-ROM-only \"Star Wars\" game \"Rebel Assault\" became one of the biggest successes of the company and was considered a killer app for CD-ROM drives in the early 1990s.\nFirst-person shooters.\nAfter the unprecedented success of id Software's \"Doom\", the PC gaming market shifted towards production of three-dimensional first person shooters. LucasArts contributed to this trend with the 1995 release of ', a first person shooter that successfully transplanted the Doom formula to a Star Wars setting. The Dark Forces Strategy guide claims that development was well underway before Doom was released and that the game was pushed back once Doom hit shelves so that it could be polished. The game was well received and spawned a new franchise: the \"Jedi Knight\" games. This began with the sequel to \"Dark Forces\", ' released in 1997; this game reflected the changing face of PC gaming, being one of the first games to appreciably benefit when used in conjunction with a dedicated 3D graphics card like 3dfx's Voodoo range. The game received an expansion pack, \"Mysteries of the Sith\", in 1998 and a full sequel in 2002 with '. 2003's ' can be seen as a spin-off from the series, but was less well received by reviewers, who complained that the franchise was becoming formulaic.\nApart from \"Star Wars\"-themed 3D shooters, LucasArts also created the western-themed game \"Outlaws\" in 1997 and \"Armed and Dangerous\" (in collaboration with Planet Moon Studios) in 2003.\nIn the new millennium.\nIn 2000, Simon Jeffery became the LucasArts president. He was president of LucasArts until 2003 and some successful \"Star Wars\" games released during his management like \"Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast\", \"Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2\", \"Knights of the Old Republic\", \"Star Wars Jedi Academy\" and \"Star Wars Galaxies\". Development of some other successful \"Star Wars\" Games began during his management, like \"Star Wars Republic Commando\" and \"Star Wars Battlefront\".\nIn April 2000, LucasArts signed a two-year international distribution deal with Activision for over 45 territories across the world including the United Kingdom. The company previously signed a two-year deal with Activision for distribution in select European territories in April 1998. The deal was extended in May 2003 and renewed again in March 2009.\nIn 2002, LucasArts recognized that the over-reliance on \"Star Wars\" was reducing the quality of its output, and announced that future releases would be at least 50% non-Star Wars-related. However, many of the original titles were either unsuccessful or even cancelled before release, and since then LucasArts again had mainly \"Star Wars\" titles in production.\nAlso in 2002, LucasArts released a compilation CD filled with music from their past games. The album is titled \"The Best of LucasArts Original Soundtracks\" and features music from the \"Monkey Island\" series, \"Grim Fandango\", \"Outlaws\", and \"The Dig\".\n2003 saw the fruitful collaboration of LucasArts and BioWare on the well reviewed role-playing game, '. Combining modern 3D graphics with high-quality storytelling and a sophisticated role-playing game system, this game reinvigorated the \"Star Wars\" franchise. Its 2004 sequel ' continued in the same vein, but LucasArts was criticized for forcing the developer Obsidian Entertainment to release the sequel unfinished, resulting in a significant amount of cut content, a disappointing ending and numerous bugs. 2003 also saw the release of \"Gladius\", a gladiator Tactical RPG that was positively received but sold poorly and was even rated as one of the \"best Xbox games most people never played\" by \"Official Xbox Magazine\".\nIn 2003, LucasArts and the \"Star Wars\" franchise also branched out in a new direction\u2014the world of the MMORPG, with the creation of \"Star Wars Galaxies\". After a successful launch, the first expansion, Jump to Lightspeed, was released in 2004. The new expansion featured the addition of real-time space combat. This was continued in \"Rage of the Wookiees\", an additional expansion which added an additional planet for users to explore. Also, a new expansion, \"Trials of Obi-Wan\" was released on November 1, 2005, consisting of several new missions focusing on the Episode 3 planet, Mustafar. While \"Star Wars Galaxies\" still retained a devoted following, it also alienated many players. \"Star Wars Galaxies\" chose to ignore the timeline established in the original films, during which the game is set, and also allowed players to play as Jedi characters. The game also underwent several major redesigns, which were received with mixed reactions by players.\nRestructuring under Jim Ward.\nIn April 2004, Jim Ward, V.P. of marketing, online and global distributions at Lucasfilm, was appointed president of LucasArts. Ward performed a top-to-bottom audit of LucasArts infrastructure, describing the company's state as \"quite a mess.\" In 2003, LucasArts had reportedly grossed just over $100,000,000 according to N.P.D., primarily from its \"Star Wars\" titles \u2014 significantly less than the grosses from the year's top single titles such as '. Ward produced a five-year investment plan to refit the company. Previous \"Star Wars\" games had been produced by external developers such as Raven Software, BioWare and Obsidian; Ward now prioritized making LucasArts' internal game development work effectively and adapt to the evolving game industry. ', ', and ' survived cuts that closed down other in-development games and reduced staff from about 450 to 190 employees.\nWard also canceled \"Star Wars Rogue Squadron Trilogy\" which was 50% completed and it was going to be released on the Xbox in 2004.\nFactor 5 was going to develop a \"Rogue Squadron\" game titled \"Rogue Squadron: X-Wing vs Tie Fighter\" for the Xbox 360 but it was canceled by LucasArts.\nAfter Factor 5's exclusivity with Sony ended they decided to release \"Rogue Squadron Trilogy\" for the Wii, but it was eventually cancelled as well.\nIn 2004, LucasArts released ', based on the same formula as the popular \"Battlefield\" series of games. It ended up becoming the best-selling \"Star Wars\" game of all time to that point, aided by a marketing tie-in with the original trilogy D.V.D. release. Its sequel, ', was released on November 1, 2005, and featured new locales such as Episode III planets Mustafar, Mygeeto, etc., in addition to space combat, playable Jedi, and new special units like Bothan spies and Imperial officers. In this same year, the second \"Knights of the Old Republic\" game was in production. LucasArts told Obsidian Entertainment that the project needed to be finished by that year's holiday season. Obsidian was forced to cut huge amounts of content from the game, resulting in a rushed, unfinished Knights of the Old Republic II.\nIn March 2005, LucasArts published ', the first game in the popular Lego video game franchise by Traveller's Tales. It was based on the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy. In May 2005, LucasArts released ', a third person action game based on the film. Also in 2005, LucasArts released ', and one of their few non-\"Star Wars\" games, ', developed by Pandemic Studios.\nOn February 16, 2006, LucasArts released ', a real-time strategy game developed by Petroglyph. September 12, 2006, saw the release of ', the sequel to the popular \"Lego Star Wars: The Video Game\". \"Lego Star Wars II\", once again developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts, follows the same basic format as the first game, but, as the name indicates, covers the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy.\nA game titled \"Traxion\" was announced. \"Traxion\" was a rhythm game which was under development for the PlayStation Portable by British developer Kuju Entertainment, scheduled to be released in Q4 2006 by LucasArts, but was instead cancelled in January 2007. The game was to feature a number of minigames, and would support imported songs from the player's own mp3 library as well as the game's bundled collection.\nIn May 2007, LucasArts announced \"Fracture\" and stated that \"new intellectual properties serve a vital role to the growth of LucasArts\". ' was labelled the number one new IP in 2005 and \"Thrillville\" the number one new children's IP in 2006. Fracture was released on October 7, 2008, to average reviews. \"Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction\" was released on January 11, 2005, to critical and commercial success which led to a sequel, '. \"Thrillville\" was released on November 21, 2006, and \" was released on October 16, 2007.\nOn September 16, 2008, \" was released to mixed reviews, though it quickly became the fastest-selling \"Star Wars\" game of all time.\nThe rapid scaling down of internal projects at LucasArts was also reflected in its handling of games developed by external developers. During the tenure of Ward, Free Radical was contracted to produce \"Star Wars: Battlefront III\", which had been in production for 2 years. Free Radical co-founder Steve Ellis described how working with LucasArts evolved from being \"the best relationship we'd ever had with a publisher\" to withholding money for 6 months and abusing the independent developer's position to withhold the full project cancellation fee\u2014this was a major event which contributed towards Free Radical entering administration.\nLast years as part of an independent Lucasfilm.\nWard left the company in early February 2008, for personal reasons. He was replaced by Howard Roffman as interim president. Darrell Rodriguez, who came from Electronic Arts, took Roffman's place in April 2008. About a month prior to release of \"\", LucasArts scaled down the internal development studio. The aforementioned game received a mediocre score from some media outlets such as IGN, GameSpot and GameTrailers. After release, minor adjustment in staffing resulted in even more layoffs.\nThe successor to \"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\", in the form of the MMORPG \"\", was announced on October 21, 2008, at an invitation-only press event. developed by BioWare. It was released in December 2011.\nThey also published ' in 2009 for all current systems. The game is a tie-in to ' television series and was released on October 6, 2009, receiving generally negative reviews.\nDuring television network G4's coverage of the 2006 E3 Convention, a LucasArts executive was asked about the return of popular franchises such as \"Monkey Island\". The executive responded that the company was currently focusing on new franchises, and that LucasArts may return to the \"classic franchises\" in 2015, though it was unclear as to whether the date was put forwards as an actual projection, or hyperbole. This turned out to be hyperbole, as LucasArts and Telltale Games announced new adventure games in a joint press release in 2009. The games announced were \"Tales of Monkey Island\", which was to be developed by Telltale, and a LucasArts-developed enhanced remake of the 1990 title \"The Secret of Monkey Island\", with the intent of bringing the old game to a new audience. According to LucasArts, this announcement was \"just the start of LucasArts' new mission to revitalize its deep portfolio of beloved gaming franchises\". Following the success of this, LucasArts released the sequel, \"\" in the summer of 2010.\nThe company began experiencing turnovers in layoffs in 2010. Rodriguez left in May after just two years on the job. A Lucasfilm board of Directors and a game industry veteran, Jerry Bowerman, filled in during the transition. Rodriguez was ultimately replaced in June by Paul Meegan, formerly of Gears of War developer Epic Games.\nIn July 2010, Haden Blackman, who served as creative director on the original \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\", LucasArts' most successful internally produced title of recent years, and the sequel, unexpectedly left. However, the company scored a surprise coup in August 2010 when Clint Hocking, a high-profile game director from Ubisoft, announced that he would be joining LucasArts. His tenure at LucasArts was short lived however, as Hocking left LucasArts in June 2012 before the game he was working on was released. In September 2010, a third of the employees at LucasArts were laid off.\nIn March 2011, LucasArts published a sequel to the popular Lego Star Wars series, \"\", based on the , once again developed by Traveller's Tales. Sony Online Entertainment announced in June 2011 that Star Wars Galaxies would be shutting down at the end of 2011. Its services were terminated on December 15, 2011.\nAnother canceled title of Lucasarts was a Darth Maul game which was going to be developed by the same company which made the Wii version of The Force Unleashed II.\nOn April 26, 2011, LucasArts announced that it had acquired a license from Epic Games to develop a number of future titles using the Unreal Engine 3 for a number of platforms. \"Star Wars 1313\", a proposed action-adventure about Boba Fett navigating Coruscant's subterranean underworld, was confirmed to use the Unreal Engine 3. However, the game was cancelled as a result of the closure of the development arm of LucasArts.\nIn April 2012, LucasArts published \"Kinect Star Wars\", developed by Terminal Reality, for the Xbox 360. It was poorly reviewed by critics, receiving an aggregated score of 53.32% on GameRankings and 55/100 on Metacritic.\nIn August 2012, Meegan, who replaced Rodriguez as president in 2010, also left his position at LucasArts after just two years on the job. Kevin Parker and Gio Corsi were named to co-lead the studio until the studio would choose a permanent president, with the former as interim head of business operations and the latter as interim head of studio production.\nThe last game released through LucasArts as a subsidiary of an independent Lucasfilm was \"Angry Birds Star Wars\", a game that gave the \"Angry Birds\" characters costumes and abilities based on the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. It was released on November 8, 2012, before the Disney acquisition of Lucasfilm was finalized. The game was developed and published by Rovio Entertainment, and licensed by LucasArts.\nAcquisition by Disney.\nThe Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm and its subsidiaries, including LucasArts, on December 21, 2012 following regulatory approval in a deal for $. At the time, there were no plans for any downsizing of Lucasfilm divisions, and a LucasArts representative said that \"for the time being, all projects are business as usual\". In the months that followed, LucasArts was believed to be working on three untitled games: an open-world RPG, an FPS, and an aerial combat game. This included cancelling \"Star Wars\" games already in development such as \"Star Wars 1313\", \"First Assault\" and \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed III\" to put more focus on \"\".\nOn April 3, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that it was shuttering its video game development practice and laying off most of the LucasArts staff. Any further game development would be handled by Disney Interactive Studios or licensed to third-party developers. A skeleton staff of fewer than ten employees remained at LucasArts to function as a video game licensor. Disney indicated that the new business model would \"[minimize] the company's risk while achieving a broad portfolio of quality \"Star Wars\" games.\" Around 150 staff members lost their jobs as a result of the closure. The layoffs at LucasArts also resulted in layoffs at fellow visual effects subsidiary Industrial Light &amp; Magic; as many of LucasArts' employees also worked for ILM, the company was left overstaffed. Electronic Arts became one of the major third-party publishers for \"Star Wars\" games through an exclusive multi-year license, while Disney Interactive Studios would handle development for the casual gaming market of \"mobile, social, tablet and online game categories\".\nLucasfilm Games since 2021.\nOn January 11, 2021, Lucasfilm announced that it was reestablishing the Lucasfilm Games brand for all future gaming titles from Lucasfilm, though it would remain solely as a licensor of Lucasfilm properties. Later that week, it was announced that MachineGames was developing a game based upon the \"Indiana Jones\" franchise with Todd Howard serving as an executive producer and Bethesda publishing the game, and that Massive Entertainment was developing an open world \"Star Wars\" game with Julian Gerighty serving as creative director and Ubisoft publishing the game. It was also revealed that EA was still in development on several games based upon the \"Star Wars\" franchise. In September 2021, it was announced that a remake of \"Knights of the Old Republic\" was in development. The game is being developed by Aspyr for Windows and PlayStation 5, for which it will serve as a timed console-exclusive. In December 2021, \"Star Wars Eclipse\" was announced at The Game Awards 2021; it is an action-adventure game in the early stages of development by Quantic Dream. The game will feature multiple playable characters with branching narratives. It is set in the \"Star Wars\" universe and is part of the ' multimedia project, which places the events of the game 200 years before the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. In January 2022, it was announced that Respawn Entertainment would be developing multiple Star Wars games, including a ' sequel, entitled \"\", alongside FPS and Strategy video games. In April 2022, it was announced that Lucasfilm Games would be co-publishing \"Return to Monkey Island\" alongside Devolver Digital, a sequel to \"LeChuck's Revenge\" with series creator Ron Gilbert returning to develop the game with his company \"Terrible Toybox.\" That same month, it was announced that Skydance New Media would be collaborating with Lucasfilm Games to make a game based in the \"Star Wars\" universe, with Amy Hennig leading the project. In June 2023, it was revealed that the \"Indiana Jones\" game from MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks would release for Windows and Xbox Series X/S as a console-exclusive. In August 2024, the new open-world action-adventure game \"Star Wars Outlaws\" was released in cooperation with Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft.\nLogo.\nThe original Lucasfilm Games logo was based upon the existing Lucasfilm movie logo, with a number of variations on it being used. This logo was later brought back when the Lucasfilm Games branding was revived in 2021. The long-lived LucasArts logo, affectionately known as the \"Gold Guy\", was introduced in 1990 and first used within \"Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge\" (the first game shipped under the LucasArts name). The logo consisted of a crude gold-colored figure inspired by an Ancestral Puebloan petroglyph, standing on a purple letter \"L\" inscribed with the company name. The figure had its hands up in the air, as if a sun were rising from behind him. It was also said to resemble an eye, with the rays of the sun as eyelashes. The logo was revised in late 2005, losing the letter \"L\" pedestal and introducing a more rounded version of the gold-colored figure. The last game to feature the original \"Gold Guy\" was ', while the new logo was first seen in '. In the games, the figure sometimes does an action like throw a lightsaber or cast Force Lightning.\nIn 1998, LucasArts approached Finnish game developer Remedy Entertainment, citing that their logo was copied from the top portion of the LucasArts logo, and threatened legal action. Remedy was by that time already in the process of redesigning their logo, so they complied by taking their old logo offline from their website, and introducing their new logo a little later.\nThe LucasArts Archives.\nThe LucasArts Archives are a series of CD-ROM personal computer game re-releases and compilations from publisher LucasArts.\nLater games published under the \"LucasArts Archives\" brand were budget-priced reissues of individual games, except for \"Monkey Island Archives\", which was a compilation of \"The Secret of Monkey Island\", ', and \"The Curse of Monkey Island\", released with \"The Curse of Monkey Islands box art.\nMany of the games that were released in these Archive collections are not directly compatible with modern operating systems, but can still be played using the ScummVM software. \"The LucasArts Macintosh Archives Vol. I\" was the top-selling Macintosh game for March, April, and May 1997, selling over 15,000 units over those three months.\nLegacy.\nEx-LucasArts developers have founded numerous San Francisco game development studios such as Double Fine Productions (2000), Telltale Games (2004), MunkyFun (2008), Dynamighty (2011), SoMa Play (2013), and Fifth Journey (2015) playing a significant role in the continued development of computer games in the Bay Area.\nAt the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Sony Computer Entertainment announced \"Grim Fandango Remastered\", developed by Double Fine Productions as a console exclusive for PlayStation platforms. It was released in 2015 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS. During Sony's new PlayStation Experience convention in 2014, another remaster by Double Fine, \"Day of the Tentacle Remastered\", was announced. It was released in March 2016 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. At the 2015 PlayStation Experience, another remastered game by Double Fine was announced, \"Full Throttle Remastered\". It was released in April 2017 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His writings offered unprecedented insight into Japanese culture, especially his collections of legends and ghost stories, such as \"\". Before moving to Japan and becoming a Japanese citizen, he worked as a journalist in the United States, primarily in Cincinnati and New Orleans. His writings about New Orleans, based on his decade-long stay there, are also well-known. His home in Orleans Parish is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum is in Japan.\nHearn was born on the Greek island of Lefkada but moved to Dublin, where he was abandoned first by his mother, then his father, and finally by his father's aunt (who had been appointed his official guardian). At the age of 19, he emigrated to the United States, where he found work as a newspaper reporter, first in Cincinnati and later in New Orleans. From there, he was sent as a correspondent to the French West Indies, in Martinique, where he stayed for two years, and then in 1890 to Japan, where he would remain for the rest of his life.\nIn Japan, Hearn married Koizumi Setsuko, with whom he had four children. His writings about Japan offered the Western world greater insight into a still largely unfamiliar culture.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nPatrick Lafcadio Hearn was born on 27 June 1850 on the Ionian Island of Lefkada, then part of a British protectorate, the United States of the Ionian Islands, now part of Greece. His mother was a Greek named Rosa Cassimati, a native of the Greek island of Kythera, while his father, Staff Surgeon of the Second Class Charles Bush Hearn, a British Army medical officer, was of Irish and English descent, who was stationed in Lefkada during the British protectorate of the United States of the Ionian Islands. Throughout his life, Lafcadio boasted of his Greek blood and felt a passionate connection to Greece. He was baptized Patrikios Lefcadios Hearn (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd) in the Greek Orthodox Church, but he seems to have been called \"Patrick Lefcadio Kassimati Charles Hearn\" in English; the middle name \"Lafcadio\" was given to him in honour of the island where he was born. Hearn's parents were married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on 25 November 1849, several months after his mother had given birth to Hearn's older brother, George Robert Hearn, on 24 July 1849. George died on 17 August 1850, two months after Lafcadio's birth.\nEmigration to Ireland and abandonment.\nHearn's father Charles in 1850 was reassigned from Lefkada to the British West Indies. Since his family did not approve of the marriage, and because he was worried that his relationship might harm his career prospects, Charles did not inform his superiors of his son or pregnant wife and left his family behind. In 1852, he arranged to send his son and wife to live with his family in Dublin, where they received a cool reception. Charles's Protestant mother, Elizabeth Holmes Hearn, had difficulty accepting Rosa's Greek Orthodox views and lack of education; she was illiterate and spoke no English. Rosa found it difficult to adapt to a foreign culture and the Protestantism of her husband's family, and was eventually taken under the wing of Elizabeth's sister, Sarah Holmes Brenane, a widow who had converted to Catholicism.\nDespite Sarah's efforts, Rosa suffered from homesickness. When her husband returned to Ireland on medical leave in 1853, it became clear that the couple had become estranged. Charles Hearn was assigned to the Crimean Peninsula, again leaving his pregnant wife and child in Ireland. When he came back in 1856, severely wounded and traumatized, Rosa had returned to her home island of Cerigo (Kythera), where she gave birth to their third son, Daniel James Hearn. Lafcadio had been left in the care of Sarah Brenane.\nCharles petitioned to have the marriage with Rosa annulled, on the grounds that she had not signed their marriage contract, which made it invalid under English law. After being informed of the annulment, Rosa almost immediately married Giovanni Cavallini, a Greek citizen of Italian ancestry, who was later appointed by the British as governor of Cerigotto (Antikythera). Cavallini required as a condition of the marriage that Rosa give up custody of both sons. As a result, James was sent to his father in Dublin while Lafcadio remained in the care of his great-aunt, Sarah Brenane, who had disinherited Charles because of the annulment. Neither Lafcadio nor James ever again saw their mother, who had four children with her second husband. Rosa was eventually committed to the National Mental Asylum on Corfu, where she died in 1882.\nCharles Hearn, who had left Lafcadio in the care of Sarah Brenane for the past four years, now appointed her as Lafcadio's permanent guardian. He married his childhood sweetheart, Alicia Goslin, in July 1857, and left with his new wife for a posting in Secunderabad, a city in India, where they had three daughters prior to Alicia's death in 1861. Lafcadio never saw his father again: Charles Hearn died of malaria in the Gulf of Suez in 1866.\nIn 1857, at age seven and despite the fact that both his parents were still alive, Hearn became the permanent ward of Sarah Brenane. She divided her residency between Dublin in the winter months, and her husband's estate at Tramore, County Waterford, on the southern Irish coast, and a house at Bangor in North Wales. Brenane engaged a tutor during the school year to provide Hearn with basic instruction and the rudiments of Catholic dogma. Hearn began exploring Brenane's library and read extensively in Greek literature, especially myths.\nCatholic education and more abandonment.\nIn 1861, his great-aunt, aware that Hearn was turning away from Catholicism and at the urging of Henry Hearn Molyneux, a relative of her late husband, he was sent to a Catholic college in France, but was disgusted with the life and gave up the Roman Catholic faith. He became fluent in French and would later translate into English the works of Guy de Maupassant and Gustave Flaubert.\nIn 1863, again at the suggestion of Molyneux, Hearn was enrolled at St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, a Catholic seminary in County Durham, England. In this environment, Hearn adopted the nickname \"Paddy\" to try to fit in better, and was the top student in English composition for three years. At age 16, while at Ushaw, Hearn injured his left eye. The eye became infected and, despite consultations with specialists in Dublin and London, and a year spent out of school convalescing, the eye went blind. Hearn also suffered from severe myopia, so his injury left him permanently with poor vision, requiring him to carry a magnifying glass for close work and a pocket telescope to see anything beyond a short distance. Hearn avoided eyeglasses, believing they would weaken his vision further. The iris was permanently discoloured, and left Hearn self-conscious about his appearance for the rest of his life, causing him to cover his left eye while conversing and always posing for the camera in profile so that the left eye was not visible.\nIn 1867, Henry Molyneux, who had become Sarah Brenane's financial manager, went bankrupt, along with Brenane. As there was no money for tuition, Hearn was sent to London's East End to live with Brenane's former maid. She and her husband had little time or money for Hearn, who wandered the streets, spent time in workhouses, and generally lived an aimless, rootless existence. His main intellectual activities consisted of visits to libraries and the British Museum.\nImmigration to Cincinnati.\nBy 1869, Henry Molyneux had recovered some financial stability and Brenane, now 75, was infirm. Resolving to end his financial obligations to the 19-year-old Hearn, he purchased a one-way ticket to New York and instructed the young man to find his way to Cincinnati, where he could locate Molyneux's sister and her husband, Thomas Cullinan, and obtain their assistance in making a living. Upon meeting Hearn in Cincinnati, however, it became clear that the family wanted little to do with him: Cullinan all but threw him out into the streets with only $5 in his pocket. As Hearn would later write, \"I was dropped moneyless on the pavement of an American city to begin life.\"\nFor a time, he was impoverished, living in stables or store rooms in exchange for menial labor. He eventually befriended the English printer and communalist Henry Watkin, who employed him in his printing business, helped find him various odd jobs, lent him books from his library, including utopianists Charles Fourier, Hepworth Dixon and John Humphrey Noyes, and gave Hearn a nickname which stuck with him for the rest of his life, the Raven, from the Edgar Allan Poe poem. Hearn also frequented the Cincinnati Public Library, which at that time had an estimated 50,000 volumes. In the spring of 1871 a letter from Henry Molyneux informed him of Sarah Brenane's death and Molyneux's appointment as sole executor. Despite Brenane having named him as the beneficiary of an annuity when she became his guardian, Hearn received nothing from the estate and never heard from Molyneux again.\nNewspaper and literary work.\nBy the strength of his talent as a writer, Hearn obtained a job as a reporter for the \"Cincinnati Daily Enquirer\", working for the newspaper from 1872 to 1875. Writing with creative freedom in one of Cincinnati's largest circulating newspapers, he became known for his lurid accounts of local murders, developing a reputation as the paper's premier sensational journalist, as well as the author of sensitive accounts of some of the disadvantaged people of Cincinnati. \"The Library of America\" selected one of these murder accounts, \"Gibbeted,\" for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of \"American True Crime\", published in 2008. After one of his murder stories, the Tanyard Murder, had run for several months in 1874, Hearn established his reputation as Cincinnati's most audacious journalist, and the \"Enquirer\" raised his salary from $10 to $25 per week.\nIn 1874, Hearn and the young Henry Farny, later a renowned painter of the American West, wrote, illustrated, and published an 8-page weekly journal of art, literature and satire entitled \"Ye Giglampz.\" The Cincinnati Public Library reprinted a facsimile of all nine issues in 1983. The work was considered by a 20th-century critic to be \"Perhaps the most fascinating sustained project he undertook as an editor.\"\nMarriage and firing by the \"Enquirer\".\nOn 14 June 1874, Hearn, aged 23, married Alethea (\"Mattie\") Foley, a 20-year-old African American woman who was formerly enslaved, an action in violation of Ohio's anti-miscegenation law at that time. In August 1875, in response to complaints from a local clergyman about his anti-religious views and pressure from local politicians embarrassed by some of his satirical writing in \"Ye Giglampz,\" the \"Enquirer\" fired him, citing as its reason his illegal marriage. He went to work for the rival newspaper \"The Cincinnati Commercial.\" The \"Enquirer\" offered to re-hire him after his stories began appearing in the \"Commercial\" and its circulation began increasing, but Hearn, incensed at the paper's behavior, refused. Hearn and Foley separated, but attempted reconciliation several times before divorcing in 1877. Foley remarried in 1880. While working for the \"Commercial\" he championed the case of Henrietta Wood, a former slave who won a major reparations case.\nWhile working for the \"Commercial\" Hearn agreed to be carried to the top of Cincinnati's tallest building on the back of a famous steeplejack, Joseph Roderiguez Weston, and wrote a half-terrified, half-comic account of the experience. Hearn wrote a series of accounts of the Bucktown and Levee neighborhoods of Cincinnati, \"...one of the few depictions we have of black life in a border city during the post-Civil War period.\" He also wrote about local black song lyrics from the era, including a song titled \"Shiloh\" that was dedicated to a Bucktown resident named \"Limber Jim.\" In addition, Hearn had printed in the \"Commercial\" a stanza he had overheard when listening to the songs of the roustabouts, working on the city's levee waterfront. Similar stanzas were recorded in song by Julius Daniels in 1926 and Tommy McClennan in his version of \"Bottle Up and Go\" (1939).\nMove to New Orleans.\nDuring the autumn of 1877, recently divorced from Mattie Foley and restless, Hearn had begun neglecting his newspaper work in favor of translating works by the French author Th\u00e9ophile Gautier into English. He had grown disenchanted with Cincinnati, writing to Henry Watkin, \"It is time for a fellow to get out of Cincinnati when they begin to call it the Paris of America.\" With the support of Watkin and \"Cincinnati Commercial\" publisher Murat Halstead, Hearn left Cincinnati for New Orleans, where he initially wrote dispatches on the \"Gateway to the Tropics\" for the \"Commercial\".\nHearn lived in New Orleans for nearly a decade, writing first for the newspaper \"Daily City Item\" beginning in June 1878, and later for the \"Times Democrat\". Since the \"Item\" was a 4-page publication, Hearn's editorial work changed the character of the newspaper dramatically. He began at the \"Item\" as a news editor, expanding to include book reviews of Bret Harte and \u00c9mile Zola, summaries of pieces in national magazines such as \"Harper's\", and editorial pieces introducing Buddhism and Sanskrit writings. As editor, Hearn created and published nearly two hundred woodcuts of daily life and people in New Orleans, making the \"Item\" the first Southern newspaper to introduce cartoons and giving the paper an immediate boost in circulation. Hearn gave up carving the woodcuts after six months when he found the strain was too great for his eye.\nAt the end of 1881, Hearn took an editorial position with the New Orleans \"Times Democrat\" and was employed translating items from French and Spanish newspapers as well as writing editorials and cultural reviews on topics of his choice. He also continued his work translating French authors into English: G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Anatole France, and most notably Pierre Loti, an author who influenced Hearn's own writing style. Milton Bronner, who edited Hearn's letters to Henry Watkin, wrote: \"[T]he Hearn of New Orleans was the father of the Hearn of the West Indies and of Japan,\" and this view was endorsed by Norman Foerster. During his tenure at the \"Times Democrat\", Hearn developed a friendship with editor Page Baker, who went on to champion Hearn's literary career; their correspondence is archived at the Loyola University New Orleans Special Collections &amp; Archives.\nThe vast number of his writings about New Orleans and its environs, many of which have not been collected, include the city's Creole population and distinctive cuisine, the French Opera, and Louisiana Voodoo. Hearn wrote enthusiastically of New Orleans, but also wrote of the city's decay, \"a dead bride crowned with orange flowers\".\nHearn's writings for national publications, such as \"Harper's Weekly\" and \"Scribner's Magazine\", helped create the popular reputation of New Orleans as a place with a distinctive culture more akin to that of Europe and the Caribbean than to the rest of North America. Hearn's best-known Louisiana works include: \nHearn published in \"Harper's Weekly\" the first known written article (1883) about Filipinos in the United States, the Manilamen or Tagalogs, one of whose villages he had visited at Saint Malo, southeast of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.\nAt the time he lived there, Hearn was little known, and even now he is little known for his writing about New Orleans, except by local cultural devotees. However, more books have been written about him than any former resident of New Orleans except Louis Armstrong.\nHearn's writings for the New Orleans newspapers included impressionistic descriptions of places and characters and many editorials denouncing political corruption, street crime, violence, intolerance, and the failures of public health and hygiene officials. Despite the fact that he is credited with \"inventing\" New Orleans as an exotic and mysterious place, his obituaries of the vodou leaders Marie Laveau and Doctor John Montenet are matter-of-fact and debunking. Selections of Hearn's New Orleans writings have been collected and published in several works, starting with \"Creole Sketches\" in 1924, and more recently in \"Inventing New Orleans: Writings of Lafcadio Hearn.\"\nMove to the French West Indies.\n\"Harper's\" sent Hearn to the West Indies as a correspondent in 1887. He spent two years in Martinique and in addition to his writings for the magazine, produced two books: \"Two Years in the French West Indies\" and \"Youma, The Story of a West-Indian Slave\", both published in 1890.\nLater life in Japan.\nIn 1890, Hearn went to Japan with a commission as a newspaper correspondent, which was quickly terminated. It was in Japan, however, that he found a home and his greatest inspiration. Through the good will of Basil Hall Chamberlain, Hearn gained a teaching position during the summer of 1890 at the Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School in Matsue, a town in western Japan on the coast of the Sea of Japan. During his fifteen-month stay in Matsue, Hearn married Koizumi Setsuko, the daughter of a local samurai family, with whom he had four children: Kazuo, Iwao, Kiyoshi, and Suzuko. In January 1896, he became a Japanese citizen, assuming the legal name after accepting a teaching position in Tokyo; Koizumi is his wife's surname and Yakumo is from \"yakumotatsu\", a poetic modifier word (\"makurakotoba\") for Izumo Province, which he translated as \"the Place of the Issuing of Clouds\". After having been Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and, later on, Spencerian, he became Buddhist.\nDuring late 1891, Hearn obtained another teaching position in Kumamoto, at the Fifth High Middle School (a predecessor of Kumamoto University), where he spent the next three years and completed his book \"Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan\" (1894). In October 1894, he secured a job in journalism with the English-language newspaper \"Kobe Chronicle\", and in 1896, with some assistance from Chamberlain, he began teaching English literature at Tokyo Imperial University, a position he held until 1903. In 1904, he was a lecturer at Waseda University.\nWhile in Japan, he encountered the art of ju-jutsu which made a deep impression upon him: \"Hearn, who encountered judo in Japan at the end of the nineteenth century, contemplated its concepts with the awed tones of an explorer staring about him in an extraordinary and undiscovered land. \"What Western brain could have elaborated this strange teaching, never to oppose force by force, but only direct and utilize the power of attack; to overthrow the enemy solely through his own strength, to vanquish him solely by his own efforts? Surely none! The Western mind appears to work in straight lines; the Oriental, in wonderful curves and circles.\" When he was teaching at the Fifth High Middle School, the headmaster was founder of Judo Kano Jigoro.\nDeath.\nOn 26 September 1904, Hearn died of heart failure in Tokyo at the age of 54. His grave is at the Z\u014dshigaya Cemetery in Tokyo's Toshima district.\nHearn's former residence in Matsue and his former residence site in Shinjuku are designated national historic places.\nLegacy.\nLiterary tradition.\nIn the late 19th century, Japan was still largely unknown and exotic to Westerners. However, with the introduction of Japanese aesthetics, particularly at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, Japanese styles became fashionable in Western countries. Hearn became known to the world by his writings concerning Japan. In later years, some critics would accuse Hearn of exoticizing Japan, but because he offered the West some of its first descriptions of pre-industrial and Meiji era Japan, his work is generally regarded as having historical value.\nAdmirers of Hearn's work have included Ben Hecht, John Erskine, Malcolm Cowley and Jorge Luis Borges.\nHearn was a major translator of the short stories of Guy de Maupassant.\nYone Noguchi is quoted as saying about Hearn, \"His Greek temperament and French culture became frost-bitten as a flower in the North.\"\nHearn won a wide following in Japan, where his books were translated and remain popular to the present day. Hearn's appeal to Japanese readers \"lies in the glimpses he offered of an older, more mystical Japan lost during the country\u2019s hectic plunge into Western-style industrialization and nation building. His books are treasured here as a trove of legends and folk tales that otherwise might have vanished because no Japanese had bothered to record them.\"\nMuseums.\nThe Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum and his old residence in Matsue are still two of the city's most popular tourist attractions. In addition, another small museum dedicated to Hearn opened in Yaizu, Shizuoka, in 2007 ().\nThe first museum in Europe for Hearn was inaugurated in Lefkada, Greece, his birthplace, on 4 July 2014, as the Lafcadio Hearn Historical Center. It contains early editions, rare books and Japanese collectibles. The visitors, through photos, texts and exhibits, can wander in the significant events of Lafcadio Hearn's life, but also in the civilizations of Europe, America and Japan of the late 18th and early 19th centuries through his lectures, writings and tales. The municipalities of Kumamoto, Matsue, Shinjuku, Yaizu, Toyama University, the Koizumi family and other people from Japan and Greece contributed to the establishment of Lafcadio Hearn Historical Center.\nOn a trip to Matsue in 2012, Professor Bon Koizumi (Hearn's great-grandson) and his wife Shoko were introduced to Dublin-based Motoko Fujita, a published photographer of \"The Shadow of James Joyce\" (Lilliput Press Ltd., Ireland, 2011) and the founder of the Experience Japan Festival in Dublin. Acting on the Koizumi's desire to reconnect with their Irish roots, Fujita then coordinated a trip for Bon and Shoko in autumn 2013, during which relationships to more Lafcadio supporters in Ireland were forged. Fujita's initiative led to the exhibition \"Coming Home: The Open Mind of Patrick Lafcadio Hearn\" at the Little Museum of Dublin (15 October 2015 to 3 January 2016), the first time Hearn was honoured in the city. The exhibit contained first editions of Hearn's works and personal items from the Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum. Professor Bon Koizumi was in attendance at the opening of the exhibition. Fujita initiated the planning of a Japanese garden in Hearn's honour, and in 2015 the https:// in Tramore, County Waterford opened.\nThere is a cultural centre named after Hearn at Durham University, where in 2022 a conference \"Lafcadio Hearn and the Global Imagination at the Fin de Si\u00e8cle\" was held.\nSister cities.\nHis life journey later connected its both ends; Lefkada and Shinjuku became sister cities in 1989. Another pair of cities he lived in, New Orleans and Matsue, did the same in 1994.\nMedia and theater.\nThe Japanese director Masaki Kobayashi adapted four Hearn tales into his 1964 film, \"Kwaidan\". Some of his stories have been adapted by Ping Chong into his puppet theatre, including the 1999 \"Kwaidan\" and the 2002 \"OBON: Tales of Moonlight and Rain\".\nIn 1984, four episode Japanese TV series \"Nihon no omokage\" (, Remnants of Japan), depicting Hearn's departure from the United States and later life in Japan, was broadcast with Greek-American actor George Chakiris as Hearn. The story was later adapted to theatrical productions.\nTwo manga book versions of Hearn\u2019s Japanese stories have been made by writer, Sean Michael Wilson, who lives in Kumamoto, as Hearn did, and is also half Irish. These are \"The Faceless Ghost\" (2015) with Japanese artist Michiru Morikawa, and \"Manga Yokai Stories\" (2020) with Japanese artist Ai Takita.\nThe video game series Touhou Project is influenced by Hearn's works. This doujin series is about a fantasy world known as \"Gensokyo\", separated from \"our\" world with a magical barrier, which world was stuck on the late Edo period. Two of its characters, Yukari Yakumo and Maribel Hearn, are direct references to Lafcadio Hearn. Yukari is a Y\u014dkai who helped create the border separating Gensokyo from the outside world, and Maribel Hearn is a college student who is able to see Gensokyo in her dreams. ZUN (the sole writer of the Touhou series), ambiguously stated that these two characters are the same person. Yukari Yakumo appears in many Touhou games, books and manga, and considered as \"a mastermind who only takes action once its really required\", and Maribel appears in the stories included in \"ZUN's Music Collection\", a series of music CD albums, from the second installment onwards, alongside another character, Renko Usami.\nWorks.\nJapanese subjects.\nSource:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n'Sayonara' collection of Japanese folk tales translated from English to Irish by P\u00e1draig Mac Cear\u00e1in.

Educators who embrace cognitive theory believe that the definition of learning as a change in behaviour is too narrow, and study the learner rather than their environment\u2014and in particular the complexities of human memory. Those who advocate constructivism believe that a learner's ability to learn relies largely on what they already know and understand, and the acquisition of knowledge should be an individually tailored process of construction. Transformative learning theory focuses on the often-necessary change required in a learner's preconceptions and worldview. Geographical learning theory focuses on the ways that contexts and environments shape the learning process.\nOutside the realm of educational psychology, techniques to directly observe the functioning of the brain during the learning process, such as event-related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging, are used in educational neuroscience. The theory of multiple intelligences, where learning is seen as the interaction between dozens of different functional areas in the brain each with their own individual strengths and weaknesses in any particular human learner, has also been proposed, but empirical research has found the theory to be unsupported by evidence.\nEducational philosophy.\nClassical theorists.\nPlato.\nPlato (428 BC\u2013347 BC) proposed the question: \"How does an individual learn something new when the topic is brand new to that person?\", This question may seem trivial; however, think of a human-like a computer. The question would then become: How does a computer take in any factual information without previous programming? Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously, which is called the Theory of Recollection or Platonic epistemology. This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don't need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don't know to question it. Plato says that if one did not previously know something, then they cannot learn it. He describes learning as a passive process, where information and knowledge are ironed into the soul over time. However, Plato's theory elicits even more questions about knowledge: If we can only learn something when we already had the knowledge impressed onto our souls, then how did our souls gain that knowledge in the first place? Plato's theory can seem convoluted; however, his classical theory can still help us understand knowledge today.\nLocke.\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) offered an answer to Plato's question as well. Locke offered the \"blank slate\" theory where humans are born into the world with no innate knowledge and are ready to be written on and influenced by the environment. The thinker maintained that knowledge and ideas originate from two sources, which are sensation and reflection. The former provides insights regarding external objects (including their properties) while the latter provides the ideas about one's mental faculties (volition and understanding). In the theory of empiricism, these sources are direct experience and observation. Locke, like David Hume, is considered an empiricist because he locates the source of human knowledge in the empirical world.\nLocke recognized that something had to be present, however. This something, to Locke, seemed to be \"mental powers\". Locke viewed these powers as a biological ability the baby is born with, similar to how a baby knows how to biologically function when born. So as soon as the baby enters the world, it immediately has experiences with its surroundings and all of those experiences are being transcribed to the baby's \"slate\". All of the experiences then eventually culminate into complex and abstract ideas. This theory can still help teachers understand their students' learning today.\nEducational psychology.\nBehavior analysis.\nThe term \"behaviorism\" was coined by American psychologist John Watson (1878\u20131959). Watson believed the behaviorist view is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science with a goal to predict and control behavior. In an article in the \"Psychological Review\", he stated that, \"Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness.\"\nMethodological behaviorism is based on the theory of only explaining public events, or observable behavior. B.F. Skinner introduced another type of behaviorism called radical behaviorism, or the conceptual analysis of behavior, which is based on the theory of also explaining private events; particularly, thinking and feelings. Radical behaviorism forms the conceptual piece of behavior analysis.\nIn behavior analysis, learning is the acquisition of a new behavior through conditioning and social learning.\nLearning and conditioning.\nThe three main types of conditioning and learning:\nIvan Pavlov discovered classical conditioning. He observed that if dogs come to associate the delivery of food with a white lab coat or the ringing of a bell, they produce saliva, even when there is no sight or smell of food. Classical conditioning considers this form of learning the same, whether in dogs or in humans. Operant conditioning reinforces this behavior with a reward or a punishment. A reward increases the likelihood of the behavior recurring, a punishment decreases its likelihood. Social learning theory observes behavior and is followed with modeling.\nThese three learning theories form the basis of applied behavior analysis, the application of behavior analysis, which uses analyzed antecedents, functional analysis, replacement behavior strategies, and often data collection and reinforcement to change behavior. The old practice was called behavior modification, which only used \"assumed\" antecedents and consequences to change behavior without acknowledging the conceptual analysis; analyzing the function of behavior and teaching of new behaviors that would serve the same function was never relevant in behavior modification.\nBehaviorists view the learning process as a change in behavior, and arrange the environment to elicit desired responses through such devices as behavioral objectives, Competency-based learning, and skill development and training. Educational approaches such as Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, curriculum-based measurement, and direct instruction have emerged from this model.\nTransfer of learning.\nTransfer of learning is the idea that what one learns in school somehow carries over to situations different from that particular time and that particular setting. Transfer was amongst the first phenomena tested in educational psychology. Edward Lee Thorndike was a pioneer in transfer research. He found that though transfer is extremely important for learning, it is a rarely occurring phenomenon. In fact, he held an experiment where he had the subjects estimate the size of a specific shape and then he would switch the shape. He found that the prior information did not help the subjects; instead it impeded their learning.\nOne explanation of why transfer does not occur often involves surface structure and deep structure. The surface structure is the way a problem is framed. The deep structure is the steps for the solution. For example, when a math story problem changes contexts from asking how much it costs to reseed a lawn to how much it costs to varnish a table, they have different surface structures, but the steps for getting the answers are the same. However, many people are more influenced by the surface structure. In reality, the surface structure is unimportant. Nonetheless, people are concerned with it because they believe that it provides background knowledge on how to do the problem. Consequently, this interferes with their understanding of the deep structure of the problem. Even if somebody tries to concentrate on the deep structure, transfer still may be unsuccessful because the deep structure is not usually obvious. Therefore, surface structure gets in the way of people's ability to see the deep structure of the problem and transfer the knowledge they have learned to come up with a solution to a new problem.\nCurrent learning pedagogies focus on conveying rote knowledge, independent of the context that gives it meaning. Because of this, students often struggle to transfer this stand-alone information into other aspects of their education. Students need much more than abstract concepts and self-contained knowledge; they need to be exposed to learning that is practiced in the context of authentic activity and culture. Critics of situated cognition, however, would argue that by discrediting stand-alone information, the transfer of knowledge across contextual boundaries becomes impossible. There must be a balance between situating knowledge while also grasping the deep structure of material, or the understanding of how one arrives to know such information.\nSome theorists argue that transfer does not even occur at all. They believe that students transform what they have learned into the new context. They say that transfer is too much of a passive notion. They believe students, instead, transform their knowledge in an active way. Students don't simply carry over knowledge from the classroom, but they construct the knowledge in a way that they can understand it themselves. The learner changes the information they have learned to make it best adapt to the changing contexts that they use the knowledge in. This transformation process can occur when a learner feels motivated to use the knowledge\u2014however, if the student does not find the transformation necessary, it is less likely that the knowledge will ever transform.\nTechniques and benefits of transfer of learning.\nThere are many different conditions that influence transfer of learning in the classroom. These conditions include features of the task, features of the learner, features of the organization and social context of the activity. The features of the task include practicing through simulations, problem-based learning, and knowledge and skills for implementing new plans. The features of learners include their ability to reflect on past experiences, their ability to participate in group discussions, practice skills, and participate in written discussions. All the unique features contribute to a student's ability to use transfer of learning. There are structural techniques that can aid learning transfer in the classroom. These structural strategies include hugging and bridging.\nHugging uses the technique of simulating an activity to encourage reflexive learning. An example of the hugging strategy is when a student practices teaching a lesson or when a student role plays with another student. These examples encourage critical thinking that engages the student and helps them understand what they are learning\u2014one of the goals of transfer of learning and desirable difficulties.\nBridging is when instruction encourages thinking abstractly by helping to identify connections between ideas and to analyze those connections. An example is when a teacher lets the student analyze their past test results and the way they got those results. This includes amount of study time and study strategies. Looking at their past study strategies can help them come up with strategies to improve performance. These are some of the ideas important to successful to hugging and bridging practices.\nThere are many benefits of transfer of learning in the classroom. One of the main benefits is the ability to quickly learn a new task. This has many real-life applications such as language and speech processing. Transfer of learning is also very useful in teaching students to use higher cognitive thinking by applying their background knowledge to new situations.\nCognitivism.\nGestalt theory.\nCognitive theories grew out of Gestalt psychology. Gestalt psychology was developed in Germany in the early 1900s by Wolfgang Kohler and was brought to America in the 1920s. The German word \"Gestalt\" is roughly equivalent to the English \"emergence (of a form-as in the game pictionary, when all of a sudden one recognises what the person is trying to convey - the form and meaning \"emerge\")\", \"configuration\" or \"organization\" and emphasizes the whole of human experience. Over the years, the Gestalt psychologists provided demonstrations and described principles to explain the way we organize our sensations into perceptions. Max Wertheimer, one of the founding fathers of Gestalt Theory, observed that sometimes we interpret motion when there is no motion at all. For example: a powered sign used at a convenience store to indicate that the store is open or closed might be seen as a sign with \"constant light\". However, the lights are actually flashing. Each light has been programmed to blink rapidly at their own individual pace. Perceived as a whole however, the sign appears fully lit without flashes. If perceived individually, the lights turn off and on at designated times. Another example of this would be a brick house: As a whole, it is viewed as a standing structure. However, it is actually composed of many smaller parts, which are individual bricks. People tend to see things from a holistic point of view rather than breaking it down into sub units.\nIn Gestalt theory, psychologists say that instead of obtaining knowledge from what's in front of us, we often learn by making sense of the relationship between what's new and old. Because we have a unique perspective of the world, humans have the ability to generate their own learning experiences and interpret information that may or may not be the same for someone else.\nGestalt psychologists criticize behaviorists for being too dependent on overt behavior to explain learning. They propose looking at the patterns rather than isolated events. Gestalt views of learning have been incorporated into what have come to be labeled \"cognitive theories\". Two key assumptions underlie this cognitive approach: that the memory system is an active organized processor of information and that prior knowledge plays an important role in learning. Gestalt theorists believe that for learning to occur, prior knowledge must exist on the topic. When the learner applies their prior knowledge to the advanced topic, the learner can understand the meaning in the advanced topic, and learning can occur. Cognitive theories look beyond behavior to consider how human memory works to promote learning, and an understanding of short-term memory and long-term memory is important to educators influenced by cognitive theory. They view learning as an internal mental process (including insight, information processing, memory and perception) where the educator focuses on building intelligence and cognitive development. The individual learner is more important than the environment.\nOther cognitive theories.\nOnce memory theories like the Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model and Baddeley's working memory model were established as a theoretical framework in cognitive psychology, new cognitive frameworks of learning began to emerge during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Today, researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load and information processing theory. These theories of learning play a role in influencing instructional design. Cognitive theory is used to explain such topics as social role acquisition, intelligence and memory as related to age.\nIn the late twentieth century, situated cognition emerged as a theory that recognized current learning as primarily the transfer of decontextualized and formal knowledge. Bredo (1994) depicts situated cognition as \"shifting the focus from individual in environment to individual and environment\". In other words, individual cognition should be considered as intimately related with the context of social interactions and culturally constructed meaning. Learning through this perspective, in which knowing and doing become inseparable, becomes both applicable and whole.\nMuch of the education students receive is limited to the culture of schools, without consideration for authentic cultures outside of education. Curricula framed by situated cognition can bring knowledge to life by embedding the learned material within the culture students are familiar with. For example, formal and abstract syntax of math problems can be transformed by placing a traditional math problem within a practical story problem. This presents an opportunity to meet that appropriate balance between situated and transferable knowledge. Lampert (1987) successfully did this by having students explore mathematical concepts that are continuous with their background knowledge. She does so by using money, which all students are familiar with, and then develops the lesson to include more complex stories that allow for students to see various solutions as well as create their own. In this way, knowledge becomes active, evolving as students participate and negotiate their way through new situations.\nConstructivism.\nFounded by Jean Piaget, constructivism emphasizes the importance of the active involvement of learners in constructing knowledge for themselves. Students are thought to use background knowledge and concepts to assist them in their acquisition of novel information. On approaching such new information, the learner faces a loss of equilibrium with their previous understanding, and this demands a change in cognitive structure. This change effectively combines previous and novel information to form an improved cognitive schema. Constructivism can be both subjectively and contextually based. Under the theory of radical constructivism, coined by Ernst von Glasersfeld, understanding relies on one's subjective interpretation of experience as opposed to objective \"reality\". Similarly, William Cobern's idea of contextual constructivism encompasses the effects of culture and society on experience.\nConstructivism asks why students do not learn deeply by listening to a teacher, or reading from a textbook. To design effective teaching environments, it believes one needs a good understanding of what children already know when they come into the classroom. The curriculum should be designed in a way that builds on the pupil's background knowledge and is allowed to develop with them. Begin with complex problems and teach basic skills while solving these problems. The learning theories of John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and David A. Kolb serve as the foundation of the application of constructivist learning theory in the classroom. Constructivism has many varieties such as active learning, discovery learning, and knowledge building, but all versions promote a student's free exploration within a given framework or structure. The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working answering open-ended questions and solving real-world problems. To do this, a teacher should encourage curiosity and discussion among his/her students as well as promoting their autonomy. In scientific areas in the classroom, constructivist teachers provide raw data and physical materials for the students to work with and analyze.\nTransformative learning theory.\nTransformative learning theory seeks to explain how humans revise and reinterpret meaning. Transformative learning is the cognitive process of effecting change in a frame of reference. A frame of reference defines our view of the world. The emotions are often involved. Adults have a tendency to reject any ideas that do not correspond to their particular values, associations and concepts.\nOur frames of reference are composed of two dimensions: habits of mind and points of view. Habits of mind, such as ethnocentrism, are harder to change than points of view. Habits of mind influence our point of view and the resulting thoughts or feelings associated with them, but points of view may change over time as a result of influences such as reflection, appropriation and feedback. Transformative learning takes place by discussing with others the \"reasons presented in support of competing interpretations, by critically examining evidence, arguments, and alternative points of view\". When circumstances permit, transformative learners move toward a frame of reference that is more inclusive, discriminating, self-reflective, and integrative of experience.\nEducational neuroscience.\nAmerican Universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and University of Southern California began offering majors and degrees dedicated to educational neuroscience or neuroeducation in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Such studies seek to link an understanding of brain processes with classroom instruction and experiences. Neuroeducation analyzes biological changes in the brain from processing new information. It looks at what environmental, emotional, and social situations best help the brain store and retain new information via the linking of neurons\u2014and best keep the dendrites from being reabsorbed, losing the information. The 1990s were designated \"The Decade of the Brain\", and advances took place in neuroscience at an especially rapid pace. The three dominant methods for measuring brain activities are event-related potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography (MEG).\nThe integration and application to education of what we know about the brain was strengthened in 2000 when the American Federation of Teachers stated: \"It is vital that we identify what science tells us about how people learn in order to improve the education curriculum.\" What is exciting about this new field in education is that modern brain imaging techniques now make it possible, in some sense, to watch the brain as it learns, and the question then arises: can the results of neuro-scientific studies of brains as they are learning usefully inform practice in this area? The neuroscience field is young. Researchers expected that new technologies and ways of observing will produce new scientific evidence that helps refine the paradigms of what students need and how they learn best. In particular, it may bring more informed strategies for teaching students with learning disabilities.\nFormal and mental discipline.\nAll individuals have the ability to develop mental discipline and the skill of mindfulness, the two go hand in hand. Mental discipline is huge in shaping what people do, say, think and feel. It's critical in terms of the processing of information and involves the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to new things and information people come across, or have recently been taught. Mindfulness is important to the process of learning in many aspects. Being mindful means to be present with and engaged in whatever you are doing at a specific moment in time. Being mindful can aid in helping us to more critically think, feel and understand the new information we are in the process of absorbing. \nThe formal discipline approach seeks to develop causation between the advancement of the mind by exercising it through exposure to abstract school subjects such as science, language and mathematics. With student's repetitive exposure to these particular subjects, some scholars feel that the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to science, language and math is of \"secondary importance\", and believe that the strengthening and further development of the mind that this curriculum provides holds far greater significance to the progressing learner in the long haul. D.C. Phillips and Jonas F. Soltis provide some skepticism to this notion. Their skepticism stems largely in part from feeling that the relationship between formal discipline and the overall advancement of the mind is not as strong as some would say. They illustrate their skepticism by opining that it is foolish to blindly assume that people are better off in life, or at performing certain tasks, because of taking particular, yet unrelated courses.\nMultiple intelligences.\nThe existence of multiple intelligences is proposed by psychologist Howard Gardner, who suggests that different kinds of intelligence exists in human beings. It is a theory that has been fashionable in continuous professional development (CPD) training courses for teachers. However, the theory of multiple intelligences is often cited as an example of pseudoscience because it lacks empirical evidence or falsifiability.\nMultimedia learning.\nMultimedia learning refers to the use of visual and auditory teaching materials that may include video, computer and other information technology. Multimedia learning theory focuses on the principles that determine the effective use of multimedia in learning, with emphasis on using both the visual and auditory channels for information processing.\nThe auditory channel deals with information that is heard, and the visual channel processes information that is seen. The visual channel holds less information than the auditory channel. If both the visual and auditory channels are presented with information, more knowledge is retained. However, if too much information is delivered it is inadequately processed, and long-term memory is not acquired. Multimedia learning seeks to give instructors the ability to stimulate both the visual and auditory channels of the learner, resulting in better progress.\nUsing online games for learning.\nMany educators and researchers believe that information technology could bring innovation on traditional educational instructions. Teachers and technologists are searching for new and innovative ways to design learner-centered learning environments effectively, trying to engage learners more in the learning process. Claims have been made that online games have the potential to teach, train and educate and they are effective means for learning skills and attitudes that are not so easy to learn by rote memorization.\nThere has been a lot of research done in identifying the learning effectiveness in game based learning. Learner characteristics and cognitive learning outcomes have been identified as the key factors in research on the implementation of games in educational settings. In the process of learning a language through an online game, there is a strong relationship between the learner's prior knowledge of that language and their cognitive learning outcomes. For the people with prior knowledge of the language, the learning effectiveness of the games is much more than those with none or less knowledge of the language.\nOther learning theories.\nOther learning theories have also been developed for more specific purposes. For example, andragogy is the art and science to help adults learn. Connectivism is a recent theory of networked learning, which focuses on learning as making connections. The Learning as a Network (LaaN) theory builds upon connectivism, complexity theory, and double-loop learning. It starts from the learner and views learning as the continuous creation of a personal knowledge network (PKN).\nLearning style theories.\nLearning style theories propose that individuals learn in different ways, that there are distinct learning styles and that knowledge of a learner's preferred learning style leads to faster and more satisfactory improvement. However, the current research has not been able to find solid scientific evidence to support the main premises of learning styles theory.\nAffective Context Model.\nPeople remember how things made them feel, and use those emotional imprints to create memories on demand.\nInformal and post-modern theories.\nIn theories that make use of cognitive restructuring, an informal curriculum promotes the use of prior knowledge to help students gain a broad understanding of concepts. New knowledge cannot be told to students, it believes, but rather the students' current knowledge must be challenged. In this way, students adjust their ideas to more closely resemble actual theories or concepts. By using this method students gain the broad understanding they're taught and later are more willing to learn and keep the specifics of the concept or theory. This theory further aligns with the idea that teaching the concepts and the language of a subject should be split into multiple steps.\nOther informal learning theories look at the sources of motivation for learning. Intrinsic motivation may create a more self-regulated learner, yet schools undermine intrinsic motivation. Critics argue that the average student learning in isolation performs significantly less well than those learning with collaboration and mediation. Students learn through talk, discussion, and argumentation.\nEducational anthropology.\nPhilosophical anthropology.\nAccording to Theodora Polito, \"every well-constructed theory of education [has] at [its] center a philosophical anthropology,\" which is \"a philosophical reflection on some basic problems of mankind.\" Philosophical anthropology is an exploration of human nature and humanity. Aristotle, an early influence on the field, deemed human nature to be \"rational animality,\" wherein humans are closely related to other animals but still set apart by their ability to form rational thought. Philosophical anthropology expanded upon these ideas by clarifying that rationality is, \"determined by the biological and social conditions in which the lives of human beings are embedded.\" Fully developed learning theories address some of the \"basic problems of mankind\" by examining these biological and social conditions to understand and manipulate the rationality of humanity in the context of learning.\nPhilosophical anthropology is evident in behaviorism, which requires an understanding of humanity and human nature in order to assert that the similarities between humans and other animals are critical and influential to the process of learning. Situated cognition focuses on how humans interact with each other and their environments, which would be considered the \"social conditions\" explored within the field of philosophical anthropology. Transformative learning theories operate with the assumption that humans are rational creatures capable of examining and redefining perspectives, something that is heavily considered within philosophical anthropology.\nAn awareness and understanding of philosophical anthropology contributes to a greater comprehension and practice of any learning theory. In some cases, philosophy can be used to further explore and define uncertain terms within the field of education. Philosophy can also be a vehicle to explore the purpose of education, which can greatly influence an educational theory.\nCriticism.\nCritics of learning theories that seek to displace traditional educational practices claim that there is no need for such theories; that the attempt to comprehend the process of learning through the construction of theories creates problems and inhibits personal freedom.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n76.

{"id": "17995", "revid": "18174831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17995", "title": "Long-term memory", "text": "Process of storage and retrieval memory\nLong-term memory (LTM) is the stage of the Atkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model in which informative knowledge is held indefinitely. It is defined in contrast to sensory memory, the initial stage, and short-term or working memory, the second stage, which persists for about 18 to 30 seconds. LTM is grouped into two categories known as explicit memory (declarative memory) and implicit memory (non-declarative memory). Explicit memory is broken down into episodic and semantic memory, while implicit memory includes procedural memory and emotional conditioning.\nStores.\nThe idea of separate memories for short- and long-term storage originated in the 19th century. One model of memory developed in the 1960s assumed that all memories are formed in one store and transfer to another store after a small period of time. This model is referred to as the \"modal model\", most famously detailed by Shiffrin. The model states that memory is first stored in sensory memory, which has a large capacity but can only maintain information for milliseconds. A representation of that rapidly decaying memory is moved to short-term memory. Short-term memory does not have a large capacity like sensory memory but holds information for seconds or minutes. The final storage is long-term memory, which has a very large capacity and is capable of holding information possibly for a lifetime.\nThe exact mechanisms by which this transfer takes place, whether all or only some memories are retained permanently, and even to have the existence of a genuine distinction between stores, remain controversial.\nEvidence.\nAnterograde amnesia.\nOne form of evidence cited in favor of the existence of a short-term store comes from anterograde amnesia, the inability to learn new facts and episodes. Patients with this form of amnesia have an intact ability to retain small amounts of information over short time scales (up to 30 seconds) but have little ability to form longer-term memories (illustrated by patient HM). This is interpreted as showing that the short-term store is protected from damage and diseases.\nDistraction tasks.\nOther evidence comes from experimental studies showing that some manipulations impair memory for the 3 to 5 most recently learned words of a list (it is presumed that they are held in short-term memory). Recall for words from earlier in the list (it is presumed, stored in long-term memory) are unaffected. Other manipulations (e.g., semantic similarity of the words) affect only memory for earlier list words, but do not affect memory for the most recent few words. These results show that different factors affect short-term recall (disruption of rehearsal) and long-term recall (semantic similarity). Together, these findings show that long-term memory and short-term memory can vary independently of each other.\nModels.\nUnitary model.\nNot all researchers agree that short- and long-term memory are separate systems. The alternative Unitary Model proposes that short-term memory consists of temporary activations of long-term representations (that there is one memory that behaves variously over all time scales, from milliseconds to years). It has been difficult to identify a sharp boundary between short- and long-term memory. Eugen Tarnow, a physics researcher, reported that the recall probability versus latency curve is a straight line from 6 to 600 seconds, with the probability of failure to recall only saturating after 600 seconds. If two different stores were operating in this time domain, it is reasonable to expect a discontinuity in this curve. Other research has shown that the detailed pattern of recall errors looks remarkably similar to recall of a list immediately after learning (it is presumed, from short-term memory) and recall after 24 hours (necessarily from long-term memory).\nFurther evidence for a unified store comes from experiments involving continual distractor tasks. In 1974, Bjork and Whitten, psychology researchers, presented subjects with word pairs to remember; before and after each word pair, subjects performed a simple multiplication task for 12 seconds. After the final word-pair, subjects performed the multiplication distractor task for 20 seconds. They reported that the recency effect (the increased probability of recall of the last items studied) and the primacy effect (the increased probability of recall of the first few items) was sustained. These results are incompatible with a separate short-term memory as the distractor items should have displaced some of the word-pairs in the buffer, thereby weakening the associated strength of the items in long-term memory.\nOvid Tzeng (1973) reported an instance where the recency effect in free recall did not seem to result from a short-term memory store. Subjects were presented with four study-test periods of 10-word lists, with a continual distractor task (20-second period of counting-backward). At the end of each list, participants had to free recall as many words as possible. After recall of the fourth list, participants were asked to recall items from all four lists. Both the initial and final recall showed a recency effect. These results violated the predictions of a short-term memory model, where no recency effect would be expected.\nKoppenaal and Glanzer (1990) attempted to explain these phenomena as a result of the subjects' adaptation to the distractor task, which allowed them to preserve at least some short-term memory capabilities. In their experiment, the long-term recency effect disappeared when the distractor after the last item differed from the distractors that preceded and followed the other items (e.g., arithmetic distractor task and word reading distractor task). Thapar and Greene challenged this theory. In one of their experiments, participants were given a different distractor task after every study item. According to Koppenaal and Glanzer's theory, no recency effect would be expected as subjects would not have had time to adapt to the distractor; yet such a recency effect remained in place in the experiment.\nAnother explanation.\nOne proposed explanation for recency in a continual distractor condition, and its disappearance in an end-only distractor task is the influence of contextual and distinctive processes. According to this model, recency is a result of the similarity of the final items' processing context to the processing context of the other items and the distinctive position of the final items versus intermediate items. In the end distractor task, the processing context of the final items is no longer similar to that of the other list items. At the same time, retrieval cues for these items are no longer as effective as without the distractor. Therefore, recency recedes or vanishes. However, when distractor tasks are placed before and after each item, recency returns, because all the list items have similar processing context.\nDual-store memory model.\nAccording to George Miller, whose paper in 1956 popularized the theory of the \"magic number seven\", short-term memory is limited to a certain number of chunks of information, while long-term memory has a limitless store.\nAtkinson\u2013Shiffrin memory model.\nAccording to the dual store memory model proposed in 1968 by Richard C. Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin, memories can reside in the short-term \"buffer\" for a limited time while they are simultaneously strengthening their associations in LTM. When items are first presented, they enter short-term memory for approximately twenty to thirty seconds, but due to its limited space, as new items enter, older ones are pushed out. The limit of items that can be held in the short-term memory is an average between four and seven, yet, with practice and new skills that number can be increased. However, each time an item in short-term memory is rehearsed, it is strengthened in long-term memory. Similarly, the longer an item stays in short-term memory, the stronger its association becomes in long-term memory.\nBaddeley's model of working memory.\nIn 1974, Baddeley and Hitch proposed an alternative theory of short-term memory, Baddeley's model of working memory. According to this theory, short-term memory is divided into different slave systems for different types of input items, and there is an executive control supervising what items enter and exit those systems. The slave systems include the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer (later added by Baddeley).\nEncoding of information.\nLTM encodes information semantically for storage, as researched by Baddeley. In vision, the information needs to enter working memory before it can be stored into LTM. This is evidenced by the fact that the speed with which information is stored into LTM is determined by the amount of information that can be fit, at each step, into visual working memory. In other words, the larger the capacity of working memory for certain stimuli, the faster will these materials be learned.\nSynaptic consolidation is the process by which items are transferred from short- to long-term memory. Within the first minutes or hours after acquisition, the engram (memory trace) is encoded within synapses, becoming resistant (though not immune) to interference from outside sources.\nAs LTM is subject to fading in the natural forgetting process, maintenance rehearsal (several recalls/retrievals of memory) may be needed to preserve long-term memories. Individual retrievals can take place in increasing intervals in accordance with the principle of spaced repetition. This can happen quite naturally through reflection or deliberate recall (also known as recapitulation), often dependent on the perceived importance of the material. Using testing methods as a form of recall can lead to the testing effect, which aids long-term memory through information retrieval and feedback.\nIn LTM, brain cells fire in specific patterns. When someone experiences something in the world, the brain responds by creating a pattern of specific nerves firing in a specific way to represent the experience. This is called distributed representation. Distributed representation can be explained through a scientific calculator. At the top of the calculator is an opening in which the numbers typed in show up. This small slot is compiled by many blocks that light up to show a specific number. In that sense, certain blocks light up when prompted to show the number 4, but other blocks light up to show the number 5. There may be overlap in the blocks used, but ultimately, these blocks are able to generate different patterns for each specific situation. The encoding of specific episodic memories can be explained through distributed representation. When you try to remember an experience, perhaps your friend's birthday party a year ago, your brain is activating a certain pattern of neurons. If you try to remember your mother's birthday party, another pattern of neurons is fired but there may be overlap because they are both birthday parties. This kind of remembering is the idea of retrieval because it involves recalling the specific distributed representation created during the encoding of the experience.\nSleep.\nSome theories consider sleep to be an important factor in establishing well-organized long-term memories. \"(See also sleep and learning.)\" Sleep plays a key function in the consolidation of new memories.\nAccording to Tarnow's theory, long-term memories are stored in dream format (reminiscent of Penfield &amp; Rasmussen's findings that electrical excitations of the cortex give rise to experiences similar to dreams). During waking life an executive function interprets LTM consistent with reality checking . It is further proposed in the theory that the information stored in memory, no matter how it was learned, can affect performance on a particular task without the subject being aware that this memory is being used. Newly acquired declarative memory traces are believed to be reactivated during NonREM sleep to promote their hippocampo-neocortical transfer for long-term storage. Specifically, new declarative memories are better remembered if recall follows Stage II non-rapid eye movement sleep. The reactivation of memories during sleep can lead to lasting synaptic changes within certain neural networks. It is the high spindle activity, low oscillation activity, and delta wave activity during NREM sleep that helps to contribute to declarative memory consolidation. In learning before sleep, spindles are redistributed to neuronally active up-states within slow oscillations during NREM sleep. Sleep spindles are thought to induce synaptic changes and thereby contribute to memory consolidation during sleep. Here, we examined the role of sleep in the object-place recognition task, a task closely comparable to tasks typically applied for testing human declarative memory: It is a one-trial task, hippocampus-dependent, not stressful and can be repeated within the same animal. Sleep deprivation reduces vigilance or arousal levels, affecting the efficiency of certain cognitive functions such as learning and memory.\nThe theory that sleep benefits memory retention is not a new idea. It has been around since Ebbinghaus's experiment on forgetting in 1885. More recently studies have been done by Payne and colleagues and Holtz and colleagues. In Payne and colleague's experiment participants were randomly selected and split into two groups. Both groups were given semantically related or unrelated word pairs, but one group was given the information at 9 A.M. and the other group received theirs at 9 P.M. Participants were then tested on the word pairs at one of three intervals 30 minutes, 12 hours, or 24 hours later. It was found that participants who had a period of sleep between the learning and testing sessions did better on the memory tests. This information is similar to other results found by previous experiments by Jenkins and Dallenbach (1924). It has also been found that many domains of declarative memory are affected by sleep such as emotional memory, semantic memory, and direct encoding.\nHoltz found that not only does sleep affect consolidation of declarative memories, but also procedural memories. In this experiment, fifty adolescent participants were taught either word pairs (which represents declarative memory) and a finger tapping task (procedural memory) at one of two different times of day. What they found was that the procedural finger tapping task was best encoded and remembered directly before sleep, but the declarative word pairs task was better remembered and encoded if learned at 3 in the afternoon.\nDivisions.\nThe brain does not store memories in one unified structure. Instead, different types of memory are stored in different regions of the brain. LTM is typically divided up into two major headings: explicit memory and implicit memory.\nExplicit memory.\nExplicit memory (or declarative memory) refers to all memories that are consciously available. These are encoded by the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex, but consolidated and stored elsewhere. The precise location of storage is unknown, but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate. Research by Meulemans and Van der Linden (2003) found that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit learning tests than did healthy controls. However, these same amnesiac patients performed at the same rate as healthy controls on implicit learning tests. This implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning, but not in implicit learning.\nDeclarative memory has three major subdivisions:\nEpisodic memory.\nEpisodic memory refers to memory for specific events in time, as well as supporting their formation and retrieval. Some examples of episodic memory would be remembering someone's name and what happened at your last interaction with each other. Experiments conducted by Spaniol and colleagues indicated that older adults have worse episodic memories than younger adults because episodic memory requires context dependent memory. It is said that episodic memories are not as detailed or accurate as people grow older in age. Some people may begin to have issues with identification or presentation related things as they age. They may not be able to recall things from their memory or have as good of a storage for details as they may have been able to do in the past. The Hippocampus is responsible for the functions of episodic memory and research suggests that the use of exercise can be effective in improving brain functions such as the episodic memory. According to Damien Moore and Paul D. Loprinzi, episodic memory can be improved using long-term potentiation, which is when synapses are made to be more durable with exercise. The durability and healthiness of the synapses will in time be able to pick up more connections with neurons and eventually help with episodic memory. Mnemonic training has also been proven to be effective with the sharpening of episodic memory. These trainings include things like the alphabet, music, numerical systems, and other learning systems. Studies by Shuyuan Chen and Zhihui Cai have shown that mnemonic training has shown to be able to improve episodic memory long term.\nSemantic memory.\nSemantic memory refers to knowledge about factual information, such as the meaning of words. Semantic memory is independent information such as information remembered for a test. In contrast with episodic memory, older adults and younger adults do not show much of a difference in semantic memory, presumably because semantic memory does not depend on context memory.\nAutobiographical memory.\nAutobiographical memory refers to knowledge about events and personal experiences from an individual's own life. Autographical memories are facilitated by aids including verbal, face-evoked, picture-evoked, odour-evoked, and music-evoked autobiographical memory cues. Though similar to episodic memory, it differs in that it contains only those experiences that are relevant to the life experiences of an individual. Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) argue that this is one component of the self-memory system.\nImplicit memory.\nImplicit memory (procedural memory) refers to the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil, drive a car, or ride a bicycle. This type of memory is encoded, and it is presumed stored by the striatum and other parts of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is believed to mediate procedural memory and other brain structures and is largely independent of the hippocampus. Research by Manelis, Hanson, and Hanson (2011) found that the reactivation of the parietal and occipital regions was associated with implicit memory. Procedural memory is considered non-declarative memory or unconscious memory which includes priming and non-associative learning.\nThe first part of nondeclarative memory (implicit memory) involves priming. Priming occurs when you do something faster after you have already done that activity, such as writing or using a fork.\nOther categories of memory may also be relevant to the discussion of LTM. For example:\nEmotional memory, the memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion, is a domain that can involve both declarative and procedural memory processes. Emotional memories are consciously available, but elicit a powerful, unconscious physiological reaction. Research indicates that the amygdala is extremely active during emotional situations and acts with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the encoding and consolidation of emotional events.\nWorking memory is not part of LTM but is important for it to function. Working memory holds and manipulates information for a short period of time, before it is either forgotten or encoded into LTM. Then, in order to remember something from LTM, it must be brought back into working memory. If working memory is overloaded, it can affect the encoding of LTM. If one has a good working memory, they may have a better LTM encoding.\nDisorders of memory.\nMinor slips and lapses of memory are fairly commonplace and may increase naturally with age, when ill, or under stress. Some women may experience more memory lapses following the onset of the menopause.\nIn general, more serious problems with memory occur due to traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nThe majority of findings on memory have been the result of studies that lesioned specific brain regions in rats or primates, but some of the most important work has been the result of accidental or inadvertent brain trauma. The most famous case in recent memory studies is the case study of HM, who had parts of his hippocampus, parahippocampal cortices, and surrounding tissue removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His subsequent total anterograde amnesia and partial retrograde amnesia provided the first evidence for the localization of memory function, and further clarified the differences between declarative and procedural memory.\nNeurodegenerative diseases.\nMany neurodegenerative diseases can cause memory loss. Some of the most prevalent (and, as a consequence, most intensely researched) include Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. None act specifically on memory; instead, memory loss is often a casualty of generalized neuronal deterioration. Currently, these illnesses are irreversible, but research into stem cells, psychopharmacology, and genetic engineering holds much promise.\nThose with Alzheimer's disease generally display symptoms such as getting momentarily lost on familiar routes, placing possessions in inappropriate locations, and distortions of existing memories or completely forgetting memories. Researchers have often used the Deese\u2013Roediger\u2013McDermott paradigm (DRM) to study the effects of Alzheimer's disease on memory. The DRM paradigm presents a list of words such as doze, pillow, bed, dream, nap, etc., but no theme word is presented. In this case, the theme word would have been \"sleep.\" Alzheimer's disease patients are more likely to recall the theme word as being part of the original list than healthy adults. There is a possible link between longer encoding times and increased false memory in LTM. The patients end up relying on the gist of the information instead of the specific words themselves. Alzheimer's disease leads to an uncontrolled inflammatory response brought on by extensive amyloid deposition in the brain, which leads to cell death in the brain. This gets worse over time and eventually leads to cognitive decline after the loss of memory. Pioglitazone may improve cognitive impairments, including memory loss, and may help protect long-term and visuospatial memory from neurodegenerative diseases.\nParkinson's disease patients have problems with cognitive performance; these issues resemble those seen in frontal lobe patients and can often lead to dementia. It is thought that Parkinson's disease is caused by degradation of the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic projection originating from the ventral tegmental area. It has also been indicated that the hippocampus plays an important role in episodic and spatial (parts of LTM) memory, and Parkinson's disease patients have abnormal hippocampuses resulting in abnormal LTM functioning. L-dopa injections are often used to try to relieve Parkinson's disease symptoms, as well as behavioral therapy.\nSchizophrenia patients have trouble with attention and executive functions, which in turn affects LTM consolidation and retrieval. They cannot encode or retrieve temporal information properly, which causes them to select inappropriate social behaviors. They cannot effectively use the information they possess. The prefrontal cortex, where schizophrenia patients have structural abnormalities, is involved with the temporal lobe and also affects the hippocampus, which causes their difficulty in encoding and retrieving temporal information (including LTM).\nBiological underpinnings at the cellular level.\nLong-term memory, unlike short-term memory, is dependent upon the synthesis of new proteins. This occurs within the cellular body, and concerns the particular transmitters, receptors, and new synapse pathways that reinforce the communicative strength between neurons. The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances (such as calcium within hippocampal neurons) in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells, this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium (a binding molecule) that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling. The temporary expulsion of magnesium frees NMDA receptors to release calcium in the cell, a signal that leads to gene transcription and the construction of reinforcing proteins. For more information, see long-term potentiation (LTP).\nOne of the newly synthesized proteins in LTP is also critical for maintaining LTM. This protein is an autonomously active form of the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC), known as PKM\u03b6. PKM\u03b6 maintains the activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength and inhibiting PKM\u03b6 erases established long-term memories, without affecting short-term memory or, once the inhibitor is eliminated, the ability to encode and store new long-term memories is restored.\nAlso, BDNF is important for the persistence of long-term memories.\nThe long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as synaptic boutons, dendritic spines, and postsynaptic density.\nOn the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 and HOMER1c has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.\nThe cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor which is believed to be important in consolidating short- to long-term memories, and which is believed to be downregulated in Alzheimer's disease.\nDNA methylation and demethylation.\nRats exposed to an intense learning event may retain a life-long memory of the event, even after a single training session. The LTM of such an event appears to be initially stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an exposure was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one and at 24 hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to hypomethylation. Hypomethylation often results from the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines in DNA. Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway (see Epigenetics in learning and memory). The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a LTM of the event.\nContradictory evidence.\nSome studies have yielded results that contradict the dual-store memory model. Studies showed that in spite of using distractors, there was still both a recency effect for a list of items and a contiguity effect.\nAnother study revealed that how long an item spends in short-term memory is not the key determinant in its strength in long-term memory. Instead, whether the participant actively tries to remember the item while elaborating on its meaning determines the strength of its store in LTM.\nSingle-store memory model.\nAn alternative theory is that there is only one memory store with associations among items and their contexts. In this model, the context serves as a cue for retrieval, and the recency effect is greatly caused by the factor of context. Immediate and delayed free recall will have the same recency effect because the relative similarity of the contexts still exists. Also, the contiguity effect still occurs because contiguity also exists between similar contexts.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17997", "revid": "47474982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17997", "title": "Latin declension", "text": "Part of Latin grammar\nLatin declension is the set of patterns in the Latin language for how nouns and certain other parts of speech (including pronouns and adjectives) change form according to their grammatical case, number and gender. Words that change form in this manner are said to be declined. \nDeclension is normally marked by suffixation: attaching different endings to the declined word. For nouns, Latin grammar instruction typically distinguishes five main patterns of endings. The patterns are numbered from first to fifth and subdivided by grammatical gender. The term \"declension\" can refer either to the overarching phenomenon, or to one of these specific five patterns. For example, nouns that have a genitive singular form that ends in are said to belong to \"the first declension\".\nAdjectives are of two kinds: those like 'good' use first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. Other adjectives such as belong to the third declension. There are no fourth- or fifth-declension adjectives.\nPronouns are also of two kinds, the personal pronouns such as 'I' and 'you (sg.)', which have their own irregular declension, and the third-person pronouns such as 'this' and 'that' which can generally be used either as pronouns or adjectivally. These latter decline in a similar way to the first and second noun declensions, but there are differences; for example the genitive singular ends in \"-\u012bus\" or \"-ius\" instead of \"-\u012b\" or \"-ae\" and the dative singular ends in \"-\u012b\".\nThe cardinal numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' also have their own declensions (\"\u016bnus\" has genitive \"-\u012bus\" and dative \"-\u012b\" like a pronoun). However, numeral adjectives such as 'a pair, two each' decline like ordinary adjectives.\nDeclension is a specific type of inflection, and is distinguished from other ways that words change form in the Latin language, such as the conjugation of verbs.\nGrammatical cases.\nA complete Latin noun declension includes up to seven grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. The locative is limited to a few nouns: generally names of cities, small islands and a few other words. \nSyncretism.\nDifferent cases commonly share the same form (called syncretism). The patterns of shared endings vary depending on a noun's grammatical number, gender, and declension class. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:\nOrder of cases.\nThe Roman grammarian Aelius Donatus (4th century AD), whose work was used as standard throughout the Middle Ages, placed the cases in this order:\n\"there are six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative and ablative.\"\nThis order was based on the order used by earlier Greek grammarians, with the addition of the ablative, which does not exist in Greek. The names of the cases also were mostly translated from the Greek terms, such as from the Greek .\nThis traditional order was formerly used in England, such as in \"The School and University Eton Latin Grammar\" (1861). That order is still followed in most other European countries. Gildersleeve and Lodge's \"Latin Grammar\" (1895) also follow this order. More recent Latin grammars published in the United States, such as Allen and Greenough's \"New Latin Grammar\" (1903) and \"Wheelock's Latin\" (first published in 1956) follow this order except they list the vocative last.\nHowever, in Britain and countries influenced by Britain other than the United States, the Latin cases are usually given in the following order: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative. This order was introduced in Benjamin Hall Kennedy's \"Latin Primer\" (1866), with the aim of making tables of declensions easier to recite and memorise (the first three and the last two cases having identical forms in several declensions). It is also used in France and Belgium. In https:// (1962), a song in French by the Belgian singer Jacques Brel, Brel sings the declension of \"rosa\" as , following the British order of cases.\nHistory of cases.\nOld Latin had essentially two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, which derived from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. The other pattern was used by the third, fourth and fifth declensions, and derived from the athematic PIE declension.\nNouns.\nRegularly inflected Latin nouns have two principal parts: the nominative singular and the genitive singular. Each declension can be unequivocally identified by the ending of the genitive singular (-\"ae\", -\"i\", -\"is\", -\"\u016bs\", -\"ei\"). This ending can be removed from the genitive singular form to find the noun's oblique stem, which is shared between all inflected forms aside from the nominative singular. (The nominative singular sometimes, but not always has a distinct stem.)\nLatin declension is commonly taught in terms of attaching different sets of vowel-initial endings to the oblique stem. For example, the first-declension noun 'cow' has the genitive singular , with the oblique stem . Its ablative singular can be formed by combining with the ending , forming . The second-declension noun 'bull' has the genitive singular , with the oblique stem . Its ablative singular can be formed by combining with the ending , forming . \nThere are five declensions (in other words, five such sets of endings) for Latin nouns:\nFirst declension (\"a\" stems).\nNouns of this declension usually end in \"-a\" in the nominative singular and are mostly feminine, e.g. f. ('road') and f. ('water'). There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g. m. ('poet'), m. ('farmer'), m. ('auriga, charioteer'), m. ('pirate') and m. ('sailor').\nThe predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is \"a\". The nominative singular form consists of the stem and the ending \"-a\", and the genitive singular form is the stem plus \"-ae\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe locative endings for the first declension are \"-ae\" (singular) and \"-\u012bs\" (plural), similar to the genitive singular and ablative plural, as in ' 'in war' and ' 'at Athens'.\nFirst declension Greek nouns.\nThe first declension also includes three types of Greek loanwords, derived from Ancient Greek's alpha declension. They are declined irregularly in the singular, but sometimes treated as native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative ('athlete') instead of the original \"athl\u0113t\u0113s. Archaic (Homeric) first declension Greek nouns and adjectives had been formed in exactly the same way as in Latin: \"nephel\u0113ger\u00e9ta Zeus\" ('Zeus the cloud-gatherer') had in classical Greek become \"nephel\u0113ger\u00e9t\u0113s.\nFor full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix First declension.\nSecond declension (\"o\" stems).\nThe second declension is a large group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine nouns like ('horse') and ('boy') and neuter nouns like ('fort'). There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of gemstones, plants, trees, and some towns and cities: these take the same endings as masculine nouns.\nIn the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the stem and the ending \"-us\", although some end in \"-er\", which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending \"-um\". Regardless of gender, every second-declension noun has the ending \"-\u012b\" attached as a suffix to the stem of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is \"o\".\nThe locative endings for the second declension are \"-\u012b\" (singular) and \"-\u012bs\" (plural); \"at Corinth\", \"at Milan\", and \"at Philippi\".\nSecond-declension \"-ius\" and \"-ium\" nouns.\nNouns ending in \"-ius\" and \"-ium\" have a genitive singular in \"-\u012b\" in earlier Latin, which was regularized to \"-i\u012b\" in the later language. Masculine nouns in \"-ius\" have a vocative singular in \"-\u012b\" at all stages. These forms in \"-\u012b\" are stressed on the same syllable as the nominative singular, sometimes in violation of the usual Latin stress rule. For example, the genitive and vocative singular \"Vergil\u012b\" (from ) is pronounced \"Verg\u00edl\u012b\", with stress on the penult, even though it is short. In Old Latin, however, the vocative was declined regularly, using \"-ie\" instead, e.g. \"f\u012blie\" \"[O] son\", archaic vocative of .\nThere is no contraction of \"-i\u012b(s)\" in plural forms and in the locative.\nIn the older language, nouns ending with \"-vus\", \"-quus\" and \"-vum\" take \"o\" rather than \"u\" in the nominative and accusative singular. For example, ('slave') could be \"servos\", accusative \"servom\".\nSecond-declension \"-r\" nouns.\nSome masculine nouns of the second declension end in \"-er\" or \"-ir\" in the nominative singular. The declension of these nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, except for the lack of suffix in the nominative and vocative singular.\nSome (but not all) nouns in \"-er\" drop the \"e\" in the genitive and other cases. For example, ('father-in-law') keeps its \"e\". However, the noun ('(school)master') drops its \"e\" in the genitive singular.\nFor declension tables of second-declension nouns, see the .\nThe vocative \"puere\" is found but only in Plautus. The genitive plural \"virum\" is found in poetry.\nSecond-declension Greek nouns.\nThe second declension contains two types of masculine Greek nouns and one form of neuter Greek noun. These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first-declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from the Omicron declension.\nSome Greek nouns may also be declined as normal Latin nouns. For example, can appear as \"the\u0101trum\".\nIrregular forms.\nDeus.\nThe inflection of ('god') is irregular. The vocative singular of \"deus\" is not attested in Classical Latin. In Ecclesiastical Latin the vocative of \"Deus\" ('God') is \"Deus\".\nIn poetry, \"-um\" may substitute \"-\u014drum\" as the genitive plural ending.\nVirus.\nThree words, although second declension neuter, end in \"-us\". These are \"common people, crowd\", \"slime, poison\", and (borrowed from Greek) \"sea\".\nThe word means \"1. slimy liquid, slime; 2. poison, venom\", denoting the venom of a snake. This Latin word is probably related to the Greek (\"ios\") meaning \"venom\" or \"rust\" and the Sanskrit word \"\" meaning \"toxic, poison\".\nSince in antiquity denoted something uncountable, it was a mass noun. Mass nouns pluralize only under special circumstances, hence the non-existence of plural forms in the texts.\nIn Neo-Latin, a plural form is necessary in order to express the modern concept of 'viruses', which leads to the following declension:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThird declension.\nThe third declension is the largest group of nouns. The nominative singular of these nouns may end in \"-a\", \"-e\", \"-\u012b\", \"-\u014d\", \"-y\", \"-c\", \"-l\", \"-n\", \"-r\", \"-s\", \"-t\", or \"-x\". This group of nouns includes masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns.\nConsonant stems.\nThe stem of a consonant-stem noun may be found from the genitive case by removing the ending \"-is\". For example, the stem of f. 'peace' is \"p\u0101c-,\" the stem of n. 'river' is \"fl\u016bmin-\", and the stem of m. 'flower' is \"fl\u014dr-.\"\nMasculine, feminine and neuter nouns often have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, many masculine nouns end in \"-or\" (, 'love'). Many feminine nouns end in \"-\u012bx\" (, 'phoenix'), and many neuter nouns end in \"-us\" with an \"r\" stem in the oblique cases ( 'burden'; 'time').\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe locative endings for the third declension are \"-\u012b\" or \"-e\" (singular) and \"-ibus\" (plural), as in 'in the country' and 'at Tralles'.\nThird declension \"i\"-stem and mixed nouns.\nThe third declension also has a set of nouns that are declined differently. They are called \"i\"-stems. \"i\"-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure \"i\"-stems are indicated by special neuter endings. Mixed \"i\"-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule. Stems indicated by the parisyllabic rule are usually mixed, occasionally pure.\nParisyllabic rule: Some masculine and feminine third-declension \"i\"-stem nouns have the same number of syllables in the genitive and the nominative. For example: ('ship'); ('cloud'). The nominative ends in \"-is\" or \"-\u0113s\".\nDouble consonant rule: The rest of the masculine and feminine third-declension \"i\"-stem nouns have two consonants before the \"-is\" in the genitive singular. For example: ('part').\nSpecial neuter ending: Neuter third-declension \"i\"-stems have no rule. However, all of them end in \"-al\", \"-ar\" or \"-e\". For example: ('animal'); ('spoon'); ('sea').\nThe mixed declension is distinguished from the consonant type only by having \"-ium\" in the genitive plural (and occasionally \"-\u012bs\" in the accusative plural). The pure declension is characterized by having \"-\u012b\" in the ablative singular, \"-ium\" in the genitive plural, \"-ia\" in the nominative and accusative plural neuter, and \"-im\" in the accusative singular masculine and feminine (however, adjectives have \"-em\").\nThe accusative plural ending \"-\u012bs\" is found in early Latin up to Virgil, but from the early empire onwards it was replaced by \"-\u0113s\".\nThe accusative singular ending \"-im\" is found only in a few words: always in 'cough', 'thirst', 'River Tiber'; usually in 'axe', 'tower', 'poop', 'fever'; occasionally in 'ship'. Most nouns, however, have accusative singular \"-em\". The ending \"-im\" is not found in any adjectives, even those that have a separate feminine such as 'swift' or 'keen', or in any masculine common nouns.\nThe ablative singular \"-\u012b\" is found in nouns which have \"-im\", and also, optionally, in some other nouns, e.g. or 'in the fire'.\nThere are two mixed-declension neuter nouns: ('heart') and ('bone'). The mixed declension is also used in the plural-only adjective ('most').\nThe rules for determining \"i\"-stems from non-\"i\"-stems and mixed \"i\"-stems are guidelines rather than rules: many words that might be expected to be \"i\"-stems according to the parisyllabic rule actually are not, such as ('dog') or ('youth'), which have genitive plural 'of dogs' and 'of young men'. Likewise, ('father'), ('mother'), ('brother'), and ('parent') violate the double-consonant rule. This fluidity even in Roman times resulted in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin.\nSome nouns in \"-t\u0101t-\", such as 'city, community' can have either consonant-stem or \"i\"-stem genitive plural: or 'of the cities'.\nPeculiarities.\nIn the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFourth declension (\"u\" stems).\nThe fourth declension is a group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine words such as m. ('wave') and m. ('port') with a few feminine exceptions, including f. ('hand') and f. ('house'). The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns including n. ('knee'). Each noun has the ending \"-\u016bs\" as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is \"u\", but the declension is otherwise very similar to the third-declension \"i\" stems.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDomus.\n ('house, dwelling, building, home, native place, family, household, race') is an irregular noun, mixing fourth and second declension forms at the same time (especially in literature). However, in practice, it is generally declined as a regular \"-us\" stem fourth declension noun, except for ablative singular \"-\u014d\", accusative plural \"-\u014ds\", and the use of the locative.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFifth declension (\"e\" stems).\nThe fifth declension is a small group of nouns consisting of mostly feminine nouns like f. ('affair, matter, thing') and \"di\u0113s, di\u0113\u012b\" m. ('day'; but f. in names of days).\nNouns ending in \"-i\u0113s\" have long \"\u0113\u012b\" in the dative and genitive, while nouns ending in a consonant + \"-\u0113s\" usually have short \"e\u012b\" in these cases. Other forms of the genitive singular are also found, such as (\"Aeneid\" 1.636), (\"Georgic\" 1.208), (Ennius).\nThe locative ending of the fifth declension was \"-\u0113\" (singular only), identical to the ablative singular, as in ('today').\nPronouns.\nPersonal pronouns.\nThe first and second persons are irregular, and both pronouns are indeclinable for gender; and the third person reflexive pronoun s\u0113, su\u012b always refers back to the subject, regardless of whether the subject is singular or plural.\nThe genitive forms , , , , are used as complements in certain grammatical constructions, whereas , are used with a partitive meaning ('[one] of us', '[one] of you'). To express possession, the possessive pronouns (essentially adjectives) , , , are used, declined in the first and second declensions to agree in number and case with the thing possessed, e.g. 'my father', 'my mother'. The vocative singular masculine of is : 'my dear Atticus'.\nPossessive pronouns' declensions.\nThe possessive adjective has an archaic variant, ; similar to . Vocative of is usually , and rarely also, like the nominative.\nUsually, to show the ablative of accompaniment, would be placed before the ablative form. However, with personal pronouns (first and second person), the reflexive and the interrogative, \"-cum\" is added onto the end of the ablative form. That is: 'with me', 'with us', 'with you', , and (sometimes ).\nPronouns have also an emphatic form bi using the suffix \"-met\" (, /, , ), used in all cases, except by the genitive plural forms.\nIn accusative case, the forms \"m\u0113m\u0113\" and \"t\u0113t\u0113\" exist as emphatic, but they are not widely used.\n has a possessive adjective: , meaning 'his/her/its/their own':\n (Cicero)\n\"He had never seen his [own] father.\"\nWhen 'his' or 'her' refers to someone else, not the subject, the genitive pronoun (as well as \"e\u014drum\" and \"e\u0101rum\") 'of him' is used instead of \"suus\":\n (Cicero)\n\"He met Clodius in front of the latter's farm.\"\nDespite its resemblance to the possessive adjectives and , does not decline in agreement with the noun it refers to, in the way that an adjective would. For instance, \"his father\" in the accusative is (literally, \"father of him\"), not \"*eium\", in contrast with the reflexive formation (\"his [own] father\").\nWhen one sentence is embedded inside another with a different subject, \"s\u0113\" and \"suus\" can refer to either subject:\n (Nepos)\n\"The senators ... sent ambassadors to Bithynia, who were to ask the king not to keep their greatest enemy with him but hand him over to them.\"\nFor the third-person pronoun 'he', see below.\nDemonstrative pronouns and adjectives.\nRelative, demonstrative and indefinite pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:\nThese differences characterize the pronominal declension, and a few special adjectives ( 'whole', 'alone', 'one', 'no', 'another', 'another [of two]', etc.) are also declined according to this pattern.\nAll demonstrative, relative, and indefinite pronouns in Latin can also be used adjectivally, with some small differences; for example in the interrogative pronoun, 'who?' and 'what?' are usually used for the pronominal form, and 'which?' for the adjectival form.\nThird person pronoun.\nThe weak demonstrative pronoun , , 'that' also serves as the third person pronoun 'he, she, it':\nThis pronoun is also often used adjectivally, e.g. \"is homo\" 'that man', \"ea pecunia\" 'that money'. It has no possessive adjective; the genitive is used instead: \"pater eius\" 'his/her father'; \"pater e\u014drum\" 'their father'.\nDeclension of \"\u012bdem\".\nThe pronoun or pronominal adjective means 'the same'. It is derived from \"is\" with the suffix \"-dem\". However, some forms have been assimilated.\nOther demonstrative pronouns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSimilar in declension is 'another'.\nInterrogative pronouns.\nThe interrogative pronouns are used strictly for asking questions. They are distinct from the relative pronoun and the interrogative adjective (which is declined like the relative pronoun). Interrogative pronouns rarely occur in the plural. The plural interrogative pronouns are the same as the plural relative pronouns.\nRelative pronouns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdjectives.\nFor the most part adjectives are declined like nouns, with the difference that adjectives can normally be used in all three genders.\nNearly all adjectives can be categorized into one of two types:\nAn adjective agrees with its corresponding noun in number, gender, and case; they do not agree in declension type. Therefore, adjectives do not necessarily take the same ending as their nouns, although this often happens to be the case.\nFirst- and second-declension adjectives.\nFirst- and second-declension adjectives are inflected in the masculine, the feminine and the neuter; the masculine form typically ends in \"-us\" (although some end in \"-er\", see below), the feminine form ends in \"-a\", and the neuter form ends in \"-um\". Therefore, some adjectives are given like .\nAdjectives ending \"-ius\" use the vocative \"-ie\" (\"\u0113brie\", \"[O] drunk man\", vocative of \"\u0113brius\"), just as in Old Latin all \"-ius\" nouns did (\"f\u012blie\", \"[O] son\", archaic vocative of \"f\u012blius\").\nFirst- and second-declension \"-r\" adjectives.\nSome first- and second-declension adjectives' masculine forms end in \"-er\". As with second-declension \"-r\" nouns, some adjectives retain the \"e\" throughout inflection, and some omit it. omits its \"e\" while keeps it.\nFirst and second declension pronominal adjectives.\nNine first and second declension pronominal adjectives are irregular in the genitive and dative singular in all genders. They can be remembered by using the mnemonic acronym . They are:\nThird-declension adjectives.\nThird-declension adjectives are normally declined like third-declension \"i\"-stem nouns, except for the fact they usually have \"-\u012b\" rather than \"-e\" in the ablative singular (unlike \"i\"-stem nouns, in which only pure i-stems have \"-\u012b\"). Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending ('old, aged'), have \"-e\" in the ablative singular, \"-um\" in the genitive plural, and \"-a\" in the nominative and accusative neuter plural.\nThird-declension adjectives with one ending.\nThese have a single nominative ending for all genders, although as usual the endings for the other cases vary. As with nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of showing the inflection.\nThird-declension adjectives with two endings.\nThird-declension adjectives that have two endings have one form for the masculine and feminine, and a separate form for the neuter. The ending for the masculine and feminine is \"-is\", and the ending for the neuter is \"-e\". It is not necessary to give the genitive, as it is the same as the nominative masculine singular.\nThird-declension adjectives with three endings.\nThird-declension adjectives with three endings have three separate nominative forms for all three genders. Like third and second declension \"-r\" nouns, the masculine ends in \"-er\". The feminine ends in \"-ris\", and the neuter ends in \"-re\". The genitive is the same as the nominative feminine singular.\nComparative and superlative forms of adjectives.\nAs in English, adjectives have superlative and comparative forms. For regular first and second declension and third declension adjectives with one or two endings, the comparative is formed by adding \"-ior\" for the masculine and feminine, and \"-ius\" for the neuter to the stem. The genitives for both are formed by adding \"-i\u014dris\". Therefore, they are declined in the third declension, but they are not declined as \"i\"-stems. Superlatives are formed by adding \"-issimus, -issima, -issimum\" to the stem and are thus declined like first and second declension adjectives.\nComparatives and superlatives of \"-er\" adjectives.\nAdjectives (in the first and second as well as third declensions) that have masculine nominative singular forms ending in \"-er\" are slightly different. As with normal adjectives, the comparative is formed by adding \"-ior\" to the stem, but for the superlative, \"-rimus\" is added to the nominative masculine singular.\nComparatives and superlatives of \"-lis\" adjectives.\nSome third declension adjectives with two endings in \"-lis\" in the masculine\u2013feminine nominative singular have irregular superlative forms. The following are the only adjectives that do.\nComparatives and superlatives of \"-eus/-ius\" adjectives.\nFirst and second declension adjectives that end in \"-eus\" or \"-ius\" are unusual in that they do not form the comparative and superlative by taking endings at all. Instead, ('more') and ('most'), the comparative and superlative degrees of ('much, greatly'), respectively, are used.\nMany adjectives in \"-uus\", except those in \"-quus\" or \"-guus\", also follow this rule.\nIrregular comparatives and superlatives.\nAs in most languages, Latin has adjectives that have irregular comparatives and superlatives.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNumerals.\nThere are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are cardinal numerals and ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals, e.g., distributive numerals and adverbial numerals.\nCardinal numerals.\nAll cardinal numerals are indeclinable, except ('one'), ('two'), ('three'), plural hundreds ('two hundred'), ('three hundred') etc., and ('thousand'), which have cases and genders like adjectives. is declined like a first- and second-declension pronoun with \"-\u012bus\" or \"-ius\" in the genitive, and \"-\u012b\" in the dative. is declined irregularly, is declined like a third-declension plural adjective, \"-cent\u012b\" ('hundred') numerals decline like first- and second-declension adjectives, and is invariable in the singular and declined like a third-declension \"i\"-stem neuter noun in the plural:\nThe plural endings for \"\u016bnus\" are used with \"pl\u016br\u0101lia tantum\" nouns, e. g. \"\u016bna castra\" (one [military] camp), \"\u016bnae sc\u0101lae\" (one ladder).\nThe word ('both'), is declined like \"duo\" except that its \"o\" is long. Both declensions derive from the Indo-European dual number, otherwise defunct in Latin, rather than the plural.\nThe numeral ('one hundred') is indeclinable, but all the other hundred numerals are declinable (, , , , , , , ).\nThe word \"m\u012blle\" 'thousand' is a singular indeclinable adjective. However, its plural, \"m\u012blia\", is a plural third-declension \"i\"-stem neuter noun. To write the phrase \"four thousand horses\" in Latin, the genitive is used: \"quattuor m\u012blia equ\u014drum\", literally, \"four thousands of horses\".\nThe rest of the numbers are indeclinable whether used as adjectives or as nouns.\nFor further information on the different sets of Latin numerals, see Latin numerals (linguistics).\nAdverbs and their comparatives and superlatives.\nAdverbs are not declined. However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.\nAdverbs from first- and second-declension adjectives.\nFirst and second declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding \"-\u0113\" onto their stems.\nAdverbs from third declension adjectives.\nTypically, third declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding \"-iter\" to the stem. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add \"-er\" to the stem.\nComparative and superlative of adverbs.\nAdverbs' comparative forms are identical to the nominative neuter singular of the corresponding comparative adjective. Adverbs' superlative forms are simply formed by attaching the regular ending \"-\u0113\" to the corresponding superlative adjective. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, first and second declensions adjectives ending in \"-eus\" or \"-ius\" use and as opposed to distinct endings.\nIrregular adverbs and their comparative and superlative forms.\nAs with adjectives, there are irregular adverbs with peculiar comparative and superlative forms.\nPeculiarities within declension.\nIrregularity in number.\nSome nouns are only used in the singular (singulare tantum) such as:\nSome nouns are only used in the plural (plurale tantum), or when plural have a singular meaning such as:\nIndeclinable nouns.\nIndeclinable nouns are nouns which only have one form in all cases (of the singular).\nHeterogeneous nouns.\nHeterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.\nPlurals with alternative meanings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Classical Latin was spoken from the late Roman Republic to the early Empire: evidence for its pronunciation is taken from comments by Roman grammarians, common spelling mistakes, transcriptions into other languages, and the outcomes of various sounds in the Romance languages.\nLatin orthography is the writing system used to spell Latin from its archaic stages down to the present. Latin was nearly always spelt in the Latin alphabet, but further details varied from period to period. The alphabet developed from Old Italic script, which had developed from a variant of the Greek alphabet, which in turn had developed from a variant of the Phoenician alphabet. The Latin alphabet most resembles the Greek alphabet that can be seen on black-figure pottery dating to c. 540 BC, especially the Euboean regional variant.\nAs the language continued to be used as a classical language, lingua franca and liturgical language long after it ceased being a native language, pronunciation and\u00a0\u2013 to a lesser extent\u00a0\u2013 spelling diverged significantly from the classical standard with Latin words being pronounced differently by native speakers of different languages. While nowadays a reconstructed classical pronunciation aimed to be that of the 1st century AD is usually employed in the teaching of Latin, the Italian-influenced ecclesiastical pronunciation as used by the Catholic church is still in common use. The Traditional English pronunciation of Latin has all but disappeared from classics education but continues to be used for Latin-based loanwords and use of Latin e.g. for binominal names in taxonomy.\nDuring most of the time written Latin was in widespread use, authors variously complained about language change or attempted to \"restore\" an earlier standard. Such sources are of great value in reconstructing various stages of the spoken language (the is an important source for the spoken variety in the 4th century CE, for example) and have in some cases indeed influenced the development of the language. The efforts of Renaissance Latin authors were to a large extent successful in removing innovations in grammar, spelling and vocabulary present in Medieval Latin but absent in both classical and contemporary Latin.\nLetterforms.\nIn Classical times there was no modern-like distinction between upper case and lower case. Inscriptions typically use square capitals, in letterforms largely corresponding to modern upper-case, and handwritten text was generally in the form of cursive, which includes letterforms corresponding to modern lowercase.\nLetters and phonemes.\nIn Classical spelling, individual letters mainly corresponded to individual phonemes (alphabetic principle). Exceptions include:\nConsonants.\nBelow are the distinctive (i.e. phonemic) consonants that are assumed for Classical Latin.\nVowels.\nMonophthongs.\nClassical Latin had ten native phonemic monophthongs: the five short vowels , , , and , and their long counterparts , , , and . Two additional monophthongs, and , were sometimes used for \u27e8y\u27e9 in loanwords from Greek by educated speakers, but most speakers would have approximated them with or .\nLong and short vowels.\nThe short vowels , , and may have been pronounced with a relatively open quality, which may be approximated as , and the corresponding long vowels with a relatively close quality, approximately . That the short and were, as this implies, similar in quality to the long and is suggested by attested misspellings such as:\n most likely had a more open allophone before .\n and were probably pronounced closer when they occurred before another vowel, with e.g. written as \u27e8mia\u27e9 in some inscriptions. Short before another vowel is often written with the so-called long I, as in \u27e8d\ua7fees\u27e9 for , indicating that its quality was similar to that of long ; it was almost never confused with \u27e8e\u27e9 in this position.\nAdoption of Greek upsilon.\n\u27e8y\u27e9 was used in Greek loanwords with upsilon \u27e8\u27e9. This letter represented the close front rounded vowel, both short and long: and . Latin did not have this sound as a native phoneme, and speakers tended to pronounce such loanwords with and in Old Latin and and in Classical and Late Latin if they were unable to produce and .\nAn intermediate vowel sound (likely a close central vowel or possibly its rounded counterpart , or even ), called , can be reconstructed for the classical period. Such a vowel is found in , , (also spelled , , ) and other words. It developed out of any historical short vowel in a non-initial open syllable by vowel reduction, probably first to , later fronted to or . In the vicinity of labial consonants, this sound was not as fronted and may have retained some rounding, thus being more similar if not identical to the unreduced short . The Claudian letter \u2c75 \u2c76 was possibly invented to represent this sound, but is never actually found used this way in the epigraphic record (it usually served as a replacement for the upsilon).\nVowel nasalization.\nVowels followed by a nasal consonant were allophonically realised as long nasal vowels in two environments:\nThose long nasal vowels had the same quality as ordinary long vowels. In Vulgar Latin, the vowels lost their nasalisation, and they merged with the long vowels (which were themselves shortened by that time). This is shown by many forms in the Romance languages, such as Spanish from Vulgar Latin (originally ) and Italian from Vulgar Latin (Classical Latin ). On the other hand, the short vowel and were restored, for example, in French and from and (\u27e8e\u27e9 is the normal development of Latin short \u27e8i\u27e9), likely by analogy with other forms beginning in the prefix .\nWhen a final \u27e8m\u27e9 occurred before a plosive or nasal in the next word, however, it was pronounced as a nasal at the place of articulation of the following consonant. For instance, was written for in inscriptions, and was a double entendre, presumably for .\nDiphthongs.\n\u27e8ae\u27e9, \u27e8oe\u27e9, \u27e8au\u27e9, \u27e8ei\u27e9 and \u27e8eu\u27e9 could represent diphthongs: \u27e8ae\u27e9 represented , \u27e8oe\u27e9 represented , \u27e8au\u27e9 represented , \u27e8ei\u27e9 represented , and \u27e8eu\u27e9 represented . \u27e8ui\u27e9 sometimes represented the diphthong , as in and . The diphthong \u27e8ei\u27e9 had mostly changed to \u27e8\u012b\u27e9 by the Classical epoch; \u27e8ei\u27e9 remained only in a few words, such as the interjection .\nIf there is a tr\u00e9ma above the second vowel, both vowels are pronounced separately: \u27e8a\u00eb\u27e9 , \u27e8a\u00fc\u27e9 , \u27e8e\u00fc\u27e9 and \u27e8o\u00eb\u27e9 . However, disyllabic \u27e8eu\u27e9 in morpheme borders is traditionally written without the tr\u00e9ma: 'my'.\nIn Old Latin, \u27e8ae\u27e9 and \u27e8oe\u27e9 were written as \u27e8ai\u27e9, \u27e8oi\u27e9 and probably pronounced as and , with a fully closed second element, similar to the final syllable in French . In the late Old Latin period, the last element of the diphthongs was lowered to , so that the diphthongs were pronounced and in Classical Latin. They were then monophthongized to and respectively, starting in rural areas at the end of the Republican period. The process, however, does not seem to have been completed before the 3rd century AD, and some scholars say that it may have been regular by the 5th century.\nVowel and consonant length.\nVowel and consonant length were more significant and more clearly defined in Latin than in modern English. Length is the duration of time that a particular sound is held before proceeding to the next sound in a word. In the modern spelling of Latin, especially in dictionaries and academic work, macrons are frequently used to mark long vowels: \u27e8\u0101\u27e9, \u27e8\u0113\u27e9, \u27e8\u012b\u27e9, \u27e8\u014d\u27e9, \u27e8\u016b\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0233\u27e9, while the breve is sometimes used to indicate that a vowel is short: \u27e8\u0103\u27e9, \u27e8\u0115\u27e9, \u27e8\u012d\u27e9, \u27e8\u014f\u27e9, \u27e8\u016d\u27e9 and \u27e8y\u0306\u27e9.\nLong consonants were usually indicated through doubling, but ancient Latin orthography did not distinguish between the vocalic and consonantal uses of \u27e8i\u27e9 and \u27e8v\u27e9. Vowel length was indicated only intermittently in classical sources and even then through a variety of means. Later medieval and modern usage tended to omit vowel length altogether. A short-lived convention of spelling long vowels by doubling the vowel letter is associated with the poet Lucius Accius. Later spelling conventions marked long vowels with an apex (a diacritic similar to an acute accent) or, in the case of long i, by increasing the height of the letter (long i); in the second century AD, those were given apices as well. The Classical vowel length system faded in later Latin and ceased to be phonemic in Romance, having been replaced by contrasts in vowel quality. Consonant length, however, remains contrastive in much of Italo-Romance, cf. Italian \"ninth\" versus \"grandfather\".\nA minimal set showing both long and short vowels and long and short consonants is ('anus'), ('year'), ('old woman').\nTable of orthography.\nThe letters \u27e8b\u27e9, \u27e8d\u27e9, \u27e8f\u27e9, \u27e8h\u27e9, \u27e8m\u27e9, \u27e8n\u27e9 are always pronounced as in English , , , , , respectively, and they do not usually cause any difficulties. The exceptions are mentioned below:\nSyllables and stress.\nNature of the accent.\nAlthough some French and Italian scholars believe that the classical Latin accent was purely a pitch accent, which had no effect on the placing of words in a line of poetry, the view of most scholars is that the accent was a stress accent. One argument for this is that unlike most languages with tonal accents, there are no minimal pairs like ancient Greek (falling accent) \"light\" vs. (rising accent) \"man\" where a change of accent on the same syllable changes the meaning. Among other arguments are the loss of vowels before or after the accent in words such as and ; and the shortening of post or pre-accentual syllables in Plautus and Terence by brevis brevians, for example, scansions such as and with the second syllable short.\nOld Latin stress.\nIn Old Latin, as in Proto-Italic, stress normally fell on the first syllable of a word. During this period, the word-initial stress triggered changes in the vowels of non-initial syllables, the effects of which are still visible in classical Latin. Compare for example:\nIn the earliest Latin writings, the original unreduced vowels are still visible. Study of this vowel reduction, as well as syncopation (dropping of short unaccented syllables) in Greek loan words, indicates that the stress remained word-initial until around the time of Plautus, in the 3rd century BC. The placement of the stress then shifted to become the pattern found in classical Latin.\nClassical Latin syllables and stress.\nIn Classical Latin, stress fell on one of the last three syllables, called the antepenult, the penult, and the ultima (short for 'before almost last', 'almost last', and 'last syllable'). Its position is determined by the syllable weight of the penult. If the penult is heavy, it is accented; if the penult is light and there are more than two syllables, the antepenult is accented. In a few words originally accented on the penult, accent is on the ultima because the two last syllables have been contracted, or the last syllable has been lost.\nSyllable.\nTo determine stress, syllable weight of the penult must be determined. To determine syllable weight, words must be broken up into syllables. In the following examples, syllable structure is represented using these symbols: C (a consonant), K (a stop), R (a liquid), and V (a short vowel), VV (a long vowel or diphthong).\nNucleus.\nEvery short vowel, long vowel, or diphthong belongs to a single syllable. This vowel forms the syllable nucleus. Thus has four syllables, one for every vowel (a i \u0101 u: V V VV V), has three (ae e u: VV V V), has two (u \u014d: V VV), and has one (ui: VV).\nOnset and coda.\nA consonant before a vowel or a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word is placed in the same syllable as the following vowel. This consonant or consonant cluster forms the syllable onset.\nAfter this, if there is an additional consonant inside the word, it is placed at the end of the syllable. This consonant is the syllable coda. Thus if a consonant cluster of two consonants occurs between vowels, they are broken up between syllables: one goes with the syllable before, the other with the syllable after.\nThere are two exceptions. A consonant cluster of a stop , , , , , or followed by a liquid or between vowels usually goes to the syllable after it, although it is also sometimes broken up like other consonant clusters.\nHeavy and light syllables.\nAs shown in the examples above, Latin syllables have a variety of possible structures. Here are some of them. The first four examples are light syllables, and the last six are heavy. All syllables have at least one V (vowel). A syllable is heavy if it has another V or C (or both) after the first V. In the table below, the extra V or VC is bolded, indicating that it makes the syllable heavy.\nThus, a syllable is heavy if it ends in a long vowel or diphthong, a short vowel and a consonant, a long vowel and a consonant, or a diphthong and a consonant. Syllables ending in a diphthong and consonant are rare in Classical Latin.\nThe syllable onset has no relationship to syllable weight; both heavy and light syllables can have no onset or an onset of one, two, or three consonants.\nIn Latin a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a long vowel or diphthong is traditionally called (lit.\u00a0transl.\u2009syllable long by nature), and a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a consonant is called (lit.\u00a0transl.\u2009long by position). These terms are translations of Greek () and (), respectively; therefore should not be mistaken for implying a syllable \"is long because of its position/place in a word\" but rather \"is treated as 'long' by convention\". This article uses the words \"heavy\" and \"light\" for syllables, and \"long\" and \"short\" for vowels since the two are not the same.\nStress rule.\nIn a word of three or more syllables, the weight of the penult determines where the accent is placed. If the penult is light, accent is placed on the antepenult; if it is heavy, accent is placed on the penult. Below, stress is marked by placing the stress mark \u27e8\u27e9 before the stressed syllable.\nIambic shortening.\nIambic shortening or is vowel shortening that occurs in words of the type \"light\u2013heavy\", where the light syllable is stressed. By this sound change, words like , , , with long final vowel change to , , , with short final vowel.\nThe term also refers to shortening of closed syllables following a short syllable, for example and so on. This type of shortening is found in early Latin, for example in the comedies of Plautus and Terence, but not in poetry of the classical period.\nElision.\nWhere one word ended with a vowel (including the nasalized vowels written \u27e8am\u27e9, \u27e8em\u27e9, \u27e8im\u27e9, \u27e8om\u27e9 and \u27e8um\u27e9, and the diphthong \u27e8ae\u27e9) and the next word began with a vowel, the former vowel, at least in verse, was regularly elided; that is, it was omitted altogether, or possibly (in the case of and ) pronounced like the corresponding semivowel. When the second word was or , and possibly when the second word was , a different form of elision sometimes occurred (prodelision): the vowel of the preceding word was retained, and the \u27e8e\u27e9 was elided instead. Elision also occurred in Ancient Greek, but in that language, it is shown in writing by the vowel in question being replaced by an apostrophe, whereas in Latin elision is not indicated at all in the orthography, but can be deduced from the verse form. Only occasionally is it found in inscriptions, as in for .\nModern conventions.\nSpelling.\nLetters.\nModern usage, even for classical Latin texts, varies in respect of \u27e8I\u27e9 and \u27e8V\u27e9. During the Renaissance, the printing convention was to use \u27e8I\u27e9 (upper case) and \u27e8i\u27e9 (lower case) for both vocalic and consonantal , to use \u27e8V\u27e9 in the upper case and in the lower case to use \u27e8v\u27e9 at the start of words and \u27e8u\u27e9 subsequently within the word regardless of whether and was represented.\nMany publishers (such as Oxford University Press) have adopted the convention of using \u27e8I\u27e9 (upper case) and \u27e8i\u27e9 (lower case) for both and , and \u27e8V\u27e9 (upper case) and \u27e8u\u27e9 (lower case) for both and .\nAn alternative approach, less common today, is to use \u27e8i\u27e9 and \u27e8u\u27e9 only for the vowels, and \u27e8j\u27e9 and \u27e8v\u27e9 for the approximants.\nMost modern editions, however, adopt an intermediate position, distinguishing between \u27e8u\u27e9 and \u27e8v\u27e9, but not between \u27e8i\u27e9 and \u27e8j\u27e9. Usually, a non-vocalic \u27e8v\u27e9 after \u27e8q\u27e9, \u27e8g\u27e9 or \u27e8s\u27e9 is still printed as \u27e8u\u27e9 rather than \u27e8v\u27e9, likely because these did not change from to post-classically.\nDiacritics.\nTextbooks and dictionaries usually indicate the length of vowels by putting a macron or horizontal bar above the long vowel, but it is not generally done in regular texts. Occasionally, mainly in early printed texts up to the 18th century, one may see a circumflex used to indicate a long vowel where this makes a difference to the sense, for instance, ('from Rome' ablative) compared to ('Rome' nominative).\nSometimes, for instance in Roman Catholic service books, an acute accent over a vowel is used to indicate the stressed syllable. It would be redundant for one who knew the classical rules of accentuation and made the correct distinction between long and short vowels, but most Latin speakers since the 3rd century have not made any distinction between long and short vowels, but they have kept the accents in the same places; thus, the use of accent marks allows speakers to read a word aloud correctly even if they have never heard it spoken aloud.\nPronunciation.\nPost-Medieval Latin.\nSince around the beginning of the Renaissance period onwards, with the language being used as an international language among intellectuals, pronunciation of Latin in Europe came to be dominated by the phonology of local languages, resulting in a variety of different pronunciation systems. See the article \"Latin regional pronunciation\" for more details on those (with the exception of the Italian one, which is described in the section on \"Ecclesiastical pronunciation\" below).\nLoan words and formal study.\nWhen Latin words are used as loanwords in a modern language, there is ordinarily little or no attempt to pronounce them as the Romans did; in most cases, a pronunciation suiting the phonology of the receiving language is employed.\nLatin words in common use in English are generally fully assimilated into the English sound system, with little to mark them as foreign; for example, \"cranium\", \"saliva\". Other words have a stronger Latin feel to them, usually because of spelling features such as the digraphs \u27e8ae\u27e9 and \u27e8oe\u27e9 (occasionally written with the ligatures: \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0153\u27e9, respectively), which both denote in English. The digraph \u27e8ae\u27e9 or ligature \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 in some words tend to be given an pronunciation; for example, \"curriculum vitae\".\nHowever, using loanwords in the context of the language borrowing them is a markedly different situation from the study of Latin itself. In this classroom setting, instructors and students attempt to recreate at least some sense of the original pronunciation. What is taught to native anglophones is suggested by the sounds of today's Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin. Instructors who take this approach rationalize that Romance vowels probably come closer to the original pronunciation than those of any other modern language (see also the section below).\nHowever, other languages\u2014including Romance family members\u2014all have their own interpretations of the Latin phonological system, applied both to loan words and formal study of Latin. But English, Romance, or other teachers do not always point out that the particular accent their students learn is not actually the way ancient Romans spoke.\nEcclesiastical pronunciation.\nSince the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an Italianate pronunciation of Latin has grown to be accepted as a universal standard in the Catholic Church. Before then, the pronunciation of Latin in church was the same as the pronunciation of Latin in other fields and tended to reflect the sound values associated with the nationality and native language of the speaker. Other ecclesiastical pronunciations are still in use, especially outside the Catholic Church.\nA guide to this Italianate pronunciation is provided below. Since the letters or letter-combinations \u27e8b\u27e9, \u27e8d\u27e9, \u27e8f\u27e9, \u27e8m\u27e9, \u27e8n\u27e9, and \u27e8v\u27e9 are pronounced as they are in English, they are not included in the table.\nIn his \": A guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Latin\", William Sidney Allen remarked that this pronunciation, used by the Catholic Church in Rome and elsewhere, was recommended by Pope Pius X in a 1912 letter to the Archbishop of Bourges. However, as can be seen from the table above, there are very significant differences. The introduction to the indicates that Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation should be used at Church liturgies. The Pontifical Academy for Latin is the pontifical academy in the Vatican that is charged with the dissemination and education of Catholics in the Latin language.\nOutside of Austria, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia, it is the most widely used standard in choral singing which, with a few exceptions like Stravinsky's , is concerned with liturgical texts. Anglican choirs adopted it when classicists abandoned traditional English pronunciation after World War II. The rise of historically informed performance and the availability of guides such as Copeman's \"Singing in Latin\" has led to the recent revival of regional pronunciations.\nPronunciation shared by Vulgar Latin and Romance languages.\nAs Classical Latin developed to Late Latin, and eventually into the modern Romance languages, it experienced several phonological changes. Notable changes include the following (the precise order of which is uncertain):\nExamples.\nThe following examples are both in verse, which demonstrates several features more clearly than prose.\nFrom Classical Latin.\nVirgil's , Book 1, verses 1\u20134. Quantitative metre (dactylic hexameter). Translation: \"I sing of arms and the man, who, driven by fate, came first from the borders of Troy to Italy and the Lavinian shores; he [was] much afflicted both on lands and on the deep by the power of the gods, because of fierce Juno's vindictive wrath.\"\nNote the elisions in and in the third line. For a fuller discussion of the prosodic features of this passage, see Dactylic hexameter.\nSome manuscripts have \" rather than \" in the second line.\nFrom Medieval Latin.\nBeginning of by Thomas Aquinas (13th century). Rhymed accentual metre.

{"id": "18000", "revid": "1317708722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18000", "title": "Latin conjugation", "text": "Latin grammatical verb inflections\nIn linguistics and grammar, \"conjugation\" has two basic meanings. One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts. \nThe second meaning of the word \"conjugation\" is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which in the present tense have 1st singular -\u014d, 2nd singular -\u0101s, and infinitive -\u0101re are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular -e\u014d, 2nd singular -\u0113s and infinitive -\u0113re belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on. The number of conjugations of regular verbs is usually said to be four.\nThe word \"conjugation\" comes from the Latin , a calque of the Greek (\"syzygia\"), literally \"yoking together (horses into a team)\".\nFor examples of verbs and verb groups for each inflectional class, see the Wiktionary appendix pages for first conjugation, second conjugation, third conjugation, and fourth conjugation.\nNumber of conjugations.\nThe ancient Romans themselves, beginning with Varro (1st century BC), originally divided their verbs into three conjugations ( \"there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third\" (Donatus), 4th century AD), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an \"a\", an \"e\" or an \"i\" in it. However, others, such as Sacerdos (3rd century AD), Dositheus (4th century AD) and Priscian (c. 500 AD), recognised four different groups.\nIn modern times grammarians generally recognise four conjugations according to the ending of the active infinitive: namely -\u0101re, -\u0113re, -ere, or -\u012bre, for example: (1) \"to love\", (2) \"to see\", (3) \"to rule\" and \"to capture\", (4) \"to hear\". (3rd conjugation verbs ending in \"-i\u014d\" such as are sometimes known as \"mixed conjugation\" since they use a mixture of 3rd and 4th conjugation endings.)\nIn addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four regular conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most frequent of these is the verb \"to be\" together with its prefixed derivatives.\nThere also exist deponent Latin verbs, which though active in meaning have endings identical to the passive endings of ordinary verbs. Examples in the different conjugations are: (1) \"to delay\", (2) \"to promise\", (3) \"to follow\" and \"to go back\", (4) \"to lie (tell a lie)\". Some verbs are semi-deponent, using passive forms for the perfect tenses only.\nPrincipal parts.\nA verb's full paradigm relies on multiple different stems. The present indicative active and the present infinitive are both based on the present stem. \nIt is not possible to infer the stems for other tenses from the present stem. This means that, although the infinitive active form normally shows the verb conjugation, knowledge of several different forms is necessary to be able to confidently produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.\nIn a dictionary, Latin verbs are listed with four \"principal parts\" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs), which allow the student to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:\nRegular conjugations.\nFirst conjugation.\nThe first conjugation is characterized by the vowel \"\u0101\" and can be recognized by the \"-\u0101re\" ending of the present active infinitive form. The infectum tenses conjugate as follows (see also their meaning):\nIn early Latin (Plautus), the 3rd singular endings \"-at\" and \"-et\" were pronounced \"-\u0101t\" and \"-\u0113t\" with a long vowel.\nOther forms:\nThe principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\nThe verb ' \"I give\" is irregular in that except in the 2nd singular ' and imperative ', the \"a\" is short, e.g. ' \"I will give\".\nThe \"a\" is also short in the supine ' and its derivatives, but the other parts of ' \"I stand\" are regular.\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:\n* \"to think\"\n* \"to try\"\n* \"to hesitate\"\n* \"to exhort\"\n* \"to be surprised, to be amazed at\"\n* \"to delay, stay\"\nPerfect tenses.\nThe three tenses of the 1st conjugation go as in the following table:\nIn poetry (and also sometimes in prose, e.g. Livy), the 3rd person plural of the perfect indicative is often ' instead of '. Occasionally the form is also found.\nIn early Latin, the future perfect indicative had a short \"i\" in , but by the time of Cicero these forms were usually pronounced with a long \"i\", in the same way as in the perfect subjunctive. Virgil has a short \"i\" for both tenses; Horace uses both forms for both tenses; Ovid uses both forms for the future perfect, but a long \"i\" in the perfect subjunctive.\nThe \"-v-\" of the perfect active tenses sometimes drops out, especially in the pluperfect subjunctive: ' for '. Forms such as ' and ' are also found.\nThe passive tenses also have feminine and neuter forms, e.g. ' \"she was loved\", ' \"it was announced\".\nForms made with instead of and instead of are also found, for example and so on, but these are not common in classical Latin. See Latin tenses.\nFor other meanings of the perfect and pluperfect subjunctive, see Latin tenses#Jussive subjunctive.\nOther forms:\nSecond conjugation.\nThe second conjugation is characterized by the vowel \u0113, and can be recognized by the -e\u014d ending of the first person present indicative and the -\u0113re ending of the present active infinitive form: \nThe passive also often means \"I seem\".\nOther forms:\nThe principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\nIn verbs with perfect in \"-v\u012b\", syncopated (i.e. abbreviated) forms are common, such as for .\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of , but and have a perfect participle with \"ss\":\n* \"to confess\"\n* \"to deserve\"\n* \"to promise\"\nThe following are semi-deponent, that is, they are deponent only in the three perfect tenses:\n* \"to dare\"\n* \"to rejoice, to be glad\"\n* \"to be accustomed\"\nThird conjugation.\nThe third conjugation has a variable short stem vowel, which may be e, i, or u in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in -ere in the present active infinitive. Deponent verbs have the infinitive -\u012b.\nThe future tense in the 3rd and 4th conjugation (\"-am, -\u0113s, -et\" etc.) differs from that in the 1st and 2nd conjugation (\"-b\u014d, -bis, -bit\" etc.). \nOther forms:\nFour 3rd conjugation verbs usually have no ending in the imperative singular: ' \"lead!\", ' \"say!\", ' \"bring!\", ' \"do!\". \nOthers, like \"run!\", have the ending \"-e\".\nThere is no regular rule for constructing the perfect stem of third-conjugation verbs, but the following patterns are used:\nAlthough \"to give\" is 1st conjugation, its compounds are 3rd conjugation and have internal reduplication:\n* \"to found\"\n* \"to entrust, believe\"\n* \"to surrender\"\n* \"to destroy, lose\"\n* \"to give back\"\n* \"to hand over\"\nLikewise the compounds of have internal reduplication. Although is transitive, its compounds are intransitive:\n* \"to cause to stand\"\n* \"to come to a halt\"\n* \"to stand off\"\n* \"to resist\"\nDeponent verbs in the 3rd conjugation include the following:\n* \"to embrace\"\n* \"to enjoy\" ( is occasionally found) \n* \"to perform, discharge, busy oneself with\"\n* \"to glide, slip\"\n* \"to speak\"\n* \"to lean on; to strive\" ( is occasionally found)\n* \"to complain\"\n* \"to follow\"\n* \"to use\"\n* \"to ride\"\nThere are also a number of 3rd conjugation deponents with the ending \"-scor\":\n* \"to obtain\"\n* \"to get angry\"\n* \"to obtain\"\n* \"to be born\"\n* \"to forget\"\n* \"to set out\"\n* \"to avenge, take vengeance on\"\nDeponent in some tenses only is the following:\n* \"to trust\"\nThe following is deponent only in the infectum tenses:\n* \"to turn back\"\nThird conjugation -i\u014d verbs.\nIntermediate between the third and fourth conjugation are the third-conjugation verbs with suffix \u2013i\u014d. These resemble the fourth conjugation in some forms. \nOther forms:\nSome examples are:\n* \"to receive, accept\"\n* \"to take, capture\"\n* \"to watch, examine\"\n* \"to desire, long for\"\n* \"to do, to make\"\n* \"to flee\"\n* \"to throw\"\n* \"to kill\"\n* \"to plunder, seize\"\n* \"to look back\"\nDeponent verbs in this group include:\n* \"to attack\"\n* \"to go out\"\n* \"to die\"\n* \"to suffer, to allow\"\n* \"to attack\"\n* \"to go back\"\nFourth conjugation.\nThe fourth conjugation is characterized by the vowel \u012b and can be recognized by the -\u012bre ending of the present active infinitive. Deponent verbs have the infinitive -\u012br\u012b:\nOther forms:\nPrincipal parts of verbs in the fourth conjugation generally adhere to the following patterns:\nDeponent verbs in the 4th conjugation include the following:\n* \"to assent\"\n* \"to experience, test\"\n* \"to bestow\"\n* \"to tell a lie\"\n* \"to measure\"\n* \"to exert oneself, set in motion, build\"\n* \"to obtain, gain possession of\"\n* \"to cast lots\"\nThe verb \"to arise\" is also regarded as 4th conjugation, although some parts, such as the 3rd singular present tense and imperfect subjunctive , have a short vowel like the 3rd conjugation. But its compound \"to rise up, attack\" is entirely 4th conjugation.\nIn the perfect tenses, shortened forms without \"-v-\" are common, for example, for . Cicero, however, prefers the full forms to .\nIrregular verbs.\n\"Sum\" and \"possum\".\nThe verb \"to be\" is the most common verb in Latin. It is conjugated as follows:\nIn early Latin (e.g. Plautus), ' can be found for the present subjunctive '. In poetry the subjunctive also sometimes occurs.\nAn alternative imperfect subjunctive is sometimes made using etc. See further: Latin tenses#Foret.\nOther forms:\nThe present participle is found only in the compounds ' \"absent\" and ' \"present\".\nIn Plautus and Lucretius, an infinitive ' is sometimes found for ' \"to be able\".\nThe principal parts of these verbs are as follows:\n* \"to be\"\n* \"to be away\"\n* \"to be present\"\n* \"to be wanting\"\n* \"to be able\"\n* \"to be for, to profit\" (adds \"d\" before a vowel)\nThe perfect tenses conjugate in the regular way.\nFor the difference in meaning between and , see Latin tenses#Difference between eram and fu\u012b\n\"Vol\u014d\", \"n\u014dl\u014d\", and \"m\u0101l\u014d\".\nThe verb and its derivatives and (short for ) resemble a 3rd conjugation verb, but the present subjunctive ending in \"-im\" is different:\nThe spellings ' and ' were used up until the time of Cicero for ' and '.\nThese verbs are not used in the passive.\nOther forms: \nPrincipal parts:\n* \"to want\"\n* \"not to want, to be unwilling\"\n* \"to prefer\"\nThe perfect tenses are formed regularly.\n\"E\u014d\" and compounds.\nThe verb \"I go\" is an irregular 4th conjugation verb, in which the \"i\" of the stem sometimes becomes \"e\". Like 1st and 2nd conjugation verbs, it uses the future \"-b\u014d, -bis, -bit\":\nOther forms:\nThe impersonal passive forms ' \"they go\", ' \"they went\" are sometimes found.\nThe principal parts of some verbs which conjugate like are the following:\n* \"to go\"\n* \"to go away\"\n* \"to go up to\"\n* \"to meet, assemble\"\n* \"to go out\"\n* \"to enter\"\n* \"to perish\"\n* \"to enter\"\n* \"to die, to perish\"\n* \"to pass by\"\n* \"to return, to go back\"\n* \"to go under, to approach stealthily, to undergo\"\n* \"to be sold\"\nIn the perfect tenses of these verbs, the \"-v-\" is almost always omitted, especially in the compounds, although the form is common in the Vulgate Bible translation.\nIn some perfect forms, the vowels \"ii-\" are contracted to \"\u012b-\": second person singular perfect , second person plural perfect ; pluperfect subjunctive ; perfect infinitive (the form is also attested).\nThe verb \"to be able\" has forms similar to .\n\"Fer\u014d\" and compounds.\nThe verb \"to bring, to bear, to carry\" is 3rd conjugation, but irregular in that the vowel following the root \"fer-\" is sometimes omitted. The perfect tense and supine stem are also irregularly formed.\nThe future tense in the 3rd and 4th conjugation (\"-am, -\u0113s, -et\" etc.) differs from that in the 1st and 2nd conjugation (\"-b\u014d, -bis, -bit\" etc.). \nOther forms:\nCompounds of include the following:\nThe principal parts of some verbs which conjugate like are the following:\n* \"to bring (to)\"\n* \"to carry away, to steal\"\n* \"to collect\"\n* \"to put off\"\n* \"to carry out\"\n* \"to offer\"\n* \"to refer\"\nThe perfect tense , however, belongs to the verb :\n* \"to raise, to remove\"\n\"F\u012b\u014d\".\nThe irregular verb \"to become, to happen, to be done, to be made\" as well as being a verb in its own right serves as the passive of \"to do, to make\". The perfect tenses are identical with the perfect passive tenses of .\nThe 1st and 2nd plural forms are almost never found.\nOther forms:\n\"Ed\u014d\".\nThe verb \"to eat\" has regular 3rd conjugation forms appearing alongside irregular ones:\nOther forms:\nThe passive form \"it is eaten\" is also found.\nThe present subjunctive etc. is found mostly in early Latin.\nIn writing, there is a possibility of confusion between the forms of this verb and those of \"I am\" and \"I give out, put forth\"; for example, \"to eat\" vs. \"to be\"; \"he eats\" vs. \"he gives out\".\nThe compound verb \"to eat up, consume\" is similar.\nNon-finite forms.\nThe non-finite forms of verbs are participles, infinitives, supines, gerunds and gerundives. The verbs used are:\n1st conjugation: \u2013 to praise\n2nd conjugation: \u2013 to frighten, deter\n3rd conjugation: \u2013 to seek, attack\n3rd conjugation (\"-i\" stem): \u2013 to take, capture\n4th conjugation: \u2013 to hear, listen (to)\nParticiples.\nThere are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future active, and future passive (= the gerundive).\nInfinitives.\nThere are seven main infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active, future passive, and potential active. Further infinitives can be made using the gerundive.\nThe future passive infinitive was not very commonly used. The Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, followed by a subjunctive clause.\nSupine.\nThe supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the fourth declension. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.\nGerund.\nThe gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the \"-ns\" becomes an \"-ndus\", and the preceding \"\u0101\" or \"\u0113\" is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the second declension, but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning \"the act of doing (the verb)\", and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form can mean \"of praising\", the dative form can mean \"for praising\", the accusative form can mean \"praising\", and the ablative form can mean \"by praising\", \"in respect to praising\", etc.\nOne common use of the gerund is with the preposition to indicate purpose. For example, could be translated as \"ready to attack\". However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for \"ready to attack the enemy\" the construction is preferred over .\nGerundive.\nThe gerundive has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a first and second declension adjective, and functions as a future passive participle (see above). It means \"(which is) to be ...ed\". Often, the gerundive is used with part of the verb , to show obligation.\nAn older form of the 3rd and 4th conjugation gerundive ends in \"-undum\", e.g. ( for ). This ending is also found with the gerundive of 'I go': 'it is necessary to go'.\nFor some examples of uses of Latin gerundives, see the Gerundive article.\nPeriphrastic conjugations.\nThere are two periphrastic conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.\nActive.\nThe first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of . It is translated as \"I am going to praise\", \"I was going to praise\", etc.\nPassive.\nThe second periphrastic conjugation uses the gerundive. It is combined with the forms of and expresses necessity. It is translated as \"I am needing to be praised\", \"I was needing to be praised\", etc., or as \"I have to (\"i.e.\", must) be praised\", \"I had to be praised\", etc. It may also be translated in English word by word, as in \"You are to be (\"i.e.\", must be) praised.\"\nPeculiarities.\nDeponent and semi-deponent verbs.\nDeponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the passive voice) but active in meaning. These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed periphrastically with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:\n1st conjugation: \u2013 to admire, wonder\n2nd conjugation: \u2013 to promise, offer\n3rd conjugation: \u2013 to speak, say\n4th conjugation: \u2013 to tell a lie\nDeponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the gerund, the supine, the present and future participles and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with \"active\" form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate \"The word is said\" with any form of , and there are no forms like \"loqu\u014d\", \"loquis\", \"loquit\", etc.\nSemi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:\n \u2013 to dare, venture\nUnlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are transitive, which means that they can take an object. For example:\n \u2013 he follows the enemy.\nNote: In the Romance languages, which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, changed to \"mirar(e)\" by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent \"active form\", and changed to \"osar(e)\" by taking the participle and making an \"-ar(e)\" verb out of it (note that \"au\" went to \"o\").\nDefective verbs.\nDefective verbs are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.\n (future participle ) \u2013 to hate\n (imperative ) \u2013 to remember\n \u2013 to have begun\n (plur. ), which means \"Hand it over\" is only in the imperative mood, and only is used in the second person.\nThe following are conjugated irregularly:\nPresent Active Participle: \u2013 \nPresent Active Participle \u2013 \nPresent Active Infinitive \u2013 (variant: )\nSupine \u2013 (acc.) , (abl.) \nGerund \u2013 (gen.) , (dat. and abl.) , no accusative\nGerundive \u2013 \n\"For\".\nThe Romance languages lost many of these verbs, but others (such as ) survived but became regular fully conjugated verbs (in Italian, ).\nImpersonal verbs.\nImpersonal verbs are those lacking a person. In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun \"it\" (as in \"It seems\", or \"it is raining\"). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part. A few examples are:\n \u2013 to rain (it rains)\n \u2013 to snow (it snows)\n \u2013 to be proper (it is proper, one should/ought to)\n \u2013 to be permitted [to] (it is allowed [to])\nIrregular future active participles.\nThe future active participle is normally formed by removing the \"\u2013um\" from the supine, and adding a \"\u2013\u016brus\".

Raised in New England by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott, she grew up among many well-known intellectuals of the day, including Margaret Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. Encouraged by her family, Alcott began writing from an early age.\nAlcott's family experienced financial hardship, and while Alcott took on various jobs to help support the family from an early age, she also sought to earn money by writing. In the 1860s she began to achieve critical success for her writing with the publication of \"Hospital Sketches\", a book based on her service as a nurse in the American Civil War. Early in her career, she sometimes used pen names such as A. M. Barnard, under which she wrote lurid short stories and sensation novels for adults. \"Little Women\" was one of her first successful novels and has been adapted for film and television. It is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters, Abigail May Alcott Nieriker, Elizabeth Sewall Alcott, and Anna Alcott Pratt.\nAlcott was an abolitionist and a feminist and remained unmarried throughout her life. She also spent her life active in reform movements such as temperance and women's suffrage. During the last eight years of her life she raised the daughter of her deceased sister. She died from a stroke in Boston on March 6, 1888, just two days after her father's death and was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Louisa May Alcott has been the subject of numerous biographies, novels, and a documentary, and has influenced other writers and public figures such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Theodore Roosevelt.\nEarly life.\nBirth and early childhood.\nLouisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, in Germantown, now part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents were transcendentalist and educator Amos Bronson Alcott and social worker Abigail May. Alcott was the second of four daughters, with Anna as the eldest and Elizabeth and May as the youngest. Alcott was named after her mother's sister, Louisa May Greele, who had died four years earlier. After Alcott's birth, Bronson kept a record of her development, noting her strong will, which she may have inherited from her mother's May side of the family. He described her as \"fit for the scuffle of things\".\nThe family moved to Boston in 1834, where Alcott's father established the experimental Temple School and met with other transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Bronson participated in child-care but often failed to provide income, creating conflict in the family. At home and in school he taught morals and improvement, while Abigail emphasized imagination and supported Alcott's writing at home. With all the commotion going on at the time writing helped her handle her emotions. Alcott was often tended by her father's friend Elizabeth Peabody, and later she frequently visited Temple School during the day.\nAlcott kept a journal from an early age. Bronson and Abigail often read it and left short messages for her on her pillow. She was a tomboy who preferred boys' games and preferred to be friends with boys or other tomboys. She wanted to play sports with the boys at school but was not allowed to.\nAlcott was primarily educated by her father, who established a strict schedule and believed in \"the sweetness of self-denial.\" When Alcott was still too young to attend school, Bronson taught her the alphabet by forming the letter shapes with his body and having her repeat their names. For a time she was educated by Sophia Foord, whom she would later eulogize. She was also instructed in biology and Native American history by Thoreau, who was a naturalist, while Emerson mentored her in literature. Alcott had a particular fondness for Thoreau and Emerson; as a young girl, they were both \"sources of romantic fantasies for her.\" Her favorite authors included Harriet Beecher Stowe, Sir Walter Scott, Fredericka Bremer, Thomas Carlyle, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Goethe, and John Milton, Friedrich Schiller, and Germaine de Staele.\nHosmer Cottage.\nIn 1840, after several setbacks with Temple School and a brief stay in Scituate, the Alcotts moved to Hosmer Cottage in Concord. Emerson, who had convinced Bronson to move his family to Concord, paid rent for the family, who were often in need of financial help. While living there, Alcott and her sisters befriended the Hosmer, Goodwin, Emerson, Hawthorne, and Channing children, who lived nearby. The Hosmer and Alcott children put on plays and often included other children. Alcott and Anna also attended school at the Concord Academy, though for a time Alcott attended a school for younger children held at the Emerson house. At eight years-old, Alcott wrote her first poem, \"To the First Robin\". When she showed the poem to her mother, Abigail was pleased.\nIn October 1842 Bronson returned from a visit to schools in England and brought Charles Lane and Henry Wright with him to live at Hosmer Cottage, while Bronson and Lane made plans to establish a \"New Eden\". The children's education was undertaken by Lane, who implemented a strict schedule. Alcott disliked Lane and found the new living arrangements difficult.\nFruitlands and Hillside.\nIn 1843 Bronson and Lane established Fruitlands, a utopian community, in Harvard, Massachusetts, where the family were to live. Alcott later described these early years in a newspaper sketch titled \"Transcendental Wild Oats\", reprinted in \"Silver Pitchers\" (1876), which relates the family's experiment in \"plain living and high thinking\" at Fruitlands. There, Alcott enjoyed running outdoors and found happiness in writing poetry about her family, elves, and spirits. She later reflected with distaste on the amount of work she had to do outside of her lessons. She also enjoyed playing with Lane's son William and often put on fairy-tale plays or performances of Charles Dickens's stories. She read works by Dickens, Plutarch, Lord Byron, Maria Edgeworth, and Oliver Goldsmith.\nDuring the demise of Fruitlands, the Alcotts discussed whether or not the family should separate. Alcott recorded this in her journal and expressed her unhappiness should they separate. After the collapse of Fruitlands in early 1844, the family rented in nearby Still River, where Alcott attended public school and wrote and directed plays that her sisters and friends performed.\nIn April 1845 the family returned to Concord, where they bought a home they called Hillside with money Abigail inherited from her father. Here, Alcott and her sister Anna attended a school run by John Hosmer after a period of home education. The family again lived near the Emersons, and Alcott was granted open access to the Emerson library, where she read Carlyle, Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe. In the summer of 1848 sixteen-year-old Alcott opened a school of twenty students in a barn near Hillside. Her students consisted of the Emerson, Channing, and Alcott children.\nThe two oldest Alcott girls continued acting in plays written by Alcott. While Anna preferred portraying calm characters, Alcott preferred the roles of villains, knights, and sorcerers. These plays later inspired \"Comic Tragedies\" (1893). The family struggled without income beyond the girls' sewing and teaching. Eventually, some friends arranged a job for Abigail and three years after moving into Hillside, the family moved to Boston. Hillside was sold to Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1852. Alcott described the three years she spent at Concord as a child as the \"happiest of her life.\"\nBoston.\nWhen the Alcott family moved to the South End of Boston in 1848, Alcott had work as a teacher, seamstress, governess, domestic helper, and laundress, to earn money for the family. Together, Alcott and her sister taught a school in Boston, though Alcott disliked teaching. Her sisters also supported the family by working as seamstresses, while their mother took on social work among the Irish immigrants. Elizabeth and May were able to attend public school, though Elizabeth later left school to undertake the housekeeping. Due to financial pressures, writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Alcott. In 1849 she created a family newspaper, the \"Olive Leaf,\" named after the local \"Olive Branch.\" The family newspaper included stories, poems, articles, and housekeeping advice. It was later renamed to \"The Portfolio\". She also wrote her first novel, \"The Inheritance,\" which was published posthumously and based on \"Jane Eyre\". Alcott, who was driven to escape poverty, wrote, \"I wish I was rich, I was good, and we were all a happy family this day.\"\nEarly adulthood.\nLife in Dedham.\nAbigail ran an intelligence office to help the destitute find employment. When James Richardson came to Abigail in the winter of 1851 seeking a companion for his frail sister and elderly father who would also be willing to do light housekeeping, Alcott volunteered to serve in the house filled with books, music, artwork, and good company on Highland Avenue. Alcott may have imagined the experience as something akin to being a heroine in a Gothic novel, as Richardson described their home in a letter as stately but decrepit.Richardson's sister, Elizabeth, was 40 years old and suffered from neuralgia. She was shy and did not seem to have much use for Alcott. Instead, Richardson spent hours reading her poetry and sharing his philosophical ideas with her. She reminded Richardson that she was hired to be Elizabeth's companion and expressed that she was tired of listening to his \"philosophical, metaphysical, and sentimental rubbish.\" Richardson's response was to assign her more laborious duties, including chopping wood, scrubbing the floors, shoveling snow, drawing water from the well, and blacking his boots.\nAlcott quit after seven weeks, when neither of the two girls her mother sent to replace her decided to take the job. As she walked from Richardson's home to Dedham station, she opened the envelope he handed her with her pay. One account states that she was so unsatisfied with the four dollars she found inside that she mailed the money back to him in contempt. Another account states that Bronson may have returned the money himself and rebuked Richardson. Alcott later wrote a slightly fictionalized account of her time in Dedham titled \"How I Went Out To Service\", which she submitted to Boston publisher James T. Fields. Fields rejected the piece, telling Alcott that she had no future as a writer.\nEarly publications.\nIn September 1851 Alcott's poem \"Sunlight\" appeared in \"Peterson's Magazine\" under the name Flora Fairchild, making it her first successful publication. 1852 marked the publication of her first story, \"The Rival Painters: A Tale of Rome\", which was published in the \"Olive Branch\". In 1854 she attended The Boston Theatre, where she was given a pass to attend free of charge. She published her first book, \"Flower Fables,\" in 1854; the book was a selection of tales she originally told to Ellen Emerson, daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Lidian Emerson had read the stories and encouraged Alcott to publish them. Though she was pleased, Alcott hoped to eventually shift her writing \"from fairies and fables to men and realities\". She also wrote \"The Rival Prima Donnas\", a play adaptation of her story with the same title.\nIn 1855 the Alcotts moved to Walpole, New Hampshire, where Alcott and Anna participated in the Walpole Amateur Dramatic Company. Alcott was praised for her \"superior histrionic ability\". At the end of the theater season, Alcott, encouraged by the success of \"Flower Fables\", began writing \"Christmas Elves\", a collection of Christmas stories illustrated by May Alcott. In November Alcott traveled to Boston and attempted to publish the collection while living with a relative. November was too late in the year to publish Christmas books and Alcott was unable to publish \"The Christmas Elves\". She then wrote and published \"The Sisters' Trial\", a story about four women who were based on the Alcott sisters.\nFamily changes.\nAlcott returned to Walpole in mid-1856 to find her sister Elizabeth ill with scarlet fever. Alcott helped nurse Elizabeth, and when she was not nursing helped with the housekeeping and wrote. Alcott prepared to publish \"Beach Bubbles\" that year, but the book was rejected. By the end of the year she was writing for the \"Olive Branch\", the \"Ladies Enterprise\", \"The Saturday Evening Gazette\", and the \"Sunday News\". Alcott again lived in Boston for a time, where she met Julia Ward Howe and Frank Sanborn. In the summer of 1857 Alcott and Anna rejoined the Walpole Amateur Dramatic Company and sought to entertain Elizabeth with stories about their acting. The family later visited Swampscott in an effort to boost Elizabeth's health, which was poor from effects of the scarlet fever, but it did not improve. During this time Alcott read \"The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\" by Elizabeth Gaskell and found inspiration from Bront\u00eb's life. \nThe family moved back to Concord in September 1857, where the Alcotts rented while Bronson repaired Orchard House. During that time, the two oldest Alcott sisters organized the Concord Dramatic Union. Elizabeth Alcott died on March 14, 1858, when she was twenty-three. Three weeks later, Anna became engaged to John Pratt, a man she met in the Concord Dramatic Union. Alcott experienced depression about these events and considered Elizabeth's death and Anna's engagement catalysts to breaking up their sisterhood. After the family moved into Orchard House in July 1858, Alcott again returned to Boston to find employment. Unable to find work and filled with despair, Alcott contemplated suicide by drowning, but she decided to \"take Fate by the throat and shake a living out of her.\" She eventually received an offer to work as a governess for invalid Alice Lovering, which she accepted.\nLater years.\nCivil War service.\nAs an adult, Alcott was an abolitionist, temperance advocate, and feminist. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Alcott wanted to enlist in the Union Army but could not because she was a woman. Instead, she sewed uniforms and waited until she reached the minimum age for army nurses at thirty years old. Soon after turning thirty in 1862, Alcott applied to the U. S. Sanitary Commission, run by Dorothea Dix, and on December 11 was assigned to work in the Union Hotel Hospital in Georgetown, Washington, D. C. When she left, Bronson felt as if he was \"sending [his] only son to the war\". When she arrived, she discovered that conditions in the hospital were poor, with over-crowded and filthy quarters, bad food, unstable beds, and insufficient ventilation. Diseases such as scarlet fever, chicken pox, measles, and typhus were rampant among the patients. Alcott's duties included cleaning wounds, feeding the men, assisting with amputations, dressing wounds, and later assigning patients to their wards. She also entertained patients by reading aloud and putting on skits. She served as a nurse for six weeks in 1862\u20131863. She intended to serve three months, but contracted typhoid fever and became critically ill partway through her service. In late January Bronson traveled to the hospital and took Alcott to Concord to recover.\nLulu Nieriker.\nAlcott nursed her mother Abigail, who was dying, in 1877 while writing \"Under the Lilacs\" (1878). Alcott also became ill and close to dying, so the family moved in with Anna Alcott Pratt, who had recently purchased Thoreau's house with Alcott's financial support. After Abigail's death in November, Alcott and Bronson permanently moved into Anna's house. Her sister May was living in London at the time and married Ernest Nieriker four months later. May became pregnant and was due to deliver her child near the end of 1879. Though Alcott wanted to travel to Paris to see May in time for the delivery, she decided against it because her health was poor. On December 29 May died from complications developed after childbirth, and in September 1880 Alcott assumed the care of her niece, Lulu, who was named after her. Nieriker sent the news to Emerson and asked him to share it with Bronson and his daughters. Only Alcott was at home when Emerson arrived; she guessed the news before he told her and shared it with Bronson and Anna after he left. During the grief that followed May's death, Alcott and her father Bronson coped by writing poetry. In a letter to her friend Maria S. Porter, Alcott wrote, \"Of all the griefs in my life, and I have had many, this is the bitterest.\" It was at this time that she completed \"\" (1880).\nAlcott sometimes hired a nanny when her poor health made it difficult to care for Lulu. While raising Lulu, she published few works. Among her published works at this time are the volumes of \"Lulu's Library\" (1886\u20131889), collections of stories written for her niece Lulu. When Bronson suffered a stroke in 1882, Alcott became his caretaker. In the years that followed she alternated between living in Concord, Boston, and Nonquitt. In June 1884 Alcott sold Orchard House, which the family was no longer living in.\nDecline and death.\nAlcott suffered from chronic health problems in her later years, including vertigo, dyspepsia, headaches, fatigue, and pain in the limbs, diagnosed as neuralgia in her lifetime. When conventional medicines did not alleviate her pain, she tried mind-cure treatments, homeopathy, hypnotism, and Christian Science. Her ill health has been attributed to mercury poisoning, morphine intake, intestinal cancer, or meningitis. Alcott herself cited mercury poisoning as the cause of her sickness. When she contracted typhoid fever during her American Civil War service, she was treated with calomel, which is a compound containing mercury. Dr. Norbert Hirschhorn and Dr. Ian Greaves suggest that Alcott's chronic health problems may have been associated with an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, possibly because mercury exposure compromised her immune system. An 1870 portrait of Alcott shows her cheeks to be flushed, perhaps with the butterfly rash that is often characteristic of lupus. The suggested diagnosis, based on Alcott's journal entries, cannot be proved.\nAs Alcott's health declined, she often lived at Dunreath Place, a convalescent home run by Dr. Rhoda Lawrence for which she had provided financial support in the past. Eventually a doctor advised Alcott to stop writing to preserve her health. In 1887 she legally adopted Anna's son, John Pratt, and made him heir to her royalties, then created a will that left her money to her remaining family. Alcott visited Bronson at his deathbed on March 1, 1888, and expressed the wish that she could join him in death. On March 3, the day before her father died, she suffered a stroke and went unconscious, in which state she remained until her death on March 6, 1888. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, near Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau, on a hillside now known as Authors' Ridge. Her niece Lulu was eight years old when Alcott died and was cared for by Anna Alcott Pratt for two years before reuniting with her father in Europe.\nLiterary success.\nWorks.\nIn 1859 Alcott began writing for the \"Atlantic Monthly\". Encouraged by Sanborn and Moncure Conway, Alcott revised and published the letters she wrote while serving as a nurse in the Boston anti-slavery paper \"Commonwealth,\" later collecting them as \"Hospital Sketches\" (1863, republished with additions in 1869). She planned to travel to South Carolina to teach freed slaves and write letters she could later publish, but she was too ill to travel and abandoned the plan. Soon after the success of \"Hospital Sketches,\" Alcott published her novel \"Moods\" (1864), based on her own experience with and stance on \"woman's right to selfhood.\" Alcott struggled to find a publisher because the novel was long. After abridgments, \"Moods\" was published and popular. In 1882 Alcott changed the end. While touring Europe in 1870, she was displeased to find out that her publisher released a new edition without her approval.\nAlcott began editing the children's magazine \"Merry's Museum\" to help pay off family debts incurred while she toured Europe as the companion of wealthy invalid Anna Weld in 1865\u201366. Though Alcott disliked editing the magazine, she became its main editor in 1867. Around the same time, Alcott's publisher, Thomas Niles, asked her to write a book especially for girls. She was hesitant to write it because she felt she knew more about boys than she did about girls, but she eventually set to work on her semi-autobiographical novel \"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy\" (1868). After publishing Little Women she, and her sister May, moved to Europe. Alcott developed a close relationship with the young Polish revolutionary Ladislas Wisniewski during her European tour with Weld. She met him in Vevey, where he taught her French and she taught him English. She detailed a romance between herself and Wisniewski but later took it out. Alcott identified Wisniewski as one of the models for the character Laurie in \"Little Women\". Her other model for Laurie was fifteen-year-old Alfred Whitman, who she met shortly before the death of her sister Elizabeth and with whom she corresponded for several years afterward. She based the heroine Jo on herself, and other characters were based on people from Alcott's life. Later Niles asked Alcott to write a second part. Also known as \"Good Wives\" (1869), it follows the March sisters into adulthood and marriage.\nIn 1870 Alcott joined May and a friend on a European tour. Though numerous publishers requested new stories, Alcott wrote little while in Europe, instead preferring to rest. Meanwhile, rumors began to spread that she had died from diphtheria. She eventually described their travels in \"Shawl Straps\" (1872). While in Europe, Alcott began writing \"Little Men\" after finding out that her brother-in-law, John Pratt, had died. She was driven to write the book to provide financial support for her sister Anna and her two sons. Alcott felt that she \"must be a father now\" to her nephews. After she left Europe, the book was released the day she arrived in Boston. Alcott took seven years to complete \"Jo's Boys\" (1886), her sequel to \"Little Men\". She began the book in 1879 but discontinued it after her sister May's death in December. Alcott resumed work on the novel in 1882 after Mary Mapes Dodge of \"St. Nicholas\" asked for a new serial. \"Jo's Boys\" (1886) completed the \"March Family Saga\", Alcott's best-known books. The general popularity of her first few published works surprised Alcott. Throughout her career as a writer, she shied away from public attention, sometimes acting as a servant when fans came to her house.\nCritical reception.\nBefore her death, Alcott asked her sister Anna Pratt to destroy her letters and journals; Anna destroyed some and gave the remaining ones to family friend Ednah Dow Cheney. In 1889 Cheney was the first person to undergo a deep study of Alcott's life, compiling the journals and letters to publish \"Louisa May Alcott: Her Life, Letters, and Journals.\" The compilation has been published multiple times since then. Cheney also published \"Louisa May Alcott: The Children's Friend,\" which focused on Alcott's appeal to children. Other various compilations of Alcott's letters were published in the following decades. In 1909 Belle Moses wrote \"Louisa May Alcott, Dreamer and Worker: A Study of Achievement,\" which established itself as the \"first major biography\" about Alcott. Katharine S. Anthony's \"Louisa May Alcott,\" written in 1938, was the first biography to focus on Alcott's psychology. A comprehensive biography about Alcott was not written until Madeleine B. Stern's 1950 \"Louisa May Alcott\". In the 1960s and 1970s, feminist analysis of Alcott's fiction increased; analysis of her works also focused on the contrast between her domestic and sensation fiction.\nMartha Saxton's 1978 \"Alcott May: A Modern Biography of Louisa May Alcott\" depicts Alcott's life in a manner that Karen Halttunen, a professor of History and American Studies at the University of Southern California, called \"controversial\". Alcott biographer Ruth K. MacDonald considered Saxton's biography to be excessively psychoanalytical, portraying Alcott as a victim to her family. MacDonald also praised Saxton's description of Alcott's acquaintance with several intellectuals of the time. MacDonald praised Sarah Elbert's 1984 biography \"A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott and Little Women\" for its combination of Saxton's psychological perspective and Madelon Bedell's larger discussion of the Alcott family from \"The Alcotts: Biography of a Family\". She also stated that the biography could use more analysis of Alcott's works. Kate Beaird Meyers of the University of Tulsa felt that the 1987 version, entitled \"A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott's Place in American Culture\", \"is much more sophisticated\" because Elbert drew upon other scholars and placed Alcott within American literature. Alcott scholar Daniel Shealy compiled and edited \"Alcott in Her Own Time\". Roberta Trites called it \"fascinating and thorough\", though she said it needed more background information about the essayists, while fellow Alcott scholar Gregory Eiselein praised Shealy's use of original accounts. Trites called Harriet Reisen's biography \"Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women\" \"far more balanced than some of her predecessors['] in that ... she follows John Matteson's lead in demonstrating how emotionally complex the relationship was between Alcott's parents and their daughters.\" She was referring to John Matteson's \"Eden's Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father\", which won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Taylor Barnes of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" generally praised Reisen's biography but wrote that its \"microscopic examination\" of Alcott's life becomes confusing. Cornelia Meigs's 1934 biography \"Invincible Alcott: The Story of the Author of Little Women\" won the Newbery Medal. \"Critical Insights: Louisa May Alcott\", edited by Gregory Eiselein and Anne K. Phillips, contains a series of essays discussing Alcott's life and literature.\nGenres and style.\nSensation and adult fiction.\nAlcott preferred writing sensation stories and novels more than domestic fiction, confiding in her journal, \"I fancy 'lurid' things\". They were influenced by the works of other writers such as Goethe, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. The stories follow themes of incest, murder, suicide, psychology, secret identities, and sensuality. Her characters are often involved in opium experimentation or mind control and sometimes experience insanity, with males and females contending for dominance. The female characters push back against the Cult of Domesticity and explore its counter ideals, Real Womanhood. Important to Alcott's income because they paid well, these sensation stories were published in \"The Flag of Our Union\", \"Frank Leslie's Chimney Corner\", and \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\". Her thrillers were usually published anonymously or with the pseudonym A. M. Barnard. J. R. Elliott of \"The Flag\" repeatedly asked her to contribute pieces under her own name, but she continued using pseudonyms. Louisa May Alcott scholar Leona Rostenberg suggests that she published these stories under pseudonyms to preserve her reputation as an author of realistic and juvenile fiction. Researching for his dissertation in 2021, doctorate candidate Max Chapnick discovered a possible new pseudonym, E. H. Gould. Chapnick found a story referenced in Alcott's personal records in the \"Olive Branch,\" published under the name E.H. Gould. While Chapnick is uncertain if the pseudonym conclusively belongs to Alcott, other stories he found include references to people and places in her life.\nAmerican studies professor Catherine Ross Nickerson credits Alcott with creating one of the earliest works of detective fiction in American literature\u2014preceded only by Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" and his other Auguste Dupin stories\u2014with her 1865 thriller \"V.V., or Plots and Counterplots.\" The story, which she published anonymously, concerns a Scottish aristocrat who tries to prove that a mysterious woman has killed his fianc\u00e9e and cousin. The detective on the case, Antoine Dupres, is a parody of Poe's Dupin who is less concerned with solving the crime than in setting up a way to reveal the solution with a dramatic flourish. Alcott's gothic thrillers remained undiscovered until the 1940s and were not published in collections until the 1970s.\nAlcott's adult novels were not as popular as she wished them to be. They lack the optimism of her juvenile fiction and explore difficult marriages, women's rights, and conflict between men and women.\nJuvenile and domestic fiction.\nAlcott had little interest in writing for children, but saw it as a good financial opportunity. She felt that writing children's literature was tedious. Alcott biographer Ruth K. MacDonald suggests that Alcott's hesitance to write children's novels may have arisen from the societal perception that writing for children was a means by which poor women made money. Her juvenile fiction portrays both women who fit Victorian ideals of domesticity and women who have careers and decide to remain single. In her domestic stories she focuses on women and children as characters, and some of the adult characters discuss social reform, such as women's rights. The child protagonists are often flawed, and the stories include didactics. Though her juvenile fiction is largely based on her childhood, she does not focus on the poverty her family experienced.\nStyle.\nAlcott's writing has been described as \"episodic\" because the narratives are broken into distinctive events with little connective tissue. Her early work is modeled after Charlotte Bront\u00eb's work. The style and ideas that appear in her writing are also influenced by her transcendental upbringing, both promoting and satirizing transcendentalist ideals. As a realist writer, she explores social conflict; she also promotes advanced views on education. She incorporates slang into her characters' dialogue, which contemporaries criticized her for doing. She also uses intertextuality by frequently including references to plays and well-known statues, among other things.\nSocial involvement.\nAbolition.\nWhen Alcott was young, her family served as station masters on the Underground Railroad and housed fugitive slaves. Alcott was unable to dictate when she first became an abolitionist, suggesting that she became an abolitionist either when William Lloyd Garrison was attacked for his abolitionist efforts or when a young African-American boy saved her from drowning in Frog Pond. Both events occurred when Alcott was a child. Alcott formed her abolitionist ideas, in part, from listening to conversations between her father and uncle Samuel May or between her father and Emerson. She was also inspired by the abolitionism of Rev. Theodore Parker, Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, and William Lloyd Garrison, with whom she was acquainted. She also knew Frederick Douglass in adulthood. As a young woman Alcott joined her family in teaching African-Americans how to read and write. When John Brown was executed on December 2, 1859, for his involvement in anti-slavery, Alcott described it as \"the execution of Saint John the Just\". Alcott attended several abolitionist rallies, including a rally at Tremont Temple that advocated for Thomas Simm's freedom. She also believed in the full integration of African-Americans into society. She wrote multiple anti-slavery stories such as \"M. L.\", \"My Contraband\", and \"An Hour\". According to Sarah Elbert, Alcott's anti-slavery stories show her regard for Harriet Beecher Stowe's anti-slavery works.\nWomen's rights.\nAfter her mother's death, Alcott committed to following her example by actively advocating for women's suffrage. In 1877, Alcott helped found the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston. She read and admired the Declaration of Sentiments published by the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights, and became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts in a school board election on March 9, 1879. She encouraged other Concord women to vote and was disappointed when few did. Alcott became a member of the National Congress of the Women of the United States while attending the Woman's Congress in 1875 and later recounted it in \"My Girls\". She gave speeches advocating women's rights and eventually convinced her publisher Thomas Niles to publish suffragist writings. She advocated for dress and diet reform as well as for women to receive college education, sometimes signing her letters with \"Yours for reform of all kinds\". Alcott also signed the \"Appeal to Republican Women in Massachusetts\", a petition that attempted to secure the vote for women.\nAlong with Elizabeth Stoddard, Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and others, Alcott was part of a group of female authors during the Gilded Age who addressed women's issues in a modern and candid manner. Their works were, as one newspaper columnist of the period commented, \"among the decided 'signs of the times'\". Alcott also joined Sorosis, where members discussed health and dress reform for women, and she helped found Concord's first temperance society. Between 1874 and 1887 many of her works, published in the \"Woman's Journal\", discussed women's suffrage. Her essay \"Happy Women\" in \"The New York Ledger\" argued that women did not need to marry. She explained her spinsterhood in an interview with Louise Chandler Moulton, saying, \"I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man's soul put by some freak of nature into a woman's body... because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.\" After her death, Alcott was memorialized during a suffragist meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nLegacy.\nAlcott homes.\nThe Alcotts' Concord home, Orchard House, where the family lived for 25 years and where \"Little Women\" was written, is open to the public and pays homage to the Alcotts' by focusing on public education and historic preservation. The Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association, which was founded in 1911 and runs the museum, allows tourists to walk through the house and learn about Louisa May Alcott. The Alcotts' earlier home in Concord, Hillside, is open as part of the Minute Man National Historic Park. Her Boston home is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.\nFilm and television.\n\"Little Women\" inspired film versions in 1933, 1949, 1994, 2018, and 2019. The novel also inspired television series in 1958, 1970, 1978, and 2017, anime versions in 1981 and 1987, and a 2005 musical. It also inspired a BBC Radio 4 version in 2017. \"Little Men\" inspired film versions in 1934, 1940, and 1998, and was the basis for a 1998 television series. Other films based on Louisa May Alcott novels and stories are \"An Old-Fashioned Girl\" (1949), \"The Inheritance\" (1997), and \"An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving\" (2008). \"Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind 'Little Women'\" aired in 2009 as part of the \"American Masters\" biography series and was aired a second time on May 20, 2018. It was directed by Nancy Porter and written by Harriet Reisen, who wrote the script based on primary sources from Alcott's life. The documentary, which starred Elizabeth Marvel as Alcott, was shot onsite for the events it covered. It included interviews with Louisa May Alcott scholars, including Sarah Elbert, Daniel Shealy, Madeleine Stern, Leona Rostenberg, and Geraldine Brooks.\nPopular culture.\nAlcott appears as the protagonist in the \"Louisa May Alcott Mystery\" series, written by Jeanne Mackin under the pseudonym Anna Maclean. In book one, \"Alcott and the Missing Heiress\", Alcott is living in Boston in 1854 and writing her sensation stories. She finds the dead body of a fictional friend who recently returned from a honeymoon and solves the mystery. \"Alcott and the Country Bachelor\" follows Alcott as she visits cousins in Walpole, New Hampshire, in the summer of 1855 and discovers the dead body of an immigrant bachelor. Alcott decides to solve what she suspects is a murder. In \"Alcott and the Crystal Gazer\", the third and final book in the series, she solves the murder of a divination woman in Boston in 1855.\n\"The Lost Summer of Louisa May Alcott\" by Kelly O'Connor McNees takes place in Walpole in 1855 and follows Alcott as she finds romance. Alcott falls in love with a fictional character named Joseph Singer but chooses to pursue a profession as a writer instead of continuing her relationship with Singer. In \"Only Gossip Prospers\" by Lorraine Tosiello, Alcott visits New York City shortly after publishing \"Little Women\". During her trip, Alcott seeks to remain anonymous because of an unrevealed circumstance from her past. \"The Revelation of Louisa May Alcott\" by Michaela MacColl takes place in 1846; young Alcott solves the murder of a slave catcher. Patricia O'Brien's \"The Glory Cloak\" tells of a fictional friendship between Alcott and Clara Barton, Alcott's work in the Civil War, and her relationships with Thoreau and her father. The epistolary novel \"The Bee and the Fly: The Improbable Correspondence of Louisa May Alcott and Emily Dickinson,\" by Lorraine Tosiello and Jane Cavolina, follows a fictional correspondence between Alcott and Dickinson, which Dickinson initiates in 1861 by asking Alcott for literary advice.\nInfluence.\nVarious modern writers have been influenced and inspired by Alcott's work, particularly \"Little Women\". As a child, Simone de Beauvoir felt a connection to Jo and expressed, \"Reading this novel gave me an exalted sense of myself. Cynthia Ozick calls herself a \"Jo-of-the-future\", and Patti Smith explains, \"[I]t was Louisa May Alcott who provided me with a positive view of my female destiny.\" Writers influenced by Louisa May Alcott include Ursula K. Le Guin, Barbara Kingsolver, Gail Mazur, Anna Quindlen, Anne Lamott, Sonia Sanchez, Ann Petry, Gertrude Stein, and J. K. Rowling. U. S. president Theodore Roosevelt said he \"worshiped\" Louisa May Alcott's books. Other politicians who have been impacted by her books include Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Hillary Clinton, and Sandra Day O'Connor. Alcott was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1996.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18004", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18004", "title": "LALR parser", "text": "Type of parser in computer science\nIn computer science, an LALR parser (look-ahead, left-to-right, rightmost derivation parser) is part of the compiling process where human readable text is converted into a structured representation to be read by computers. An LALR parser is a software tool to process (parse) text into a very specific internal representation that other programs, such as compilers, can work with. This process happens according to a set of production rules specified by a formal grammar for a computer language. \nAn LALR parser is a simplified version of a canonical LR parser.\nThe LALR parser was invented by Frank DeRemer in his 1969 PhD dissertation, \"Practical Translators for LR(k) languages\", in his treatment of the practical difficulties at that time of implementing LR(1) parsers. He showed that the LALR parser has more language recognition power than the LR(0) parser, while requiring the same number of states as the LR(0) parser for a language that can be recognized by both parsers. This makes the LALR parser a memory-efficient alternative to the LR(1) parser for languages that are LALR. It was also proven that there exist LR(1) languages that are not LALR. Despite this weakness, the power of the LALR parser is sufficient for many mainstream computer languages, including Java, though the reference grammars for many languages fail to be LALR due to being ambiguous.\nThe original dissertation gave no algorithm for constructing such a parser given a formal grammar. The first algorithms for LALR parser generation were published in 1973. In 1982, DeRemer and Tom Pennello published an algorithm that generated highly memory-efficient LALR parsers. LALR parsers can be automatically generated from a grammar by an LALR parser generator such as Yacc or GNU Bison. The automatically generated code may be augmented by hand-written code to augment the power of the resulting parser.\nHistory.\nIn 1965, Donald Knuth invented the LR parser (Left to Right, Rightmost derivation). The LR parser can recognize any deterministic context-free language in linear-bounded time. Rightmost derivation has very large memory requirements and implementing an LR parser was impractical due to the limited memory of computers at that time. To address this shortcoming, in 1969, Frank DeRemer proposed two simplified versions of the LR parser, namely the Look-Ahead LR (LALR) and the Simple LR parser (SLR) that had much lower memory requirements at the cost of less language-recognition power, with the LALR parser being the most-powerful alternative. In 1977, memory optimizations for the LR parser were invented but still the LR parser was less memory-efficient than the simplified alternatives.\nIn 1979, Frank DeRemer and Tom Pennello announced a series of optimizations for the LALR parser that would further improve its memory efficiency. Their work was published in 1982.\nOverview.\nGenerally, the LALR parser refers to the LALR(1) parser, just as the LR parser generally refers to the LR(1) parser. The \"(1)\" denotes one-token lookahead, to resolve differences between rule patterns during parsing. Similarly, there is an LALR(2) parser with two-token lookahead, and LALR(\"k\") parsers with \"k\"-token lookup, but these are rare in actual use. The LALR parser is based on the LR(0) parser, so it can also be denoted LALR(1)\u00a0=\u00a0LA(1)LR(0) (1 token of lookahead, LR(0)) or more generally LALR(\"k\")\u00a0=\u00a0LA(\"k\")LR(0) (k tokens of lookahead, LR(0)). There is in fact a two-parameter family of LA(\"k\")LR(\"j\") parsers for all combinations of \"j\" and \"k\", which can be derived from the LR(\"j\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"k\") parser, but these do not see practical use.\nAs with other types of LR parsers, an LALR parser is quite efficient at finding the single correct bottom-up parse in a single left-to-right scan over the input stream, because it does not need to use backtracking. Being a lookahead parser by definition, it always uses a lookahead, with LALR(1) being the most-common case.\nRelation to other parsers.\nLR parsers.\nThe LALR(1) parser is less powerful than the LR(1) parser, and more powerful than the SLR(1) parser, though they all use the same production rules. The simplification that the LALR parser introduces consists in merging rules that have identical kernel item sets, because during the LR(0) state-construction process the lookaheads are not known. This reduces the power of the parser because not knowing the lookahead symbols can confuse the parser as to which grammar rule to pick next, resulting in reduce/reduce conflicts. All conflicts that arise in applying a LALR(1) parser to an unambiguous LR(1) grammar are reduce/reduce conflicts. The SLR(1) parser performs further merging, which introduces additional conflicts.\nThe standard example of an LR(1) grammar that cannot be parsed with the LALR(1) parser, exhibiting such a reduce/reduce conflict, is:\n S \u2192 a E c\n \u2192 a F d\n \u2192 b F c\n \u2192 b E d\n E \u2192 e\n F \u2192 e\nIn the LALR table construction, two states will be merged into one state and later the lookaheads will be found to be ambiguous. The one state with lookaheads is:\nAn LR(1) parser will create two different states (with non-conflicting lookaheads), neither of which is ambiguous. In an LALR parser this one state has conflicting actions (given lookahead c or d, reduce to E or F), a \"reduce/reduce conflict\"; the above grammar will be declared ambiguous by a LALR parser generator and conflicts will be reported.\nTo recover, this ambiguity is resolved by choosing E, because it occurs before F in the grammar. However, the resultant parser will not be able to recognize the valid input sequence codice_1, since the ambiguous sequence codice_2 is reduced to codice_3, rather than the correct codice_4, but codice_5 is not in the grammar.\nLL parsers.\nThe LALR(\"j\") parsers are incomparable with LL(\"k\") parsers: for any \"j\" and \"k\" both greater than 0, there are LALR(\"j\") grammars that are not LL(\"k\") grammars and vice versa. In fact, it is undecidable whether a given LL(1) grammar is LALR(\"k\") for any formula_1.\nDepending on the presence of empty derivations, a LL(1) grammar can be equal to a SLR(1) or a LALR(1) grammar. If the LL(1) grammar has no empty derivations it is SLR(1) and if all symbols with empty derivations have non-empty derivations it is LALR(1). If symbols having only an empty derivation exist, the grammar may or may not be LALR(1).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18008", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18008", "title": "Language center", "text": "Speech processing areas of the brain\nIn neuroscience and psychology, the term language center refers collectively to the areas of the brain which serve a particular function for speech processing and production. Language is a core system that gives humans the capacity to solve difficult problems and provides them with a unique type of social interaction. Language allows individuals to attribute symbols (e.g. words or signs) to specific concepts, and utilize them through sentences and phrases that follow proper grammatical rules. Finally, speech is the mechanism by which language is orally expressed.\nInformation is exchanged in a larger system, including language-related regions. These regions are connected by white matter fiber tracts that make possible the transmission of information between regions. The white matter fiber bunches were recognized to be important for language production after suggesting that it is possible to make a connection between multiple language centers. The three classical language areas that are involved in language production and processing are Broca's and Wernicke's areas, and the angular gyrus.\nBroca's area.\nBroca's Area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was analyzing speech problems resulting from injuries to this brain region, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Paul Broca had a patient called Leborgne who could only pronounce the word \"tan\" when speaking. After working with another patient with a similar impairment, Paul Broca concluded that damage in the inferior frontal gyrus affected articulate language.\nBroca's area is well known for being the syntactic processing \"center\". It has been known of since Paul Broca associated speech production with an area in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus, which he called \"Broca's area\". Although this area is in charge of speech production, the specific details of its role in the language system is unknown. However, it is involved in phonological, semantic, and syntactic processing, and working memory. The anterior region of Broca's area is involved in semantic processing, while the posterior region involves phonological processing (Bohsali, 2015). The whole of Broca's area has been shown to have a higher activation while doing reading tasks than other types of tasks.\nIn a simple explanation of speech production, this area approaches phonological word representation chronologically divided into segments of syllables which then is sent to different motor areas where they are converted into a phonetic code. The study of how this area produces speech has been made with paradigms using both single and complex words.\nBroca's area is correlated with phonological segmentation, unification, and syntactic processing, all connected to linguistic information. This area, although it synchronizes the transformation of information within cortical systems involved in spoken word production, does not contribute to the production of single words. The inferior frontal lobe is the one in charge of word production.\nFurthermore, Broca's area is structurally related to the thalamus, and both are engaged in language processing. The connectivity between both areas is two thalamic nuclei, the pulvinar, and the ventral nucleus, which are involved in language processing and linguistic functions similar to BA 44 and 45 in Broca's area. Pulvinar is connected to many frontal regions of the frontal cortex and the ventral nucleus is involved in speech production. The frontal speech regions of the brain have been shown to participate in speech sound perception.\nBroca's Area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.\nWernicke's area.\nWernicke's area was named for German doctor Carl Wernicke, who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into aphasias (loss of ability to speak). This area of the brain is involved in language comprehension. Therefore, Wernicke's area is for understanding oral language. Besides Wernicke's area, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and angular gyrus (AG) participate in language comprehension. Therefore, language comprehension is not located in a specific area. Contrarily, it involves large regions of the inferior parietal lobe and left temporal.\nWhile the finale of speech production is a sequence of muscle movements, activating knowledge about the sequence of phonemes (consonants and vowel speech sounds) that creates a word is a phonological retrieval. Wernicke's area contributes to phonological retrieval. All speech production tasks (e.g. word retrieval, repetition, and reading aloud) require phonological retrieval. The phonological retrieval system involved in speech repetition is the auditory phoneme perception system, and the visual letter perception system is the one that serves for reading aloud. Communicative speech production entails a phase preceding phonological retrieval. Speech comprehension involves mapping sequences of phonemes onto word meaning.\nAngular gyrus.\nThe angular gyrus is important in processing concrete and abstract concepts. It also has a role in verbal working memory during retrieval of verbal information and in visual memory when turning written language into spoken language. The left AG is activated in semantic processing that requires concept retrieval and conceptual integration. Also, the left AG is activated during problems of multiplication and addition requiring return of arithmetic factors in verbal memory. Thus, it is involved in verbal coding of numbers.\nInsular cortex.\nThe insula is implicated in speech and language, taking part in functional and structural connections with motor neurons, linguistic, sensory, and limbic brain areas. The knowledge about the function of the insula in speech production comes from different studies with patients having speech apraxia. These studies have led researchers to learn of the involvement of different parts of the insula. These parts are the left anterior insula, which is related to speech production, and the bilateral anterior insula, which is involved in misleading speech comprehension.\nSpeech and language disorders.\nMany different sources state that the study of the brain, and therefore, language disorders, originated in the 19th century, and linguistic analysis of those disorders began in the 20th century. Studying language impairments in the brain after injuries aids in comprehending how the brain works and changes after an injury. When this happens, the brain's impairment is referred to as \"aphasia\". Lesions to Broca's Area results primarily in disruptions to speech production; damage to Wernicke's Area, which is located in the lower part of the temporal lobe, leads mainly to disruptions in speech reception.\nThere are numerous distinctive ways in which language can be affected. Phonemic paraphasia, an attribute of conduction aphasia and Wernicke aphasia, does not involve speech comprehension impairment. Instead, it requires speech production damage, where the desired phonemes are selected erroneously or in an incorrect sequence. Therefore, although Wernicke's aphasia, a combination of phonological retrieval and semantic systems impairment, affects speech comprehension, it also involves speech production damage. Phonemic paraphasia and anomia (impaired word retrieval) are the results of phonological retrieval impairment.\nAnother lesion that involves impairment in language production and processing is apraxia of speech, a difficulty synchronizing articulators essential for speech production. This type of lesion is located in the superior pre-central gyrus of the insula, and is more likely to occur in patients with Broca's aphasia. Lesions of the dominant ventral anterior nucleus may result in semantic paraphasias and difficulty in word-finding. Also, individuals with thalamic lesions experience difficulties linking semantic concepts with correct phonological representations in word production.\nDyslexia is a language-processing disorder. It involves learning difficulties in reading, writing, word recognition, phonological recording, numeracy, and spelling. Even with access to appropriate intervention during childhood, these difficulties continue throughout the lifespan. Children are diagnosed with dyslexia when more than one factor affecting learning (e.g. reading or writing) appears. When children diagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in concrete cognitive functioning, this is called an assumption of specificity, and it aids in the diagnosis of dyslexia.\nSome characteristics that distinguish dyslexics include errors in phonological processing, causing misreading of unfamiliar words, affecting comprehension; inadequacy of working memory, affecting speaking, reading, and writing; errors in oral reading; oral skill difficulties such as expressing oneself; and writing skill problems in areas such as spelling and general expression. Dyslexics not only experience learning difficulties, but also other secondary characteristics, such as having difficulties in organizing, planning, social interaction, motor skills, visual perception, and short-term memory. These characteristics affect personal and academic life.\nDysarthria is a motor speech disorder caused by damage to the central and/or peripheral nervous system, and it is related to degenerative neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dysarthria can be caused by a mechanical difficulty in the vocal cords, or neurological disease, and produces abnormal articulation of phonemes, such as using \"b\" in place of \"p\". Apraxic dysarthria is a type of dyspraxia that involves distortions of words. This type is related to facial apraxia and motor aphasia if Broca's area is involved.\nCurrent scientific consensus.\nImprovement in computer technology in the late 20th century has allowed a better understanding of the correlation between brain and language, in the disorders that this entails. This improvement has permitted better visualization of the brain structure in high-resolution three-dimensional images. It has also allowed observation of brain activity through blood flow (Dronkers, Ivanova, &amp; Baldo, 2017).\nNew medical imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI have allowed researchers to generate pictures showing which areas of a living brain are active at a given time. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) localizes specific brain functions to particular brain regions by observing blood flow in different areas. This technique shows the location and magnitude of neural activity variations, influenced by external stimulation and fluctuation at rest. MRI is a technique that was developed in the 20th century to observe brain activity in healthy and abnormal brains. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is a technique used for tracking white matter bundles \"in vivo\", and gives information on the internal fibrous structure via measuring water diffusion. This diffusion tensor is used for inferring white matter connectivity.\nIn the past, research was primarily based on observations of loss of ability resulting from damage to the cerebral cortex. In the modern era, medical imaging has represented a radical step forward for research on speech processing. It is now known that a whole series of relatively large brain areas are involved in speech processing. In more recent research, subcortical regions (those lying below the cerebral cortex such as the putamen and the caudate nucleus), as well as the pre-motor areas (BA 6), have received increased attention. It is now generally assumed that the following structures of the cerebral cortex near the primary and secondary auditory cortices play a fundamental role in speech processing:\nThe left hemisphere is usually dominant in right-handed people, although bilateral activations are not uncommon in syntactic processing. It is now accepted that the right hemisphere plays an important role in the processing of suprasegmental acoustic features like prosody, which is \"the rhythmic and melodic variations in speech\". There are two types of prosodic information: emotional prosody (right hemisphere), which is the emotional content of the speech, and linguistic prosody (left hemisphere), the syntactic and thematic structure of the speech.\nMost areas of speech processing develop in the second year of life in the dominant half (hemisphere) of the brain, which often (though not necessarily) corresponds to the opposite of the dominant hand. 98% of right-handed people are left-hemisphere dominant, and the majority of left-handed people are as well.\nComputerized tomographic (CT) scans are a technique dating to the 1970s, and produce low spatial resolution, but are capable of providing the location of injuries \"in vivo\". Also, Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) techniques have contributed to the understanding that specific brain regions have different roles when supporting speech processing. VLSM has been used to observe complex language functions supported by multiple brain regions. VBM is a helpful technique for analyzing language impairments related to neurodegenerative disease.\nOlder models.\nThe differentiation of speech production into only two large sections of the brain (i.e. Broca's and Wernicke's areas), which was accepted long before medical imaging techniques, is now considered outdated. Broca's area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was the analysis of speech problems resulting from injuries to this brain region, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Lesions to Broca's Area result primarily in disruptions to speech production. \nDamage to Wernicke's area, located in the lower part of the temporal lobe, mainly leads to speech reception disruptions. This area was named for German doctor Carl Wernicke, who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into aphasias (loss of ability to speak).\nBroca's area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. It contrasts with the drag force, which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction. Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity, but it may act in any direction perpendicular to the flow.\nIf the surrounding fluid is air, the force is called an aerodynamic force. In water or any other liquid, it is called a hydrodynamic force.\nDynamic lift is distinguished from other kinds of lift in fluids. Aerostatic lift or buoyancy, in which an internal fluid is lighter than the surrounding fluid, does not require movement and is used by balloons, blimps, dirigibles, boats, and submarines. Planing lift, in which only the lower portion of the body is immersed in a liquid flow, is used by motorboats, surfboards, windsurfers, sailboats, and water-skis.\nOverview.\nA fluid flowing around the surface of a solid object applies a force on it. It does not matter whether the object is moving through a stationary fluid (e.g. an aircraft flying through the air) or whether the object is stationary and the fluid is moving (e.g. a wing in a wind tunnel) or whether both are moving (e.g. a sailboat using the wind to move forward). Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. Lift is always accompanied by a drag force, which is the component of the surface force parallel to the flow direction.\nLift is mostly associated with the wings of fixed-wing aircraft, although it is more widely generated by many other streamlined bodies such as propellers, kites, helicopter rotors, racing car wings, maritime sails, wind turbines, and by sailboat keels, ship's rudders, and hydrofoils in water. Lift is also used by flying and gliding animals, especially by birds, bats, and insects, and even in the plant world by the seeds of certain trees.\nWhile the common meaning of the word \"lift\" assumes that lift opposes weight, lift can be in any direction with respect to gravity, since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity. When an aircraft is cruising in straight and level flight, the lift opposes gravity. However, when an aircraft is climbing, descending, or banking in a turn the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical. Lift may also act as downforce on the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft at the top of an aerobatic loop, and on the horizontal stabiliser of an aircraft. Lift may also be largely horizontal, for instance on a sailing ship.\nThe lift discussed in this article is mainly in relation to airfoils; marine hydrofoils and propellers share the same physical principles and work in the same way, despite differences between air and water such as density, compressibility, and viscosity.\nThe flow around a lifting airfoil is a fluid mechanics phenomenon that can be understood on essentially two levels: There are mathematical theories, which are based on established laws of physics and represent the flow accurately, but which require solving equations. And there are physical explanations without math, which are less rigorous. Correctly explaining lift in these qualitative terms is difficult because the cause-and-effect relationships involved are subtle. A comprehensive explanation that captures all of the essential aspects is necessarily complex. There are also many simplified explanations, but all leave significant parts of the phenomenon unexplained, while some also have elements that are simply incorrect.\nSimplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil.\nAn airfoil is a streamlined shape that is capable of generating significantly more lift than drag. A flat plate can generate lift, but not as much as a streamlined airfoil, and with somewhat higher drag.\nMost simplified explanations follow one of two basic approaches, based either on Newton's laws of motion or on Bernoulli's principle.\nExplanation based on flow deflection and Newton's laws.\nAn airfoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is lift.\nAs the airflow approaches the airfoil it is curving upward, but as it passes the airfoil it changes direction and follows a path that is curved downward. According to Newton's second law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then Newton's third law requires the air to exert an upward force on the airfoil; thus a reaction force, lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.\nThe downward turning of the flow is not produced solely by the lower surface of the airfoil, and the air flow above the airfoil accounts for much of the downward-turning action.\nThis explanation is correct but it is incomplete. It does not explain how the airfoil can impart downward turning to a much deeper swath of the flow than it actually touches. Furthermore, it does not mention that the lift force is exerted by pressure differences, and does not explain how those pressure differences are sustained.\nControversy regarding the Coand\u0103 effect.\nSome versions of the flow-deflection explanation of lift cite the Coand\u0103 effect as the reason the flow is able to follow the convex upper surface of the airfoil. The conventional definition in the aerodynamics field is that the \"Coand\u0103 effect\" refers to the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent surface that curves away from the flow, and the resultant entrainment of ambient air into the flow.\nMore broadly, some consider the effect to include the tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface, not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet. It is in this broader sense that the Coand\u0103 effect is used by some popular references to explain why airflow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil. This is a controversial use of the term \"Coand\u0103 effect\"; the flow following the upper surface simply reflects an absence of boundary-layer separation, thus it is not an example of the Coand\u0103 effect. Regardless of whether this broader definition of the \"Coand\u0103 effect\" is applicable, calling it the \"Coand\u0103 effect\" does not provide an explanation, it just gives the phenomenon a name.\nThe ability of a fluid flow to follow a curved path is not dependent on shear forces, viscosity of the fluid, or the presence of a boundary layer. Air flowing around an airfoil, adhering to both upper and lower surfaces, and generating lift, is accepted as a phenomenon in inviscid flow.\nExplanations based on an increase in flow speed and Bernoulli's principle.\nThere are two common versions of this explanation, one based on \"equal transit time\", and one based on \"obstruction\" of the airflow.\nFalse explanation based on equal transit-time.\nThe \"equal transit time\" explanation starts by arguing that the flow over the upper surface is faster than the flow over the lower surface because the path length over the upper surface is longer and must be traversed in equal transit time. Bernoulli's principle states that under certain conditions increased flow speed is associated with reduced pressure. It is concluded that the reduced pressure over the upper surface results in upward lift.\nWhile it is true that the flow speeds up, a serious flaw in this explanation is that it does not correctly explain what causes the flow to speed up. The longer-path-length explanation is incorrect. No difference in path length is needed, and even when there is a difference, it is typically much too small to explain the observed speed difference. This is because the assumption of equal transit time is wrong when applied to a body generating lift. There is no physical principle that requires equal transit time in all situations and experimental results confirm that for a body generating lift the transit times are not equal. In fact, the air moving past the top of an airfoil generating lift moves \"much\" \"faster\" than equal transit time predicts. The much higher flow speed over the upper surface can be clearly seen in this animated flow visualization.\nObstruction of the airflow.\nLike the equal transit time explanation, the \"obstruction\" or \"streamtube pinching\" explanation argues that the flow over the upper surface is faster than the flow over the lower surface, but gives a different reason for the difference in speed. It argues that the curved upper surface acts as more of an obstacle to the flow, forcing the streamlines to pinch closer together, making the streamtubes narrower. When streamtubes become narrower, conservation of mass requires that flow speed must increase. Reduced upper-surface pressure and upward lift follow from the higher speed by Bernoulli's principle, just as in the equal transit time explanation. Sometimes an analogy is made to a venturi nozzle, claiming the upper surface of the wing acts like a venturi nozzle to constrict the flow.\nOne serious flaw in the obstruction explanation is that it does not explain how streamtube pinching comes about, or why it is greater over the upper surface than the lower surface. For conventional wings that are flat on the bottom and curved on top this makes some intuitive sense, but it does not explain how flat plates, symmetric airfoils, sailboat sails, or conventional airfoils flying upside down can generate lift, and attempts to calculate lift based on the amount of constriction or obstruction do not predict experimental results. Another flaw is that conservation of mass is not a satisfying physical reason why the flow would speed up. Effectively explaining the acceleration of an object requires identifying the force that accelerates it.\nIssues common to both versions of the Bernoulli-based explanation.\nA serious flaw common to all the Bernoulli-based explanations is that they imply that a speed difference can arise from causes other than a pressure difference, and that the speed difference then leads to a pressure difference, by Bernoulli's principle. This implied one-way causation is a misconception. The real relationship between pressure and flow speed is a mutual interaction. As explained below under a more comprehensive physical explanation, producing a lift force requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The Bernoulli-only explanations do not explain how the pressure differences in the vertical direction are sustained. That is, they leave out the flow-deflection part of the interaction.\nAlthough the two simple Bernoulli-based explanations above are incorrect, there is nothing incorrect about Bernoulli's principle or the fact that the air goes faster on the top of the wing, and Bernoulli's principle can be used correctly as part of a more complicated explanation of lift.\nBasic attributes of lift.\nLift is a result of pressure differences and depends on angle of attack, airfoil shape, air density, and airspeed.\nPressure differences.\nPressure is the normal force per unit area exerted by the air on itself and on surfaces that it touches. The lift force is transmitted through the pressure, which acts perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Thus, the net force manifests itself as pressure differences. The direction of the net force implies that the average pressure on the upper surface of the airfoil is lower than the average pressure on the underside.\nThese pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved airflow. When a fluid follows a curved path, there is a pressure gradient perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside. This direct relationship between curved streamlines and pressure differences, sometimes called the streamline curvature theorem, was derived from Newton's second law by Leonhard Euler in 1754:\nformula_1\nThe left side of this equation represents the pressure difference perpendicular to the fluid flow. On the right side of the equation, \u03c1 is the density, v is the velocity, and R is the radius of curvature. This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create larger pressure differentials and that for straight flow (R \u2192 \u221e), the pressure difference is zero.\nAngle of attack.\nThe angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the oncoming airflow. A symmetrical airfoil generates zero lift at zero angle of attack. But as the angle of attack increases, the air is deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases, resulting in more lift. For small angles, a symmetrical airfoil generates a lift force roughly proportional to the angle of attack.\nAs the angle of attack increases, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the wing; there is less deflection downward so the airfoil generates less lift. The airfoil is said to be stalled.\nAirfoil shape.\nThe maximum lift force that can be generated by an airfoil at a given airspeed depends on the shape of the airfoil, especially the amount of camber (curvature such that the upper surface is more convex than the lower surface, as illustrated at right). Increasing the camber generally increases the maximum lift at a given airspeed.\nCambered airfoils generate lift at zero angle of attack. When the chord line is horizontal, the trailing edge has a downward direction and since the air follows the trailing edge it is deflected downward. When a cambered airfoil is upside down, the angle of attack can be adjusted so that the lift force is upward. This explains how a plane can fly upside down.\nFlow conditions.\nThe ambient flow conditions which affect lift include the fluid density, viscosity and speed of flow. Density is affected by temperature, and by the medium's acoustic velocity \u2013 i.e. by compressibility effects.\nAir speed and density.\nLift is proportional to the density of the air and approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed. Lift also depends on the size of the wing, being generally proportional to the wing's area projected in the lift direction. In calculations it is convenient to quantify lift in terms of a lift coefficient based on these factors.\nBoundary layer and profile drag.\nNo matter how smooth the surface of an airfoil seems, any surface is rough on the scale of air molecules. Air molecules flying into the surface bounce off the rough surface in random directions relative to their original velocities. The result is that when the air is viewed as a continuous material, it is seen to be unable to slide along the surface, and the air's velocity relative to the airfoil decreases to nearly zero at the surface (i.e., the air molecules \"stick\" to the surface instead of sliding along it), something known as the no-slip condition. Because the air at the surface has near-zero velocity but the air away from the surface is moving, there is a thin boundary layer in which air close to the surface is subjected to a shearing motion. The air's viscosity resists the shearing, giving rise to a shear stress at the airfoil's surface called skin friction drag. Over most of the surface of most airfoils, the boundary layer is naturally turbulent, which increases skin friction drag.\nUnder usual flight conditions, the boundary layer remains attached to both the upper and lower surfaces all the way to the trailing edge, and its effect on the rest of the flow is modest. Compared to the predictions of inviscid flow theory, in which there is no boundary layer, the attached boundary layer reduces the lift by a modest amount and modifies the pressure distribution somewhat, which results in a viscosity-related pressure drag over and above the skin friction drag. The total of the skin friction drag and the viscosity-related pressure drag is usually called the profile drag.\nStalling.\nAn airfoil's maximum lift at a given airspeed is limited by boundary-layer separation. As the angle of attack is increased, a point is reached where the boundary layer can no longer remain attached to the upper surface. When the boundary layer separates, it leaves a region of recirculating flow above the upper surface, as illustrated in the flow-visualization photo at right. This is known as the \"stall\", or \"stalling\". At angles of attack above the stall, lift is significantly reduced, though it does not drop to zero. The maximum lift that can be achieved before stall, in terms of the lift coefficient, is generally less than 1.5 for single-element airfoils and can be more than 3.0 for airfoils with high-lift slotted flaps and leading-edge devices deployed.\nBluff bodies.\nThe flow around bluff bodies \u2013 i.e. without a streamlined shape, or stalling airfoils \u2013 may also generate lift, in addition to a strong drag force. This lift may be steady, or it may oscillate due to vortex shedding. Interaction of the object's flexibility with the vortex shedding may enhance the effects of fluctuating lift and cause vortex-induced vibrations. For instance, the flow around a circular cylinder generates a K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street: vortices being shed in an alternating fashion from the cylinder's sides. The oscillatory nature of the flow produces a fluctuating lift force on the cylinder, even though the net (mean) force is negligible. The lift force frequency is characterised by the dimensionless Strouhal number, which depends on the Reynolds number of the flow.\nFor a flexible structure, this oscillatory lift force may induce vortex-induced vibrations. Under certain conditions \u2013 for instance resonance or strong spanwise correlation of the lift force \u2013 the resulting motion of the structure due to the lift fluctuations may be strongly enhanced. Such vibrations may pose problems and threaten collapse in tall man-made structures like industrial chimneys.\nIn the Magnus effect, a lift force is generated by a spinning cylinder in a freestream. Here the mechanical rotation acts on the boundary layer, causing it to separate at different locations on the two sides of the cylinder. The asymmetric separation changes the effective shape of the cylinder as far as the flow is concerned such that the cylinder acts like a lifting airfoil with circulation in the outer flow.\nA more comprehensive physical explanation.\nAs described above under \"Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil\", there are two main popular explanations: one based on downward deflection of the flow (Newton's laws), and one based on pressure differences accompanied by changes in flow speed (Bernoulli's principle). Either of these, by itself, correctly identifies some aspects of the lifting flow but leaves other important aspects of the phenomenon unexplained. A more comprehensive explanation involves both downward deflection and pressure differences (including changes in flow speed associated with the pressure differences), and requires looking at the flow in more detail.\nLift at the airfoil surface.\nThe airfoil shape and angle of attack work together so that the airfoil exerts a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must then exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.\nThe net force exerted by the air occurs as a pressure difference over the airfoil's surfaces. Pressure in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense, so that pressure must always be thought of as pushing, and never as pulling. The pressure thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces. The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing the pressure on the wing's upper surface and increasing the pressure on the lower surface. The pressure on the lower surface pushes up harder than the reduced pressure on the upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.\nThe pressure difference which results in lift acts directly on the airfoil surfaces; however, understanding how the pressure difference is produced requires understanding what the flow does over a wider area.\nThe wider flow around the airfoil.\nAn airfoil affects the speed and direction of the flow over a wide area, producing a pattern called a \"velocity field\". When an airfoil produces lift, the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, the flow above and below the airfoil is deflected downward leaving the air far behind the airfoil in the same state as the oncoming flow far ahead. The flow above the upper surface is sped up, while the flow below the airfoil is slowed down. Together with the upward deflection of air in front and the downward deflection of the air immediately behind, this establishes a net circulatory component of the flow. The downward deflection and the changes in flow speed are pronounced and extend over a wide area, as can be seen in the flow animation on the right. These differences in the direction and speed of the flow are greatest close to the airfoil and decrease gradually far above and below. All of these features of the velocity field also appear in theoretical models for lifting flows.\nThe pressure is also affected over a wide area, in a pattern of non-uniform pressure called a \"pressure field\". When an airfoil produces lift, there is a diffuse region of low pressure above the airfoil, and usually a diffuse region of high pressure below, as illustrated by the isobars (curves of constant pressure) in the drawing. The pressure difference that acts on the surface is just part of this pressure field.\nMutual interaction of pressure differences and changes in flow velocity.\nThe non-uniform pressure exerts forces on the air in the direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. The direction of the force is different at different locations around the airfoil, as indicated by the block arrows in the \"pressure field around an airfoil\" figure. Air above the airfoil is pushed toward the center of the low-pressure region, and air below the airfoil is pushed outward from the center of the high-pressure region.\nAccording to \"Newton's second law\", a force causes air to accelerate in the direction of the force. Thus the vertical arrows in the accompanying pressure field diagram indicate that air above and below the airfoil is accelerated, or turned downward, and that the non-uniform pressure is thus the cause of the downward deflection of the flow visible in the flow animation. To produce this downward turning, the airfoil must have a positive angle of attack or have sufficient positive camber. Note that the downward turning of the flow over the upper surface is the result of the air being pushed downward by higher pressure above it than below it. Some explanations that refer to the \"Coand\u0103 effect\" suggest that viscosity plays a key role in the downward turning, but this is false. (see above under \"Controversy regarding the Coand\u0103 effect\").\nThe arrows ahead of the airfoil indicate that the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, and the arrows behind the airfoil indicate that the flow behind is deflected upward again, after being deflected downward over the airfoil. These deflections are also visible in the flow animation.\nThe arrows ahead of the airfoil and behind also indicate that air passing through the low-pressure region above the airfoil is sped up as it enters, and slowed back down as it leaves. Air passing through the high-pressure region below the airfoil is slowed down as it enters and then sped back up as it leaves. Thus the non-uniform pressure is also the cause of the changes in flow speed visible in the flow animation. The changes in flow speed are consistent with \"Bernoulli's principle\", which states that in a steady flow without viscosity, lower pressure means higher speed, and higher pressure means lower speed.\nThus changes in flow direction and speed are directly caused by the non-uniform pressure. But this cause-and-effect relationship is not just one-way; it works in both directions simultaneously. The air's motion is affected by the pressure differences, but the existence of the pressure differences depends on the air's motion. The relationship is thus a mutual, or reciprocal, interaction: Air flow changes speed or direction in response to pressure differences, and the pressure differences are sustained by the air's resistance to changing speed or direction. A pressure difference can exist only if something is there for it to push against. In aerodynamic flow, the pressure difference pushes against the air's inertia, as the air is accelerated by the pressure difference. This is why the air's mass is part of the calculation, and why lift depends on air density.\nSustaining the pressure difference that exerts the lift force on the airfoil surfaces requires sustaining a pattern of non-uniform pressure in a wide area around the airfoil. This requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed according to Bernoulli's principle. The pressure differences and the changes in flow direction and speed sustain each other in a mutual interaction. The pressure differences follow naturally from Newton's second law and from the fact that flow along the surface follows the predominantly downward-sloping contours of the airfoil. And the fact that the air has mass is crucial to the interaction.\nHow simpler explanations fall short.\nProducing a lift force requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli's principle. Each of the simplified explanations given above in Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil falls short by trying to explain lift in terms of only one or the other, thus explaining only part of the phenomenon and leaving other parts unexplained.\nQuantifying lift.\nPressure integration.\nWhen the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface is known, determining the total lift requires adding up the contributions to the pressure force from local elements of the surface, each with its own local value of pressure. The total lift is thus the integral of the pressure, in the direction perpendicular to the farfield flow, over the airfoil surface.\n formula_2\nwhere:\nThe above lift equation neglects the skin friction forces, which are small compared to the pressure forces.\nBy using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral, we obtain an expression for the pressure drag \"Dp\" (which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and, if the wing is three-dimensional, the induced drag). If we use the spanwise vector j, we obtain the side force \"Y\".\nformula_3\nThe validity of this integration generally requires the airfoil shape to be a closed curve that is piecewise smooth.\nLift coefficient.\nLift depends on the size of the wing, being approximately proportional to the wing area. It is often convenient to quantify the lift of a given airfoil by its \"lift coefficient\" formula_4, which defines its overall lift in terms of a unit area of the wing.\nIf the value of formula_4 for a wing at a specified angle of attack is given, then the lift produced for specific flow conditions can be determined:\nformula_6\nwhere \nMathematical theories of lift.\nMathematical theories of lift are based on continuum fluid mechanics, assuming that air flows as a continuous fluid. Lift is generated in accordance with the fundamental principles of physics, the most relevant being the following three principles:\nBecause an airfoil affects the flow in a wide area around it, the conservation laws of mechanics are embodied in the form of partial differential equations combined with a set of boundary condition requirements which the flow has to satisfy at the airfoil surface and far away from the airfoil.\nTo predict lift requires solving the equations for a particular airfoil shape and flow condition, which generally requires calculations that are so voluminous that they are practical only on a computer, through the methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Determining the net aerodynamic force from a CFD solution requires \"adding up\" (integrating) the forces due to pressure and shear determined by the CFD over every surface element of the airfoil as described under \"pressure integration\".\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations (NS) provide the potentially most accurate theory of lift, but in practice, capturing the effects of turbulence in the boundary layer on the airfoil surface requires sacrificing some accuracy, and requires use of the Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations (RANS). Simpler but less accurate theories have also been developed.\nNavier\u2013Stokes (NS) equations.\nThese equations represent conservation of mass, Newton's second law (conservation of momentum), conservation of energy, the Newtonian law for the action of viscosity, the Fourier heat conduction law, an equation of state relating density, temperature, and pressure, and formulas for the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid.\nIn principle, the NS equations, combined with boundary conditions of no through-flow and no slip at the airfoil surface, could be used to predict lift with high accuracy in any situation in ordinary atmospheric flight. However, airflows in practical situations always involve turbulence in the boundary layer next to the airfoil surface, at least over the aft portion of the airfoil. Predicting lift by solving the NS equations in their raw form would require the calculations to resolve the details of the turbulence, down to the smallest eddy. This is not yet possible, even on the most powerful computer. So in principle the NS equations provide a complete and very accurate theory of lift, but practical prediction of lift requires that the effects of turbulence be modeled in the RANS equations rather than computed directly.\nReynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) equations.\nThese are the NS equations with the turbulence motions averaged over time, and the effects of the turbulence on the time-averaged flow represented by turbulence modeling (an additional set of equations based on a combination of dimensional analysis and empirical information on how turbulence affects a boundary layer in a time-averaged average sense). A RANS solution consists of the time-averaged velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil.\nThe amount of computation required is a minuscule fraction (billionths) of what would be required to resolve all of the turbulence motions in a raw NS calculation, and with large computers available it is now practical to carry out RANS calculations for complete airplanes in three dimensions. Because turbulence models are not perfect, the accuracy of RANS calculations is imperfect, but it is adequate for practical aircraft design. Lift predicted by RANS is usually within a few percent of the actual lift.\nInviscid-flow equations (Euler or potential).\nThe Euler equations are the NS equations without the viscosity, heat conduction, and turbulence effects. As with a RANS solution, an Euler solution consists of the velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil. While the Euler equations are simpler than the NS equations, they do not lend themselves to exact analytic solutions.\nFurther simplification is available through potential flow theory, which reduces the number of unknowns to be determined, and makes analytic solutions possible in some cases, as described below.\nEither Euler or potential-flow calculations predict the pressure distribution on the airfoil surfaces roughly correctly for angles of attack below stall, where they might miss the total lift by as much as 10\u201320%. At angles of attack above stall, inviscid calculations do not predict that stall has happened, and as a result they grossly overestimate the lift.\nIn potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be irrotational, i.e. that small fluid parcels have no net rate of rotation. Mathematically, this is expressed by the statement that the curl of the velocity vector field is everywhere equal to zero. Irrotational flows have the convenient property that the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function called a potential. A flow represented in this way is called potential flow.\nIn potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be incompressible. Incompressible potential-flow theory has the advantage that the equation (Laplace's equation) to be solved for the potential is linear, which allows solutions to be constructed by superposition of other known solutions. The incompressible-potential-flow equation can also be solved by conformal mapping, a method based on the theory of functions of a complex variable. In the early 20th century, before computers were available, conformal mapping was used to generate solutions to the incompressible potential-flow equation for a class of idealized airfoil shapes, providing some of the first practical theoretical predictions of the pressure distribution on a lifting airfoil.\nA solution of the potential equation directly determines only the velocity field. The pressure field is deduced from the velocity field through Bernoulli's equation.\nApplying potential-flow theory to a lifting flow requires special treatment and an additional assumption. The problem arises because lift on an airfoil in inviscid flow requires circulation in the flow around the airfoil (See \"Circulation and the Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem\" below), but a single potential function that is continuous throughout the domain around the airfoil cannot represent a flow with nonzero circulation. The solution to this problem is to introduce a branch cut, a curve or line from some point on the airfoil surface out to infinite distance, and to allow a jump in the value of the potential across the cut. The jump in the potential imposes circulation in the flow equal to the potential jump and thus allows nonzero circulation to be represented. However, the potential jump is a free parameter that is not determined by the potential equation or the other boundary conditions, and the solution is thus indeterminate. A potential-flow solution exists for any value of the circulation and any value of the lift. One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to impose the Kutta condition, which is that, of all the possible solutions, the physically reasonable solution is the one in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly. The streamline sketches illustrate one flow pattern with zero lift, in which the flow goes around the trailing edge and leaves the upper surface ahead of the trailing edge, and another flow pattern with positive lift, in which the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge in accordance with the Kutta condition.\nLinearized potential flow.\nThis is potential-flow theory with the further assumptions that the airfoil is very thin and the angle of attack is small. The linearized theory predicts the general character of the airfoil pressure distribution and how it is influenced by airfoil shape and angle of attack, but is not accurate enough for design work. For a 2D airfoil, such calculations can be done in a fraction of a second in a spreadsheet on a PC.\nCirculation and the Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem.\nWhen an airfoil generates lift, several components of the overall velocity field contribute to a net circulation of air around it: the upward flow ahead of the airfoil, the accelerated flow above, the decelerated flow below, and the downward flow behind.\nThe circulation can be understood as the total amount of \"spinning\" (or vorticity) of an inviscid fluid around the airfoil.\nThe Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem relates the lift per unit width of span of a two-dimensional airfoil to this circulation component of the flow. It is a key element in an explanation of lift that follows the development of the flow around an airfoil as the airfoil starts its motion from rest and a starting vortex is formed and left behind, leading to the formation of circulation around the airfoil. Lift is then inferred from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. This explanation is largely mathematical, and its general progression is based on logical inference, not physical cause-and-effect.\nThe Kutta\u2013Joukowski model does not predict how much circulation or lift a two-dimensional airfoil produces. Calculating the lift per unit span using Kutta\u2013Joukowski requires a known value for the circulation. In particular, if the Kutta condition is met, in which the rear stagnation point moves to the airfoil trailing edge and attaches there for the duration of flight, the lift can be calculated theoretically through the conformal mapping method.\nThe lift generated by a conventional airfoil is dictated by both its design and the flight conditions, such as forward velocity, angle of attack and air density. Lift can be increased by artificially increasing the circulation, for example by boundary-layer blowing or the use of blown flaps. In the Flettner rotor the entire airfoil is circular and spins about a spanwise axis to create the circulation.\nThree-dimensional flow.\nThe flow around a three-dimensional wing involves significant additional issues, especially relating to the wing tips. For a wing of low aspect ratio, such as a typical delta wing, two-dimensional theories may provide a poor model and three-dimensional flow effects can dominate. Even for wings of high aspect ratio, the three-dimensional effects associated with finite span can affect the whole span, not just close to the tips.\nWing tips and spanwise distribution.\nThe vertical pressure gradient at the wing tips causes air to flow sideways, out from under the wing then up and back over the upper surface. This reduces the pressure gradient at the wing tip, therefore also reducing lift. The lift tends to decrease in the spanwise direction from root to tip, and the pressure distributions around the airfoil sections change accordingly in the spanwise direction. Pressure distributions in planes perpendicular to the flight direction tend to look like the illustration at right. This spanwise-varying pressure distribution is sustained by a mutual interaction with the velocity field. Flow below the wing is accelerated outboard, flow outboard of the tips is accelerated upward, and flow above the wing is accelerated inboard, which results in the flow pattern illustrated at right.\nThere is more downward turning of the flow than there would be in a two-dimensional flow with the same airfoil shape and sectional lift, and a higher sectional angle of attack is required to achieve the same lift compared to a two-dimensional flow. The wing is effectively flying in a downdraft of its own making, as if the freestream flow were tilted downward, with the result that the total aerodynamic force vector is tilted backward slightly compared to what it would be in two dimensions. The additional backward component of the force vector is called lift-induced drag.\nThe difference in the spanwise component of velocity above and below the wing (between being in the inboard direction above and in the outboard direction below) persists at the trailing edge and into the wake downstream. After the flow leaves the trailing edge, this difference in velocity takes place across a relatively thin shear layer called a vortex sheet.\nHorseshoe vortex system.\nThe wingtip flow leaving the wing creates a tip vortex. As the main vortex sheet passes downstream from the trailing edge, it rolls up at its outer edges, merging with the tip vortices. The combination of the wingtip vortices and the vortex sheets feeding them is called the vortex wake.\nIn addition to the vorticity in the trailing vortex wake there is vorticity in the wing's boundary layer, called 'bound vorticity', which connects the trailing sheets from the two sides of the wing into a vortex system in the general form of a horseshoe. The horseshoe form of the vortex system was recognized by the British aeronautical pioneer Lanchester in 1907.\nGiven the distribution of bound vorticity and the vorticity in the wake, the Biot\u2013Savart law (a vector-calculus relation) can be used to calculate the velocity perturbation anywhere in the field, caused by the lift on the wing. Approximate theories for the lift distribution and lift-induced drag of three-dimensional wings are based on such analysis applied to the wing's horseshoe vortex system. In these theories, the bound vorticity is usually idealized and assumed to reside at the camber surface inside the wing.\nBecause the velocity is deduced from the vorticity in such theories, some authors describe the situation to imply that the vorticity is the cause of the velocity perturbations, using terms such as \"the velocity induced by the vortex\", for example. But attributing mechanical cause-and-effect between the vorticity and the velocity in this way is not consistent with the physics. The velocity perturbations in the flow around a wing are in fact produced by the pressure field.\nManifestations of lift in the farfield.\nIntegrated force/momentum balance in lifting flows.\nThe flow around a lifting airfoil must satisfy Newton's second law regarding conservation of momentum, both locally at every point in the flow field, and in an integrated sense over any extended region of the flow. For an extended region, Newton's second law takes the form of the \"momentum theorem for a control volume\", where a control volume can be any region of the flow chosen for analysis. The momentum theorem states that the integrated force exerted at the boundaries of the control volume (a surface integral), is equal to the integrated time rate of change (material derivative) of the momentum of fluid parcels passing through the interior of the control volume. For a steady flow, this can be expressed in the form of the net surface integral of the flux of momentum through the boundary.\nThe lifting flow around a 2D airfoil is usually analyzed in a control volume that completely surrounds the airfoil, so that the inner boundary of the control volume is the airfoil surface, where the downward force per unit span formula_12 is exerted on the fluid by the airfoil. The outer boundary is usually either a large circle or a large rectangle. At this outer boundary distant from the airfoil, the velocity and pressure are well represented by the velocity and pressure associated with a uniform flow plus a vortex, and viscous stress is negligible, so that the only force that must be integrated over the outer boundary is the pressure. The free-stream velocity is usually assumed to be horizontal, with lift vertically upward, so that the vertical momentum is the component of interest.\nFor the free-air case (no ground plane), the force formula_12 exerted by the airfoil on the fluid is manifested partly as momentum fluxes and partly as pressure differences at the outer boundary, in proportions that depend on the shape of the outer boundary, as shown in the diagram at right. For a flat horizontal rectangle that is much longer than it is tall, the fluxes of vertical momentum through the front and back are negligible, and the lift is accounted for entirely by the integrated pressure differences on the top and bottom. For a square or circle, the momentum fluxes and pressure differences account for half the lift each. For a vertical rectangle that is much taller than it is wide, the unbalanced pressure forces on the top and bottom are negligible, and lift is accounted for entirely by momentum fluxes, with a flux of upward momentum that enters the control volume through the front accounting for half the lift, and a flux of downward momentum that exits the control volume through the back accounting for the other half.\nThe results of all of the control-volume analyses described above are consistent with the Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem described above. Both the tall rectangle and circle control volumes have been used in derivations of the theorem.\nLift reacted by overpressure on the ground under an airplane.\nAn airfoil produces a pressure field in the surrounding air, as explained under \"The wider flow around the airfoil\" above. The pressure differences associated with this field die off gradually, becoming very small at large distances, but never disappearing altogether. Below the airplane, the pressure field persists as a positive pressure disturbance that reaches the ground, forming a pattern of slightly-higher-than-ambient pressure on the ground, as shown on the right. Although the pressure differences are very small far below the airplane, they are spread over a wide area and add up to a substantial force. For steady, level flight, the integrated force due to the pressure differences is equal to the total aerodynamic lift of the airplane and to the airplane's weight. According to Newton's third law, this pressure force exerted on the ground by the air is matched by an equal-and-opposite upward force exerted on the air by the ground, which offsets all of the downward force exerted on the air by the airplane. The net force due to the lift, acting on the atmosphere as a whole, is therefore zero, and thus there is no integrated accumulation of vertical momentum in the atmosphere, as was noted by Lanchester early in the development of modern aerodynamics.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He put an end to the Twenty Years' Anarchy, a period of great instability in the Byzantine Empire between 695 and 717, marked by the rapid succession of several emperors to the throne, along with ending the continual defeats and territorial losses the Byzantines had suffered during the 7th century. He also successfully defended the Empire against the invading Umayyads and forbade the veneration of icons.\nEarly life.\nLeo III was born in Germanikeia, Commagene, which is in modern Kahramanmara\u015f in Turkey. His original name was Konon (). Leo III was fluent in Arabic as his native language, and was described by Theophanes the Confessor as \"the Saracen-minded,\" although there is very little evidence that he was directly influenced by Islam.\nAfter the victory of Justinian II, Konon was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to Alania and Lazica to organize an alliance against the Umayyad caliphate under al-Walid I. According to the chronicle written by Theophanes the Confessor, Justinian wanted to get rid of Konon and took back the money that had been given to him to help advance Byzantine interests, thus leaving Konon stranded in Alania. The chronicle describes the mission as successful and Konon returning eventually to Justinian after crossing the Caucasus mountains in May with snowshoes and taking the fortress of Sideron, associated with the Tsebelda fortress, on the way.\nKonon was appointed commander (\"strat\u0113gos\") of the Anatolic Theme by Emperor Anastasius II. On his deposition, Konon joined with his colleague Artabasdos, the \"strat\u0113gos\" of the Armeniac Theme, in conspiring to overthrow the new Emperor Theodosius III, ostensibly in support of Anastasius. Artabasdos was betrothed to Konon's daughter Anna. In 717, Konon marched on Constantinople, capturing Theodosius' son at Nicomedia. He forced Theodosius to abdicate, promising safety for him and his family. Theodosius then became a monk at Ephesus. On 25 March, abandoning his allegiance to Anastasius, Konon was crowned by Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople as Emperor Leo III at the Hagia Sophia.\nSiege of Constantinople.\nThe new emperor was immediately forced to attend to the second Arab siege of Constantinople, which commenced in August of the same year. The Arabs were Umayyad forces sent by Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik and serving under his brother Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik. They had taken advantage of the civil discord in the Byzantine Empire to bring a force of 80,000 to 150,000 men and a massive fleet to the Bosphorus, intending to seize the Byzantine capital and destroy the Empire with a single overwhelming attack.\nCareful preparations, begun three years earlier under Anastasius II, and the stubborn resistance put up by Leo wore out the invaders. An important factor in the victory of the Byzantines was their use of Greek fire. The Arab forces also fell victim to Bulgarian reinforcements arriving to aid the Byzantines. Leo was allied with the Bulgarians but the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor was uncertain if they were still serving under Tervel of Bulgaria or his eventual successor Kormesiy of Bulgaria.\nFaced with the Bulgarian onslaught, the impenetrability of Constantinople's walls, and their own exhausted provisions, the Arabs were forced to abandon the siege in August 718. Sulayman had died the previous year, and his successor Umar II never made a second attempt to capture the city. The siege had lasted 12 months.\nReign.\nHaving thus saved the Empire from extinction, Leo proceeded to consolidate its administration, which in the previous years of anarchy had become completely disorganized. In 718 he suppressed a rebellion in Sicily. The following year saw the deposed Emperor Anastasius II raise an army and attempt to retake the throne, but he was captured and executed by Leo's government. The rebellion was the only serious threat to Leo's usurpation. Umayyad attacks under Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik continued in the form of yearly raids in eastern and central Asia Minor (see hatched area in figure), which affected communications, commerce and agricultural production. In 721, the city of Dalisandus was captured, followed by the fortresses of Kamachon and Ikonion in 723/724 and several frontier fortresses in 725. Caesarea (Cappadocia) was captured in 727, then Gangra in 728. The Byzantine counter-raids were generally of little strategic impact, although crucially a major invading force was destroyed in the Battle of Akroinon of 740. It was only during the Third Fitna of 744\u2013747, a civil war within the Umayyad Caliphate, that the regularity of attacks were temporarily interrupted.\nLeo secured the Empire's frontiers by inviting Slavic settlers into the depopulated districts and by restoring the army to efficiency. His military efforts were supplemented by his alliances with the Khazars and the Georgians. However, the Lombards exploited the Empire's difficulties beginning in 717, when the duke of Benevento captured Cumae, the duke of Spoleto captured Narni and Liutprand, King of the Lombards, occupied Classe in the Exarchate of Ravenna. Although Narni was never regained, Gregory II recovered Cumae and Liutprand withdrew from Classe. In 724 or 725, Leo increased taxes in Italy which Gregory opposed. This led to two plots to assassinate Gregory, the second of which was supported by Exarch Paul, but both were foiled by the Romans with the help of the Lombards of Benevento and Spoleto.\nLeo effected many political and ecclesiastical restructurings in order to bolster the authority of the Empire and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Since the end of the seventh century, imperial \"strat\u0113goi\" were sent to the theme of Sicily (which included Calabria), and in 732\u2013733 Leo deprived the church of Rome of the patrimony of St Peter in the theme, reallocating tax income that originally went to the church of Rome to the imperial administration (a large annual sum of 350 pounds of gold). However in 743, Constantine V compensated Pope Zachary for this loss by granting him the estates of Ninfa and Norma to the south of Rome. Between 732 and 754, the bishops of Illyricum, Crete, Sicily, Calabria and Naples (until 769) were transferred from the authority of Rome to Constantinople. The Isaurians in general saw the church and its patriarchs as subordinate to the imperial will.\nThe 740 Constantinople earthquake damaged the Walls of Constantinople, the restoration of which Leo paid for out of the imperial treasury, raising the City taxes by 81\u20443 per cent in order to do so, as was recorded on the land walls near the Sea of Marmara. The Empire of the eighth century was characterized by ruralization and depopulation, which along with the Arab invasions motivated Leo to undertake intense centralization and militarization, particularly involving the many fortresses and walls in towns such as Nicaea and Padyandus.\nLeo III died of dropsy on 18 June 741 and was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles.\nIconoclastic policies.\nLeo's most striking legislative reforms dealt with religious matters, especially iconoclasm (\"icon-breaking,\" therefore an iconoclast is an \"icon-breaker\"). After an apparently successful attempt to enforce the baptism of all Jews and Montanists in the empire (722), he issued a series of edicts against the veneration of images (726\u2013729).\nA revolt broke out in Greece under the leadership of Agallianos Kontoskeles, mainly on religious grounds, with a certain Kosmas being declared rival emperor. The imperial fleet quashed the uprising in 727 by way of Greek fire. In 730, Patriarch Germanus opted to resign rather than subscribe to iconoclasm; Leo replaced him with Anastasius, who willingly sided with the Emperor on the question of icons. Patriarch John V of Jerusalem along with John of Damascus fiercely opposed imperial iconoclasm, issuing a pamphlet entitled \"Adversus Constantinum Caballinum\". A later polemical version of the pamphlet attributes to Leo the saying, \"I am emperor and priest.\"\nIn the Italian Peninsula, the defiant attitude of Popes Gregory II and later Gregory III on behalf of image-veneration led to a fierce quarrel with the Emperor, with the \"Liber Pontificalis\" stating that Gregory II \"took up arms against the emperor as if against an enemy.\" In Rome, the population was more sympathetic to iconodulia, killing a pro-imperial duke and blinding another, while in Naples, iconoclasm was broadly well-received. A conflict between pro- and anti-imperial factions in the Exarchate of Ravenna led to the death of Exarch Paul. The struggle was accompanied by an armed outbreak in the Exarchate in 727, which Leo endeavoured to subdue by means of a large fleet. The new Exarch, Eutychius, disembarked in Naples but could not enter Rome and assert his authority. This led to an unexpected alliance between Liutprand and Eutychius against Gregory, who, however, managed to convince the King, appealing to his piety, to return north and the Exarch to put down a revolt in Etruria led by the usurper Tiberius Petasius. In response to the promulgation of stronger iconoclastic decrees in 730, Gregory II and Gregory III summoned councils in Rome to anathematize and excommunicate the iconoclasts (730, 732). Leo retaliated by making the aforementioned transferals in Southern Italy and Illyricum from the papal diocese to that of the Patriarch of Constantinople.\nAnalysis of Leo's iconoclasm.\nScholars offer various explanations for the ban on venerating icons c.\u2009730. On the basis of Patriarch Germanus' letters read at the 787 Second Council of Nicaea, which state that the bishops Constantine of Nakoleia and Thomas of Claudiopolis had forbidden the veneration of icons even before 730, some scholars argue that the alleged aniconism of the eastern part of the Empire, Leo's place of origin, motivated his policies. The phrase \"I am emperor and priest\" attributed to Leo by later iconodule polemicists represents the characteristically Isaurian imperial ascendancy over the church, which was rejected in the mid-9th century after Patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople purged the clergy of iconoclasts, asserting the autonomy of the church against the iconoclast emperor, Theophilos (r.\u2009829\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842). Others have discussed the mutual influence of Muslim and Byzantine iconoclasm, noting that Caliph Yazid II had issued an iconoclastic edict, also targeting his Christian subjects, already in 721.\nAccording to historian Marie-France Auz\u00e9py, these explanations are insufficient. She appeals to an explanation by Byzantine chroniclers, that a terrifying volcanic eruption at Thira in 726 was interpreted by Leo as a manifestation of God's wrath. In the Bible, God allows his people to fall to Babylonian captivity because of their idolatry. Thus, Auz\u00e9py says, the banning of the veneration of images was fundamentally a rejection of idolatry in order to ensure the survival of the Christian people of the Empire, a decision which was apparently vindicated by the abatement of the Arab and Bulgar threat during Leo's reign.\nSome scholars, such as Leslie Brubaker and John Haldon, doubt whether there was any active imperial involvement in iconoclasm at all, proposing instead that Leo made a qualified critique of the use of images in public spaces, likely leading to the adoption of a somewhat iconoclastic attitude among the clergy in the late 730s or early 740s. The notion that there was mass imperial persecution and destruction of images is dismissed as a later \"iconophile myth\". Brubaker and Haldon support this hypothesis by pointing to the absence of any reports of iconoclasm in several contemporary accounts, including those of Willibald, who travelled to Nicaea from 727 to 729, Germanus and even John of Damascus. The Venerable Bede does refer to a critique of images in Constantinople, and Germanus and John of Damascus say that the clergy was divided on the issue of iconoclasm, however there was no evidence of widespread support for the iconoclastic policies or of systematic removal of images under Leo. Brubaker and Haldon attribute a more moderate iconoclasm to Leo, \"It is quite possible that Leo did attempt to restrict the public display of certain types of image and to remove them from certain places in churches (near the altar and in the apse, for example) to avoid their receiving the honour due to God alone\", confirming this conclusion with the writings of Germanus and John of Damascus which appear to describe a kind of initial or moderate stage of iconoclasm.\nLegislation.\nLeo reformed the \"silention\", a type of restricted council instituted by Justinian I, transforming it into a special assembly in the Great Palace of Constantinople, in which the emperor would announce a solemn decision.\nLeo undertook a set of civil reforms including the abolition of the system of prepaying taxes which had weighed heavily upon the wealthier proprietors, the elevation of the serfs into a class of free tenants and the remodelling of family law, maritime law and criminal law, notably substituting mutilation for the death penalty in many cases. These punishments were contrary to the Roman legal tradition, and bear the influence of canon law. The new measures, which were embodied in a new code called the \"Ecloga\" (\"Selection\"), published in 741, met with some opposition on the part of the nobles and higher clergy. The \"Ecloga\" were a revision and abridgement of the sixth-century Code of Justinian. Leo's prologue to the \"Ecloga\" sets out his conception of law as requiring ethical significance founded upon God's will and divinely-sanctioned imperial authority. The authors of the legal codes of Basil I (r.\u2009867\u00a0\u2013\u00a0886) and Leo VI the Wise (r.\u2009886\u00a0\u2013\u00a0912) of the Macedonian dynasty formally rejected the \"Ecloga\".\nLeo and his successor Constantine V transformed the Byzantine \"orphanotrophos\" into a magistrate. Prior to these legislative reforms, Byzantine law required that all orphans are passed into the Byzantine orphanage or to a monastery.\nNumismatics.\nThe coins minted during Leo's reign exclusively depicted male imperial dynasts, promoting the dynastic order of succession. In 721, Leo introduced the \"miliar\u0113sion\", a silver coin worth one-twelfth of a \"nomisma\". The gold coins of Leo IV the Khazar show posthumous portraits of Leo III.\nAssessment and legacy.\nIn response to the catastrophic Twenty Years' Anarchy, Leo, and his son Constantine V in emulation, fundamentally changed the formula of imperial survival as established by Justinian I. The military was closely associated with the regime in order to stifle the possibility of usurpation. Imperial power was also strengthened by the introduction of low-denomination silver coins, allowing greater flexibility in raising taxes. This autocratic renewal of imperial authority was motivated by justice and spiritual welfare, leading to the denunciation and eventual destruction of images deemed to be \"idolatrous\". These aspects, which all originate in the personality of Leo, can be attributed to the entire Isaurian dynasty, which was unwaveringly iconoclastic, Irene of Athens excepted. Succeeding generations of the Byzantine ruling class regarded the Isaurian period as one of religious persecution. The phrase \"I am emperor and priest\" attributed to Leo by later iconodule polemicists represents the characteristically Isaurian imperial ascendancy over the church, which was rejected in the mid-9th century after Patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople purged the clergy of iconoclasts, asserting the autonomy of the church against the iconoclast emperor, Theophilos (r.\u2009829\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842).\nThe few primary sources of the eighth and ninth centuries were mostly written by clerical or monastic iconodules who were hostile to Leo and Constantine V. They tended to view the period as dominated by ecclesiastical matters and in particular the imperial persecution of iconodules, despite the Empire's contemporaneous existential struggle against its enemies. Modern assessment of the reign of Leo as well as that of his son is that it was a period of violence which saw the Empire's rescue from destruction, within a context of extensive domestic policy reform. Leo's successful ruse against Caliph Sulayman and his general Maslama, which secured his place on the throne, and then his successful defense of the Empire during the siege of Constantinople, earned him a reputation as a wily and formidable commander against colossal odds. His personal knowledge of the geography of the foothills of the Taurus Mountains helped in the countering of Arab incursions mainly in the latter part of his reign, as was especially signified in the Battle of Akroinon\u2014a crucial victory for Leo which had changed the tide of the Arab\u2013Byzantine wars in the favour of Rome for the next 350 years. However, the Byzantine control over its Italian possessions was steadily weakened during Leo's reign, and his attempts to reassert imperial authority there failed.\nIn 1573, a translation of John of Damascus' attack on Leo III was published, under the title \"Apologie divis\u00e9e en trois livres contre L\u00e9on Isaure\", triggering religious controversy.\nFamily.\nWith his wife Maria, Leo III had four known children:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They had previously settled in the Middle Danube in the 5th century, near what is now Austria, Slovenia and Hungary. Their previous homeland was in the north, near present day Hamburg. Roman-era historians in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD mention the Lombards as one of the Suebian peoples, and report them living on the Lower Elbe already in the early 1st century. Their legacy is apparent in Lombardy, northern Italy, the region deriving its name from them.\nThere are no contemporary accounts of the Lombards in the 3rd or 4th century, or for most of the 5th century, which is when they reappear, near the Danube river far to the south. Legendary accounts of the Lombard migration are found in several early medieval texts, the oldest being the \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\" (\"Origin of the Lombard People\"). There are two other notable later adaptions, the \"Chronicon Gothanum\" and the more scholarly \"History of the Lombards\" by Paul the Deacon, written between 787 and 796 AD, which contain more information. All three describe the Lombards as a people who moved to the Danube from somewhere near the North Sea. The details, however, differ until they enter \"Rugiland\" soon after Odoacer's defeat in 487/488 AD of the Rugii, who had a kingdom near what is now Vienna.\nIn the Danube region, the Lombards came into conflict with other small kingdoms, starting with the Heruls, neighbours of the Rugii, and culminating with their defeat of the Gepids. The Lombard king Audoin defeated the Gepid leader Thurisind in 551 or 552 AD, and Audoin's successor Alboin eventually destroyed the Gepids in 567 AD. The Lombards also settled further south in Pannonia, in modern-day Hungary. Near Sz\u00f3l\u00e1d, archaeologists have unearthed burial sites of Lombard men and women being buried together as families, unusual among Germanic peoples at the time. Contemporary traces have also been discovered of Mediterranean Greeks and a possible migrant from France.\nFollowing Alboin's victory over the Gepids, he led his people into northeastern Italy, which had become severely depopulated and devastated by the long Gothic War (535\u2013554) between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom. The Lombards were joined by numerous Saxons, Heruls, Gepids, Bulgars, Thuringians and Ostrogoths, and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569 AD, they had conquered all of northern Italy and the principal cities north of the Po River except Pavia, which fell in 572 AD. At the same time, they occupied areas in central and southern Italy. They established a Lombard Kingdom in north and central Italy, which reached its zenith under the 8th century ruler Liutprand. In 774 AD, the kingdom was conquered by the Frankish king Charlemagne and integrated into the Frankish Empire. Lombard nobles, however, continued to rule the southern parts of the Italian peninsula well into the 11th century, when they were conquered by the Normans and added to the County of Sicily. During this period, the southern part of Italy still under Lombard control was known to the Norse as Langbar\u00f0aland or 'land of the Lombards', as inscribed in Norse runestones.\nName.\nThe classical Latin and Greek forms of the name ( and ) were first recorded by Strabo and Velleius Paterculus. \nThe standard explanation derives the name from \"long\" and \"beard,\" meaning \"the Long-beards\". Isidore of Seville stated in the 7th century that it was commonly said that the Langobards got their name because they never cut their beards. The origin stories in the \"Origo\" and the \"History\" of Paul the Deacon connect this name to a special trick played by the ancestors of the Langobards. The \"Chronicon Gothanum\", on the other hand, skips this episode and says the name of the Langobards simply arose \"by the voice of the common people\" (), because of their long and uncut beards. Scholars generally accept this \"long-beard\" interpretation as linguistically and semantically sound. Other explanations \u2014 such as deriving \"-bard-\" from a weapon (\"barta\" \"axe\"), or as a synonym for \"fighters\" parallel to the alternate ethnonym Winnili (\"the fighters\") \u2014 are less convincing. It is possible that \"Winnili\" was the name the tribe used internally, while Langobardi began as a name used by outsiders.\nLater sources sometimes also used a rare shortened form \"Bardi\". Place-names like Bardengau and Bardowick in northern Germany, near the first known homeland of the Langobardi, possibly preserve this same element. On the other hand, scholars have also noted that this type of \"Bard\" placename is common throughout northern Germany, and apparently associated with wet or muddy areas.\nLegendary origins.\nAll three of the legendary accounts state that the Langobards were originally called Winnili, and they begin with the Winnili being ruled by two brothers, Ibor and Aio (or Agio), whose mother and advisor is named Gambara.\nThe \"Origo\" and the \"History\" of Paul the Deacon have them first living an island in the far north which the various manuscripts of these works spell in different ways: \"Scadan, Scandanan, Scadanan, or Scadinavia\". This appears to be an imitation of the 6th-century origin of the Goths written by Jordanes. The 7th-century writer Fredegar similarly says that the Langobardi came from \"Scathanavia\", but only says this is \"between the Danube and the Ocean.\"\nThe \"Codex Gothanus\" was written later than the other two records, but it appears to preserve some older material. It says that the Lombards set out from a river called Vindilicus at the far edge of Gaul, then moved to \"Scatenauga\", which was a place on the lower Elbe.\nIn the oldest of the three versions, the \"Origo\" then reports a war between the Winnili and the Vandals, who were attempting to force other peoples to pay tribute. The Winnili did not move from their home island until after they won this war, and changed their name to the Langobardi. The \"Origo\" gives no reason for leaving. Paul the Deacon's \"History\" says that one third of the Winnili needed to move because of over-population and a low-lying coast. The war with the Vandals then happened in the new homeland called \"Scoringa\", which is not mentioned in the other two sources. It was here that they fought the Vandals and changed their tribal name according to Paul, but afterwards they decided to move again, this time because of famine. \"Scoringa\" was perhaps on the Baltic coast or the Bardengau on the banks of the Elbe. Scoringa's etymology is uncertain, but it probably refers to a coastal shoreline region.\nIn the Vandal war reported by the \"Origo\" and \"History\", the Winnili were young and brave and refused to pay tribute, saying \"It is better to maintain liberty by arms than to stain it by the payment of tribute.\" The Vandals prepared for war and consulted Godan (the god Odin), who answered that he would give victory to those whom he would see first at sunrise. The Winnili were fewer in number and Gambara sought help from Frea (the goddess Frigg), who advised that all Winnili women should tie their hair in front of their faces like beards and march in line with their husbands. At sunrise, Frea turned her husband's bed so that he was facing east, and woke him. So Godan spotted the Winnili first and asked, \"Who are these long-beards?,\" and Frea replied, \"My lord, thou hast given them the name, now give them also the victory.\" From that moment onwards, the Winnili were known as the \"Longbeards\" (Latinised as \"Langobardi\", Italianised as \"Longobardi\", and Anglicized as \"Langobards\" or \"Lombards\").\nIn contrast, the \"Chronicon\" has the Winnili living first on a similarly named river, the \"Vindilicus\", near the furthest borders of Gaul. Once they started moving, their new dwellings were on the banks of the Elbe at a place called \"Stananauge\". The \"Vindilicus\" had in fact been mentioned in the earlier collection of etymologies by Isidore of Seville, as a river where the Vandals supposedly originated. This sentence however comes immediately after a comment about the etymology of the name of the Langobards. The \"Chronicon\" therefore apparently combined two distinct entries of Isidore. The \"Chronicon\" does not mention the places on the migration route described by Paul and the \"Origo\" (see below), but it surprisingly says that after living on the Elbe, the Langobardi lived in Saxony at \"Patespruna\", which is probably intended to be Paderborn. The \"Chronicon\" says that the new tribal name was a result of the common people's voice (\"vulgorum vocem\").\nWhen Paul the Deacon wrote the \"Historia\" between 787 and 796 he was a Catholic monk and devoted Christian. He thought the pagan stories of his people \"silly\" and \"laughable\". Paul explained that the name \"Langobard\" came from the length of their beards. A modern theory suggests that the name \"Langobard\" comes from \"Langbar\u00f0r\", a name of Odin. Priester states that when the Winnili changed their name to \"Lombards\", they also changed their old agricultural fertility cult to a cult of Odin, thus creating a conscious tribal tradition. Fr\u00f6hlich inverts the order of events in Priester and states that with the Odin cult, the Lombards grew their beards in resemblance of the Odin of tradition and their new name reflected this.\nHistory.\nFirst century: Lower Elbe.\nThe first mention of the Lombards in a near contemporary record occurred between AD 9 and 16, by the Roman court historian Velleius Paterculus, who accompanied a Roman expedition as prefect of the cavalry. Paterculus says that under Tiberius the \"power of the Langobardi was broken, a race () surpassing even the Germans in savagery\". Strabo, writing in about 20 AD, treats them as a branch of the Suebi, and indicates that they had previously lived west of the Elbe, but were now forced by Romans to stay on the eastern side. \nTacitus, writing in about 100 AD in his \"Germania\", emphasized that the Langobardi were a distinctively small Suebian people, in terms of numbers, but surrounded by the most powerful peoples. They kept safe, according to him, \"by daring the perils of war\". Beyond the Langobardi were the Nerthus-worshipping tribes whose land of rivers and forest stretched to the sea and the remote parts of \"Germania\".\nIn his \"Annals\", Tacitus also noted the involvement of the Langobardi in the conflicts of the time. 9 AD when Arminius and his allies won the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, the Lombards and Semnones were part of the kingdom of Marobod, the King of the Marcomanni, who was allied with Rome. However, after the outbreak of war between Arminius and Marobod in 17 AD the Lombards and Semnones switched to the alliance of Arminius. They detested Marobod's title of king, and saw Arminius as a champion of freedom. In the battle the two sides eventually fought, Tacitus believed that the Cherusci and Langobardi were fighting for ancient renown or newly-won freedom, while the other side for the increase of their dominion. Arminius died in 21 AD. In 47 AD, the Cherusci were assigned a new leader by Rome, Italicus, and this was controversial. Both his supporters and detractors appealed to neighbouring tribe. When he was eventually dethroned, the Langobardi restored him.\nThe lands of the lower Elbe fall into the zone of the Jastorf Culture and became Elbe-Germanic, differing from the lands between Rhine, Weser, and the North Sea. Archaeologists have identified the probable core region of the Langobard settlements in zone south of Hamburg, separated from the coastal Chauci to the west by the moorlands of the Oste river, and to the south was the sparsely populated L\u00fcneburg Heath. To the east their borders are hard to define, though they may have reached as far as the Ilmenau, or Drawehn, or even H\u00f6hbeck. On the north of the Elbe, cemeteries in the districts of Hagenow, Ludwigslust, and the fringe of the district of Schwerin up to Lake Schwerin are considered Langobardic. This whole area was continuously inhabited until the late early Roman period, when parts of the population began to shift. The German archaeologist Willi Wegewitz defined several Iron Age burial sites at the Lower Elbe as \"Langobardic\". The burial sites are crematorial and are usually dated from the sixth century BC through the third century AD, so a settlement breakoff seems unlikely. Archaeological finds show that the Lombards were an agricultural people.\nSecond century.\nFar to the south of the Lower Elbe, in 166 AD Cassius Dio reported that just before the Marcomannic Wars, 6,000 Lombards and Obii (sometimes thought to be Ubii) crossed the Danube and invaded Pannonia. The two tribes were defeated, but the non-Roman nations of the region were concerned about the possible Roman reaction. They sent Ballomar, King of the Marcomanni, as ambassador to Aelius Bassus, who was then administering Pannonia. Peace was made and the two tribes returned to their homes. However, this was seen as a foretaste of the great war which subsequently broke out.\nIn the mid-second century, surviving descriptions of Europe based on the work of geographer Claudius Ptolemy appears to describe the Langobardi in two distinct places, probably because the text is partly based upon several different earlier sources.\nThis double mention has been interpreted as an editorial error by Gudmund Sch\u00fctte, in his analysis of Ptolemy. \nDifficult to evaluate, the \"Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani\" mentions \"Patespruna\" in Saxony, probably Paderborn, as one of the places the early Langobardi lived.\nFrom the second century onwards, many of the Germanic tribes recorded as active during the Principate started to unite into bigger tribal unions, such as the Franks, Alamanni, Bavarii, and Saxons. The Lombards are not mentioned at first, perhaps because they were not initially on the border of Rome, or perhaps because they were subjected to a larger tribal union, like the Saxons. It is, however, highly probable that, when the bulk of the Lombards migrated, a considerable part remained behind and afterwards became absorbed by the Saxon tribes in the Elbe region, while the emigrants alone retained the name of Lombards. However, the \"Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani\" states that the Lombards were subjected by the Saxons around 300 but rose up against them under their first king, Agelmund, who ruled for 30 years. In the second half of the fourth century, the Lombards left their homes, probably due to bad harvests, and embarked on their migration.\nMigration.\nThe only account of how the Langobards moved from the Lower Elbe to the Danube is found in the \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\", and the \"History\" of Paul the Deacon. The end of their journey was \"Rugiland\", where they arrived after 387 when Odoacer defeated the kingdom of the Rugii. They stopped in several places: \"Scoringa\" and \"Mauringa\" are only mentioned by Paul the Deacon; \"Golanda\", \"Anthaib\", \"Banthaib\", and \"Vurgundaib\" (\"Burgundaib\") are mentioned in both texts. According to the Ravenna Cosmography, Mauringa was the land east of the Elbe.\nThe crossing into Mauringa was very difficult. The Assipitti (possibly the Usipetes) denied them passage through their lands and a fight was arranged for the strongest man of each tribe. The Lombard was victorious, passage was granted, and the Lombards reached Mauringa.\nThe Lombards departed from Mauringa and reached Golanda. Scholar Ludwig Schmidt thinks this was further east, perhaps on the right bank of the Oder. Schmidt considers the name the equivalent of Gotland, meaning simply \"good land\". This theory is highly plausible; Paul the Deacon mentions the Lombards crossing a river, and they could have reached \"Rugiland\" from the Upper Oder area via the Moravian Gate.\nMoving out of Golanda, the Lombards passed through Anthaib and Banthaib until they reached Vurgundaib, believed to be the old lands of the Burgundes. In Vurgundaib, the Lombards were stormed in camp by \"Bulgars\" (probably Huns) and were defeated; King Agelmund was killed and Laimicho was made king. He was in his youth and desired to avenge the slaughter of Agelmund. The Lombards themselves were probably made subjects of the Huns after the defeat but rose up and defeated them with great slaughter, gaining great booty and confidence as they \"became bolder in undertaking the toils of war.\" \nMiddle Danube.\nDuring the reign of King Claffo, the Langobards occupied parts of modern-day Upper and Lower Austria and converted to Arian Christianity. In 505 the Herulians attacked and defeated them, obliging them to pay tax and withdraw to Northern Bohemia. In 508, King Rodulf sent his brother to the Lombard court to collect tribute and extend the truce; however, he was stabbed by Rometrud, sister of King Tato. Rodulf personally led his forces against Tato, but was ambushed and killed from a hill.\nIn the 540s, Audoin (ruled 546\u2013560) led the Lombards across the Danube once more into Pannonia. Thurisind, King of the Gepids attempted to expel them, and both peoples asked for help from the Byzantines. Justinian I sent his army against the Gepids; however, it was routed on the way by the Herulians and the sides signed a two-year truce. Revenging what he felt as a betrayal, Thurisind made an alliance with the Kutrigurs who devastated Moesia before end of the armistice. The Langobard and Roman army joined together and defeated the Gepids in 551. In the battle, Audoin's son, Alboin killed Thurisind's son, Turismod.\nIn 552, the Byzantines, aided by a large contingent of Foederati, notably Lombards, Heruls and Bulgars, defeated the last Ostrogoths led by Teia in the Battle of Taginae.\nIn approximately 560, Audoin was succeeded by his son Alboin, a young and energetic leader who defeated the neighboring Gepidae and made them his subjects; in 566, he married Rosamund, daughter of the Gepid king Cunimund. In the same year, he made a pact with Khagan Bayan. Next year the Lombards and the Avars destroyed the Gepid kingdom in the Lombard\u2013Gepid War, the allies halved the prize of war and the nomads settled in Transylvania.\nKingdom of the Lombards in Italy, 568\u2013774.\nIn the spring of 568, Alboin, now fearing the aggressive Avars, led the Lombard migration into Italy, which he planned for years. According to the \"History of the Lombards,\" \"Then the Langobards, having left Pannonia, hastened to take possession of Italy with their wives and children and all their goods.\" The Avars have agreed to shelter them if they wish to come back.\nVarious other peoples who either voluntarily joined or were subjects of King Alboin were also part of the migration. Whence, even until today, we call the villages in which they dwell Gepidan, Bulgarian, Sarmatian, Pannonian, Suabian, Norican, or by other names of this kind.\" At least 20,000 Saxon warriors, old allies of the Lombards, and their families joined them in their new migration.\nThe first important city to fall was \"Forum Iulii\" (Cividale del Friuli) in northeastern Italy, in 569. There, Alboin created the first Lombard duchy, which he entrusted to his nephew Gisulf. Soon Vicenza, Verona and Brescia fell into Germanic hands. In the summer of 569, the Lombards conquered the main Roman centre of northern Italy, Milan. The area was then recovering from the terrible Gothic Wars, and the small Byzantine army left for its defence could do almost nothing. Longinus, the Exarch sent to Italy by Emperor Justin II, could only defend coastal cities that could be supplied by the powerful Byzantine fleet. Pavia fell after a siege of three years, in 572, becoming the first capital city of the new Lombard kingdom of Italy.In the following years, the Lombards penetrated further south, conquering Tuscany and establishing two duchies, Spoleto and Benevento under Zotto, which soon became semi-independent and even outlasted the northern kingdom, surviving well into the twelfth century. Wherever they went, they were joined by the Ostrogothic population, which was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. The Byzantines managed to retain control of the area of Ravenna and Rome, linked by a thin corridor running through Perugia.\nWhen they entered Italy, some Lombards retained their native form of paganism, while some were Arian Christians. Hence they did not enjoy good relations with the Early Christian Church. Gradually, they adopted Roman or Romanized titles, names, and traditions, and partially converted to orthodoxy (in the seventh century), though not without a long series of religious and ethnic conflicts. By the time Paul the Deacon was writing, the Lombard language, dress and even hairstyles had nearly all disappeared \"in toto\".\nThe whole Lombard territory was divided into 36 duchies, whose leaders settled in the main cities. The king ruled over them and administered the land through emissaries called \"gastaldi\". This subdivision, however, together with the independent indocility of the duchies, deprived the kingdom of unity, making it weak even when compared to the Byzantines, especially since these had begun to recover from the initial invasion. This weakness became even more evident when the Lombards had to face the increasing power of the Franks. In response, the kings tried to centralize power over time, but they definitively lost control over Spoleto and Benevento in the attempt.\nLangobardia major.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nArian monarchy.\nIn 572, Alboin was murdered in Verona in a plot led by his wife, Rosamund, who later fled to Ravenna. His successor, Cleph, was also assassinated, after a ruthless reign of 18 months. His death began an interregnum of years (the \"Rule of the Dukes\") during which the dukes did not elect any king, a period regarded as a time of violence and disorder. In 586, threatened by a Frankish invasion, the dukes elected Cleph's son, Authari, as king. In 589, he married Theodelinda, daughter of Garibald I of Bavaria, the Duke of Bavaria. The Catholic Theodelinda was a friend of Pope Gregory I and pushed for Christianization. In the meantime, Authari embarked on a policy of internal reconciliation and tried to reorganize royal administration. The dukes yielded half their estates for the maintenance of the king and his court in Pavia. On the foreign affairs side, Authari managed to thwart the dangerous alliance between the Byzantines and the Franks.\nAuthari died in 591 and was succeeded by Agilulf, the duke of Turin, who also married Theodelinda in the same year. Agilulf successfully fought the rebel dukes of northern Italy, conquering Padua in 601, Cremona and Mantua in 603, and forcing the Exarch of Ravenna to pay tribute. Agilulf died in 616; Theodelinda reigned alone until 628 when she was succeeded by Adaloald. Arioald, the head of the Arian opposition who had married Theodelinda's daughter Gundeperga, later deposed Adaloald.\nArioald was succeeded by Rothari, regarded by many authorities as the most energetic of all Lombard kings. He extended his dominions, conquering Liguria in 643 and the remaining part of the Byzantine territories of inner Veneto, including the Roman city of \"Opitergium\" (Oderzo). Rothari also made the famous edict bearing his name, the \"Edictum Rothari\", which established the laws and the customs of his people in Latin: the edict did not apply to the tributaries of the Lombards, who could retain their own laws. Rothari's son Rodoald succeeded him in 652, still very young, and was killed by his opponents.\nAt the death of King Aripert I in 661, the kingdom was split between his children Perctarit, who set his capital in Milan, and Godepert, who reigned from Pavia (Ticinum). Perctarit was overthrown by Grimoald, son of Gisulf, duke of Friuli and Benevento since 647. Perctarit fled to the Avars and then to the Franks. Grimoald managed to regain control over the duchies and deflected the late attempt of the Byzantine emperor Constans II to conquer southern Italy. He also defeated the Franks. At Grimoald's death in 671 Perctarit returned and promoted tolerance between Arians and Catholics, but he could not defeat the Arian party, led by Arachi, duke of Trento, who submitted only to his son, the philo-Catholic Cunincpert.\nThe Lombards engaged in fierce battles with Slavic peoples during these years: from 623 to 626 the Lombards unsuccessfully attacked the Carantanians, and, in 663\u201364, the Slavs raided the Vipava Valley and the Friuli.\nCatholic monarchy.\nReligious strife and the Slavic raids remained a source of struggle in the following years. In 705, the Friuli Lombards were defeated and lost the land to the west of the So\u010da River, namely the Gorizia Hills and the Venetian Slovenia. A new ethnic border was established that has lasted for over 1200 years up until the present time.\nThe Lombard reign began to recover only with Liutprand the Lombard (king from 712), son of Ansprand and successor of the brutal Aripert II. He managed to regain a certain control over Spoleto and Benevento, and, taking advantage of the disagreements between the Pope and Byzantium concerning the reverence of icons, he annexed the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchy of Rome. He also helped the Frankish marshal Charles Martel drive back the Arabs. The Slavs were defeated in the Battle of Lavariano, when they tried to conquer the Friulian Plain in 720. Liutprand's successor Aistulf conquered Ravenna for the Lombards for the first time but had to relinquish it when he was subsequently defeated by the king of the Franks, Pippin III, who was called by the Pope.\nAfter the death of Aistulf, Ratchis attempted to become king of Lombardy, but he was deposed by Desiderius, duke of Tuscany, the last Lombard to rule as king. Desiderius managed to take Ravenna definitively, ending the Byzantine presence in northern Italy. He decided to reopen struggles against the Pope, who was supporting the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento against him, and entered Rome in 772, the first Lombard king to do so. But when Pope Hadrian I called for help from the powerful Frankish king Charlemagne, Desiderius was defeated at Susa and besieged in Pavia, while his son Adelchis was forced to open the gates of Verona to Frankish troops. Desiderius surrendered in 774, and Charlemagne, in an utterly novel decision, took the title \"King of the Lombards\". Before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other, but none had adopted the title of King of another people. Charlemagne took part of the Lombard territory to create the Papal States.\nThe Lombardy region in Italy, which includes the cities of Brescia, Bergamo, Milan, and the old capital Pavia, is a reminder of the presence of the Lombards.\nLater history.\nFalling to the Franks and the Duchy of Benevento, 774\u2013849.\nThough the kingdom centred on Pavia in the north fell to Charlemagne and the Franks in 774, the Lombard-controlled territory to the south of the Papal States was never subjugated by Charlemagne or his descendants. In 774, Duke Arechis II of Benevento, whose duchy had only nominally been under royal authority, though certain kings had been effective at making their power known in the south, claimed that Benevento was the successor state of the kingdom. He tried to turn Benevento into a \"secundum Ticinum\": a second Pavia. He tried to claim the kingship, but with no support and no chance of a coronation in Pavia.\nCharlemagne came down with an army, and his son Louis the Pious sent men, to force the Beneventan duke to submit, but his submission and promises were never kept and Arechis and his successors were \"de facto\" independent. The Beneventan dukes took the title \"pr\u00ednceps\" (prince) instead of that of king.\nThe Lombards of southern Italy were thereafter in the anomalous position of holding land claimed by two empires: the Carolingian Empire to the north and west and the Byzantine Empire to the east. They typically made pledges and promises of tribute to the Carolingians, but effectively remained outside Frankish control. Benevento meanwhile grew to its greatest extent yet when it imposed a tribute on the Duchy of Naples, which was tenuously loyal to Byzantium and even conquered the Neapolitan city of Amalfi in 838. At one point in the reign of Sicard, Lombard control covered most of southern Italy save the very south of Apulia and Calabria and Naples, with its nominally attached cities. It was during the ninth century that a strong Lombard presence became entrenched in formerly Greek Apulia. However, Sicard had opened up the south to the invasive actions of the Saracens in his war with Andrew II of Naples and when he was assassinated in 839, Amalfi declared independence and two factions fought for power in Benevento, crippling the principality and making it susceptible to external enemies.\nThe civil war lasted ten years and ended with a peace treaty imposed in 849 by Emperor Louis II, the only Frankish king to exercise actual sovereignty over the Lombard states. The treaty divided the kingdom into two states: the Principality of Benevento and the Principality of Salerno, with its capital at Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nSouthern Italy and the Arabs, 836\u2013915.\nAndrew II of Naples hired Islamic mercenaries and formed a Muslim-Christian alliance for his war with Sicard of Benevento in 836; Sicard responded with other Muslim mercenaries. The Saracens initially concentrated their attacks on Sicily and Byzantine Italy, but soon Radelchis I of Benevento called in more mercenaries, who destroyed Capua in 841. Landulf the Old founded the present-day Capua, \"New Capua\", on a nearby hill. In general, the Lombard princes were less inclined to ally with the Saracens than with their Greek neighbours of Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples, and Sorrento. Guaifer of Salerno, however, briefly put himself under Muslim suzerainty.\nIn 847 a large Muslim force seized Bari, until then a Lombard gastaldate under the control of Pandenulf. Saracen incursions proceeded northwards until Adelchis of Benevento sought the help of his suzerain, Louis II, who allied with the Byzantine emperor Basil I to expel the Arabs from Bari in 869. An Arab landing force was defeated by the emperor in 871. Adelchis and Louis remained at war until the death of Louis in 875. Adelchis regarded himself as the true successor of the Lombard kings, and in that capacity he amended the \"Edictum Rothari\", the last Lombard ruler to do so.\nAfter the death of Louis, Landulf II of Capua briefly flirted with a Saracen alliance, but Pope John VIII convinced him to break it off. Guaimar I of Salerno fought the Saracens with Byzantine troops. Throughout this period the Lombard princes swung in allegiance from one party to another. Finally, towards 915, Pope John X managed to unite the Christian princes of southern Italy against the Saracen establishments on the Garigliano river. The Saracens were ousted from Italy in the Battle of the Garigliano in 915.\nLombard principalities in the tenth century.\nThe independent state of Salerno inspired the gastalds of Capua to move towards independence, and by the end of the century they were styling themselves \"princes\" and as a third Lombard state. The Capuan and Beneventan states were united by Atenulf I of Capua in 900. He subsequently declared them to be in perpetual union, and they were separated only in 982, on the death of Pandulf Ironhead. With all of the Lombard south under his control, except Salerno, Atenulf felt safe to use the title \"Princeps Gentis Langobardorum\" (\"prince of the Lombard people\"), which Arechis II had begun using in 774. Among Atenulf's successors the principality was ruled jointly by fathers, sons, brothers, cousins, and uncles for the greater part of the century.\nMeanwhile, the prince Gisulf I of Salerno began using the title \"Langobardorum Gentis Princeps\" around mid-century, but the ideal of a united Lombard principality was realised only in December 977, when Gisulf died and his domains were inherited by Pandulf Ironhead, who temporarily held almost all Italy south of Rome and brought the Lombards into an alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. His territories were divided upon his death.\nLandulf the Red of Benevento and Capua tried to conquer the principality of Salerno with the help of John III of Naples, but with the aid of Mastalus I of Amalfi, Gisulf repulsed him. The rulers of Benevento and Capua made several attempts on Byzantine Apulia at this time, but late in the century, the Byzantines, under the stiff rule of Basil II, gained ground on the Lombards.\nAccording to the \"Catalogum Principum Salerni\", the Prince of \"langobard Salerno\" Guaimar IV ruled for 34 years and 17 days. He conquered and was: Duke of Amalfi (1039\u20131052), Duke of Gaeta (1040\u20131041), and Prince of Capua (1038\u20131047) in Southern Italy over the period from 1027 to 1052. He was an important figure in the final phase of Byzantine authority in the Mezzogiorno and the commencement of Norman power. Guaimar's legacy includes his dominion, either by conquest or otherwise, over Salerno, Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples, Sorrento, Apulia, Calabria, and Capua at one time or another. He was the last great Lombard prince of the south, but perhaps he is best known for his character, which the Lord Norwich sums up this way: \"...without once breaking a promise or betraying a trust. Up to the day he died his honour and good faith had never once been called in question.\". Salerno in these decades was the main and more rich city (called \"Opulenta Salernum\") in southern Italy, even because of the \"Schola Medica Salernitana\" (the first \"university\" of medicine in Europe).\nAfter the assassination of Guaimar IV the Principality of Salerno started to be dominated more and more by the Normans: in 1077 ended the history of the Langobards in Italy when this Principality was conquered by the Norman Robert Guiscard.\nThe principal source for the history of the Lombard principalities in this period is the \"Chronicon Salernitanum\", composed late in the tenth century at Salerno.\nNorman conquest, 1017\u20131078.\nThe diminished Beneventan principality soon lost its independence to the papacy and declined in importance until it fell in the Norman conquest of southern Italy. The Normans, first called in by the Lombards to fight the Byzantines for control of Apulia and Calabria (under the likes of Melus of Bari and Arduin, among others), had become rivals for hegemony in the south. The Salernitan principality experienced a golden age under Guaimar III and Guaimar IV, but under Gisulf II, the principality shrank to insignificance and fell in 1078 to Robert Guiscard, who had married Gisulf's sister Sichelgaita. The Capua principality was hotly contested during the reign of the hated Pandulf IV, the \"Wolf of the Abruzzi\", and, under his son, it fell, almost without contest, to the Norman Richard Drengot (1058). The Capuans revolted against Norman rule in 1091, expelling Richard's grandson Richard II and setting up one Lando IV.\nCapua was again put under Norman rule after the Siege of Capua of 1098 and the city quickly declined in importance under a series of ineffective Norman rulers. The independent status of these Lombard states is in general attested by the ability of their rulers to switch suzerains at will. Often the legal vassal of the pope or the emperor (either Byzantine or Holy Roman), they were the real power-brokers in the south until their erstwhile allies the Normans rose to preeminence.\nGenetics.\nA genetic study published in \"Nature Communications\" in September 2018 found strong genetic similarities between Lombards of Italy and earlier Lombards of Central Europe. Lombard males were primarily carriers of subclades of haplogroup R1b and I2a2a1, both of which are common among Germanic peoples. Lombard males were found to be more genetically homogeneous than Lombard females. The evidence suggested that the Lombards originated in Central/Northern Europe, and were a patriarchal people who settled Central Europe and then later Italy through a migration from the north.\nA genetic study published in \"Science Advances\" in September 2018 examined the remains of a Lombard male buried at an Alemannic graveyard. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1b1a2a1a1c2b2b and the maternal haplogroup H65a. The graveyard also included the remains of a Frankish and a Byzantine male, both of whom were also carriers of subclades of the paternal haplogroup R1b1a2a1a1. The Lombard, Frankish and Byzantine males were all found to be closely related, and displayed close genetic links to Northern Europe, particularly Lithuania and Iceland.\nA genetic study published in the \"European Journal of Human Genetics\" in January 2019 examined the mtDNA of a large number of early-medieval Lombard remains from Central Europe and Italy. These individuals were found to be closely related and displayed strong genetic links to Central Europe. The evidence suggested that the Lombard settlement of Italy was the result of a migration from the north involving both males and females.\nA 2024 paper found that the Lombards of Italy were best modelled by a Jutlandic Iron Age source, consistent with an origin in Jutland or northern Germany.\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nUnless Cimbrian and M\u00f2cheno represent surviving dialects, the Lombardic language is extinct. It declined beginning in the seventh century, but may have been in scattered use until as late as about the year 1000. Only fragments of the language have survived, the main evidence being individual words quoted in Latin texts. In the absence of Lombardic texts, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the language's morphology and syntax. The genetic classification of the language depends entirely on phonology. Since there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the High German consonant shift, it is usually classified as an Upper German dialect descended from Elbe Germanic.\nLombardic fragments are preserved in runic inscriptions. Primary source texts include short inscriptions in the Elder Futhark, among them the \"bronze capsule of Schretzheim\" (c. 600) and the silver belt buckle found in Pforzen, Ostallg\u00e4u (Schwaben). A number of Latin texts include Lombardic names, and Lombardic legal texts contain terms taken from the legal vocabulary of the vernacular. In 2005, Emilia Den\u010deva argued that the inscription of the Pernik sword may be Lombardic.\nPaul the Deacon, writing about 790 AD, mentioned that in his time the Bavarians and Saxons, and \"other peoples of the same language \", were still singing songs about King Alboin (died 572 AD). This indicates that at least for the use of such songs, there was still a shared language connecting at least the Saxons and Bavarians, and possibly also the Langobardi.\nThe Italian language preserves a large number of Lombardic words, although it is not always easy to distinguish them from other Germanic borrowings such as those from Gothic or from Frankish. They often bear some resemblance to English words, as Lombardic was akin to Old Saxon. For instance, \"guardia\" from \"wardan\" (warden), \"guerra\" from \"werra\" (war), \"ricco\" from \"rikki\" (rich), and \"guadare\" from \"wadjan\" (to wade).\nThe \"Codice diplomatico longobardo\", a collection of legal documents, makes reference to many terms of Germanic origin, some of them still in use in the Italian language:\n\"marchio\" (mark), \"maniscalco\" (blacksmith), \"braida\" (suburban meadow), \"borgo\" (burg, village), \"fara\" (fundamental unity of Lombard social and military organization, presently used as toponym), \"sala\" (hall, room, also used as toponym), \"staffa\" (stirrup), \"stalla\" (stable), \"sculdascio\", \"faida\" (feud), \"manigoldo\" (scoundrel), \"sgherro\" (henchman); \"fanone\" (baleen), \"stamberga\" (hovel); \"anca\" (hip), \"guancia\" (cheek), \"nocca\" (knuckle), \"schiena\" (back); \"gazza\" (magpie), \"martora\" (marten); \"gualdo\" (wood, presently used as toponym); verbs like \"bussare\" (to knock), \"russare\" (to snore).\nSocial structure.\nMigration Period society.\nDuring their stay at the mouth of the Elbe, the Lombards came into contact with other western Germanic populations, such as the Saxons and the Frisians. From these populations, which had long been in contact with the Celts (especially the Saxons), they adopted a rigid social organization into castes, rarely present in other Germanic peoples.\nThe Lombard kings can be traced back as early as c. 380 and thus to the beginning of the Great Migration. Kingship developed among the Germanic peoples when the unity of a single military command was found necessary. Schmidt believed that the Germanic tribes were divided into cantons and that the earliest government was a general assembly that selected canton chiefs and war leaders in times of conflict. All such figures were probably selected from a caste of nobility. As a result of the wars of their wanderings, royal power developed such that the king became the representative of the people, but the influence of the people on the government did not fully disappear. Paul the Deacon gives an account of the Lombard tribal structure during the migration:\n... in order that they might increase the number of their warriors, [the Lombards] confer liberty upon many whom they deliver from the yoke of bondage, and that the freedom of these may be regarded as established, they confirm it in their accustomed way by an arrow, uttering certain words of their country in confirmation of the fact.\nComplete emancipation appears to have been granted only among the Franks and the Lombards.\nSociety of the Catholic kingdom.\nLombard society was divided into classes comparable to those found in the other Germanic successor states of Rome, Frankish Gaul and Spain under the Visigoths. There was a noble class, a class of free persons beneath them, a class of unfree non-slaves (serfs), and finally slaves. The aristocracy itself was poorer, more urbanised, and less landed than elsewhere. Aside from the richest and most powerful of the dukes and the king himself, Lombard noblemen tended to live in cities (unlike their Frankish counterparts) and hold little more than twice as much in land as the merchant class (a far cry from provincial Frankish aristocrats who held vast swathes of land, hundreds of times larger than those beneath his status). The aristocracy by the eighth century was highly dependent on the king for means of income related especially to judicial duties: many Lombard nobles are referred to in contemporary documents as \"iudices\" (judges) even when their offices had important military and legislative functions as well.\nThe freemen of the Lombard kingdom were far more numerous than in Frankish lands, especially in the eighth century, when they are almost invisible in surviving documentary evidence. Smallholders, owner-cultivators, and rentiers are the most numerous types of person in surviving diplomata for the Lombard kingdom. They may have owned more than half of the land in Lombard Italy. The freemen were \"exercitales\" and \"viri devoti\", that is, soldiers and \"devoted men\" (a military term like \"retainers\"); they formed the levy of the Lombard army, and they were sometimes, if infrequently, called to serve, though this seems not to have been their preference. The small landed class, however, lacked the political influence necessary with the king (and the dukes) to control the politics and legislation of the kingdom. The aristocracy was more thoroughly powerful politically if not economically in Italy than in contemporary Gaul and Spain.\nThe urbanisation of Lombard Italy was characterised by the (or \"city as islands\"). It appears from archaeology that the great cities of Lombard Italy\u2014Pavia, Lucca, Siena, Arezzo, Milan\u2014were themselves formed of small urban cores within the old Roman city walls. The cities of the Roman Empire had been partially destroyed in the series of wars of the fifth and sixth centuries. Many sectors were left in ruins and ancient monuments became fields of grass used as pastures for animals, thus the Roman Forum became the \"Campo Vaccino\", the field of cows. The portions of the cities that remained intact were small, modest, contained a cathedral or major church (often sumptuously decorated), and a few public buildings and townhouses of the aristocracy. Few buildings of importance were stone, most were wood. In the end, the inhabited parts of the cities were separated from one another by stretches of pasture even within the city walls.\nReligious history.\nThe legend from Origo may hint that initially, before the passage from Scandinavia to the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the Lombards worshiped the Vanir. Later, in contact with other Germanic populations, they adopted the worship of the \u00c6sir: an evolution that marked the passage from the adoration of deities related to fertility and the earth to the cult of warlike gods.\nIn chapter 40 of his \"Germania\", Roman historian Tacitus, discussing the Suebian tribes of Germania, writes that the Lombards were one of the Suebian tribes united in worship of the deity Nerthus, who is often identified with the Norse goddess Freyja. The other tribes were the Reudigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suarines and Nuitones.\nSt. Barbatus of Benevento observed many pagan rituals and traditions among the Lombards authorised by the Duke Romuald, son of King Grimoald:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They expressed a religious veneration to a golden viper, and prostrated themselves before it: they paid also a superstitious honour to a tree, on which they hung the skin of a wild beast, and these ceremonies were closed by public games, in which the skin served for a mark at which bowmen shot arrows over their shoulder.\nChristianisation.\nThe Lombards first adopted Christianity while still in Pannonia, but their conversion and Christianisation was largely nominal and far from complete. During the reign of Wacho, they were Orthodox Catholics allied with the Byzantine Empire, but Alboin converted to Arianism as an ally of the Ostrogoths and invaded Italy. All these Christian conversions primarily affected the aristocracy, while the common people remained pagan.\nIn Italy, the Lombards were intensively Christianised, and the pressure to convert to Orthodox Catholicism was great. With the Bavarian queen Theodelinda, an Orthodox Catholic, the monarchy was brought under heavy Catholic influence. After initial support for the anti-Rome party in the Schism of the Three Chapters, Theodelinda remained a close contact and supporter of Pope Gregory I. In 603, Adaloald, the heir to the throne, received Orthodox Catholic baptism. However, the lack of spiritual involvement of most of the Lombards in religious disputes remained constant, so much so that the opposition between Orthodox Catholics, on the one hand, and pagans, Arians and schismatics, on the other, soon took on political significance. The supporters of Roman orthodoxy, led by the Bavarian dynasty, were politically the proponents of greater integration with the Romans, accompanied by a strategy of preserving the status quo with the Byzantines. Arians, pagans and schismatics, rooted above all in the northeastern regions of the kingdom (Austria), were instead interpreters of the preservation of the warlike and aggressive spirit of the people. Thus, to the \"pro-Catholic\" phase of Agilulf, Theodolinda and Adaloald followed, from 626 (Arioald's accession to the throne) to 690 (definitive defeat of the rebel Alahis), a long phase of the revival of Arianism, embodied by militarily aggressive kings like Rothari and Grimoald. However, tolerance towards Orthodox Catholics was never questioned by the various kings, also safeguarded by the influential contribution of the respective queens (largely chosen, for reasons of dynastic legitimacy, among the Orthodox Catholic princesses of the Bavarian dynasty).\nIn the seventh century, the nominally Christian aristocracy of Benevento was still practising pagan rituals such as sacrifices in \"sacred\" woods. By the end of the reign of Cunincpert, however, the Lombards were more or less completely Catholicised. Under Liutprand Orthodox Catholicism became tangible as the king sought to justify his title \"rex totius Italiae\" by uniting the south of the peninsula with the north, thereby bringing together his Italo-Roman and Germanic subjects into one Catholic State.\nBeneventan Christianity.\nThe Duchy and eventually Principality of Benevento in southern Italy developed a unique Christian rite in the seventh and eighth centuries. The Beneventan rite is more closely related to the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite than to the Roman rite. The Beneventan rite has not survived in its complete form, although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of local significance are extant. The Beneventan rite appears to have been less complete, less systematic, and more liturgically flexible than the Roman rite.\nCharacteristic of this rite was the Beneventan chant, a Lombard-influenced chant that bore similarities to the Ambrosian chant of Milan. The Beneventan chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Beneventan rite; many Beneventan chants were assigned multiple roles when inserted into Gregorian chantbooks, appearing variously as antiphons, offertories, and communions, for example. It was eventually supplanted by the Gregorian chant in the eleventh century.\nThe chief centre of the Beneventan chant was Montecassino, one of the first and greatest abbeys of Western monasticism. Gisulf II of Benevento had donated a large swathe of land to Montecassino in 744, and that became the basis for an important state, the \"Terra Sancti Benedicti\", which was a subject only to Rome. The Cassinese influence on Christianity in southern Italy was immense. Montecassino was also the starting point for another characteristic of Beneventan monasticism, the use of the distinct Beneventan script, a clear, angular script derived from the Roman cursive as used by the Lombards.\nArt.\nDuring their nomadic phase, the Lombards primarily created art that was easily carried with them, like arms and jewellery. Though relatively little of this has survived, it bears resemblance to the similar endeavours of other Germanic tribes of central Europe from the same era.\nThe first major modifications to the Germanic style of the Lombards came in Pannonia and especially in Italy, under the influence of local, Byzantine, and Christian styles. The conversions from nomadism and paganism to settlement and Christianity also opened up new arenas of artistic expressions, such as architecture (especially churches) and its accompanying decorative arts (such as frescoes).\nArchitecture.\nFew Lombard buildings have survived. Most have been lost, rebuilt, or renovated at some point, so they preserve little of their original Lombard structure. Lombard architecture was well-studied in the twentieth century, and the four-volume \"Lombard Architecture\" (1919) by Arthur Kingsley Porter is a \"monument of illustrated history\".\nThe small Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle in Cividale del Friuli is probably one of the oldest preserved examples of Lombard architecture, as Cividale was the first Lombard city in Italy. Parts of Lombard constructions have been preserved in Pavia (San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, crypts of Sant'Eusebio and San Giovanni Domnarum) and Monza (cathedral). The \"Basilic autariana\" in Fara Gera d'Adda near Bergamo and the church of San Salvatore in Brescia also have Lombard elements. All these buildings are in northern Italy (Langobardia major), but by far the best-preserved Lombard structure is in southern Italy (Langobardia minor). The Church of Santa Sofia in Benevento was erected in 760 by Duke Arechis II, and it preserves Lombard frescoes on the walls and even Lombard capitals on the columns.\nLombard architecture flourished under the impulse provided by the Catholic monarchs like Theodelinda, Liutprand, and Desiderius to the foundation of monasteries to further their political control. Bobbio Abbey was founded during this time.\nSome of the late Lombard structures of the ninth and tenth centuries have been found to contain elements of style associated with Romanesque architecture and so have been dubbed \"first Romanesque\". These edifices are considered, along with some similar buildings in southern France and Catalonia, to mark a transitory phase between the Pre-Romanesque and full-fledged Romanesque.\nNotes and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18013", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18013", "title": "Loki", "text": "Norse deity\nLoki is a god in Norse mythology. He is the son of F\u00e1rbauti (a j\u00f6tunn) and Laufey (a goddess), and the brother of Helblindi and B\u00fdleistr. Loki is married to the goddess Sigyn and they have two sons, Narfi or Nari and V\u00e1li. By the j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent J\u00f6rmungandr. In the form of a mare, Loki was impregnated by the stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir.\nLike other gods, Loki is a shape shifter and in separate sources appears in the form of a salmon, a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named \u00de\u00f6kk (Old Norse 'thanks'). While sometimes friendly with the gods, Loki engineers the death of the beloved god Baldr. For this, Odin's specially engendered son V\u00e1li binds Loki with the entrails of one of his sons, where he writhes in pain. In the \"Prose Edda\", this son, Nari or Narfi, is killed by another of Loki's sons, who is also called V\u00e1li. The goddess Ska\u00f0i is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes.\nLoki is foretold to eventually break free from his bonds and, among the forces of the j\u00f6tnar, to go to battle with the gods, during which time his children play a key role in the destruction of all but two humans over the events of Ragnar\u00f6k. Loki has a particular enmity with the god Heimdallr. The two are in fact prophesied to kill one another during Ragnar\u00f6k.\nLoki is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources: the \"Prose Edda\" and \"Heimskringla\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; the Norwegian Rune Poems, in the poetry of skalds, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the Snaptun Stone, the Kirkby Stephen Stone and the Gosforth Cross. Scholars have debated Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some have described as that of a trickster god. Loki has been depicted in, or referenced in, a variety of media in modern popular culture.\nEtymology and alternate names.\nThe etymology of the name \"Loki\" has been extensively debated. The name has been associated with the Old Norse word \"logi\" ('flame') at times, but there does not seem to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese \"Lokki\", Danish \"Loke\", Norwegian \"Loke\" and \"Lokke\", Swedish \"Luki\" and \"Luku\") point to an origin in the Germanic root *\"luk\"-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish \"lockan\u00e4t\" and Faroese \"lokkanet\" ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese \"lokki\"~\"grindalokki\"~\"grindalokkur\", 'daddy-long-legs' referring both to crane flies and harvestmen, as well as modern Swedish \"\" (\"Locke-spiders\"). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in \"n\"- like \"Nokk(e)\", but this corresponds to the *\"luk\"- etymology insofar, as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *\"hnuk\"-, in contexts where western varieties used *\"luk\"-: \"\"nokke\" corresponds to \"n\u00f8kkel\"\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as \"loki\"~\"lokke\" to \"lykil\"\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).\nWhile it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at Ragnar\u00f6k, \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop. Hence, it is natural that Loki is the inventor of the fishnet, which consists of loops and knots, and that the word \"loki\" (\"lokke\", \"lokki\", \"loke\", \"luki\") is a term for makers of cobwebs: spiders and the like.\" Though not prominent in the oldest sources, this identity as a \"tangler\" may be the etymological meaning of Loki's name.\nIn various poems from the \"Poetic Edda\" (stanza 2 of \"Lokasenna\", stanza 41 of \"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\", and stanza 26 of \"Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l\"), and sections of the \"Prose Edda\" (chapter 32 of \"Gylfaginning\", stanza 8 of \"Haustl\u00f6ng\", and stanza 1 of \"\u00de\u00f3rsdr\u00e1pa\") Loki is alternatively referred to as \"Loptr\", which is generally considered derived from Old Norse \"lopt\" meaning \"air\", and therefore points to an association with the air.\nThe name \"Hve\u00f0rungr\" (Old Norse '?roarer') is also used in reference to Loki, occurring in names for Hel (such as in \"Ynglingatal\", where she is called \"hve\u00f0rungs m\u00e6r\") and in reference to Fenrir (as in \"V\u00f6luspa\").\nAttestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", Loki appears (or is referenced) in the poems \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", \"Lokasenna\", \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\", \"Reginsm\u00e1l\", \"Baldrs draumar\", and \"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\".\n\"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\".\nIn stanza 35 of the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", a v\u00f6lva tells Odin that, among many other things, she sees Sigyn sitting very unhappily with her bound husband, Loki, under a \"grove of hot springs\". In stanza 51, during the events of Ragnar\u00f6k, Loki appears free from his bonds and is referred to as the \"brother of B\u00fdleistr\" (here transcribed as \"Byleist\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn stanza 54, after consuming Odin and being killed by Odin's son V\u00ed\u00f0arr, Fenrir is described as \"Loki's kinsman\".\n\"Lokasenna\".\nThe poem \"Lokasenna\" (Old Norse \"Loki's Flyting\") centers around Loki flyting with other gods; Loki puts forth two stanzas of insults while the receiving figure responds with a single stanza, and then another figure chimes in. The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that \u00c6gir, a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and elves. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers Fimafeng and Eldir. Loki \"could not bear to hear that\", and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.\nEntrance and rejection.\nLoki comes out of the woods and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their mead with malice\". Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you\". Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.\nRe-entrance and insults.\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead\". Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The skaldic god Bragi is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite. Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOdin then asks his silent son V\u00ed\u00f0arr to stand up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred\". Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting\". Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament\", and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.\nThe goddess I\u00f0unn interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she will not say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she does not want the two of them to fight. The goddess Gefjun asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him\". Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced sei\u00f0r (a type of sorcery) on the island of \"Samsey\" (now Sams\u00f8, Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.\nFrigg, a major deity who is married to Odin, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of Fj\u00f6rgyn, a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers Vili and V\u00e9 into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son Baldr in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.\nThe goddess Freyja declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother Freyr, when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children\".\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the Vanir to the \u00c6sir during the \u00c6sir-Vanir War, that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot\", urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he will not keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with his sister (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.\nThe god Tyr defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people\", and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of Ragnar\u00f6k. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury\", further calling him a \"wretch\".\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnar\u00f6k. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Ger\u00f0r with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at Ragnar\u00f6k. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he is proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he is said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and dais when men go to battle.\nThe god Heimdallr says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he will not stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life\", that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess Ska\u00f0i says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging\", he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, \u00dejazi. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of Laufey\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds\".\nSif goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn\", drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif and Loki had been lovers, despite her marriage to Thor (an affair that is otherwise unattested). Beyla (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice\", that no worse woman has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children\", and calling her a bad \"serving-wench\".\nThe arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki.\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature\", stating that with his hammer Mj\u00f6llnir he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor will not be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at Ragnar\u00f6k. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east\", and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero\", and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the Skr\u00fdmir (\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to Hel, below the gates of N\u00e1grind.\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir\", and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of \"Lokasenna\" with a final stanza:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a salmon and hid in the waterfall of Franangrsfors, where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son Nari, and his son Narfi changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, his spouse, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.\n\"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\".\nIn the poem \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\", Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess Freyja, and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she would lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.\nIn J\u00f6tunheimr, the j\u00f6tunn \u00derymr sits on a burial mound, plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the \u00c6sir and the Elves; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to marry him. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he is still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies\". Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to marry \u00derymr. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed Br\u00edsingamen, falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of Laufey\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.\nAfter riding together in Thor's goat-driven chariot, the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to marry him. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess V\u00e1r. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.\n\"Reginsm\u00e1l\".\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem \"Reginsm\u00e1l\". The prose introduction to \"Reginsm\u00e1l\" details that, while the hero Sigurd was being fostered by Regin, son of Hreidmar, Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, H\u0153nir, and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; Andvari, who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a pike, and \u00d3tr, who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess R\u00e1n, borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"norn of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river Vadgelmir, and that their suffering will be long.\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring Andvarinaut, which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he does not believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.\n\"Baldrs draumar\".\nIn \"Baldr draumar\", Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in Hel, and questions her repeatedly about his son Baldr's bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\".\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma\", found within the poem \"Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0\". The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a, that Loki himself gave birth to the horse Sleipnir by the stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of B\u00fdleistr\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as \"Lopt\". Loki's consumption of a woman's heart is otherwise unattested.\n\"Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l\".\nIn the poem \"Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l\", a stanza mentions Loki (as \"Lopt\") in association with runes. In the poem, Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r describes to the hero Svipdagr that Sinmara keeps the weapon L\u00e6vateinn within a chest, locked with nine strong locks (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Prose Edda\".\n\"Gylfaginning\".\nThe \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\" tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\nHigh's introduction.\nLoki first appears in the \"Prose Edda\" in chapter 20 of the book \"Gylfaginning\", where he is referred to as the \"\u00e1s called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of Third explains to \"Gangleri\" (King Gylfi in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of \"Lokasenna\".\nLoki is more formally introduced by High in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the \u00c6sir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the \u00c6sir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is \"Lopt\", that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn F\u00e1rbauti, his mother is \"Laufey or N\u00e1l\", and his brothers are Helblindi and B\u00fdleistr. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Sigyn is introduced as being married to Loki, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from J\u00f6tunheimr; the wolf Fenrir, the serpent J\u00f6rmungandr, and the female being Hel. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki. In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.\nLoki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir.\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established Midgard and built Val-Hall\". The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as \"Loki Laufeyjarson\"\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, \"Laufey\").\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was\", Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a hrimthurs, they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"had such dealings\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"somewhat later\" Loki gives birth to a gray foal with eight legs; the horse Sleipnir\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"\nLoki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi.\nIn chapter 44, Third reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his two goats. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child \u00dej\u00e1lfi sucks the bone marrow from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter R\u00f6skva.\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in J\u00f6tunheimr. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of Skrymir, who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of \u00datgar\u00f0r it would be better for them to turn back now, for \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki's men there will not put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of Logi to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (\"Logi\", Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (\"Hugi\", Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in tides). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, J\u00f6rmungandr, and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (\"Elli\", Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.\nNorwegian rune poem.\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the Norwegian rune poem in connection with the Younger Futhark Bjarkan rune:\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death\".\nArchaeological record.\nSnaptun Stone.\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, Denmark. Made of soapstone that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" where sons of Ivaldi stitch up Loki's lips.\nThe stone is identified as a hearth stone; the nozzle of the bellows would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the Moesg\u00e5rd Museum near Aarhus, Denmark.\nKirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross.\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, England, features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki. Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white sandstone, and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in Gainford, County Durham and is now housed in the Durham Cathedral Library.\nThe mid-11th century Gosforth Cross has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.\nScandinavian folklore.\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as \"Lokke\". In Jutland, the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In Zealand the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist Axel Olrik cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\nThe expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the diocese of Viborg etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\nAnd in Thy, from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".\n\"Loka T\u00e1ttur\" or \"Lokka T\u00e1ttur\" (Faroese \"tale\u2014or \"\u00fe\u00e1ttr\"\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and H\u0153nir helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.\nOrigin and identification with other figures.\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"\nOrigin.\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, Jacob Grimm was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, Sophus Bugge theorized Loki to be variant of Lucifer of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After World War II, four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of Folke Str\u00f6m, who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a hypostasis of the god Odin. In 1959, Jan de Vries theorized that Loki is a typical example of a trickster figure. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, Anna Birgitta Rooth concluded that Loki was originally a spider. Anne Holtsmark, writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.\nIdentification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr.\nA popular theory proposed by a variety of scholars is that \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr\" is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in \"Haustl\u00f6ng\", in the prose prologue to \"Reginsm\u00e1l\" and also in the \"Loka T\u00e1ttur\" a Faroese ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in \"Haustl\u00f6ng\", strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including Jan de Vries and Georges Dum\u00e9zil, have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that \"Loki\" and \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr\" were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur \"Lokrur\". \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the \"Prose Edda\", as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the \"Poetic Edda\" are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to \"\u00derymlur\" where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.\nBinding.\nThe scholar John Lindow highlights the recurring pattern of the bound monster in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".\nModern popular culture.\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic fifth columnist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic Prometheus, a heroic bearer of culture\".\nLoki appears in Richard Wagner's opera cycle \"Ring of the Nibelung\" as \"Loge\" (a play on Old Norse \"loge\", \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as Wotan's assistant rather than Donner's), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera \"Das Rheingold\", he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.\nIn 2008, five black smokers were discovered between Greenland and Norway, the most northerly group so far discovered, and given the name Loki's Castle, as their shape reminded discoverers of a fantasy castle, and (a University of Bergen press release says) \"Loki\" was \"an appropriate name for a field that was so difficult to locate\".\nIn the 1994 film \"The Mask\", the main character Stanley Ipkiss finds Loki's mask. Alan Cumming portrayed Loki in the 2005 sequel \"Son of the Mask\".\nIn the video game \"Persona 5,\" the character of Goro Akechi utilizes a manifestation of Loki, or a \"Persona,\" in combat. His outward, gentle prince-like personality is reflected with his Robin Hood Persona.\nLoki appears in Marvel Comics and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Hiddleston, as a villain (or antihero) who consistently comes into conflict with the superhero Thor, his adopted brother and archenemy. \nLoki is a central character in Neil Gaiman's novel \"American Gods\" and an important character in a few arcs of Gaiman's comic \"The Sandman\". Loki is also a central figure in the series of fantasy novels by Joanne Harris: \"Runemarks\", \"Runelight\", \"The Gospel of Loki\" and \"The Testament of Loki\".\nHe appears in the games Asgard's Wrath and Asgard's Wrath 2.\nLoki has also appeared in the T.V. series, \"Supernatural\", and is played by Richard Speight, Jr. He is described as a trickster and a demigod.\nLoki appears in \"\" as part of the Asgard arc. In it, players are able to fight and defeat Loki.\nReferences.\nCited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18016", "revid": "49426652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18016", "title": "Lisp (programming language)", "text": "Programming language family\nLisp (historically LISP, an abbreviation of \"list processing\") is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.\nOriginally specified in the late 1950s, it is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use, after Fortran. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket, and Clojure.\nLisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by (though not originally derived from) the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became a favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler, and the read\u2013eval\u2013print loop.\nThe name \"LISP\" derives from \"List Processor\". Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.\nThe interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as \"s-expressions\", or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function that takes three arguments would be called as .\nHistory.\nJohn McCarthy began developing Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was motivated by a desire to create an AI programming language that would work on the IBM 704, as he believed that \"IBM looked like a good bet to pursue Artificial Intelligence research vigorously.\" He was inspired by Information Processing Language, which was also based on list processing, but did not use it because it was designed for different hardware and he found an algebraic language more appealing. Due to these factors, he consulted on the design of the Fortran List Processing Language, which was implemented as a Fortran library. However, he was dissatisfied with it because it did not support recursion or a modern if-then-else statement (which was a new concept when Lisp was first introduced) .\nMcCarthy's original notation used bracketed \"M-expressions\" that would be translated into S-expressions. As an example, the M-expression is equivalent to the S-expression . Once Lisp was implemented, programmers rapidly chose to use S-expressions, and M-expressions were abandoned. M-expressions surfaced again with short-lived attempts of MLisp by Horace Enea and CGOL by Vaughan Pratt.\nLisp was first implemented by Steve Russell on an IBM 704 computer using punched cards. Russell was working for McCarthy at the time and realized (to McCarthy's surprise) that the Lisp \"eval\" function could be implemented in machine code.\nAccording to McCarthy\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Steve Russell said, look, why don't I program this \"eval\"\u00a0... and I said to him, ho, ho, you're confusing theory with practice, this \"eval\" is intended for reading, not for computing. But he went ahead and did it. That is, he compiled the \"eval\" in my paper into IBM 704 machine code, fixing bugs, and then advertised this as a Lisp interpreter, which it certainly was. So at that point Lisp had essentially the form that it has today\u00a0...\nThe result was a working Lisp interpreter which could be used to run Lisp programs, or more properly, \"evaluate Lisp expressions\".\nTwo assembly language macros for the IBM 704 became the primitive operations for decomposing lists: car (\"Contents of the Address part of Register\" number) and cdr (\"Contents of the Decrement part of Register\" number), where \"register\" refers to registers of the computer's central processing unit (CPU). Lisp dialects still use and ( and ) for the operations that return the first item in a list and the rest of the list, respectively.\nMcCarthy published Lisp's design in a paper in \"Communications of the ACM\" on April 1, 1960, entitled \"Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I\". He showed that with a few simple operators and a notation for anonymous functions borrowed from Church, one can build a Turing-complete language for algorithms.\nThe first complete Lisp compiler, written in Lisp, was implemented in 1962 by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at MIT, and could be compiled by simply having an existing LISP interpreter interpret the compiler code, producing machine code output able to be executed at a 40-fold improvement in speed over that of the interpreter. This compiler introduced the Lisp model of incremental compilation, in which compiled and interpreted functions can intermix freely. The language used in Hart and Levin's memo is much closer to modern Lisp style than McCarthy's earlier code.\nGarbage collection routines were developed by MIT graduate student Daniel Edwards, prior to 1962.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, a great effort was made to unify the work on new Lisp dialects (mostly successors to Maclisp such as ZetaLisp and NIL (New Implementation of Lisp)) into a single language. The new language, Common Lisp, was somewhat compatible with the dialects it replaced (the book \"Common Lisp the Language\" notes the compatibility of various constructs). In 1994, ANSI published the Common Lisp standard, \"ANSI X3.226-1994 Information Technology Programming Language Common Lisp\".\nConnection to artificial intelligence.\nSince inception, Lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence research community, especially on PDP-10 systems. Lisp was used as the implementation of the language Micro Planner, which was used in the famous AI system SHRDLU. In the 1970s, as AI research spawned commercial offshoots, the performance of existing Lisp systems became a growing issue, as programmers needed to be familiar with the performance ramifications of the various techniques and choices involved in the implementation of Lisp.\nGenealogy and variants.\nOver its sixty-year history, Lisp has spawned many variations on the core theme of an S-expression language. Some of these variations have been standardized and implemented by different groups with different priorities (for example, both Common Lisp and Scheme have multiple implementations). However, in other cases a software project defines a Lisp without a standard and there is no clear distinction between the dialect and the implementation (for example, Clojure and Emacs Lisp fall into this category).\nDifferences between dialects (and/or implementations) may be quite visible\u2014for instance, Common Lisp uses the keyword codice_1 to name a function, but Scheme uses codice_2. Within a dialect that is standardized conforming implementations support the same core language, but with different extensions and libraries. This sometimes also creates quite visible changes from the base language - for instance, Guile (an implementation of Scheme) uses codice_3 to create functions which can have default arguments and/or keyword arguments, neither of which are standardized.\n2000 to present.\nAfter having declined somewhat in the 1990s, Lisp has experienced a resurgence of interest after 2000. Most new activity has been focused around implementations of Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Clojure, and Racket, and includes development of new portable libraries and applications.\nMany new Lisp programmers were inspired by writers such as Paul Graham and Eric S. Raymond to pursue a language others considered antiquated. New Lisp programmers often describe the language as an eye-opening experience and claim to be substantially more productive than in other languages. This increase in awareness may be contrasted to the \"AI winter\" and Lisp's brief gain in the mid-1990s.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], there were eleven actively maintained Common Lisp implementations.\nThe open source community has created new supporting infrastructure: CLiki is a wiki that collects Common Lisp related information, the Common Lisp directory lists resources, #lisp is a popular IRC channel and allows the sharing and commenting of code snippets (with support by lisppaste, an IRC bot written in Lisp), Planet Lisp collects the contents of various Lisp-related blogs, on LispForum users discuss Lisp topics, Lispjobs is a service for announcing job offers and there is a weekly news service, \"Weekly Lisp News\". \"Common-lisp.net\" is a hosting site for open source Common Lisp projects. Quicklisp is a library manager for Common Lisp.\nFifty years of Lisp (1958\u20132008) was celebrated at LISP50@OOPSLA. There are regular local user meetings in Boston, Vancouver, and Hamburg. Other events include the European Common Lisp Meeting, the European Lisp Symposium and an International Lisp Conference.\nThe Scheme community actively maintains over twenty implementations. Several significant new implementations (Chicken, Gambit, Gauche, Ikarus, Larceny, Ypsilon) have been developed in the 2000s (decade). The Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme standard of Scheme was widely accepted in the Scheme community. The Scheme Requests for Implementation process has created a lot of quasi-standard libraries and extensions for Scheme. User communities of individual Scheme implementations continue to grow. A new language standardization process was started in 2003 and led to the R6RS Scheme standard in 2007. Academic use of Scheme for teaching computer science seems to have declined somewhat. Some universities are no longer using Scheme in their computer science introductory courses; MIT now uses Python instead of Scheme for its undergraduate computer science program and MITx massive open online course.\nThere are several new dialects of Lisp: Arc, Hy, Nu, Liskell, and LFE (Lisp Flavored Erlang). The parser for Julia is implemented in Femtolisp, a dialect of Scheme (Julia is inspired by Scheme, which in turn is a Lisp dialect).\nIn October 2019, Paul Graham released http://, \"a new dialect of Lisp.\"\nMajor dialects.\nCommon Lisp and Scheme represent two major streams of Lisp development. These languages embody significantly different design choices.\nCommon Lisp is a successor to Maclisp. The primary influences were Lisp Machine Lisp, Maclisp, NIL, S-1 Lisp, Spice Lisp, and Scheme. It has many of the features of Lisp Machine Lisp (a large Lisp dialect used to program Lisp Machines), but was designed to be efficiently implementable on any personal computer or workstation. Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language and thus has a large language standard including many built-in data types, functions, macros and other language elements, and an object system (Common Lisp Object System). Common Lisp also borrowed certain features from Scheme such as lexical scoping and lexical closures. Common Lisp implementations are available for targeting different platforms such as the LLVM, the Java virtual machine,\nx86-64, PowerPC, Alpha, ARM, Motorola 68000, and MIPS, and operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Dragonfly BSD, and Heroku.\nScheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy L. Steele, Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman. It was designed to have exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions. Designed about a decade earlier than Common Lisp, Scheme is a more minimalist design. It has a much smaller set of standard features but with certain implementation features (such as tail-call optimization and full continuations) not specified in Common Lisp. A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and message passing styles, find convenient expression in Scheme. Scheme continues to evolve with a series of standards (Revisedn Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme) and a series of Scheme Requests for Implementation.\nClojure is a dialect of Lisp that targets mainly the Java virtual machine, and the Common Language Runtime (CLR), the Python VM, the Ruby VM YARV, and compiling to JavaScript. It is designed to be a pragmatic general-purpose language. Clojure draws considerable influences from Haskell and places a very strong emphasis on immutability. Clojure provides access to Java frameworks and libraries, with optional type hints and type inference, so that calls to Java can avoid reflection and enable fast primitive operations. Clojure is not designed to be backwards compatible with other Lisp dialects.\nFurther, Lisp dialects are used as scripting languages in many applications, with the best-known being Emacs Lisp in the Emacs editor, AutoLISP and later Visual Lisp in AutoCAD, Nyquist in Audacity, and Scheme in LilyPond. The potential small size of a useful Scheme interpreter makes it particularly popular for embedded scripting. Examples include SIOD and TinyScheme, both of which have been successfully embedded in the GIMP image processor under the generic name \"Script-fu\". LIBREP, a Lisp interpreter by John Harper originally based on the Emacs Lisp language, has been embedded in the Sawfish window manager.\nStandardized dialects.\nLisp has officially standardized dialects: R6RS Scheme, R7RS Scheme, IEEE Scheme, ANSI Common Lisp and ISO ISLISP.\nLanguage innovations.\nPaul Graham identifies nine important aspects of Lisp that distinguished it from existing languages like Fortran:\nLisp was the first language where the structure of program code is represented faithfully and directly in a standard data structure\u2014a quality much later dubbed \"homoiconicity\". Thus, Lisp functions can be manipulated, altered or even created within a Lisp program without lower-level manipulations. This is generally considered one of the main advantages of the language with regard to its expressive power, and makes the language suitable for syntactic macros and meta-circular evaluation.\nA conditional using an \"if\u2013then\u2013else\" syntax was invented by McCarthy for a chess program written in Fortran. He proposed its inclusion in ALGOL, but it was not made part of the Algol 58 specification. For Lisp, McCarthy used the more general \"cond\"-structure. Algol 60 took up \"if\u2013then\u2013else\" and popularized it.\nLisp deeply influenced Alan Kay, the leader of the research team that developed Smalltalk at Xerox PARC; and in turn Lisp was influenced by Smalltalk, with later dialects adopting object-oriented programming features (inheritance classes, encapsulating instances, message passing, etc.) in the 1970s. The Flavors object system introduced the concept of multiple inheritance and the mixin. The Common Lisp Object System provides multiple inheritance, multimethods with multiple dispatch, and first-class generic functions, yielding a flexible and powerful form of dynamic dispatch. It has served as the template for many subsequent Lisp (including Scheme) object systems, which are often implemented via a metaobject protocol, a reflective meta-circular design in which the object system is defined in terms of itself: Lisp was only the second language after Smalltalk (and is still one of the very few languages) to possess such a metaobject system. Many years later, Alan Kay suggested that as a result of the confluence of these features, only Smalltalk and Lisp could be regarded as properly conceived object-oriented programming systems.\nLisp introduced the concept of automatic garbage collection, in which the system walks the heap looking for unused memory. Progress in modern sophisticated garbage collection algorithms such as generational garbage collection was stimulated by its use in Lisp.\nEdsger W. Dijkstra in his 1972 Turing Award lecture said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLargely because of its resource requirements with respect to early computing hardware (including early microprocessors), Lisp did not become as popular outside of the AI community as Fortran and the ALGOL-descended C language. Because of its suitability to complex and dynamic applications, Lisp enjoyed some resurgence of popular interest in the 2010s.\n\"This article's examples are written in Common Lisp (though most are also valid in Scheme).\"\nSyntax and semantics.\nSymbolic expressions (S-expressions).\nLisp is an expression oriented language. Unlike most other languages, no distinction is made between \"expressions\" and \"statements\"; all code and data are written as expressions. When an expression is \"evaluated\", it produces a value (possibly multiple values), which can then be embedded into other expressions. Each value can be any data type.\nMcCarthy's 1958 paper introduced two types of syntax: \"Symbolic expressions\" (S-expressions, sexps), which mirror the internal representation of code and data; and \"Meta expressions\" (M-expressions), which express functions of S-expressions. M-expressions never found favor, and almost all Lisps today use S-expressions to manipulate both code and data.\nThe use of parentheses is Lisp's most immediately obvious difference from other programming language families. As a result, students have long given Lisp nicknames such as \"Lost In Stupid Parentheses\", or \"Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses\". However, the S-expression syntax is also responsible for much of Lisp's power: the syntax is simple and consistent, which facilitates manipulation by computer. However, the syntax of Lisp is not limited to traditional parentheses notation. It can be extended to include alternative notations. For example, XMLisp is a Common Lisp extension that employs the metaobject protocol to integrate S-expressions with the Extensible Markup Language (XML).\nThe reliance on expressions gives the language great flexibility. Because Lisp functions are written as lists, they can be processed exactly like data. This allows easy writing of programs which manipulate other programs (metaprogramming). Many Lisp dialects exploit this feature using macro systems, which enables extension of the language almost without limit.\nLists.\nA Lisp list is written with its elements separated by whitespace, and surrounded by parentheses. For example, is a list whose elements are the three \"atoms\" , , and . These values are implicitly typed: they are respectively two integers and a Lisp-specific data type called a \"symbol\", and do not have to be declared as such.\nThe empty list is also represented as the special atom . This is the only entity in Lisp which is both an atom and a list.\nExpressions are written as lists, using prefix notation. The first element in the list is the name of a function, the name of a macro, a lambda expression or the name of a \"special operator\" (see below). The remainder of the list are the arguments. For example, the function returns its arguments as a list, so the expression\n (list 1 2 (quote foo))\nevaluates to the list . The \"quote\" before the in the preceding example is a \"special operator\" which returns its argument without evaluating it. Any unquoted expressions are recursively evaluated before the enclosing expression is evaluated. For example,\n (list 1 2 (list 3 4))\nevaluates to the list . The third argument is a list; lists can be nested.\nOperators.\nArithmetic operators are treated similarly. The expression\n (+ 1 2 3 4)\nevaluates to 10. The equivalent under infix notation would be \"\".\nLisp has no notion of operators as implemented in ALGOL-derived languages. Arithmetic operators in Lisp are variadic functions (or \"n-ary\"), able to take any number of arguments. A C-style '++' increment operator is sometimes implemented under the name codice_4 giving syntax\n (incf x)\nequivalent to codice_5, returning the new value of codice_6.\n\"Special operators\" (sometimes called \"special forms\") provide Lisp's control structure. For example, the special operator takes three arguments. If the first argument is non-nil, it evaluates to the second argument; otherwise, it evaluates to the third argument. Thus, the expression\n (if nil\n (list 1 2 \"foo\")\n (list 3 4 \"bar\"))\nevaluates to . Of course, this would be more useful if a non-trivial expression had been substituted in place of .\nLisp also provides logical operators and, or and not. The and and or operators do short-circuit evaluation and will return their first nil and non-nil argument respectively.\n (or (and \"zero\" nil \"never\") \"James\" 'task 'time)\nwill evaluate to \"James\".\nLambda expressions and function definition.\nAnother special operator, , is used to bind variables to values which are then evaluated within an expression. This operator is also used to create functions: the arguments to are a list of arguments, and the expression or expressions to which the function evaluates (the returned value is the value of the last expression that is evaluated). The expression\n (lambda (arg) (+ arg 1))\nevaluates to a function that, when applied, takes one argument, binds it to and returns the number one greater than that argument. Lambda expressions are treated no differently from named functions; they are invoked the same way. Therefore, the expression\n ((lambda (arg) (+ arg 1)) 5)\nevaluates to . Here, we're doing a function application: we execute the anonymous function by passing to it the value 5.\nNamed functions are created by storing a lambda expression in a symbol using the defun macro.\n (defun foo (a b c d) (+ a b c d))\n defines a new function named in the global environment. It is conceptually similar to the expression:\n (setf (fdefinition 'f) #'(lambda (a) (block f b...)))\nwhere is a macro used to set the value of the first argument to a new function object. is a global function definition for the function named . is an abbreviation for special operator, returning a function object.\nAtoms.\nIn the original LISP there were two fundamental data types: atoms and lists. A list was a finite ordered sequence of elements, where each element is either an atom or a list, and an atom was a number or a symbol. A symbol was essentially a unique named item, written as an alphanumeric string in source code, and used either as a variable name or as a data item in symbolic processing. For example, the list contains three elements: the symbol , the list , and the number 2.\nThe essential difference between atoms and lists was that atoms were immutable and unique. Two atoms that appeared in different places in source code but were written in exactly the same way represented the same object, whereas each list was a separate object that could be altered independently of other lists and could be distinguished from other lists by comparison operators.\nAs more data types were introduced in later Lisp dialects, and programming styles evolved, the concept of an atom lost importance. Many dialects still retained the predicate \"atom\" for legacy compatibility, defining it true for any object which is not a cons.\nConses and lists.\nA Lisp list is implemented as a singly linked list. Each cell of this list is called a \"cons\" (in Scheme, a \"pair\") and is composed of two pointers, called the \"car\" and \"cdr\". These are respectively equivalent to the and fields discussed in the article \"linked list\".\nOf the many data structures that can be built out of cons cells, one of the most basic is called a \"proper list\". A proper list is either the special (empty list) symbol, or a cons in which the points to a datum (which may be another cons structure, such as a list), and the points to another proper list.\nIf a given cons is taken to be the head of a linked list, then its car points to the first element of the list, and its cdr points to the rest of the list. For this reason, the and functions are also called and when referring to conses which are part of a linked list (rather than, say, a tree).\nThus, a Lisp list is not an atomic object, as an instance of a container class in C++ or Java would be. A list is nothing more than an aggregate of linked conses. A variable that refers to a given list is simply a pointer to the first cons in the list. Traversal of a list can be done by \"cdring down\" the list; that is, taking successive cdrs to visit each cons of the list; or by using any of several higher-order functions to map a function over a list.\nBecause conses and lists are so universal in Lisp systems, it is a common misconception that they are Lisp's only data structures. In fact, all but the most simplistic Lisps have other data structures, such as vectors (arrays), hash tables, structures, and so forth.\nS-expressions represent lists.\nParenthesized S-expressions represent linked list structures. There are several ways to represent the same list as an S-expression. A cons can be written in \"dotted-pair notation\" as , where is the car and the cdr. A longer proper list might be written in dotted-pair notation. This is conventionally abbreviated as in \"list notation\". An improper list may be written in a combination of the two \u2013 as for the list of three conses whose last cdr is (i.e., the list in fully specified form).\nList-processing procedures.\nLisp provides many built-in procedures for accessing and controlling lists. Lists can be created directly with the procedure, which takes any number of arguments, and returns the list of these arguments.\n (list 1 2 'a 3)\n ;Output: (1 2 a 3)\n (list 1 '(2 3) 4)\n ;Output: (1 (2 3) 4)\nBecause of the way that lists are constructed from cons pairs, the procedure can be used to add an element to the front of a list. The procedure is asymmetric in how it handles list arguments, because of how lists are constructed.\n (cons 1 '(2 3))\n ;Output: (1 2 3)\n (cons '(1 2) '(3 4))\n ;Output: ((1 2) 3 4)\nThe procedure appends two (or more) lists to one another. Because Lisp lists are linked lists, appending two lists has asymptotic time complexity formula_1\n (append '(1 2) '(3 4))\n ;Output: (1 2 3 4)\n (append '(1 2 3) '() '(a) '(5 6))\n ;Output: (1 2 3 a 5 6)\nShared structure.\nLisp lists, being simple linked lists, can share structure with one another. That is to say, two lists can have the same \"tail\", or final sequence of conses. For instance, after the execution of the following Common Lisp code:\nthe lists and are and respectively. However, the tail is the same structure in both lists. It is not a copy; the cons cells pointing to and are in the same memory locations for both lists.\nSharing structure rather than copying can give a dramatic performance improvement. However, this technique can interact in undesired ways with functions that alter lists passed to them as arguments. Altering one list, such as by replacing the with a , will affect the other:\n (setf (third foo) 'goose)\nThis changes to , but thereby also changes to \u2013 a possibly unexpected result. This can be a source of bugs, and functions which alter their arguments are documented as \"destructive\" for this very reason.\nAficionados of functional programming avoid destructive functions. In the Scheme dialect, which favors the functional style, the names of destructive functions are marked with a cautionary exclamation point, or \"bang\"\u2014such as (read \"set car bang\"), which replaces the car of a cons. In the Common Lisp dialect, destructive functions are commonplace; the equivalent of is named for \"replace car\". This function is rarely seen, however, as Common Lisp includes a special facility, , to make it easier to define and use destructive functions. A frequent style in Common Lisp is to write code functionally (without destructive calls) when prototyping, then to add destructive calls as an optimization where it is safe to do so.\nSelf-evaluating forms and quoting.\nLisp evaluates expressions which are entered by the user. Symbols and lists evaluate to some other (usually, simpler) expression \u2013 for instance, a symbol evaluates to the value of the variable it names; evaluates to . However, most other forms evaluate to themselves: if entering into Lisp, it returns .\nAny expression can also be marked to prevent it from being evaluated (as is necessary for symbols and lists). This is the role of the special operator, or its abbreviation (one quotation mark). For instance, usually if entering the symbol , it returns the value of the corresponding variable (or an error, if there is no such variable). To refer to the literal symbol, enter or, usually, .\nBoth Common Lisp and Scheme also support the \"backquote\" operator (termed \"quasiquote\" in Scheme), entered with the character (Backtick). This is almost the same as the plain quote, except it allows expressions to be evaluated and their values interpolated into a quoted list with the comma \"unquote\" and comma-at \"splice\" operators. If the variable has the value then evaluates to , while evaluates to . The backquote is most often used in defining macro expansions.\nSelf-evaluating forms and quoted forms are Lisp's equivalent of literals. It may be possible to modify the values of (mutable) literals in program code. For instance, if a function returns a quoted form, and the code that calls the function modifies the form, this may alter the behavior of the function on subsequent invocations.\n '(one two three))\n (setf (third stuff) 'bizarre)) ; bad!\nModifying a quoted form like this is generally considered bad style, and is defined by ANSI Common Lisp as erroneous (resulting in \"undefined\" behavior in compiled files, because the file-compiler can coalesce similar constants, put them in write-protected memory, etc.).\nLisp's formalization of quotation has been noted by Douglas Hofstadter (in \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\") and others as an example of the philosophical idea of self-reference.\nScope and closure.\nThe Lisp family splits over the use of dynamic or static (a.k.a. lexical) scope. Clojure, Common Lisp and Scheme make use of static scoping by default, while newLISP, Picolisp and the embedded languages in Emacs and AutoCAD use dynamic scoping. Since version 24.1, Emacs uses both dynamic and lexical scoping.\nList structure of program code; exploitation by macros and compilers.\nA fundamental distinction between Lisp and other languages is that in Lisp, the textual representation of a program is simply a human-readable description of the same internal data structures (linked lists, symbols, number, characters, etc.) as would be used by the underlying Lisp system.\nLisp uses this to implement a very powerful macro system. Like other macro languages such as the one defined by the C preprocessor (the macro preprocessor for the C, Objective-C and C++ programming languages), a macro returns code that can then be compiled. However, unlike C preprocessor macros, the macros are Lisp functions and so can exploit the full power of Lisp.\nFurther, because Lisp code has the same structure as lists, macros can be built with any of the list-processing functions in the language. In short, anything that Lisp can do to a data structure, Lisp macros can do to code. In contrast, in most other languages, the parser's output is purely internal to the language implementation and cannot be manipulated by the programmer.\nThis feature makes it easy to develop \"efficient\" languages within languages. For example, the Common Lisp Object System can be implemented cleanly as a language extension using macros. This means that if an application needs a different inheritance mechanism, it can use a different object system. This is in stark contrast to most other languages; for example, Java does not support multiple inheritance and there is no reasonable way to add it.\nIn simplistic Lisp implementations, this list structure is directly interpreted to run the program; a function is literally a piece of list structure which is traversed by the interpreter in executing it. However, most substantial Lisp systems also include a compiler. The compiler translates list structure into machine code or bytecode for execution. This code can run as fast as code compiled in conventional languages such as C.\nMacros expand before the compilation step, and thus offer some interesting options. If a program needs a precomputed table, then a macro might create the table at compile time, so the compiler need only output the table and need not call code to create the table at run time. Some Lisp implementations even have a mechanism, codice_7, that allows code to be present during compile time (when a macro would need it), but not present in the emitted module.\nEvaluation and the read\u2013eval\u2013print loop.\nLisp languages are often used with an interactive command line, which may be combined with an integrated development environment (IDE). The user types in expressions at the command line, or directs the IDE to transmit them to the Lisp system. Lisp \"reads\" the entered expressions, \"evaluates\" them, and \"prints\" the result. For this reason, the Lisp command line is called a \"read\u2013eval\u2013print loop\" (REPL).\nThe basic operation of the REPL is as follows. This is a simplistic description which omits many elements of a real Lisp, such as quoting and macros.\nThe function accepts textual S-expressions as input, and parses them into an internal data structure. For instance, if you type the text at the prompt, translates this into a linked list with three elements: the symbol , the number 1, and the number 2. It so happens that this list is also a valid piece of Lisp code; that is, it can be evaluated. This is because the car of the list names a function\u2014the addition operation.\nA will be read as a single symbol. will be read as the number one hundred and twenty-three. will be read as the string \"123\".\nThe function evaluates the data, returning zero or more other Lisp data as a result. Evaluation does not have to mean interpretation; some Lisp systems compile every expression to native machine code. It is simple, however, to describe evaluation as interpretation: To evaluate a list whose car names a function, first evaluates each of the arguments given in its cdr, then applies the function to the arguments. In this case, the function is addition, and applying it to the argument list yields the answer . This is the result of the evaluation.\nThe symbol evaluates to the value of the symbol foo. Data like the string \"123\" evaluates to the same string. The list evaluates to the list (1 2 3).\nIt is the job of the function to represent output to the user. For a simple result such as this is trivial. An expression which evaluated to a piece of list structure would require that traverse the list and print it out as an S-expression.\nTo implement a Lisp REPL, it is necessary only to implement these three functions and an infinite-loop function. (Naturally, the implementation of will be complex, since it must also implement all special operators like or .) This done, a basic REPL is one line of code: .\nThe Lisp REPL typically also provides input editing, an input history, error handling and an interface to the debugger.\nLisp is usually evaluated eagerly. In Common Lisp, arguments are evaluated in applicative order ('leftmost innermost'), while in Scheme order of arguments is undefined, leaving room for optimization by a compiler.\nControl structures.\nLisp originally had very few control structures, but many more were added during the language's evolution. (Lisp's original conditional operator, , is the precursor to later structures.)\nProgrammers in the Scheme dialect often express loops using tail recursion. Scheme's commonality in academic computer science has led some students to believe that tail recursion is the only, or the most common, way to write iterations in Lisp, but this is incorrect. All oft-seen Lisp dialects have imperative-style iteration constructs, from Scheme's loop to Common Lisp's complex expressions. Moreover, the key issue that makes this an objective rather than subjective matter is that Scheme makes specific requirements for the handling of tail calls, and thus the reason that the use of tail recursion is generally encouraged for Scheme is that the practice is expressly supported by the language definition. By contrast, ANSI Common Lisp does not require the optimization commonly termed a tail call elimination. Thus, the fact that tail recursive style as a casual replacement for the use of more traditional iteration constructs (such as , or ) is discouraged in Common Lisp is not just a matter of stylistic preference, but potentially one of efficiency (since an apparent tail call in Common Lisp may not compile as a simple jump) and program correctness (since tail recursion may increase stack use in Common Lisp, risking stack overflow).\nSome Lisp control structures are \"special operators\", equivalent to other languages' syntactic keywords. Expressions using these operators have the same surface appearance as function calls, but differ in that the arguments are not necessarily evaluated\u2014or, in the case of an iteration expression, may be evaluated more than once.\nIn contrast to most other major programming languages, Lisp allows implementing control structures using the language. Several control structures are implemented as Lisp macros, and can even be macro-expanded by the programmer who wants to know how they work.\nBoth Common Lisp and Scheme have operators for non-local control flow. The differences in these operators are some of the deepest differences between the two dialects. Scheme supports \"re-entrant continuations\" using the procedure, which allows a program to save (and later restore) a particular place in execution. Common Lisp does not support re-entrant continuations, but does support several ways of handling escape continuations.\nOften, the same algorithm can be expressed in Lisp in either an imperative or a functional style. As noted above, Scheme tends to favor the functional style, using tail recursion and continuations to express control flow. However, imperative style is still quite possible. The style preferred by many Common Lisp programmers may seem more familiar to programmers used to structured languages such as C, while that preferred by Schemers more closely resembles pure-functional languages such as Haskell.\nBecause of Lisp's early heritage in list processing, it has a wide array of higher-order functions relating to iteration over sequences. In many cases where an explicit loop would be needed in other languages (like a loop in C) in Lisp the same task can be accomplished with a higher-order function. (The same is true of many functional programming languages.)\nA good example is a function which in Scheme is called and in Common Lisp is called . Given a function and one or more lists, applies the function successively to the lists' elements in order, collecting the results in a new list:\n (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3 4 5) '(10 20 30 40 50))\nThis applies the function to each corresponding pair of list elements, yielding the result .\nExamples.\nHere are examples of Common Lisp code.\nThe basic \"Hello, World!\" program:\nLisp syntax lends itself naturally to recursion. Mathematical problems such as the enumeration of recursively defined sets are simple to express in this notation. For example, to evaluate a number's factorial:\n (if (zerop n) 1\n (* n (factorial (1- n)))))\nAn alternative implementation takes less stack space than the previous version if the underlying Lisp system optimizes tail recursion:\n (if (zerop n) acc\n (factorial (1- n) (* acc n))))\nContrast the examples above with an iterative version which uses Common Lisp's macro:\n (loop for i from 1 to n\n for fac = 1 then (* fac i)\n finally (return fac)))\nThe following function reverses a list. (Lisp's built-in \"reverse\" function does the same thing.)\n (let ((return-value))\n (dolist (e list) (push e return-value))\n return-value))\nObject systems.\nVarious object systems and models have been built on top of, alongside, or into Lisp, including\nOperating systems.\nSeveral operating systems, including language-based systems, are based on Lisp (use Lisp features, conventions, methods, data structures, etc.), or are written in Lisp, including:\nGenera, renamed Open Genera, by Symbolics; Medley, written in Interlisp, originally a family of graphical operating systems that ran on Xerox's later Star workstations; Mezzano; Interim; ChrysaLisp, by developers of Tao Systems' TAOS; and also the Guix System for GNU/Linux.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nHistory\nAssociations and meetings\nBooks and tutorials\nInterviews\nResources"}

The trivial logarithmic identities are as follows:\nExplanations.\nBy definition, we know that:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 and formula_3.\nSetting formula_4,\nwe can see that:\nformula_5\nSo, substituting these values into the formula, we see that:\nformula_6\nwhich gets us the first property.\nSetting formula_7, we can see that:\nformula_8\nSo, substituting these values into the formula, we see that:\nformula_9\nwhich gets us the second property.\nCancelling exponentials.\nLogarithms and exponentials with the same base cancel each other. This is true because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations\u00a0\u2013 much like the same way multiplication and division are inverse operations, and addition and subtraction are inverse operations:\nformula_10\nformula_11\nBoth of the above are derived from the following two equations that define a logarithm: (note that in this explanation, the variables of formula_12 and formula_12 may not be referring to the same number)\nformula_14\nLooking at the equation formula_15, and substituting the value for formula_12 of\nformula_17, we get the following equation:\nformula_18\nwhich gets us the first equation.\nAnother more rough way to think about it is that formula_19,\nand that that \"formula_20\" is formula_21.\nLooking at the equation formula_22, and substituting the value for formula_23 of formula_24, we get the following equation:\nformula_25\nwhich gets us the second equation.\nAnother more rough way to think about it is that formula_26, and that that something \"formula_20\" is formula_28.\nUsing simpler operations.\nLogarithms can be used to make calculations easier. For example, two numbers can be multiplied just by using a logarithm table and adding. These are often known as logarithmic properties, which are documented in the table below. The first three operations below assume that \"x\" = \"b\"\"c\" and/or \"y\" = \"b\"\"d\", so that log\"b\"(\"x\") = \"c\" and log\"b\"(\"y\") = \"d\". Derivations also use the log definitions \"x\" = \"b\"log\"b\"(\"x\") and \"x\" = log\"b\"(\"b\"\"x\").\nWhere formula_29, formula_12, and formula_31 are positive real numbers and formula_32, and formula_33 and formula_34 are real numbers.\nThe laws result from canceling exponentials and the appropriate law of indices. Starting with the first law:\nformula_35\nThe law for powers exploits another of the laws of indices:\nformula_36\nThe law relating to quotients then follows:\nformula_37\nformula_38\nSimilarly, the root law is derived by rewriting the root as a reciprocal power:\nformula_39\nDerivations of product, quotient, and power rules.\nThese are the three main logarithm laws, rules, or principles, from which the other properties listed above can be proven. Each of these logarithm properties correspond to their respective exponent law, and their derivations and proofs will hinge on those facts. There are multiple ways to derive or prove each logarithm law\u00a0\u2013 this is just one possible method.\nLogarithm of a product.\nTo state the \"logarithm of a product\" law formally:\nformula_40\nDerivation:\nLet formula_41, where formula_3,\nand let formula_43. We want to relate the expressions formula_44 and formula_45. This can be done more easily by rewriting in terms of exponentials, whose properties we already know. Additionally, since we are going to refer to formula_44 and formula_45 quite often, we will give them some variable names to make working with them easier: Let formula_48, and let formula_49.\nRewriting these as exponentials, we see that\nformula_50\nFrom here, we can relate formula_51 (i.e. formula_12) and formula_53 (i.e. formula_31) using exponent laws as\nformula_55\nTo recover the logarithms, we apply formula_56 to both sides of the equality.\nformula_57\nThe right side may be simplified using one of the logarithm properties from before: we know that formula_58, giving\nformula_59\nWe now resubstitute the values for formula_60 and formula_61 into our equation, so our final expression is only in terms of formula_12, formula_31, and formula_29.\nformula_65\nThis completes the derivation.\nLogarithm of a quotient.\nTo state the \"logarithm of a quotient\" law formally:\nformula_66\nDerivation:\nLet formula_41, where formula_3,\nand let formula_43.\nWe want to relate the expressions formula_44 and formula_45. This can be done more easily by rewriting in terms of exponentials, whose properties we already know. Additionally, since we are going to refer to formula_44 and formula_45 quite often, we will give them some variable names to make working with them easier: Let formula_48, and let formula_49.\nRewriting these as exponentials, we see that:\nformula_50\nFrom here, we can relate formula_51 (i.e. formula_12) and formula_53 (i.e. formula_31) using exponent laws as\nformula_81\nTo recover the logarithms, we apply formula_56 to both sides of the equality.\nformula_83\nThe right side may be simplified using one of the logarithm properties from before: we know that formula_84, giving\nformula_85\nWe now resubstitute the values for formula_60 and formula_61 into our equation, so our final expression is only in terms of formula_12, formula_31, and formula_29.\nformula_91\nThis completes the derivation.\nLogarithm of a power.\nTo state the \"logarithm of a power\" law formally:\nformula_92\nDerivation:\nLet formula_41, where formula_3, let formula_95, and let formula_96. For this derivation, we want to simplify the expression formula_97. To do this, we begin with the simpler expression formula_44. Since we will be using formula_44 often, we will define it as a new variable: Let formula_48.\nTo more easily manipulate the expression, we rewrite it as an exponential. By definition, formula_101, so we have\nformula_102\nSimilar to the derivations above, we take advantage of another exponent law. In order to have formula_103 in our final expression, we raise both sides of the equality to the power of formula_104:\nformula_105\nwhere we used the exponent law formula_106.\nTo recover the logarithms, we apply formula_56 to both sides of the equality.\nformula_108\nThe left side of the equality can be simplified using a logarithm law, which states that formula_109.\nformula_110\nSubstituting in the original value for formula_60, rearranging, and simplifying gives\nformula_112\nThis completes the derivation.\nChanging the base.\nMost calculators have buttons for natural logarithms (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fake link/styles.css\"/&gt;ln) and common logarithms (log or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fake link/styles.css\"/&gt;log10), but not all calculators have buttons for the logarithm of an arbitrary base. Accordingly, it is sometimes useful to change the base of a logarithm.As briefly mentioned in the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fake link/styles.css\"/&gt;\u00a7 Trivial identities section, the definition of a logarithm is: formula_113 Solving for x in the exponential equation bx = y could be done on most calculators by using common or natural logarithms: formula_114 For example, the binary logarithm (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fake link/styles.css\"/&gt;log2), which is widely used in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fake link/styles.css\"/&gt;computer science, could be calculated on most calculators as: formula_115More generally, the change of base formula can be formally defined as:formula_116\nProof and derivation.\nLet formula_117, where formula_118 Let formula_119. Here, formula_120 and formula_29 are the two bases we will be using for the logarithms. They cannot be 1, because the logarithm function is not well defined for the base of 1. The number formula_12 will be what the logarithm is evaluating, so it must be a positive number. Since we will be dealing with the term formula_44 quite frequently, we define it as a new variable: Let formula_48.\nTo more easily manipulate the expression, it can be rewritten as an exponential.\nformula_125\nApplying formula_126 to both sides of the equality,\nformula_127\nNow, using the logarithm of a power property, which states that formula_128,\nformula_129\nIsolating formula_60, we get the following:\nformula_131\nResubstituting formula_48 back into the equation,\nformula_133\nThis completes the proof that formula_134.\nThis formula has several consequences:\nformula_135\nformula_136\nformula_137\nformula_138\nformula_139\nformula_140\nwhere formula_141 is any permutation of the subscripts 1, ..., \"n\". For example\nformula_142\nSummation and subtraction.\nThe following summation and subtraction rule is especially useful in probability theory when one is dealing with a sum of log-probabilities:\nNote that the subtraction identity is not defined if formula_143, since the logarithm of zero is not defined. Also note that, when programming, formula_120 and formula_33 may have to be switched on the right hand side of the equations if formula_146 to avoid losing the \"1 +\" due to rounding errors. Many programming languages have a specific codice_1 function that calculates formula_147 without underflow (when formula_12 is small).\nMore generally:\nformula_149\nExponents.\nA useful identity involving exponents:\nformula_150\nor more universally:\nformula_151\nOther or resulting identities.\nformula_152\nformula_153\nInequalities.\nBased on,\nformula_154\nformula_155\nAll are accurate around formula_156, but not for large numbers.\nTropical identities.\nThe following identity relates log semiring to the min-plus semiring.\nformula_157\nCalculus identities.\nLimits.\nformula_158\nformula_159\nformula_160\nformula_161\nformula_162\nformula_163\nThe last limit is often summarized as \"logarithms grow more slowly than any power or root of \"x\"\".\nDerivatives of logarithmic functions.\nformula_164\nformula_165\nformula_166\nIntegral definition.\nformula_167\nTo modify the limits of integration to run from formula_12 to formula_169, we change the order of integration, which changes the sign of the integral:\nformula_170\nTherefore:\nformula_171\nRiemann Sum.\nformula_172\nformula_173\nformula_174\nformula_175\nformula_176\nfor formula_177 and formula_178 is a sample point in each interval.\nSeries representation.\nThe natural logarithm formula_179 has a well-known Taylor series expansion that converges for formula_12 in the open-closed interval (\u22121, 1]:\nformula_181\nWithin this interval, for formula_7, the series is conditionally convergent, and for all other values, it is absolutely convergent. For formula_183 or formula_184, the series does not converge to formula_179. In these cases, different representations or methods must be used to evaluate the logarithm.\nHarmonic number difference.\nIt is not uncommon in advanced mathematics, particularly in analytic number theory and asymptotic analysis, to encounter expressions involving differences or ratios of harmonic numbers at scaled indices. The identity involving the limiting difference between harmonic numbers at scaled indices and its relationship to the logarithmic function provides an intriguing example of how discrete sequences can asymptotically relate to continuous functions. This identity is expressed as\nformula_186\nwhich characterizes the behavior of harmonic numbers as they grow large. This approximation (which precisely equals formula_187 in the limit) reflects how summation over increasing segments of the harmonic series exhibits integral properties, giving insight into the interplay between discrete and continuous analysis. It also illustrates how understanding the behavior of sums and series at large scales can lead to insightful conclusions about their properties. Here formula_188 denotes the formula_189-th harmonic number, defined as\nformula_190\nThe harmonic numbers are a fundamental sequence in number theory and analysis, known for their logarithmic growth. This result leverages the fact that the sum of the inverses of integers (i.e., harmonic numbers) can be closely approximated by the natural logarithm function, plus a constant, especially when extended over large intervals. As formula_189 tends towards infinity, the difference between the harmonic numbers formula_192 and formula_188 converges to a non-zero value. This persistent non-zero difference, formula_187, precludes the possibility of the harmonic series approaching a finite limit, thus providing a clear mathematical articulation of its divergence. The technique of approximating sums by integrals (specifically using the integral test or by direct integral approximation) is fundamental in deriving such results. This specific identity can be a consequence of these approximations, considering:\nformula_195\nHarmonic limit derivation.\nThe limit explores the growth of the harmonic numbers when indices are multiplied by a scaling factor and then differenced. It specifically captures the sum from formula_196 to formula_197:\nformula_198\nThis can be estimated using the integral test for convergence, or more directly by comparing it to the integral of formula_199 from formula_189 to formula_197:\nformula_202\nAs the window's lower bound begins at formula_196 and the upper bound extends to formula_197, both of which tend toward infinity as formula_205, the summation window encompasses an increasingly vast portion of the smallest possible terms of the harmonic series (those with astronomically large denominators), creating a discrete sum that stretches towards infinity, which mirrors how continuous integrals accumulate value across an infinitesimally fine partitioning of the domain. In the limit, the interval is effectively from formula_169 to formula_207 where the onset formula_189 implies this minimally discrete region.\nDouble series formula.\nThe harmonic number difference formula for formula_209 is an extension of the classic, alternating identity of formula_210:\nformula_211\nwhich can be generalized as the double series over the residues of formula_60:\nformula_213\nwhere formula_214 is the principal ideal generated by formula_60. Subtracting formula_216 from each term formula_217 (i.e., balancing each term with the modulus) reduces the magnitude of each term's contribution, ensuring convergence by controlling the series' tendency toward divergence as formula_60 increases. For example:\nformula_219\nThis method leverages the fine differences between closely related terms to stabilize the series. The sum over all residues formula_220 ensures that adjustments are uniformly applied across all possible offsets within each block of formula_60 terms. This uniform distribution of the \"correction\" across different intervals defined by formula_222 functions similarly to telescoping over a very large sequence. It helps to flatten out the discrepancies that might otherwise lead to divergent behavior in a straightforward harmonic series. Note that the structure of the summands of this formula matches those of the interpolated harmonic number formula_223 when both the domain and range are negated (i.e., formula_224). However, the interpretation and roles of the variables differ.\nDeveci's Proof.\nA fundamental feature of the proof is the accumulation of the subtrahends formula_225 into a unit fraction, that is, formula_226 for formula_227, thus formula_228 rather than formula_229, where the extrema of formula_230 are formula_231 if formula_232 and formula_233 otherwise, with the minimum of formula_234 being implicit in the latter case due to the structural requirements of the proof. Since the cardinality of formula_230 depends on the selection of one of two possible minima, the integral formula_236, as a set-theoretic procedure, is a function of the maximum formula_237 (which remains consistent across both interpretations) plus formula_169, not the cardinality (which is ambiguous due to varying definitions of the minimum). Whereas the harmonic number difference computes the integral in a global sliding window, the double series, in parallel, computes the sum in a local sliding window\u2014a shifting formula_60-tuple\u2014over the harmonic series, advancing the window by formula_60 positions to select the next formula_60-tuple, and offsetting each element of each tuple by formula_242 relative to the window's absolute position. The sum formula_243 corresponds to formula_244 which scales formula_245 without bound. The sum formula_246 corresponds to the prefix formula_247 trimmed from the series to establish the window's moving lower bound formula_196, and formula_209 is the limit of the sliding window (the scaled, truncated series):\nformula_250\nformula_251\nIntegrals of logarithmic functions.\nformula_252\nformula_253\nTo remember higher integrals, it is convenient to define:\nformula_254\nwhere formula_255 is the \"n\"th harmonic number:\nformula_256\nformula_257\nformula_258\nformula_259\nThen:\nformula_260\nformula_261\nApproximating large numbers.\nThe identities of logarithms can be used to approximate large numbers. Note that log\"b\"(\"a\") + log\"b\"(\"c\") = log\"b\"(\"ac\"), where \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are arbitrary constants. Suppose that one wants to approximate the 44th Mersenne prime, 232,582,657 \u22121. To get the base-10 logarithm, we would multiply 32,582,657 by log10(2), getting 9,808,357.09543 = 9,808,357 + 0.09543. We can then get 109,808,357 \u00d7 100.09543 \u2248 1.25 \u00d7 109,808,357.\nSimilarly, factorials can be approximated by summing the logarithms of the terms.\nComplex logarithm identities.\nThe complex logarithm is the complex number analogue of the logarithm function. No single valued function on the complex plane can satisfy the normal rules for logarithms. However, a multivalued function can be defined which satisfies most of the identities. It is usual to consider this as a function defined on a Riemann surface. A single valued version, called the principal value of the logarithm, can be defined which is discontinuous on the negative x axis, and is equal to the multivalued version on a single branch cut.\nDefinitions.\nIn what follows, a capital first letter is used for the principal value of functions, and the lower case version is used for the multivalued function. The single valued version of definitions and identities is always given first, followed by a separate section for the multiple valued versions.\nThe multiple valued version of log(\"z\") is a set, but it is easier to write it without braces and using it in formulas follows obvious rules.\nWhen \"k\" is any integer:\nformula_264\nformula_265\nformula_266\nConstants.\nPrincipal value forms:\nformula_267\nformula_268\nMultiple value forms, for any \"k\" an integer:\nformula_269\nformula_270\nSummation.\nPrincipal value forms:\nformula_271\nformula_272\nformula_273\nformula_274\nMultiple value forms:\nformula_275\nformula_276\nPowers.\nA complex power of a complex number can have many possible values.\nPrincipal value form:\nformula_277\nformula_278\nMultiple value forms:\nformula_279\nWhere \"k\"1, \"k\"2 are any integers:\nformula_280\nformula_281\nAsymptotic identities.\nPronic numbers.\nAs a consequence of the harmonic number difference, the natural logarithm is asymptotically approximated by a finite series difference, representing a truncation of the integral at formula_282:\nformula_283\nwhere formula_284 is the nth triangular number, and formula_285 is the sum of the first n even integers. Since the nth pronic number is asymptotically equivalent to the nth perfect square, it follows that:\nformula_283\nPrime number theorem.\nThe prime number theorem provides the following asymptotic equivalence:\nformula_287\nwhere formula_288 is the prime counting function. This relationship is equal to:\nformula_289\nwhere formula_290 is the harmonic mean of formula_291. This is derived from the fact that the difference between the formula_61th harmonic number and formula_293 asymptotically approaches a small constant, resulting in formula_294. This behavior can also be derived from the properties of logarithms: formula_293 is half of formula_296, and this \"first half\" is the natural log of the root of formula_297, which corresponds roughly to the first formula_298th of the sum formula_299, or formula_255. The asymptotic equivalence of the first formula_298th of formula_299 to the latter formula_303th of the series is expressed as follows:\nformula_304\nwhich generalizes to:\nformula_305\nformula_306\nand:\nformula_307\nformula_308\nformula_309\nfor fixed formula_189. The correspondence sets formula_255 as a unit magnitude that partitions formula_312 across powers, where each interval formula_298 to formula_314, formula_314 to formula_316, etc., corresponds to one formula_255 unit, illustrating that formula_312 forms a divergent series as formula_205.\nReal Arguments.\nThese approximations extend to the real-valued domain through the interpolated harmonic number. For example, where formula_320:\nformula_321\nStirling numbers.\nThe natural logarithm is asymptotically related to the harmonic numbers by the Stirling numbers and the Gregory coefficients. By representing formula_255 in terms of Stirling numbers of the first kind, the harmonic number difference is alternatively expressed as follows, for fixed formula_189:\nformula_324\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The locations of many lost cities have been forgotten, but some have been rediscovered and studied extensively by scientists. Recently abandoned cities or cities whose location was never in question might be referred to as ruins or ghost towns. Smaller settlements may be referred to as abandoned villages. The search for such lost cities by European explorers and adventurers in Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia from the 15th century onward eventually led to the development of archaeology.\nLost cities generally fall into two broad categories: those where all knowledge of the city's existence was forgotten before it was rediscovered, and those whose memory was preserved in myth, legend, or historical records but whose location was lost or at least no longer widely recognized.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReasons for loss.\nCities may become lost for a variety of reasons including natural disasters, economic or social upheaval, or war.\nThe Incan capital city of Vilcabamba was destroyed and depopulated during the Spanish conquest of Peru in 1572. The Spanish did not rebuild the city, and the location went unrecorded and was forgotten until it was rediscovered through a detailed examination of period letters and documents.\nTroy was a city located in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey. It is best known for being the focus of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the \"Iliad\", one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, the city slowly declined and was abandoned in the Byzantine era. Buried by time, the city was consigned to the realm of legend until the location was first excavated in the 1860s.\nOther settlements are lost with few or no clues to their abandonment. For example, Malden Island, in the central Pacific, was deserted when first visited by Europeans in 1825, but the remains of temples and other structures on the island indicate that a population of Polynesians had lived there for perhaps several generations in the past. Typically this lack of information is due to no surviving written or oral histories and a lack of archaeological data as in the case of the remote and fairly unknown Malden Island.\nRediscovery.\nWith the development of archaeology and the application of modern techniques, many previously lost cities have been rediscovered.\nMachu Picchu is a pre-Columbian Inca site situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba Valley in Peru. Often referred to as the \"Lost City of the Incas\", it is perhaps the most familiar icon of the Inca World. Machu Picchu was built around 1450, at the height of the Inca Empire. It was abandoned just over 100 years later, in 1572, as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area. In 1911, Melchor Arteaga led the explorer Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu, which had been largely forgotten by everybody except the small number of people living in the immediate valley. Nevertheless, Peruvian explorer and farmer Agust\u00edn Liz\u00e1rraga predated this discovery by 9 years, having found the Inca site on 14 July 1902. He left a charcoal inscription bearing the words \"A. Liz\u00e1rraga 1902\".\nHelike was an ancient Greek city that sank at night in the winter of 373 BCE. The city was located in Achaea, Northern Peloponnesos, two kilometres (12 stadia) from the Corinthian Gulf. The city was thought to be legend until 2001, when it was rediscovered in the Helike Delta. In 1988, the Greek archaeologist Dora Katsonopoulou launched the Helike Project to locate the site of the lost city. In 1994, in collaboration with the University of Patras, a magnetometer survey was carried out in the midplain of the delta, which revealed the outlines of a buried building. In 1995, this target was excavated (now known as the Klonis site), and a large Roman building with standing walls was brought to light.\nLost cities by continent.\nNorth America.\nMexico and Central America.\nMaya cities.\n\"Incomplete list \u2013 for further information, see Maya civilization\"\nUndiscovered and fictional lost cities.\nLegendary.\nThat some cities are considered legendary does not mean they did not in fact exist.

After studying with Georges Cuvier and Alexander von Humboldt in Paris, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel. He emigrated to the United States in 1847 after visiting Harvard University. He went on to become professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, to head its Lawrence Scientific School, and to found its Museum of Comparative Zoology.\nAgassiz is known for observational data gathering and analysis. He made institutional and scientific contributions to zoology, geology, and related areas, including multivolume research books running to thousands of pages. He is particularly known for his contributions to ichthyological classification, including of extinct species such as megalodon, and to the study of historical geology, including the founding of glaciology.\nHis theories on human, animal and plant polygenism have been criticised as implicitly supporting scientific racism.\nEarly life.\nLouis Agassiz was born on May 28, 1807 in M\u00f4tier, a hamlet within the municipality of Haut-Vully (now part of Mont-Vully), in the Swiss canton of Fribourg. He was the son of Louis Benjamin Rodolphe Agassiz and Rose Mayor. His father was a Protestant clergyman, as had been his progenitors for six generations, and his mother was the daughter of a physician and an intellectual in her own right, who had assisted her husband in the education of their children. Louis Agassiz was educated at home until he spent four years at secondary school in Bienne, which he entered in 1818 and completed his elementary studies in Lausanne. Agassiz studied at the universities of Z\u00fcrich, Heidelberg and Munich. At the last one, he extended his knowledge of natural history, especially of botany. In 1829, he received the degree of doctor of philosophy at Erlangen and, in 1830, that of doctor of medicine at Munich. \nMoving to Paris, he came under the tutelage of Alexander von Humboldt and later received his financial benevolence. Humboldt and Georges Cuvier launched him on his careers of respectively geology and zoology. Ichthyology soon became a focus of Agassiz's life's work.\nEarly work.\nIn 1819 to 1820, the German biologists Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius undertook an expedition to Brazil. They returned home to Europe with many natural objects, including an important collection of the freshwater fish of Brazil, especially of the Amazon River. Spix, who died in 1826, likely from a tropical disease, did not live long enough to work out the history of those fish, and Martius selected Agassiz for this project.\nAgassiz threw himself into the work with an enthusiasm that would go on to characterize the rest of his life's work. The task of describing the Brazilian fish was completed and published in 1829. It was followed by research into the history of fish found in Lake Neuch\u00e2tel. Enlarging his plans, he in 1830 issued a prospectus of a \"History of the Freshwater Fish of Central Europe\". In 1839, however, the first part of the publication appeared, and it was completed in 1842.\nIn November 1832, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel, at a salary of about US$400 and declined brilliant offers in Paris because of the leisure for private study that that position afforded him. The fossil fish in the rock of the surrounding region, the slates of Glarus and the limestones of Monte Bolca, soon attracted his attention. At the time, very little had been accomplished in their scientific study. Agassiz as early as 1829, planned the publication of a work. More than any other, it would lay the foundation of his worldwide fame. Five volumes of his \"Recherches sur les poissons fossiles\" (\"Research on Fossil Fish\") were published from 1833 to 1843. They were magnificently illustrated, chiefly by Joseph Dinkel. In gathering materials for that work, Agassiz visited the principal museums in Europe. Meeting Cuvier in Paris, he received much encouragement and assistance from him.\nIn 1833, he married Cecile Braun, the sister of his friend Alexander Braun and established his household at Neuch\u00e2tel. Trained to scientific drawing by her brothers, his wife was of the greatest assistance to Agassiz, with some of the most beautiful plates in \"fossil\" and \"freshwater\" fishes being drawn by her.\nAgassiz found that his palaeontological analyses required a new ichthyological classification. The fossils that he examined rarely showed any traces of the soft tissues of fish but instead, consisted chiefly of the teeth, scales, and fins, with the bones being perfectly preserved in comparatively few instances. He therefore adopted a classification that divided fish into four groups (ganoids, placoids, cycloids, and ctenoids), based on the nature of the scales and other dermal appendages. That did much to improve fish taxonomy, but Agassiz's classification has since been superseded.\nWith Louis de Coulon, both father and son, he founded the \"Societ\u00e9 des Sciences Naturelles\", of which he was the first secretary and in conjunction with the Coulons also arranged a provisional museum of natural history in the orphan's home. Agassiz needed financial support to continue his work. The British Association and the Earl of Ellesmere, then Lord Francis Egerton, stepped in to help. The 1290 original drawings made for the work were purchased by the Earl and presented by him to the Geological Society of London. In 1836, the Wollaston Medal was awarded to Agassiz by the council of that society for his work on fossil ichthyology. In 1838, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society. Meanwhile, invertebrate animals engaged his attention. In 1837, he issued the \"Prodrome\" of a monograph on the recent and fossil Echinodermata, the first part of which appeared in 1838; in 1839\u20131840, he published two quarto volumes on the fossil echinoderms of Switzerland; and in 1840\u20131845, he issued his \"\u00c9tudes critiques sur les mollusques fossiles\" (\"Critical Studies on Fossil Mollusks\").\nBefore Agassiz's first visit to England in 1834, Hugh Miller and other geologists had brought to light the remarkable fossil fish of the Old Red Sandstone of the northeast of Scotland. The strange forms of \"Pterichthys\", \"Coccosteus\", and other genera were then made known to geologists for the first time. They were of intense interest to Agassiz and formed the subject of a monograph by him published in 1844\u20131845: \"Monographie des poissons fossiles du Vieux Gr\u00e8s Rouge, ou Syst\u00e8me D\u00e9vonien (Old Red Sandstone) des \u00celes Britanniques et de Russie\" (\"Monograph on Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone, or Devonian System of the British Isles and of Russia\").\nIn 1838, Frederick William III of Prussia founded the Neuch\u00e2tel Academy which owes its birth to the impetus of Louis Agassiz. The young scholar endowed with exceptional charisma was recruited by the authorities of the Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel as early as 1832. In the early stages of his career in Neuchatel, Agassiz also made a name for himself as a man who could run a scientific department well. Under his care, the University of Neuch\u00e2tel soon became a leading institution for scientific inquiry.\nFrom 1836 onwards, Agassiz became increasingly interested in glaciers. At a time when Swiss glaciers were still advancing, the hypothesis of an extensive past glaciation emerged in scientific circles. On 24 July 1837, in his speech at the annual meeting of the Swiss Academy of Natural Sciences in Neuch\u00e2tel, which he chaired, he presented this new theory, although a lecture on fossil fish was expected. To support the Ice Age theory, he traveled the Alps in search of traces of previous glacial movements. The research conducted on the Unteraargletscher between 1840 and 1845 was groundbreaking. At that time, his companions added the Agassizhorn to the list of mountains of Switzerland named after people.\nIn 1842 to 1846, Agassiz issued his \"Nomenclator Zoologicus\", a classification list with references of all names used in zoological genera and groups. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1843. After his departure for the United States, his strong commitment to the public dissemination of knowledge and to the defense of women's education would play a decisive role in the affirmation of science in America.\nIce age.\nThe vacation of 1836 was spent by Agassiz and his wife in the little village of Bex, where he met Jean de Charpentier and Ignaz Venetz. Their recently announced glacial theories had startled the scientific world, and Agassiz returned to Neuch\u00e2tel as an enthusiastic convert. In 1837, Agassiz proposed that the Earth had been subjected to a past ice age. He presented the theory to the Helvetic Society that ancient glaciers flowed outward from the Alps, and even larger glaciers had covered the plains and mountains of Europe, Asia, and North America and smothered the entire Northern Hemisphere in a prolonged ice age. In the same year, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Before that proposal, Goethe, de Saussure, Ignaz Venetz, Jean de Charpentier, Karl Friedrich Schimper, and others had studied the glaciers of the Alps, and Goethe, Charpentier, and Schimper had even concluded that the erratic blocks of alpine rocks scattered over the slopes and summits of the Jura Mountains had been moved there by glaciers. Those ideas attracted the attention of Agassiz, and he discussed them with Charpentier and Schimper, whom he accompanied on successive trips to the Alps. Agassiz even had a hut constructed upon one of the Aar Glaciers and for a time made it his home to investigate the structure and movements of the ice.\nAgassiz visited England, and with William Buckland, the only English naturalist who shared his ideas, made a tour of the British Isles in search of glacial phenomena, and became satisfied that his theory of an ice age was correct. In 1840, Agassiz published a two-volume work, \"\u00c9tudes sur les glaciers\" (\"Studies on Glaciers\"). In it, he discussed the movements of the glaciers, their moraines, and their influence in grooving and rounding the rocks and in producing the striations and \"roches moutonn\u00e9es\" seen in Alpine-style landscapes. He accepted Charpentier and Schimper's idea that some of the alpine glaciers had extended across the wide plains and valleys of the Aar and Rh\u00f4ne, but he went further by concluding that in the recent past, Switzerland had been covered with one vast sheet of ice originating in the higher Alps and extending over the valley of northwestern Switzerland to the southern slopes of the Jura. The publication of the work gave fresh impetus to the study of glacial phenomena in all parts of the world.\nFamiliar then with recent glaciation, Agassiz and the English geologist William Buckland visited the mountains of Scotland in 1840. There, they found clear evidence in different locations of glacial action. The discovery was announced to the Geological Society of London in successive communications. The mountainous districts of England, Wales, and Ireland were understood to have been centres for the dispersion of glacial debris. Agassiz remarked \"that great sheets of ice, resembling those now existing in Greenland, once covered all the countries in which unstratified gravel (boulder drift) is found; that this gravel was in general produced by the trituration of the sheets of ice upon the subjacent surface, etc.\"\nIn his later years, Agassiz applied his glacial theories to the geology of the Brazilian tropics, including the Amazon. Agassiz began with a working hypothesis which could be tested by the results of fieldwork to find either inconclusive, or conclusively supporting or refuting evidence. A hypothesis that can be conclusively refuted is better than a hypothesis that is difficult to test. Agassiz had a close association with his student and field assistant, the geologist Charles Hartt who eventually refuted Agassiz's theories about the Amazon based on his fieldwork there. Instead of evidence for any glacial processes, he found chemically weathered sediments from marine and tropical fluvial, not glacial, processes, a finding that later geologists confirmed. Agassiz hypothesis that the Amazon was affected by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was correct, although the mechanism causing the effect was non-glacial. The Amazon rainforest was split into two large blocks by extensive savanna during the LGM.\nUnited States.\nWith the aid of a grant of money from the king of Prussia, Agassiz crossed the Atlantic in the autumn of 1846 to investigate the natural history and geology of North America and to deliver a course of lectures on \"The Plan of Creation as shown in the Animal Kingdom\" by invitation from John Amory Lowell, at the Lowell Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. The financial offers that were presented to him in the United States induced him to settle there, where he remained to the end of his life. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1846.\nIn 1846, still married to Cecilie, who remained with their three children in Switzerland, Agassiz met Elizabeth Cabot Cary at a dinner. The two developed a romantic attachment, and when his wife died in 1848, they made plans to marry. The ceremony took place on April 25, 1850, in Boston, Massachusetts at King's Chapel. Agassiz brought his children to live with them, and Elizabeth raised and developed close relationships with her step-children. She had no children of her own.\nAgassiz had a mostly cordial relationship with the Harvard botanist Asa Gray despite their disagreements. Agassiz believed each human race had been separately created, but Gray, a supporter of Charles Darwin, believed in the shared evolutionary ancestry of all humans. In addition, Agassiz was a member of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the more autocratic academic structures of European universities, but Gray was a staunch opponent of that group.\nAgassiz's engagement for the Lowell Institute lectures precipitated the establishment in 1847 of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard University, with Agassiz as its head. Harvard appointed him professor of zoology and geology, and he founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology there in 1859 and served as its first director until his death in 1873. During his tenure at Harvard, Agassiz studied the effect of the last ice age in North America. In his \"Contributions to the Natural History of the United States,\" he critically examined Darwin's theory of evolution. He believed that God created new life after each ice age and that it was the responsibility of naturalists to understand this plan of creation. By defending this view, he gained the favor of the American readership. In August 1857, Agassiz was offered the chair of palaeontology in the Museum of Natural History, Paris, which he refused. He was later decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor.\nAgassiz continued his lectures for the Lowell Institute. In succeeding years, he gave lectures on \"Ichthyology\" (1847\u20131848), \"Comparative Embryology\" (1848\u20131849), \"Functions of Life in Lower Animals\" (1850\u20131851), \"Natural History\" (1853\u20131854), \"Methods of Study in Natural History\" (1861\u20131862), \"Glaciers and the Ice Period\" (1864\u20131865), \"Brazil\" (1866\u20131867), and \"Deep Sea Dredging\" (1869\u20131870). In 1850, he had married Elizabeth Cabot Cary, who later wrote introductory books about natural history and a lengthy biography of her husband after he had died.\nAgassiz served as a nonresident lecturer at Cornell University while he was also on faculty at Harvard. In 1852, he accepted a medical professorship of comparative anatomy at Charlestown, Massachusetts, but he resigned in two years. From then on, Agassiz's scientific studies dropped off, but he became one of the best-known scientists in the world. By 1857, Agassiz was so well-loved that his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote \"The Fiftieth Birthday of Agassiz\" in his honor and read it at a dinner given for Agassiz by the Saturday Club in Cambridge. Agassiz's own writing continued with four (of a planned 10) volumes of \"Natural History of the United States\", published from 1857 to 1862. He also published a catalog of papers in his field, \"Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae\", in four volumes between 1848 and 1854.\nStricken by ill health in the 1860s, Agassiz resolved to return to the field for relaxation and to resume his studies of Brazilian fish. In April 1865, he led the Thayer Expedition to Brazil. While there, he commissioned two photographers, Augusto Stahl and Georges Leuzinger, to accompany the expedition and produce somatological images of Indigenous people and enslaved Africans and Black people. After his return in August 1866, an account of the expedition, \"A Journey in Brazil\", was published in 1868. In December 1871, he made a second eight-month excursion, known as the \"Hassler\" expedition under the command of Commander Philip Carrigan Johnson (the brother of Eastman Johnson) and visited South America on its southern Atlantic and Pacific Seaboards. The ship explored the Magellan Strait, which drew the praise of Charles Darwin.\nFollowing the establishment of the first U.S. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in New York City in 1866, Agassiz was called on to help settle disputes about animal behavior. He deemed the way turtles were shipped caused them suffering, while P.T. Barnum argued with Agassiz' support that his snakes would eat only live animals.\nHis second wife, Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, assisted him in preparing his \"A Journey in Brazil\". Along with her stepson, Alexander Agassiz, she wrote \"Seaside Studies in Natural History\" and \"Marine Animals of Massachusetts\". Elizabeth wrote at the Strait that \"the \"Hassler\" pursued her course, past a seemingly endless panorama of mountains and forests rising into the pale regions of snow and ice, where lay glaciers in which every rift and crevasse, as well as the many cascades flowing down to join the waters beneath, could be counted as she steamed by them... These were weeks of exquisite delight to Agassiz. The vessel often skirted the shore so closely that its geology could be studied from the deck.\"\nFamily.\nFrom his first marriage to Cecilie Braun, Agassiz had two daughters, Ida and Pauline, and a son, Alexander.\nIn 1863, Agassiz's daughter Ida married Henry Lee Higginson, who later founded the Boston Symphony Orchestra and was a benefactor to Harvard and other schools. On November 30, 1860, Agassiz's daughter Pauline was married to Quincy Adams Shaw (1825\u20131908), a wealthy Boston merchant and later a benefactor to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Pauline Agassiz Shaw later became a prominent educator, suffragist, and philanthropist.\nLater life.\nIn the last years of his life, Agassiz worked to establish a permanent school in which zoological science could be pursued amid the living subjects of its study. In 1873, the private philanthropist John Anderson gave Agassiz the island of Penikese, in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts (south of New Bedford), and presented him with $50,000 to endow it permanently as a practical school of natural science that would be especially devoted to the study of marine zoology. The school collapsed soon after Agassiz's death but is considered to be a precursor of the nearby Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory.\nAgassiz had a profound influence on the American branches of his two fields and taught many future scientists who would go on to prominence, including Alpheus Hyatt, David Starr Jordan, Joel Asaph Allen, Joseph Le Conte, Ernest Ingersoll, William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, Orestes St. John, Nathaniel Shaler, Samuel Hubbard Scudder, Alpheus Packard, and his son Alexander Emanuel Agassiz. He had a profound impact on the paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott and the natural scientist Edward S. Morse. Agassiz had a reputation for being a demanding teacher. He would allegedly \"lock a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained.\" Two of Agassiz's most prominent students detailed their personal experiences under his tutelage: Scudder, in a short magazine article for\" Every Saturday\", and Shaler, in his \"Autobiography\". Those and other recollections were collected and published by Lane Cooper in 1917, which Ezra Pound would draw on for his anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.\nIn the early 1840s, Agassiz named two fossil fish species after Mary Anning (\"Acrodus anningiae\" and \"Belenostomus anningiae\") and another after her friend, Elizabeth Philpot. Anning was a paleontologist known around the world for important finds, but because of her gender, she was often not formally recognized for her work. Agassiz was grateful for the help that the women gave him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834.\nAgassiz died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1873 and was buried on the Bellwort Path at Mount Auburn Cemetery, joined later by his wife. His monument is a boulder from a glacial moraine of the Aar near the site of the old H\u00f4tel des Neuch\u00e2telois, not far from the spot where his hut once stood. His grave is sheltered by pine trees from his old home in Switzerland.\nLegacy.\nThe Cambridge elementary school north of Harvard University was named in his honor, and the surrounding neighborhood became known as \"Agassiz\" as a result. The school's name was changed to the Maria L. Baldwin School on May 21, 2002, because of concerns about Agassiz's involvement in scientific racism and to honor Maria Louise Baldwin, the African-American principal of the school, who served from 1889 to 1922. The neighborhood, however, continued to be known as Agassiz. c.\u20092009, neighborhood residents decided to rename the neighborhood's community council as the \"Agassiz-Baldwin Community\". Then, in July 2021, culminating a two-year effort on the part of neighborhood residents, the Cambridge City Council voted unanimously to change the name to the Baldwin Neighborhood. An elementary school, the Agassiz Elementary School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, existed from 1922 to 1981.\nGeological tributes.\nAn ancient glacial lake that formed in central North America, Lake Agassiz, is named after him, as are Mount Agassiz in California's Palisades, Mount Agassiz in the Uinta Mountains of Utah, Agassiz Peak in Arizona, Agassiz Rock in Massachusetts, and the Agassizhorn in the Bernese Alps in his native Switzerland. Agassiz Glacier in Montana, Agassiz Creek in Glacier National Park, Agassiz Glacier in the Saint Elias Mountains of Alaska, and Mount Agassiz in the White Mountains of New Hampshire also bear his name. A crater on Mars, \"Crater Agassiz\", and a promontorium on the moon are also named in his honor. Cape Agassiz, a headland situated in Palmer Land, Antarctica, is named in his honor. A main-belt asteroid, 2267 Agassiz, is also named in association with him.\nBiological tributes.\nSeveral animal species are named in honor of him, including \nand the most well-known, \nTribute awards.\nIn 2005, the European Geosciences Union Division on Cryospheric Sciences established the Louis Agassiz Medal, awarded to individuals in recognition of their outstanding scientific contribution to the study of the cryosphere on Earth or elsewhere in the Solar System.\nAgassiz took part in a monthly gathering called the Saturday Club at the Parker House, a meeting of Boston writers and intellectuals. He was therefore mentioned in a stanza of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. poem \":\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDaguerreotypes of Renty and Delia Taylor.\nIn 1850, Agassiz commissioned daguerreotypes, which were described as \"haunting and voyeuristic\" of the enslaved Renty Taylor and Taylor's daughter, Delia, to further his arguments about black inferiority. They are the earliest known photographs of enslaved persons. Agassiz left the images to Harvard, and they remained in the Peabody Museum's attic until 1976, when they were rediscovered by Ellie Reichlin, a former staff member. The 15 daguerrotypes were in a case with the embossing \"J. T. Zealy, Photographer, Columbia,\" with several handwritten labels, which helped in later identification. Reichlin spent months doing research to try to identify the people in the photos, but Harvard University did not make efforts to contact the families and licensed the photos for use.\nIn 2011, Tamara Lanier wrote a letter to the president of Harvard that identified herself as a direct descendant of the Taylors and asked the university to turn over the photos to her.\nIn 2019, Taylor's descendants sued Harvard for the return of the images and unspecified damages. The lawsuit was supported by 43 living descendants of Agassiz, who wrote in a letter of support, \"For Harvard to give the daguerreotypes to Ms. Lanier and her family would begin to make amends for its use of the photos as exhibits for the white supremacist theory Agassiz espoused.\" Everyone must evaluate fully \"his role in promoting a pseudoscientific justification for white supremacy.\"\nSettlement of the lawsuit was announced in May 2025. All of the Agassiz-Zealy daguerrotypes are expected to be transferred to a museum of African-American history in South Carolina (none go to Ms. Lanier personally), and Harvard is to pay an undisclosed monetary sum to Ms. Lanier for her emotional distress.\nAggasiz-Zeally Gallery\nPolygenism and racism.\nAgassiz was a well-known natural scientist of his generation in America. In addition to being a natural scientist, Agassiz wrote prolifically in the field of scientific polygenism after he came to the United States.\nUpon arriving in Boston in 1846, Agassiz spent a few months acquainting himself with the northeast region of the United States. He spent much of his time with Samuel George Morton, a famous American anthropologist at the time who became well known by analyzing fossils brought back by Lewis and Clark. One of Morton\u2019s personal projects involved studying cranial capacity of human skulls from around the world. Morton aimed to use craniometry to prove that white people were biologically superior to other races. His work \"Crania Aegyptiaca\" claimed to support the polygenism belief that the races were created separately and each had their own unique attributes.\nMorton relied on other scientists to send him skulls along with information about where they were acquired. Factors that can affect cranial capacity, such as body size and gender, were not taken into consideration by Morton. He made questionable judgment calls such as dismissing Hindu skull calculations from his Caucasian cranial measurements because they brought the overall average down. Oppositely, he included Peruvian skull measurements alongside Native American calculations even though the Peruvian numbers lowered the average score. Despite Morton's unsound methods, his published work on cranial capacities across races was deemed authoritative in the United States and Europe. Morton is a primary influence on Agassiz's belief in polygenism.\nJohn Amory Lowell invited Agassiz to present twelve lectures in December 1846 on three subjects titled \"\"The Plan of Creation as shown in the Animal Kingdom\", \"Ichthyology,\" and \"Comparative Embryology\"\" as a part of the Lowell Lecture series. These lectures were widely attended with up to 5,000 people in attendance on some nights. It was during these lectures that Agassiz announced for the first time that black and white people had different origins but were part of the same species. Agassiz repeated this lecture 10 months later to the Charleston Literary Club but changed his original stance, claiming that black people were physiologically and anatomically a distinct species.\nAgassiz believed that humans did not descend from one single common ancestor. He believed that like plants and animals, various regions have differentiated species of humans. He considered this hypothesis testable, and matched to the available evidence. He also indicated that there were obvious geographical barriers that were the likely cause of speciation.\nStephen Jay Gould asserted that Agassiz's observations sprang from racist bias, in particular from his revulsion on first encountering African-Americans in the United States. Referencing letters written by Agassiz, Gould compares Agassiz' public display of dispassionate objectivity to his private correspondence, in which he describes \"the production of half breeds\" as \"a sin against nature...\" Describing the interbreeding of white and black people, he warns, \"We have already had to struggle, in our progress, against the influence of universal equality... but how shall we eradicate the stigma of a lower race when its blood has once been allowed to flow freely into our children.\" In contrast, others have asserted that, despite favoring polygenism, Agassiz rejected racism and believed in a spiritualized human unity. However, in the same article, Agassiz asks the reader to consider the hierarchy of races, mentioning \"The indomitable, courageous, proud Indian, \u2013 in how very different a light he stands by the side of the submissive, obsequious, imitative negro, or by the side of the tricky, cunning, and cowardly Mongolian! Are not these facts indications that the different races do not rank upon one level in nature?\"\nHistorian Moses Finley considered that the advent of democracy and the development of slavery were closely linked in ancient Greece. This connection, which is questioned, had provided American slaveholders with an argument for maintaining slavery during the American Civil War. Agassiz never supported slavery and claimed his views on polygenism had nothing to do with politics. However, his views on polygenism have emboldened proponents of segregationism. During the Civil War, Agassiz advocated for the liberation of slaves. However, his goal was to prevent any miscegenation. Only strict separation would prevent inexperienced or morally weak white masters from succumbing (Agassiz here transforms the victims into culprits) to the supposed lasciviousness of their black servants and producing mixed-race children. Indeed, following the ban on transporting and importating slaves into America in 1807, there were very few pure Africans left, as many black women had been sexually assaulted and raped by their masters. Unlike Abraham Lincoln, who envisioned repatriating people of African descent to their continent, Agassiz believed their presence in America was irreversible. According to him, the liberation of slaves should be accompanied by strict legal provisions guaranteeing racial segregation to avoid \"crossbreedings\" which, according to him, risked giving birth to less fertile individuals. He envisioned geographic segregation between the northern and southern United States. Agassiz, like other proponents of so-called scientific racism, played a pioneering role in the development of systematic racial segregation.\nAccusations of racism and segregationism against Agassiz have prompted the renaming of landmarks, schoolhouses, and other institutions (which abound in Massachusetts) that bear his name. Opinions about those moves are often mixed, given his extensive scientific legacy in other areas, his racism has long been overshadowed in favor of his brilliant research in the natural sciences. In 2007, the St. Gallen historian Hans F\u00e4ssler took advantage of the 200th anniversary of Agassiz's birth to uncover the scientist's dark side and created an international committee \"Demounting Louis Agassiz\" whose objective was to rename places named after the Swiss scientist in order to send a clear signal against racism. In 2007 and 2015, the Swiss government acknowledged his \"racist thinking\", but declined to rename the Agassizhorn summit Rentyhorn, despite Carlo Sommaruga advocated that such change had already been made in Switzerland when, at the request of Parliament, the Federal Council had decided, in January 1863, to rename the Highest Peak in Switzerland \"Pointe Dufour\" in honor of the Swiss General and topographer Guillaume Henri Dufour. After the Sonderbund War, the country pacified by Dufour had adopted a new Swiss Federal Constitution, inspired by the Constitution of the United States, founding the federal state in 1848. In 2017, the Swiss Alpine Club declined to revoke Agassiz's status as a member of honor, which he received in 1865 for his scientific work, because the club considered that removing Louis Agassiz from the list of former honorary members would be to falsify history. Racism was first analyzed in Switzerland by the African-American writer James Baldwin during his 1953 visit to Leukerbad. He described it as a \"naive\" belief in the superiority of white culture and \"race,\" which\u2014unlike in the United States\u2014did not reveal its violent side due to a lack of direct contact with enslaved or colonized people. Since the 1960s, intellectuals and researchers have taken a closer look at antisemitism and xenophobia in Switzerland. In June 2019, Neuch\u00e2tel changed the name of Espace Louis-Agassiz, near the Faculty of Letters of the University of Neuch\u00e2tel area, to Espace Tilo-Frey. She was the first person of African descent elected to the National Council, in 1971, the year that Swiss voters approved giving women the right to vote and to stand for office in a referendum. In 2020, the Stanford Department of Psychology asked for a statue of Louis Agassiz to be removed from the front fa\u00e7ade of its building. When another statue, that of Baron David de Pury, became a source of debate in Switzerland, the authorities in Neuch\u00e2tel opted to install a plaque and launched an artistic contest to create a work that interacted with the statue and its past. An international jury presided by Pap Ndiaye selected Genevan artist Mathias Pfund's sculpture \"Great in the Concrete\", inspired by the 1906 fall of Agassiz\u2019s statue with head buried in concrete. In 2021, Chicago Public Schools announced they would remove Agassiz's name from an elementary school and rename it for the abolitionist and political activist, Harriet Tubman. In 2022, The Trustees of Reservations renamed Agassiz Rock as The Monoliths.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nAttribution:\nArchive sources.\nA collection of Louis Agassiz's professional and personal life is conserved in . \nExternal links.\n]"}

He and his friends such as Du Fu (712\u2013770) were among the prominent figures in the flourishing of Chinese poetry of the Tang dynasty, often called the \"Golden Age of Chinese Poetry\". The expression \"Three Wonders\" denotes Li Bai's poetry, Pei Min's swordplay, and Zhang Xu's calligraphy.\nAround 1,000 poems attributed to Li are extant. His poems have been collected into the most important Tang dynasty collection, \"Heyue yingling ji\", compiled in 753 by Yin Fan. Thirty-four of Li Bai's poems are included in the anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\", which was first published in the 18th century. Around the same time, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe. In Ezra Pound's famous work \"Cathay\" (1915), Li Bai's poems enjoy the lion's share (11 out of 19). \nLi Bai's poems became models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking. Among the most famous are \"Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day\" (Chinese: \u6625\u65e5\u9189\u8d77\u8a00\u5fd7), \"The Hard Road to Shu\" (Chinese: \u8700\u9053\u96be), \"Bring in the Wine\" (Chinese: \u5c06\u8fdb\u9152), and \"Quiet Night Thought\" (Chinese: \u9759\u591c\u601d), which are still taught in schools in China. In the West, multilingual translations of Li's poems continue to be made. His life has even taken on a legendary aspect, including tales of drunkenness and chivalry, and the well-known tale that Li drowned when he reached from his boat to grasp the moon's reflection in the river while he was drunk.\nMuch of Li's life is reflected in his poems, which are about places he visited; friends whom he saw off on journeys to distant locations, perhaps never to meet again; his own dream-like imaginings, embroidered with shamanic overtones; current events of which he had news; descriptions of nature, perceived as if in a timeless moment; and more. However, of particular importance are the changes in China during his lifetime. His early poems were written in a \"golden age\" of internal peace and prosperity, under an emperor who actively promoted and participated in the arts. This ended with the beginning of the rebellion of general An Lushan, which eventually left most of Northern China devastated by war and famine. Li's poems during this period take on new tones and qualities. Unlike his younger friend Du Fu, Li did not live to see the end of the chaos. Li Bai is depicted in the \"Wu Shuang Pu\" (\u7121\u96d9\u8b5c, \"Table of Peerless Heroes\") by Jin Guliang.\nNames.\nLi Bai's name has been romanized as Li Bai, Li Po, Li Bo (romanizations of Standard Chinese pronunciations), and Ri Haku (a romanization of the Japanese pronunciation). The varying Chinese romanizations are due to the facts that his given name (\u767d) has two pronunciations in Standard Chinese: the literary reading \"b\u00f3\" () and the colloquial reading \"b\u00e1i\"; and that earlier authors used Wade\u2013Giles while modern authors prefer pinyin. The reconstructed version of how he and others during the Tang dynasty would have pronounced this is \"Bh\u00e6k\". His courtesy name was Taibai (\u592a\u767d), literally \"Great White\", as the planet Venus was called at the time; according to his biography in the \"New Book of Tang\", this was because Li's mother had dreamt of Venus while giving birth to him. Li's courtesy name has been romanized variously as \"Li Taibo\", \"Li Taibai\", \"Li Tai-po\", among others. The Japanese pronunciation of his name and courtesy name may be romanized as \"Ri Haku\" and \"Ri Taihaku\" respectively.\nHe is also known by his art name (\"hao\") \"Q\u012bngli\u00e1n J\u016bsh\u00ec\" (), meaning \"Householder of Azure Lotus\", or by the nicknames \"Immortal Poet\" (Poet Transcendent; Wine Immortal (), Banished Transcendent (), Poet-Knight-errant (, or \"Poet-Hero\").\nLife.\nThe two \"Books of Tang\", \"The Old Book of Tang\" and \"The New Book of Tang\", remain the primary sources of bibliographical material on Li Bai. Other sources include internal evidence from poems by or about Li Bai, and certain other sources, such as the preface to his collected poems by his relative and literary executor, Li Yangbin.\nBackground and birth.\nLi Bai is generally considered to have been born in 701, in Suyab (\u788e\u8449) of ancient Chinese Central Asia (present-day Kyrgyzstan), where his family had prospered in business at the frontier. Afterwards, the family under the leadership of his father, Li Ke (\u674e\u5ba2), moved to Jiangyou (\u6c5f\u6cb9), near modern Chengdu, in Sichuan, when the youngster was about five years old. There is some mystery or uncertainty about the circumstances of the family's relocations, due to a lack of legal authorization which would have generally been required to move out of the border regions, especially if one's family had been assigned or exiled there.\nBackground.\nTwo accounts given by contemporaries Li Yangbing (a family relative) and Fan Chuanzheng state that Li's family was originally from what is now southwestern Jingning County, Gansu. Li's ancestry is traditionally traced back to Li Gao, the noble founder of the state of Western Liang. This provides some support for Li's own claim to be related to the Li dynastic royal family of the Tang dynasty: the Tang emperors also claimed descent from the Li rulers of West Liang. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (\u96b4\u897f\u674e\u6c0f). Evidence suggests that during the Sui dynasty, Li's own ancestors, at that time for some reason classified socially as commoners, were forced into a form of exile from their original home (in what is now Gansu) to some location or locations further west. During their exile in the far west, the Li family lived in the ancient Silk Road city of Suiye (Suyab, now an archeological site in present-day Kyrgyzstan), and perhaps also in Tiaozhi (), a state near modern Ghazni, Afghanistan. These areas were on the ancient Silk Road, and the Li family were likely merchants. Their business was quite prosperous.\nEarly years.\nIn 705, when Li Bai was four years old, his father secretly moved his family to Sichuan, near Chengdu, where he spent his childhood. Currently, there is a monument commemorating this in Zhongba Town, Jiangyou, Sichuan province (the area of the modern province known then as Shu, after a former independent state which had been annexed by the Sui dynasty and later incorporated into the Tang dynasty lands). The young Li spent most of his growing years in Qinglian (\u9752\u83b2; lit. \"Blue [also translated as 'green', 'azure', or 'nature-coloured'] Lotus\"), a town in Chang-ming County, Sichuan, China. This now nominally corresponds with Qinglian Town (\u9752\u84ee\u93ae) of Jiangyou County-level city, in Sichuan.\nThe young Li read extensively, including Confucian classics such as \"The Classic of Poetry (Shijing)\" and the \"Classic of History (Shujing)\", as well as various astrological and metaphysical materials which Confucians tended to eschew, though he disdained to take the literacy exam. Reading the \"Hundred Authors\" was part of the family literary tradition, and he was also able to compose poetry before he was ten. The young Li also engaged in other activities, such as taming wild birds and fencing. His other activities included riding, hunting, traveling, and aiding the poor or oppressed by means of both money and arms. Eventually, the young Li seems to have become quite skilled in swordsmanship; as this autobiographical quote by Li himself both testifies to and also helps to illustrate the wild life that he led in the Sichuan of his youth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"When I was fifteen, I was fond of sword play, and with that art I challenged quite a few great men.\"\nBefore he was twenty, Li had fought and killed several men, apparently for reasons of chivalry, in accordance with the knight-errant tradition (\"youxia\").\nIn 720, he was interviewed by Governor Su Ting, who considered him a genius. Though he expressed a wish to become an official, he never took the civil service examination.\nMarriage and family.\nLi is known to have married four times. His first marriage, in 727, in Anlu, Hubei, was to the granddaughter of a former government minister. His wife was from the well-connected Xu (\u8bb8) family. Li Bai made this his home for about ten years, living in a home owned by his wife's family on Mt. Bishan (\u78a7\u5c71). In 744, he married for the second time in what now is the Liangyuan District of Henan. This marriage was to another poet, surnamed Zong (\u5b97), with whom he both had children and exchanges of poems, including many expressions of love for her and their children. His wife, Zong, was a granddaughter of Zong Chuke (\u5b97\u695a\u5ba2, died 710), an important government official during the Tang dynasty and the interregnal period of Wu Zetian.\nOn the way to Chang'an.\nLeaving Sichuan.\nIn his mid-twenties, about 725, Li Bai left Sichuan, sailing down the Yangzi River through Dongting Lake to Nanjing, beginning his days of wandering. He then went back up-river, to Yunmeng, in what is now Hubei, where his marriage to the granddaughter of a retired prime minister, Xu Yushi, seems to have formed but a brief interlude. During the first year of his trip, he met celebrities and gave away much of his wealth to needy friends.\nIn 730, Li Bai stayed at Zhongnan Mountain near the capital Chang'an (Xi'an), and tried but failed to secure a position. He sailed down the Yellow River, stopped by Luoyang, and visited Taiyuan before going home. In 735, Li Bai was in Shanxi, where he intervened in a court martial against Guo Ziyi, who was later, after becoming one of the top Tang generals, to repay the favour during the An Shi disturbances. By perhaps 740, he had moved to Shandong. It was in Shandong at this time that he became one of the group known as the \"Six Idlers of the Bamboo Brook\" or the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove (Rong Qiqi's inclusion was anachronous), an informal group dedicated to literature and wine. He wandered about the area of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, eventually making friends with a famous Daoist priest, Wu Yun. In 742, Wu Yun was summoned by the Emperor to attend the imperial court, where his praise of Li Bai was great.\nAt Chang'an.\nWu Yun's praise of Li Bai led Emperor Xuanzong (born Li Longji and also known as Emperor Minghuang) to summon Li to the court in Chang'an. Li's personality fascinated the aristocrats and common people alike, including another Taoist (and poet), He Zhizhang, who bestowed upon him the nickname the \"Immortal Exiled from Heaven\". Indeed, after an initial audience, where Li Bai was questioned about his political views, the Emperor was so impressed that he held a big banquet in his honor. At this banquet, the Emperor was said to show his favor, even to the extent of personally seasoning his soup for him.\nEmperor Xuanzong employed him as a translator, as Li Bai knew at least one non-Chinese language. Ming Huang eventually gave him a post at the Hanlin Academy, which served to provide scholarly expertise and poetry for the Emperor.\nWhen the emperor ordered Li Bai to the palace, he was often drunk, but quite capable of performing on the spot.\nLi Bai wrote several poems about the Emperor's beautiful and beloved Yang Guifei, the favorite royal consort. A story, probably apocryphal, circulates about Li Bai during this period. Once, while drunk, Li Bai had gotten his boots muddy, and Gao Lishi, the most politically powerful eunuch in the palace, was asked to assist in the removal of these, in front of the Emperor. Gao took offense at being asked to perform this menial service, and later managed to persuade Yang Guifei to take offense at Li's poems concerning her. At the persuasion of Yang Guifei and Gao Lishi, Xuanzong reluctantly, but politely, and with large gifts of gold and silver, sent Li Bai away from the royal court. After leaving the court, Li Bai formally became a Taoist, making a home in Shandong, but wandering far and wide for the next ten some years, writing poems. Li Bai lived and wrote poems at Bishan (or Bi Mountain (\u78a7\u5c71), today Baizhao Mountain (\u767d\u5146\u5c71)) in Yandian, Hubei. Bi Mountain (\u78a7\u5c71) in the poem \"Question and Answer Amongst the Mountains\" (\u5c71\u4e2d\u95ee\u7b54 Shanzhong Wenda) refers to this mountain.\nMeeting Du Fu.\nHe met Du Fu in the autumn of 744, when they shared a single room and various activities together, such as traveling, hunting, wine, and poetry, thus established a close and lasting friendship. They met again the following year. These were the only occasions on which they met, in person, although they continued to maintain a relationship through poetry. This is reflected in the dozen or so poems by Du Fu to or about Li Bai which survive, and the one from Li Bai directed toward Du Fu which remains.\nLetters for political patronage.\nA somewhat lesser known capital of Li Bai's life are the letters he wrote to various officials. In most of them, his aim was to seek political patronage. The famous letter to Han Jing Zhou (\u97e9\u8346\u5dde) is maybe the most known example of his writing. Li Bai's style in his letters was very exaggerated, sometimes arrogant too. Contrary to what was the common practice at the time, I. e. self \u2013 depreciating tone for one's self and a praising tone for the candidate patron, Li Bai ornates his own personal image very vividly. Victor H. Mair translated some notable letters of Li Bai. An excerpt from the letter to Han Jing Zhou (\u4e0e\u97e9\u8346\u5dde\u4e66, pin yin: y\u01d4 h\u00e1n j\u012bng zh\u014du sh\u016b), which Mair dates around 734 CE, illustrates Li Bai's perception of himself:\n\" At fifteen, I was fond of swordsmanship and ranged broadly in search of employ- ment [131] with various lords. At thirty, I became an accomplished litterateur and contacted successively a number of high officers. Although I am not quite a six- footer I am braver than ten thousand men. Princes, dukes, and high ministers admit that I have moral courage and high principles. This, then, has been my past spiritual biography. How could I venture not to explain it fully to Your Lordship ?\"\nWar and exile.\nAt the end of 755, the disorders instigated by the rebel general An Lushan burst across the land. The Emperor eventually fled to Sichuan and abdicated. During the confusion, the Crown Prince opportunely declared himself Emperor and head of the government. The An Shi disturbances continued (as they were later called, since they lasted beyond the death of their instigator, carried on by Shi Siming and others). Li Bai became a staff adviser to Prince Yong, one of Ming Huang's (Emperor Xuanzong's) sons, who was far from the top of the primogeniture list, yet named to share the imperial power as a general after Xuanzong had abdicated, in 756.\nHowever, even before the empire's external enemies were defeated, the two brothers fell to fighting each other with their armies. Upon the defeat of the Prince's forces by his brother the new emperor in 757, Li Bai escaped, but was later captured, imprisoned in Jiujiang, and sentenced to death. The famous and powerful army general Guo Ziyi and others intervened; Guo Ziyi was the very person whom Li Bai had saved from court martial a couple of decades before. His wife, the lady Zong, and others (such as Song Ruosi) wrote petitions for clemency. Upon General Guo Ziyi's offering to exchange his official rank for Li Bai's life, Li Bai's death sentence was commuted to exile: he was consigned to Yelang. Yelang (in what is now Guizhou) was in the remote extreme southwestern part of the empire, and was considered to be outside the main sphere of Chinese civilization and culture. Li Bai headed toward Yelang with little sign of hurry, stopping for prolonged social visits (sometimes for months), and writing poetry along the way, leaving detailed descriptions of his journey for posterity. Notice of an imperial pardon recalling Li Bai reached him before he even got near Yelang. He had only gotten as far as Wushan, traveling at a leisurely pace, as recorded in the poem \"Struggling up the Three Gorges\", intimating that it took so long that his hair turned white during the trip up river, towards exile. Then, news of his pardon caught up with him in 759.\nReturn and other travels.\nWhen Li received the news of his imperial pardon, he returned down the river to Jiangxi, passing on the way through Baidicheng, in Kuizhou Prefecture, still engaging in the pleasures of food, wine, good company, and writing poetry; his poem \"\" records this stage of his travels, as well as poetically mocking his enemies and detractors, implied in his inclusion of imagery of monkeys. Although Li did not cease his wandering lifestyle, he then generally confined his travels to Nanjing and the two Anhui cities of Xuancheng and Li Yang (in modern Zhao County). His poems of this time include nature poems and poems of socio-political protest. Eventually, in 762, Li's relative Li Yangbing became magistrate of Dangtu, and Li Bai went to stay with him there. In the meantime, Suzong and Xuanzong both died within a short period of time, and China had a new emperor. Also, China was involved in renewed efforts to suppress further military disorders stemming from the Anshi rebellions, and Li volunteered to serve on the general staff of the Chinese commander Li Guangbi. However, at age 61, Li became critically ill, and his health would not allow him to fulfill this plan.\nDeath.\nThe new Emperor Daizong appointed Li Bai as a court counsellor in January 764, but by the time the imperial edict arrived in Dangtu, Anhui, Li Bai had already been reported dead for more than a year. Local authorities, however, were only able to ascertain that he died sometime in 762, with the date and cause of his death lost to history.\nLater writers speculated about Li's death. The ninth-century Tang poet Pi Rixiu suggested in a poem that Li had died of chronic thoracic suppuration (pus entering the chest cavity). According to another source, Li Bai drowned after falling from his boat one day while drunk, as he tried to embrace the reflection of the moon in the Yangtze River.\nCalligraphy.\nLi Bai was a skilled calligrapher. One surviving piece of his calligraphy work in his own handwriting exists today. The piece is titled \"Sh\u00e0ng y\u00e1ng t\u00e1i\" (\"Going Up To Sun Terrace\"), a long scroll (with later addition of a title written by Emperor Huizong of Song and a postscript added by the Qianlong Emperor); the calligraphy is housed in the Palace Museum in Beijing, China.\nSurviving texts and editing.\nEven Li Bai and Du Fu, the two most famous and most comprehensively edited Tang poets, were affected by the destruction of the imperial Tang libraries and the loss of many private collections in the periods of turmoil (An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion). Although many of Li Bai's poems have survived, even more were lost and there is difficulty regarding variant texts. One of the earliest endeavors at editing Li Bai's work was by his relative Li Yangbing, the magistrate of Dangtu, with whom he stayed in his final years and to whom he entrusted his manuscripts. However, the most reliable texts are not necessarily in the earliest editions. Song dynasty scholars produced various editions of his poetry, but it was not until the Qing dynasty that such collections as the \"Complete Tang Poems\" made the most comprehensive studies of the then surviving texts.\nThemes.\nCritics have focused on Li Bai's strong sense of the continuity of poetic tradition, his glorification of alcoholic beverages (and, indeed, frank celebration of drunkenness), his use of persona, the fantastic extremes of some of his imagery, his mastery of formal poetic rules\u2014and his ability to combine all of these with a seemingly effortless virtuosity to produce inimitable poetry. Other themes in Li's poetry, noted especially in the 20th century, are sympathy for the common folk and antipathy towards needless wars (even when conducted by the emperor himself).\nPoetic tradition.\nLi Bai had a strong sense of himself as being part of a poetic tradition. The \"genius\" of Li Bai, says one recent account, \"lies at once in his total command of the literary tradition before him and his ingenuity in bending (without breaking) it to discover a uniquely personal idiom...\" Burton Watson, comparing him to Du Fu, says Li's poetry, \"is essentially backward-looking, that it represents more a revival and fulfillment of past promises and glory than a foray into the future.\" Watson adds, as evidence, that of all the poems attributed to Li Bai, about one sixth are in the form of \"yuefu\", or, in other words, reworked lyrics from traditional folk ballads. As further evidence, Watson cites the existence of a fifty-nine poem collection by Li Bai entitled \"Gu Feng\", or \"In the Old Manner\", which is, in part, tribute to the poetry of the Han and Wei dynasties. His admiration for certain particular poets is also shown through specific allusions, for example to Qu Yuan or Tao Yuanming, and occasionally by name, for example Du Fu.\nA more general appreciation for history is shown on the part of Li Bai in his poems of the \"huaigu\" genre, or meditations on the past, wherein following \"one of the perennial themes of Chinese poetry\", \"the poet contemplates the ruins of past glory\".\nRapt with wine and moon.\nJohn C. H. Wu observed that \"while some may have drunk more wine than Li [Bai], no-one has written more poems about wine.\" Classical Chinese poets were often associated with drinking wine, and Li Bai was part of the group of Chinese scholars in Chang'an his fellow poet Du Fu called the \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup.\" The Chinese generally did not find the moderate use of alcohol to be immoral or unhealthy. James J.\u00a0Y Liu comments that \"zui\" in poetry \"does not mean quite the same thing as 'drunk', 'intoxicated', or 'inebriated', but rather means being mentally carried away from one's normal preoccupations\u00a0...\" Liu translates \"zui\" as \"rapt with wine\". The \"Eight Immortals\", however, drank to an unusual degree, though they still were viewed as pleasant eccentrics. Burton Watson concluded that \"[n]early all Chinese poets celebrate the joys of wine, but none so tirelessly and with such a note of genuine conviction as Li [Bai]\".\nThe following two poems, \"Rising Drunk on a Spring Day, Telling My Intent\" and \"Drinking Alone by Moonlight\", are among Li Bai's most famous and demonstrate different aspects of his use of wine and drunkenness.\n&lt;poem&gt;We are lodged in this world as in a great dream;\nThen why cause our lives so much stress?\nThis is my reason to spend the day drunk\nAnd collapse, sprawled against the front pillar.\nWhen I wake, I peer out in the yard\nWhere a bird is singing among the flowers.\nNow tell me, what season is this?\u2014\nThe spring breeze speaks with orioles warbling.\nI am so touched that I almost sigh,\nI turn to the wine, pour myself more,\nThen sing wildly, waiting for the moon,\nWhen the tune is done, I no longer care.&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;\"Rising Drunk on a Spring Day, Telling My Intent\" ( ), translated by Stephen Owen\n&lt;poem&gt;Here among flowers one flask of wine,\nWith no close friends, I pour it alone.\nI lift cup to bright moon, beg its company,\nThen facing my shadow, we become three.\nThe moon has never known how to drink;\nMy shadow does nothing but follow me.\nBut with moon and shadow as companions the while,\nThis joy I find must catch spring while it's here.\nI sing, and the moon just lingers on;\nI dance, and my shadow flails wildly.\nWhen still sober we share friendship and pleasure,\nThen, utterly drunk, each goes his own way\u2014\nLet us join to roam beyond human cares\nAnd plan to meet far in the river of stars.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\"Drinking Alone by Moonlight\" (\"Yu\u00e8xi\u00e0 d\u00fazhu\u00f3\" ), translated by Stephen Owen\nFantastic imagery.\nAn important characteristic of Li Bai's poetry \"is the fantasy and note of childlike wonder and playfulness that pervade so much of it\". Burton Watson attributes this to a fascination with the Taoist priest, Taoist recluses who practiced alchemy and austerities in the mountains, in the aim of becoming xian, or immortal beings. There is a strong element of Taoism in his works, both in the sentiments they express and in their spontaneous tone, and \"many of his poems deal with mountains, often descriptions of ascents that midway modulate into journeys of the imagination, passing from actual mountain scenery to visions of nature deities, immortals, and 'jade maidens' of Taoist lore\". Watson sees this as another affirmation of Li Bai's affinity with the past, and a continuity with the traditions of the Chuci and the early fu. Watson finds this \"element of fantasy\" to be behind Li Bai's use of hyperbole and the \"playful personifications\" of mountains and celestial objects.\nNostalgia.\nLiterary critic James J.Y. Liu notes \"Chinese poets seem to be perpetually bewailing their exile and longing to return home. This may seem sentimental to Western readers, but one should remember the vastness of China, the difficulties of communication... the sharp contrast between the highly cultured life in the main cities and the harsh conditions in the remoter regions of the country, and the importance of family...\" It is hardly surprising, he concludes, that nostalgia should have become a \"constant, and hence conventional, theme in Chinese poetry.\"\nLiu gives as a prime example Li's poem \"A Quiet Night Thought\" (also translated as \"Contemplating Moonlight\"), which is often learned by schoolchildren in China. In a mere 20 words, the poem uses the vivid moonlight and frost imagery to convey the feeling of homesickness. This translation is by Yang Xianyi and Dai Naidie:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUse of persona.\nLi Bai also wrote a number of poems from various viewpoints, including the personae of women. For example, he wrote several poems in the \"Zi Ye\", or \"Lady Midnight\" style, as well as Han folk-ballad style poems.\nTechnical virtuosity.\nLi Bai is well known for the technical virtuosity of his poetry and the mastery of his verses. In terms of poetic form, \"critics generally agree that Li [Bai] produced no significant innovations\u00a0... In theme and content also, his poetry is notable less for the new elements it introduces than for the skill with which he brightens the old ones.\"\nBurton Watson comments on Li Bai's famous poem, which he translates \"Bring the Wine\": \"like so much of Li [Bai]'s work, it has a grace and effortless dignity that somehow make it more compelling than earlier treatment of the same.\"\nLi Bai's yuefu poems have been called the greatest of all time by Ming-dynasty scholar and writer Hu Yinglin.\nLi Bai especially excelled in the Gushi form, or \"old style\" poems, a type of poetry allowing a great deal of freedom in terms of the form and content of the work. An example is his poem \"\u8700\u9053\u96e3\", translated by Witter Bynner as \"Hard Roads in Shu\". Shu is a poetic term for Sichuan, the destination of refuge that Emperor Xuanzong considered fleeing to escape the approaching forces of the rebel General An Lushan. Watson comments that, this poem, \"employs lines that range in length from four to eleven characters, the form of the lines suggesting by their irregularity the jagged peaks and bumpy mountain roads of Sichuan depicted in the poem.\"\nLi Bai was also noted as a master of the jueju, or cut-verse. Ming-dynasty poet Li Pan Long thought Li Bai was the greatest jueju master of the Tang dynasty.\nLi Bai was noted for his mastery of the l\u00fcshi, or \"regulated verse\", the formally most demanding verse form of the times. Watson notes, however, that his poem \"Seeing a Friend Off\" was \"unusual in that it violates the rule that the two middle couplets\u00a0... must observe verbal parallelism\", adding that Chinese critics excused this kind of violation in the case of a genius like Li.\nInfluence.\nIn the East.\nLi Bai's poetry was immensely influential in his own time, as well as for subsequent generations in China. From early on, he was paired with Du Fu. The recent scholar Paula Varsano observes that \"in the literary imagination they were, and remain, the two greatest poets of the Tang\u2014or even of China\". Yet she notes the persistence of \"what we can rightly call the 'Li-Du debate', the terms of which became so deeply ingrained in the critical discourse surrounding these two poets that almost any characterization of the one implicitly critiqued the other\". Li's influence has also been demonstrated in the immediate geographical area of Chinese cultural influence, being known as Ri Haku in Japan. This influence continues even today. Examples range from poetry to painting and to literature.\nIn his own lifetime, during his many wanderings and while he was attending court in Chang'an, Li Bai met and parted from various contemporary poets. These meetings and separations were typical occasions for versification in the tradition of the literate Chinese of the time, a prime example being his relationship with Du Fu.\nAfter his lifetime, Li Bai's influence continued to grow. Some four centuries later, during the Song dynasty, for example, just in the case of his poem that is sometimes translated \"Drinking Alone Beneath the Moon\", the poet Yang Wanli wrote a whole poem alluding to it (and to two other Li Bai poems), in the same \"gushi\", or old-style poetry form.\nIn the 20th century, Li Bai even influenced the poetry of Mao Zedong.\nIn China, his poem \"Quiet Night Thoughts\", reflecting a nostalgia of a traveller away from home, has been widely \"memorized by school children and quoted by adults\".\nHe is sometimes worshipped as an immortal in Chinese folk religion and is also considered a divinity in Vietnam Cao Dai religion.\nIn the West.\nAustrian composer Gustav Mahler used German adaptations of four of Li's poems as texts for four of the songs in his song-symphony Das Lied von der Erde in 1908. American composer Harry Partch based his \"Seventeen Lyrics by Li Po\" (early 1930s, his earliest surviving acknowledged work) for intoning voice and Adapted Viola (an instrument of Partch's own invention) on texts in \"The Works of Li Po, the Chinese Poet\" translated by Shigeyoshi Obata. Around the same time (1931), Swiss composer Volkmar Andreae set eight poems as \"Li-Tai-Pe: Eight Chinese songs for tenor and orchestra, op. 37\". In Brazil, the songwriter Beto Furquim included a musical setting of the poem \"Jing Ye Si\" in his album \"Muito Prazer\".\nEzra Pound.\nLi Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pound's versions of some of his poems in the collection 'Cathay', (Pound transliterating his name according to the Japanese manner as \"Rihaku\"). Li Bai's interactions with nature, friendship, his love of wine and his acute observations of life inform his more popular poems. Some, like \"Changgan xing\" (translated by Ezra Pound as \"\"), record the hardships or emotions of common people. An example of the liberal, but poetically influential, translations, or adaptations, of Japanese versions of his poems made, largely based on the work of Ernest Fenollosa and professors Mori and Ariga.\nGustav Mahler.\nGustav Mahler integrated four of Li Bai's works into his symphonic song cycle \"Das Lied von der Erde\". These were derived from free German translations by Hans Bethge, published in an anthology called (\"The Chinese Flute\"), Bethge based his versions on the collection \"Chinesische Lyrik\" by Hans Heilmann (1905). Heilmann worked from pioneering 19th-century translations into French: three by the Marquis d'Hervey-Saint-Denys and one (only distantly related to the Chinese) by Judith Gautier. Mahler freely changed Bethge's text.\nReference in Beat Generation.\nLi Bai's poetry can be seen as having an influence on Beat Generation writer Gary Snyder during Snyder's years of studying Asian culture and Zen. Li Bai's style of descriptive writing contributed to the diversity within the Beat writing style.\nTranslation.\nLi Bai's poetry was introduced to Europe by Jean Joseph Marie Amiot, a Jesuit missionary in Beijing, in his \"Portraits des C\u00e9l\u00e8bres Chinois\", published in the series \"M\u00e9moires concernant l'histoire, les sciences, les arts, les m\u0153urs, les usages, &amp;c. des Chinois, par les missionnaires de Pekin\". (1776\u20131797). Further translations into French were published by Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys in his 1862 \"Po\u00e9sies de l'\u00c9poque des Thang\".\nJoseph Edkins read a paper, \"On Li Tai-po\", to the Peking Oriental Society in 1888, which was subsequently published in that society's journal. The early sinologist Herbert Allen Giles included translations of Li Bai in his 1898 publication \"Chinese Poetry in English Verse\", and again in his \"History of Chinese Literature\" (1901). The third early translator into English was L. Cranmer-Byng (1872\u20131945). His \"Lute of Jade: Being Selections from the Classical Poets of China\" (1909) and \"A Feast of Lanterns\" (1916) both featured Li's poetry.\nRenditions of Li Bai's poetry into modernist English poetry were influential through Ezra Pound in \"Cathay\" (1915) and Amy Lowell in \"Fir-Flower Tablets\" (1921). Neither worked directly from the Chinese: Pound relied on more or less literal, word for word, though not terribly accurate, translations of Ernest Fenollosa and what Pound called the \"decipherings\" of professors Mori and Ariga; Lowell on those of Florence Ayscough. Witter Bynner with the help of Kiang Kang-hu included several of Li's poems in \"The Jade Mountain\" (1939). Although Li was not his preferred poet, Arthur Waley translated a few of his poems into English for the \"Asiatic Review\", and included them in his \"More Translations from the Chinese\". Shigeyoshi Obata, in his 1922 \"The Works of Li Po\", claimed he had made \"the first attempt ever made to deal with any single Chinese poet exclusively in one book for the purpose of introducing him to the English-speaking world.\" A translation of Li Bai's poem \"Green Moss\" by poet William Carlos Williams was sent as a letter to Chinese American poet David Rafael Wang where Williams was seen as having a similar tone as Pound.\nLi Bai became a favorite among translators for his straightforward and seemingly simple style. Later translations are too numerous to discuss here, but an extensive selection of Li's poems, translated by various translators, is included in John Minford and Joseph S. M.

{"id": "18025", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18025", "title": "Longship", "text": "Specialized Scandinavian warship\nLongships () were long clinker-built warships (, Old Swedish: \"h\u00e6rskip\") propelled by oars, and later also by sail, used by the Norse and surrounding Germanic tribes from at least the 4th century AD and throughout the Viking Age, being part of the Nordic ship building tradition. As the name suggests, they were long slender ships, intended for speed, with the ability to carry a large crew of warriors. They are sometimes called \"dragonships\" () due to a tradition of the fore and aft ends being decorated with a raised dragonhead () and tail respectively, with the sail making up the \"wing\" of the dragon. The largest types were thus called \"dragons\" (\"dreki\"), while smaller types had names such as karve (\"karfi\"), snekke (\"snekkja\"), and skeid (\"skei\u00f0\").\nArchaeological finds have been made of longships from the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries in Denmark, Norway and Germany, with motifs on Gotlandic picture stones dating to the 8th century or earlier. It is thought that the Norse specifically invented the design for Viking usage, which included raiding and warfare, exploration and commerce. The longship is a rather distinctly Norse (Scandinavian) construction, with bronze age petroglyphs in Sweden indicating a long tradition of building long animal-headed naval ships in Scandinavia. Equivalent clinker-built naval ships by the Wends (a South Baltic Slavic people) were much smaller and shorter in comparison.\nThe principles leading to the longship's design evolved over a long period of time. A big technological advancement came around 300 AD, when clinker-building was invented, as seen in the Danish Nydam boat and Swedish Bj\u00f6rke boat, both from around 320 AD, with their features being subsquently adopted in the ships of other cultures, including those of the Anglo-Saxons, as seen in the 7th century Sutton Hoo ship. They continued to influence naval engineering for centuries, and the character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat building traditions to the present day. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with cloth sails (woven wool), and had various details and carvings on the hull.\nHistory.\nThe evolution of shipbuilding in Scandinavia was facilitated by development of the iron industry. There was a great increase in iron production in the later Viking Age with the exploitation of bog ore as a source of iron ore to smelt into metal for iron tools, including farm implements and weaponry, as well as shipbuilding tools. With this technology, and the ready availability of nearly unlimited timber in the vast forests of Norway, the Norsemen acquired a high degree of skill in boat construction. Scandinavians developed the shipbuilding, navigation, and seamanship capabilities needed to exploit the undefended ports and coastlines of continental Europe. They became its foremost maritime people and the Viking Age began with Norse overseas expansion.\nThe archaeologists Julie Lund and S\u00f8ren M. Sindb\u00e6k cite a dataset generated by a reconstruction of annual summer temperatures over the past 2,000 years that indicates a distinct warming trend in the 8th and 9th centuries, reviving earlier hypotheses that a milder climate was an impetus for the expansion of Norse maritime activity and colonization. Neil Price proposes that the maritime raiding practices which constitute what he calls the \"Viking phenomenon\" may have begun earlier than ordinarily believed, and beyond the environs of the North Sea. He argues that recent finds such as the Salme ship burials from c. 750 suggest that raiding might have originated in the Baltic region, especially in the east.\nThe Norse had a well-developed naval architecture, and during the early medieval period, their ship designs were advanced for their time. The ships were owned by coastal farmers, and under the leidang system, every section in the king's realm was required to build warships and to provide men to crew them, allowing the king to quickly assemble a large and powerful war fleet. The historians David Bachrach and Bernard Bachrach say that Viking longships were part of a long tradition of oared warships operating in the northern seas. The main purpose of their warships was to \"land troops rather than to engage in combat at sea\", and to swiftly carry as many warriors as possible to a scene of conflict. In the 10th century, longships would sometimes be tied together in offshore battles to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. However, examples of more traditional naval combat also exist, such as the Battle of Svolder, where various projectiles and bow and arrow were used, as well as naval boarding.\nThe Viking longships were powerful naval weapons in their time and were highly valued possessions. Archaeological finds show that the Viking ships were not standardized. Ships varied from designer to designer and place to place and often had regional characteristics. For example, the choice of material was mostly dictated by the regional forests, such as pine from Norway and Sweden, and oak from Denmark. Moreover, each Viking longship had particular features adjusted to the natural conditions under which it was sailed.\nDuring the 9th-century peak of the Viking expansion, large fleets set out to attack the declining Frankish empire by attacking navigable rivers such as the Rhine, the Seine, the Loire and others. Rouen was sacked in 841, the year after the death of Louis the Pious, a son of Charlemagne. Quentovic, near modern \u00c9taples, was attacked in 842 and 600 Danish ships attacked Hamburg in 845. In the same year, 129 ships returned to attack the Seine. They were called \"dragonships\" by enemies such as the English because some had a dragon-shaped decoration atop the bowstem.\nOn 1 October 844, when most of the Iberian peninsula was controlled by the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba and was known as \"al-Andalus\", a flotilla of about 80 Viking ships, after attacking Asturias, Galicia and Lisbon, ascended the Guadalquivir to Seville, and after a brief siege and heavy fighting, took it by storm on 3 October. They inflicted many casualties and took numerous hostages with the intent to ransom them. Another group of Vikings had gone to C\u00e1diz to plunder while those in Seville waited on \"Qubtil\" (Isla Menor), an island in the river, for the ransom money to arrive. Meantime, the emir of C\u00f3rdoba, Abd ar-Rahman II, prepared a military contingent to meet them, and on 11 November a pitched battle ensued on the grounds of \"Talayata\" (Tablada). The Vikings held their ground, but the results were catastrophic for the invaders, who suffered a thousand casualties; four hundred were captured and executed, some thirty ships were destroyed. It was not a total victory for the emir's forces, but the Viking survivors had to negotiate a peace to leave the area, surrendering their plunder and the hostages they had taken to sell as slaves, in exchange for food and clothing.\nIn 859, a major long-distance Viking expedition set out for \"al-Andalus\". They tried to land at Galicia and were driven off. Then they sailed down the west coast of the peninsula and burned the mosque at I\u0161b\u012bliya (Seville), but were repelled by a large Muslim force there before entering the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar and burning the mosque at al-Jaz\u012brah (Algeciras), following which they headed south to the Emirate of Nekor in modern Morocco, plundered the city for eight days, and defeated a Muslim force that attempted to stop them.\nThe Vikings made several incursions into \"al-Andalus\" in the years 859, 966 and 971, but with intentions more diplomatic than bellicose, although an attempt at invasion in 971 was frustrated when the Viking fleet was totally annihilated.\nDevelopment.\nPre-historic ships.\nThe origin of the longship design can be traced back to the Nordic Bronze Age, as various ships of similar principle can be found on period petroglyphs around Sweden (for example the Rock Carvings in Tanum, spanning about 600 panels dated to between 1800 and 500 BC). Such show various features later found on longships, such as having raised stems fore and aft, sometimes decorated with what appear to be animal heads.\nThe Hjortspring boat, a vessel designed as a large canoe, closely resembles the thousands of petroglyph images of Nordic Bronze Age ships found throughout Scandinavia. Dating to the 4th century BC, it was found in a bog in southern Denmark. About long and wide, the boat is the oldest find of a wooden plank-built ship in the Nordic countries. A large array of weaponry, including shields, spears, and swords, was found with the boat.\nRowed longships.\nThe earliest rowed true longship that has been found is the Nydam ship, built in Denmark around 400\u00a0AD. It also had very rounded underwater sections but had more pronounced flare in the topsides, giving it more stability as well as keeping more water out of the boat at speed or in waves. It had no sail. It was of lapstrake construction fastened with iron nails. The bow and stern were slightly elevated. The keel was a flattened plank about twice as thick as a normal strake plank but still not strong enough to withstand the downwards thrust of a mast. The ribs were selected from timber that had grown to the specific shape, and were lashed to the planks with lime-bast rope through raised \"cleats\" (spacers) on the inside that had been shaped from the solid timber.\nA later development of this style of ship is the Sutton Hoo ship, found in an Anglo-Saxon grave in Sutton Hoo, England, dating to around 620. The Anglo-Saxons were at this time very cognate to the Norse, and the finds in the grave shows a close relation between these cultures. Albeit completely rotted away, the remnant shape in the earth shows a low prow and stern like the Nydam ship, with a total length of .\nThe Kvalsund ship, one of two vessels found in a Danish bog, was built in the late 8th century. According to the dendrochronology research team led by S\u00e6bj\u00f8rg Walaker Nordeide, a specialist in Medieval archaeology, the Kvalsund ship is a link in the transition from the ship technology of the early Iron Age to that of the Viking Age. They say that based on dendrochronological dating of the wooden remains, the trees used to construct the two vessels are estimated to have been felled at the end of the 8th century, ca. 780\u2013800, dating the vessels to \"the threshold of the Viking Age\". The ship, known as Kvalsund II to distinguish it from the boat that was found with it, is estimated to be long and wide, with 10 pairs of oars. A mast was found, but it is not known to which it belonged.\nTypes of longships.\nThere was no single type of Viking ship: there were many kinds. The archeologist and historian Olaf Olsen and the maritime archaeologist Ole Crumlin-Pedersen say that according to the sagas, a Viking ship had to have at least 13 pairs of oars to be regarded as a longship and at least 25 pairs of oars to be considered a great-ship. They varied in size from about , were powered either by oars or by sail and oars, and were built for various purposes, such as warfare, fishing, or trade. Longships can be classified into a number of different types, depending on size, construction details, and the prestige of the owner. The word 'longship' appears to describe ships characterized by their length, rather than being a name for a ship type. The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board. The proper type names for ships in this category were \"skei\u00f0\", \"dreki\", \"askr\" and \"snekkja\".\nCrumlin-Pedersen refers to the word 'longship' as being commonly used to mean the \"swift raiding vessels and landing crafts of the Vikings\". Longships made it possible for the Vikings to raid the coastal regions of Western Europe and to sail up its rivers. The Vikings were successful in warfare with these ships of advanced design, using them in sea operations as landing vessels for warriors to be deployed in land battle. Longships also enabled the establishment of permanent Scandinavian settlements in the Northern Isles of Scotland, parts of Ireland, the Danelaw area of England, and Normandy in France.\nAccording to Judith Jesch, a scholar of the Viking Age and Old Norse language and literature, the Old Norse word \"langskip\" occurs just twice in the skaldic stanzas. 'Longship' is used only once in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", in the form \"langscip\", in an entry for the year 896 that describes King Alfred's part in the Anglo-Saxon and Viking warfare of the late 9th century. In the \"Chronicle\" and other Anglo-Saxon written sources, the Danish ships are called \"\u00e6scas\" or they are referred to by the type names \"snekkja\", \"skei\u00f0\" or \"dreki\". Crumlin-Pedersen says \"skei\u00f0\" appears to have been the most common name for longships in Scandinavia.\nModern-day knowledge of Viking ships comes from iconography such as the pictures found on runestones, in written accounts, especially the Old Norse sagas, and finds of the remains of actual ships. The philologist Eldar Heide argues that most classification schemes used in introductions to the subject of old Scandinavian ship types, such as \"knorr\", \"snekkja\", or \"karfi\", are problematic, and calls for more emphasis on research of the textual evidence to understand what they were called and what they were like. Jesch says that any kind of Scandinavian ship could be long, and that \"longship\" is not a technical term. She says furthermore that text in the skaldic corpus calling a large warship a \"dragon\", whether or not it has a dragonhead prow, is more likely a poetical conceit rather than a technical term for warships.\nOle Crumlin-Pederson was the founder of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde and made important contributions to maritime archaeology research. According to Crumlin-Pedersen, information on the origin and dating of early ships from Northern Europe can \"be determined by independent natural scientific methods, primarily by dendrochronology\", and it is not necessary to use sequential typology to date archaeological finds of such vessels.\nKarve (\"karfi\").\nThe \"karve\", or \"karvi\" (; Old Swedish: \"karve\"; , \"korabl\u012d\"; also a Proto-Finnic form of , \"small boat\"), is the smallest vessel that is considered a longship. The Gokstad ship is a famous Viking ship that was probably a \"karvi\" built around the end of the 9th century and buried c. 900; it was excavated in 1880 by Nicolay Nicolaysen. It is nearly long with 16 rowing positions, i.e., it carried 32 oarsmen.\nSnekke (\"snekkja\" / \"snacc\").\nThe \"snekke\" (, Old Danish: \"sn\u00e6kke\", Old Swedish: \"sn\u00e6kkia\", ) was one of the most common types of ships. With 13 benches, that is, 26 oarsmen, a \"snekke\" was regarded as the smallest ship usable for warfare. Jesch writes that eight skaldic stanzas use the word \"snekkja\", with seven of them dating to the mid-11th century. She says it is clearly related to the Old English \"snacc\", but its etymology is uncertain. The name survives for a smaller boat type in the Nordic countries; in , , ; also in German as (, ), and Dutch as (, \"snikke\", ); although in Swedish, the most commonly used term is \"\", which has historically been translated as \"gig\".\nSkeid (\"skei\u00f0\" / \"sceg\u00f0\").\nSkeid (Old West Norse: ; ; Old East Norse: ; , \"skedii\"), meaning 'skid, slider, cleaver (of water)', with the connotation of \"speeder\", was a type of narrow and fast longship.\nA Viking Age skeid known as \"Skuldelev 2\", a long, slender warship about long, was discovered in the Roskilde finds of 1962. Dendrochronology shows that this vessel was built in Dublin around 1042. \"Skuldelev 2\" had 30 benches and could carry a crew of 65 to 70. It was likely a skeid, and considering its size certainly belonged to a high-ranking chieftain, according to the linguist Angus Somerville and the historian R. Andrew McDonald. In 1996\u201397 archaeologists discovered the remains of another ship in the harbor. This ship, called the \"Roskilde 6\", is the longest Viking ship ever discovered and has been dated to around 1025. It was long and had a beam of . The vessel drew about of water, and carried about 100 men, including 78 rowers. \"Skuldelev 2\" was replicated as \"Seastallion from Glendalough\" (\"Havhingsten fra Glendalough\") at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde and launched in 2004.\nDragon (\"dreki\" / \"ormr\").\nThe term \"dragon\" (Old West Norse: \"dreki\", Old East Norse: \"draki\"; also , \"serpent\" = 'dragon') was used for ships with thirty rooms and upwards. These ships were likely skeids that differed only in the carvings of the head and tail of a flying dragon, carried on the prow and stern of the ship. Judith Jesch, an expert in runic inscriptions, says, \"The word \"dreki\" for a ship derives from this practice of placing carved dragonheads on ships... but there is no evidence that it was a technical term for any particular kind of ship.\"\nThe earliest mentioned \"dreki\" was the ship of unstated size owned by Harald Fairhair in the 10th century. Short says that warships were measured by the number of \"r\u00fam\", \"rooms\", they contained, a room being the space between the crossbeams, a little less than . A room could accommodate two oars, one on each side of the ship. According to N.A.M. Rodger, ships of 30 rooms or more were very unusual. The first \"drekki\" ship whose size is known was Olav Tryggvason's 30 room \"Tranin\" (Crane), built at Nidaros in 995. His later ship \"Ormrinn langi\" (Long Serpent) of 34 room (assumed to be long) built during the winter of 999 to 1000, was the most well-known of such ships in this period. The common word for dragon in old Germanic languages such as Old Norse was not \"dragon\" (\"\"), but rather \"serpent\", specifically \"worm\" (, , ). This is mirrored in the name \"Long Serpent\" (), or \"Long Dragon\", as given by the philologist Hans-Peter Naumann, for example. \nThe city seal of Bergen, Norway, created in 1299, depicts a ship with a dragon's head at either end, which might be intended to represent a dreki ship.\nPropulsion.\nThe longships had two methods of propulsion: oars and sail. At sea, the sail enabled longships to travel faster than by oar and to cover long distances overseas with far less manual effort. Sails could be raised or lowered quickly. Oars were used when near the coast or in a river, to gain speed quickly, and when there was an adverse (or insufficient) wind. In combat, the variability of wind power made rowing the chief means of propulsion. The ship was steered by a vertical flat blade with a short round handle, at right angles, mounted over the starboard side of the aft gunwale.\nLongships were not fitted with actual benches, and apparently had movable seats. When rowing, the oarsmen may have sat on sea chests (chests containing their personal possessions) that would otherwise take up space. These chests would be brought aboard the ship when it was manned. Oars were fashioned of varying lengths according to their position in the ship. In the construction of longships, rounded or rectangular oarports were cut through the upper strake on both sides along the full length of a warship, while on merchant ships they were fitted only near the ends.\nAn innovation that improved the sail's performance was the \"beitass\" (Old Norse), a wooden luff or tacking spar that stiffened the sail, thus allowing the vessel to tack (sail into the wind, on a zig-zag course). It was used especially on the \"knarr\". The windward performance of the ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or leeboard. To assist in tacking, the \"beitass\" kept the luff taut. A step was built into the ship just forward of the mast with one or two sockets on each side. The heel of the \"beitass\" was stepped into one of these when the vessel was underway. Sometimes blocks of wood were treenailed to the sides of the hull, with each hole angled forward to receive the end of the tacking spar.\nNavigation.\nDuring the Viking Age (900\u20131200\u00a0AD) Vikings were the dominant seafarers of the North Atlantic. One of the keys to their success was the ability to navigate skillfully across the open waters. According to the medievalist and archaeologist, James Graham-Campbell, however they achieved their navigational feats, the Vikings appear to have developed ocean navigation to a high degree, possibly using innate skills that modern people have forgot they possess. They sailed their ships from Arctic waters to the Volga River and the Caspian Sea and across the Atlantic Ocean to North America. They could not have accomplished these feats without a mastery of seamanship and navigation. They used their ships to raid coastal towns, but also went on trading expeditions and made voyages to explore foreign lands and establish new settlements.\nThe steersman was the skipper (\"styrima\u00f0r\") of the vessel and set its course and speed, sailing by observation of the sea, the sky, and the wind, as well as by weather signs such as the behaviour of seabirds. The maritime archaeologist Timm Weski cites Schnall for the information that a number of coastal currents are mentioned in the Nordic sources, along with the danger they represented to sailors, who, however, seemed to pay no attention to currents on the open sea. They did not take them into account when steering a course in a long-distance passage, nor did they take advantage of following currents that would have given them a boost in their direction of travel.\nThe historian and research scientist Tatjana N. Jackson writes that when Vikings began to migrate from Norway to Iceland in the 9th century, they brought with them the names of the four cardinal directions: \"nor\u00f0r\", \"austr\", \"su\u00f0r\", and \"vestr\", as well as the names of the ordinal directions, those that referred to the features of the western coast of Norway. Consequently \"landnor\u00f0r\" ('north by the land') meant north-east, \"\u00fatnor\u00f0r\" ('north and out, away') meant north-west, while \"landsu\u00f0r\" meant south-east, and \"\u00fatsu\u00f0r\" south-west.\nAccording to the Old Norse philologist and runologist Tristan Mueller-Vollmer writing with Kirsten Wolf, a specialist in Old Norse and Scandinavian linguistics, it is nearly certain that the Vikings could set their latitude on a voyage, but little is known of how they might have done this. Viking mariners probably depended on oral headings when they set a course to sail, having no magnetic compass and no charts. They likely used basic celestial navigation, tracking the sun's movement during the day and the position of the stars at night, primarily Polaris, called \"leidarstjarna\" (lode star) in Old Norse. However, the Pole Star would only have been visible in the early and late parts of the sailing season because of the long hours of summer daylight in the north. Weski says that nowadays the position of the Pole Star is almost directly overhead at the pole, but in 1000 it circled around the pole at a distance of about 7\u00b0 in the sky.\nThorsteinn Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, a specialist in the medieval history of science in Iceland and Norway, considers the voyages to Vinland made by the Vikings as \"the crowning medieval Norse achievement in the field of seamanship and navigation.\" They were the culmination of hundreds of years of experience sailing across the northern Atlantic. The influence of these voyages on later historic events may have been negligible, but they had a lasting impact as an essential part of the Norse heritage of the Icelandic sagas.\nSunstone hypothesis.\nAccording to the scientific journal \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\", the Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou in 1969 proposed that so-called \"sunstones\" might have been used by the Vikings to determine the azimuth direction of the sun, even when it is or obscured by clouds or mist or below the horizon. Sightings of the sun's position at sunrise and sunset were necessary for their ships to stay on course. These sightings would frequently be obstructed by thin layers of fog or low clouds, even though the sky overhead remained blue. Under such conditions, he theorized that sunstones could have been used to determine the position of the obscured sun because of their property of polarizing light. These stones, crystals of Iceland spar (a variety of calcite), or of cordierite, are doubly refracting, meaning that objects viewed through them appear to be doubled.\nIn 1975, the maritime historian Uwe Schnall published a study, \"Navigation der Wikinger\", about Viking-Age navigation based on Old Norse texts held at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Schnall wrote that navigational aids such as the supposed '\"sun stone\" (\"s\u00f3larsteinn\"), often associated with sun compasses, are mentioned only once in the Icelandic sagas, in the second section of Snorri's \"Heimskringla\", a biography of Saint Olaf, \"St. Olaf's Saga\". The story is about a wager between King Olaf and the farmer Sigur\u056er, but not in a navigational setting. Sigur\u056er declared that he could find the sun's position in the sky, even though it was an overcast day with snow being blown in the wind. King Olaf held a sunstone in the air and viewed the sun, confirming Sigur\u056er's claim. Schnall says that all other references to \"s\u00f3larsteinn\" concern precious stones, which were not used to navigate.\nNo sunstone has ever been found in Viking archaeological investigations. Consequently it is not known if Vikings ever actually used sunstones, but they could have been useful navigational aids, as much of the area they sailed over and explored in the North Atlantic was near polar latitudes, where the sun is very close to the horizon for much of the year.\nAn astronomer for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Bradley E. Schaefer, writes that there is no useful textual, ethnographic, or archaeological evidence for the use of \"sunstones\" as celestial navigation aids, thus their nature is unknown. He declares that his extensive tests with \"many crystals, many configurations, and many cloud conditions, all throughout the North Atlantic around Iceland and Greenland\" show that in real-world practice, the crystals perform very poorly and can be used to determine the sun's direction \"only when the sky has large blue patches\", in which case its location is already obvious from observations with the naked eye.\nSundials.\nDuring an excavation of a Viking Age farm in southern Greenland part of a circular disk with carvings was recovered. The discovery of the so-called Viking Sundial suggested a hypothesis that it was used as a compass. Archaeologists found a piece of stone and a fragment of a wooden disk, both featuring straight and hyperbolic carvings. It turned out that the two items had been parts of sundials used by the Vikings as a compass during their sea-crossings along latitude 61 degrees North.\nArchaeologists have found two devices which they interpret as navigation instruments. Both appear to be sundials with gnomon curves etched on a flat surface. The devices are small enough to be held flat in the hand at diameter. A wooden version dated to about 1000\u00a0AD was found in Greenland. A stone version was also found at Vatnahverfi, Greenland. By looking at the place where the shadow from the rod falls on a carved curve, a navigator is able to sail along a line of latitude. Both gnomon curve devices show the curve for 61\u00b0 north very prominently. This was the approximate latitude that the Vikings would have sailed along to get to Greenland from Scandinavia. The wooden device also has north marked and had 32 arrow heads around the edge that may be the points of a compass. Other lines are interpreted as the solstice and equinox curves. The device was tested successfully, as a sun compass, during a 1984 reenactment when a longship sailed across the North Atlantic. It was accurate to within \u00b15\u00b0.\nCrew.\nThe Gulating Law (\"Gulatingslova\") of Norway, passed down orally until about 1100, contained a number of rules regarding the duties of a warship's steersman (\"styrima\u00f0r\"), who functioned as its skipper. The \"styrima\u00f0r\" was appointed by the king and bore responsibility for the ship before, during and after a voyage. If the ship was yet to be built he supervised its construction. When the king summoned the \"leidang\" to war, the \"styrima\u00f0r\" chose the crew for his ship. He was responsible for its navigation on voyages, while the \"lei\u00f0s\u00f6guma\u00f0r\" was the crew member who actually plotted the ship's course.\nRowing positions on longships were assigned so that each man had a designated place. The position of a rower on a ship, known as an \"oar bench\", was called a \"sess\". Aft was the \"lypting\", a raised half deck, where the helmsman and the commander stood. Forward of this was the \"fyrirrum\" (foreroom) where a chest, \"the high-seat chest\" (\"h\u00e1s\u00e6tis-kista\"), held the crew's weapons and was also used to store treasure. Next was a bailing station called the \"austr-r\u00fam\" and then the long amidships section, the \"krappa-r\u00fam\", where the oarsmen manned the oars and managed the sails, and where they lived on a voyage. The forepart of the ship also had its bailing station between the \"krappa-r\u00fam\" and the raised half deck, the \"stafn\", in the bow. Some ships had a space at the bow called the \"rausn\" (forecastle) where the \"stafnbuar\" (lookout man) and the \"merkis-ma\u00f0r\" (standard bearer) were stationed. Crumlin-Pedersen says that when rowing, the crew of the Oseberg ship for example sat on moveable chests which were used to stow the warrior's personal belongings. Equipment could also be stored in his skin sleeping bag in the daytime and when boarding the ship or going ashore.\nCook duty on voyages was assigned by the cast of lots among the men who lived in a \"fylki\", i.e. ship district, or county, who had thralls to carry on the work at their farmsteads. The cook was paid the same wages as the sailors, who received one \u00f8re per month.\nConstruction.\nAina Margrethe Heen-Pettersen, a specialist in Viking Age archaeology, says a substantial social and economic investment was demanded to build and outfit a ship for expeditions. Estimates derived from experimental archaeology show that building a longship may have required the labour of 100 persons for a year, counting that necessary to produce the needed ropes, sails, and iron. Assuming 12-hour working days, as many as 40,000 work hours would be expended. Equipping, crewing, and feeding a fleet also needed considerable resources.\nA master shipwright called the \"hofudsmidir\" (\"h\u01ebfu\u00f0smi\u00f0r\") was in charge of the construction of large ships. It was his responsibility to ensure that all required materials were available at the shipyard or worksite and that the craftsmen were fed and paid for their labour. McGrail says building the ships required a large number of workers, with various skills and levels of expertise. \"Long Serpent\" (\"Ormr inn langi\") was built for Olaf Tryggvason at Trondheim in 998 or 999 by a team with these job descriptions: labourers, tree fellers, general carpenters or plank-cutters (\"filungar\"), and stem-and-stern wrights or \"stafnasmidir\" (\"stafnasmi\u00f0r\"). who were paid twice the wages of plank cutters. The \"stafnasmidir\" shaped the keel and the carved those stems that were decorated artistically, while the \"filungr\" used axes and adzes to cleave the planks. In one scene of the Bayeux tapestry a man, almost certainly a \"stafnasmidir\", is depicted standing in front of the stem of a boat, inspecting the workmanship and checking that its lines are fair.\nCharacteristics.\nThe longships were characterized as graceful, long, narrow, and light, with a shallow-draft hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one metre deep and permitted arbitrary beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages or used bottom-up for shelter in camps. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the hull. Later versions had a rectangular sail on a single mast, which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys. The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship, but lay in the range of and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions was around . The Viking Ship Museum in Oslo houses the remains of three such ships, the Oseberg, the Gokstad and the Tune ship.\nOle Crumlin-Pedersen writes that the Viking warship was differentiated from the merchant ship by its long continuous deck and the long line of oar ports, the deck being made of loose planks placed in grooves in the sides of the cross-beams. The fore and aft ends of the deck were raised slightly\u2014the foreward end was called the \"stafn-lok\" and the afterward was called the \"lypting\". This was not what would be considered a deck in modern times. It was little more than a raised floor, and it offered no shelter from foul weather.\nTimber.\nAlthough analysis of timber samples from Viking longships shows that a variety of timbers were used to build them, oak was most often used because it was strong, durable, and rot resistant. Although oak is a heavy timber, it can be easily worked by adze and axe when green (unseasoned). Generally large and prestigious ships were made from oak. Morten Ravn, a curator and researcher at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, says the skaldic stanzas describe which wood species were used to craft a specific type ship or ship component. Pine (Old Norse: \"fura\") and fir (\"\u00feella\"), maple (\"hlynr\"), ash (\"askr\"), and linden or lime (\"lind\"), are noted, but especially oak (\"eik\"). \"Eik\" and \"eikikj\u01eblr\" (a keel made of oak), are used in referring to well-made ships. The size of the mast, \"vandlangt\" (long-masted), is also used to define a high-status ship.\nAccording to Angelo Forte, a maritime historian, Viking shipwrights used timber that had been recently cut, and may have immersed it in water to make it flexible enough to bend in the shape of the hull. They took advantage of the natural shapes of tree trunks, branches and roots to form those parts required for a ship's construction. These are very strong because they are aligned with the tree's fibres. Tall, straight trees were most suitable for working into masts, keels, and planking for the hull. The forestem and sternpost would be carved as single pieces from curved trunks. Forked branches were made into floor timbers, and curved ones were made into frames. The natural bend where a trunk joined a root was optimal for fashioning into knees, used as braces to stiffen the joint between two pieces of timber fastened at angles to each other. Boatbuilders chose a log with a branch that had the correct shape. Generally made from a straight piece of timber and fastened using a knee in each side of the hull, \"biti\" were the cross beams that functioned as the rower's seat. They are an essential part of the frame\u2014a bite with its floor timber, knee and futtocks is the stiffest joinery in the boat.\nTimber was worked with iron adzes and axes. Most of the smoothing was done with a side axe. Other tools used in woodwork were hammers, wedges, drawknives, and planes.\nSail, mast, and rigging.\nAccording to the archaeologist Ole Thirup Kastholm, curator of the Roskilde Museum, sails and rigging, for the most part, are not represented in the archaeological record. These primary components of a functional sailing ship are known only by negative impressions on hulls, contemporary representations of ships, and detached objects. Kastholm writes that modern-day reconstructions of Viking Age warships are rigged with a more elevated type of square sail, based largely on the Norwegian square-rigged vessels of the 19th century. He says these contrast with the evidence of images of ships from the Viking Age on rune stones, graffiti, picture stones, and coins that depict warships equipped with low, square sails significantly wider than their height. Sails and rigging have, therefore, been reconstructed on the basis of ethnographic evidence, rather than evidence from the archaeological record revealed in maritime archaeological finds. In his view, data gathered from prehistoric remains should take precedence over the hypotheses of ethnography and experiments derived from them.\nThe historian F. Donald Logan says the sail of the Gokstad ship was rectangular in shape or nearly a square of possibly , and that it was made of rough wool cloth (\"va\u00f0m\u00e1l\"), probably striped or checked, and hung from a yard. Lines were attached from the bottom of the sail to points along the gunwale, allowing the ship to \"reach\" (sail across the wind) and to \"tack\" (sail towards the wind). Logan says that the mast of Gokstad ship, for example, has not survived in its original state, thus its height and the height to which the sail was raised are not certain. However long the mast was, apparently between , it was set into the keelson, a heavy wooden housing on the keel amidship, from which it could be removed as necessary.\nLise Bender J\u00f8rgensen, an archaeologist, writes that because Viking ship sails were made of wool, large amounts of it would have been necessary for their production, as demonstrated by experimental archaeology. With the introduction of sails in Scandinavia around 700, there would have been a great increase in demand for wool sailcloth and the labour of women to produce it. The researchers that J\u00f8rgensen cites say of sailcloth, warp yarns and weft had to be spun and woven into 15\u201316 lengths of cloth before the sailmakers could begin their work.\nThe nautical archaeologists Cooke \"et al\" describe how, with the aim of reconstructing sails to rig replicas of four of the Skuldeleve ships from Roskilde Fjord, the Viking Ship Museum initiated research in the archaeological record and in the literature to define its specifications for weaving the fabric. Because woollen square-sails had been used until the 20th century in Scandinavia and in the Faroe Islands, a good deal of practical information about making them was still available, and a few sailmakers who worked in wool were still alive. The museum began its research into woollen sails in 1977, and in the years afterwards several reconstructions of Viking Age ships were outfitted with wool sails. According to the museum, it appears that three types of weave were used to produce wool sail cloth in Viking times, depending on the available resources and the local traditions of the area where it was made. The museum decided to use 2/1 twill (\"tuskept\") for the weaving of the wool sail for its reconstructed ships, basing this decision on the only available archaeological material, fragments of heavy woollen sailcloth dated to the mid-13th century found at Trondenes church in Norway.\nAccording to the mariner and archaeologist Se\u00e1n McGrail, masts have only rarely been found in excavations, and these are the lower parts of them. Little evidence of the standing rigging needed to support a ship's mast has survived to modern times, other than that found in iconography, and the slight evidence that does exist comes mostly from the Norse tradition. Depictions on sources such as the Bayeux tapestry indicate that the masts of ninth- to 12th-century vessels were braced by a forestay to the bowstem or a forward beam and shrouds to the top strakes or to an accessible crossbeam. The halyard may have served also as a backstay to support the mast from an after thwart or beam.\nWillow \"withies\", or \"osiers\", were also required for attaching rigging to the hull and securing the rudder to its frame. MacGrail says the consensus among modern scholars is that cordage in Early Medieval times was made from the bast of linden trees or possibly from hemp. In situations where extra strength was needed, ropes were made from seal, whale, or walrus walrus hides cut spirally. McGrail says the whale skin and seal skin ropes described by Ohthere to King Alfred were 60 \"ells\", or 15 fathoms long. J\u00f8rgensen says ropes made of walrus hides were renowned for their strength. Pine tar was used to preserve organic materials such as the wood of boats, ropes, sails and fishnets.\nRudder.\nViking ships were steered by a long rudder (\"st\u00fdri\") fastened to a cylindrical piece of oak wood that according to the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde was called a \"rorvort\". It was mounted on the outside of the hull on the starboard (steer-board, from Old Norse \"styrbord\") quarter of the vessel. The rudder on the Gokstad ship was long. Nicolaysen, the excavator of the Gokstad ship, gives the Old Icelandic terms for the rudder and its different parts mentioned in the Icelandic sagas. He says the rudder (st\u00fdri) on Scandinavian vessels had since ancient times a fixed position forward of the sternpost, on the right side of the vessel, thus the name \"starboard\" (\"stj\u00f3rnbor\u00f0i\"), while the opposite side to the left of the helmsman, was called the \"bakbor\u00f0i\". The helmsman had behind him an upright wooden bulkhead (\"h\u01ebf\u00f0a-fj\u01ebl\") made from a forked piece of oak standing across the beam. \nThe helm consisted of a plank in the shape of a broad oar, the lower portion of which (\"stj\u00f3rnarbla\u00f0\") as may be seen in the Tune ship's's rudder. This had a round hole in the middle to allow it to be fastened to the side of the vessel by a loop of rope called the \"st\u00fdrihamla\". The tiller (\"st\u00fdrisdrengr\") \"st\u00fdrisst\u00f6ng\" (rudder-post), \"hjalmunv\u01eblr\" (lit. helm-pin) was stuck in a square hole in the upper part of the neck. The rudder was mounted with iron, to which one or more cramps were added down near the heel of the rudder. When the rudder was set in position up and down, a bit aslant so that its blade was almost parallel with the gunwale, it was said to \"leggja styri i lag\" (steady the helm), while the opposite action was termed to \"leggja styri or lag\", which meant to raise the helm. This was done in shallow water when the rudder might strike the bottom, with the helmsman laying off the helm and the crew steering with the oars.\nThe Norwegian newspaperman and seafarer, Captain Magnus Andersen, considered the rudder of a Viking ship \"greatly preferable to a stern rudder\", based on his experience sailing a replica of the Gokstad ship across the Atlantic in 1893.\nAnchors.\nThe anchor and its cable were essential parts of a ship's equipment. As described by Crumlin-Pedersen, anchors could be made of wood weighted with stone (\"stj\u00f3ri\") or of iron with a wooden stock (\"akkeri\"). The anchor from the ship-grave at Ladby on the island of Funen in Denmark was found well preserved in the bow of the ship. It is long and wide and attached to a chain which is estimated to originally have been ca. long. It was shaped like a modern-day anchor but had smaller flukes. The anchor weighed only , but the length of iron linked chain attached between it and the anchor line provided a spring that helped damp out the snatch of the rope in a swell, and prevented its being abraded on the stones of the seafloor.\nThe archaeologist and historian Haakon Shetelig describes how the Gokstad grave-ship's anchor, which had been placed on the deck-boards forward of the mast for the burial, was so rusted when excavated that it disintegrated immediately, but the oaken anchor stock was intact. It measured long, from which he deduces that the anchor itself was long, assuming that the proportions would have been the same as in the Oseberg ship.\nShip builders' tools.\nThe M\u00e4stermyr chest, a jointed Viking Age tool chest made of oak and found in Gotland in Sweden, contained blacksmithing and woodworking tools. Recent research suggests that it was lost during transportation in what was possibly a lakeshore environment at the time. A farmer found the chest in 1936 while plowing a field. Many tools from the M\u00e4stermyr find are part of an exhibit at the Swedish History Museum. The wood-working tools have previously been interpreted as boat-building and fine carpentry tools, based on the fact that similar tools are used in traditional carpentry nowadays. The tools include augers, scrapers, draw knives, axes, adzes,\nwedges, sledge hammers, and planes, along with a rivet iron for forging ship's rivets. The M\u00e4stermyr chest may date to 950-1000. Given that most finds of Norse tool chests have occurred on the shores of lakes, Julie Lund believes that the chests were likely to have been deliberately placed in such locations for a ritual purpose, similarly to the locating of smithies in Old Norse folklore. Christer Westerdahl, a field archaeologist and ethnologist, calls the unknown owner of the chest an \"itinerant boatbuilder and smith\" who may have lost or sacrificed his complete toolkit.\nWriting on the process of the working of wood in the period when Viking ships were built, Forte describes the contents of a 13th-century Norwegian treatise, \"Konungs skuggsj\u00e1\", which lists the tools used by shipwrights of the time. These include broadaxes, augers, and gouges, but no saws. He notes that the Bayeaux Tapestry contains a scene that shows the construction of a ship from the felling of trees for its timber to its fitting out. The scene depicts men using axes to fell trees, cut branches, and cleave planking for the hull. An axe with a longer blade and a shorter handle is shown being used to shape the planking. Adzes, a router plane, and a bore are also shown, but again no saw is in evidence. Some of the planks of the Skuldelev vessels had distinct axe cuts, and possibly adze cuts as well. The smooth cutting marks and occasional gouges left by planes are visible in the wood worked during the ships' construction. The marks left by routers, drawknives, and scrapers are apparent. Drilled holes are also to be seen.\nSe\u00e1n McGrail writes that woodworking tools excavated in a number of Viking Age burials demonstrate that Viking shipwrights used a wide variety of handtools. He says inspection of these tools, of toolmarks found on the wooden remains of Viking boats, and of boatbuilding scenes portrayed by artists of the early Middle Ages, such as on the Bayeux Tapestry, indicate that the premier Viking Age shipbuilder's tool was the axe. The craftsmen who used the tools were so skilled that they commonly performed the final dressing of oak planks with axes. The planks of the ships in the Skuldelev finds were finished with a drawknife, and adzes apparently were used to shape some curved surfaces. Hammers and mallets, knives, gouges, wedges, and chisels were often employed, while holes were bored with a bit inserted in a T-shaped handle.\nLegacy.\nThe archaeologist Dagfinn Skre writes that Viking warriors, who used their ships to reach Northern European coasts where they raided settlements and monasteries, had inherited a long tradition of expertise in naval warfare that evolved over three thousand years. Their light and swift ships were eminently suited to storming these locations and making off before counter attacks could be mounted. These ships were the basis of warrior identity and their battle tactics, while the sea provided a theatre of operations where they attained power and prestige. Thus they developed matchless seamanship, naval warfare, and shipbuilding skills. According to the historian R\u00e9gis Boyer, an argument can be made that the Vikings provoked the West into an awareness of itself as a global entity, forcing it to set up a common defence and to reorganize itself politically with stronger centralized powers. He says, \"[T]hey possessed a ferment of activity and dynamism that lay dormant in the south. They came at just the right moment to breathe new life into the (Indo-)European personality.\"\nHistorians, archaeologists and adventurers have reconstructed longships in an attempt to understand how they worked. The longship was light, fast, and nimble. The true Viking warships, or \"langskips\", were long and narrow, frequently with a length to beam (width) ratio of 7:1; they were very fast under sail or propelled by warriors who served as oarsmen. The overall length to beam (width) ratio of the excavated Viking longships Skuldelev 5 and the Ladby ship was 7:1, and that of Skuldelev 2 was 8.3:1.\nIn Scandinavia, the longship was the usual vessel for war until the 12th\u201313th centuries. \"Lei\u00f0angr\" fleet-levy laws remained in place for most of the Middle Ages in Norway, where the active participation of the \"lei\u00f0angr\" was still strategically necessary \u2014their military obligations had not been fully replaced by systems of taxation as they had been in Sweden and Denmark. These laws required that when summoned by the Crown, the freemen peasantry should build, man, and furnish ships for war\u2014ships with at least 20 or 25 pairs of oars (40 or 50 rowers). By the late 14th century, these low-boarded vessels were at a disadvantage against newer, taller warships. When the Victual Brothers, in the employ of the Hansa, attacked Bergen in late 1393, the \"great ships\" of the pirates could not be boarded by the Norwegian levy ships called out by Margaret I of Denmark, and the raiders were able to sack the town with impunity. While earlier times had seen larger and taller longships in service, by this time the authorities had also gone over to other types of ships for warfare. The last known mobilization of the \"lei\u00f0angr\" occurred in 1429, when the Victual Brothers defeated the naval levies of the Norwegian western counties (\"fylker\") outside Bergen.\nNotable longships.\nPreserved originals.\nSeveral of the original longships built in the Viking Age have been excavated by archaeologists. The following is a list of vessels that have been important to knowledge of longship design and construction:\nHistorical examples.\nImportant longships known only from written sources include:\nReplicas.\nCrumlin-Pedersen says that experimental ship archaeology can provide a methodology to gain insight studying the remains of ancient ships in context of the past\u2014their construction, use, and maintenance being reflections of its maritime aspects. Sometimes, however, a research-driven approach to such projects is subordinated to other, opposing goals. A number of full-scale replicas of several ships of the past have been built in various places, their builders claiming to make important contributions to a modern understanding of the practice of navigation in the past. He says that sometimes \"the use of the terms 'experimental' and 'replica' is just a cover-up for raising money for a project whose aims have little relevance to scholarly study.\"\nEven in those instances where archaeological, iconographic or textual evidence is available for the replica builder to consult, there are frequently large gaps in the original sources on the nature of the equipment and rigging of ancient ships, and even of important hull components. A lack of research, poor construction techniques, and inept seamanship on the part of the crew because of inadequate experience, may lead to false conclusions about the characteristics and seaworthiness of the ancient vessels. The naval historian Alan Binns says even modern-day replica Viking ships that are accurate reproductions of the originals must be treated cautiously as historical evidence for a ship's capabilities, as they are usually sailed by professional sailors with modern backup, and are not representative of the actual ships that sailed in the Viking Age.\nAccording to Anton Englert, an archaeologist and curator of the Viking Ship Museum, most of the trial voyages of reconstructed ancient ships have been performed by amateurs who wanted to prove a certain hypothesis by re-enacting a voyage. He says it is arguable whether or not such hypotheses have contributed to experimental archaeology. Only a few projects were built on substantial archaeological evidence, as with the construction of \"Viking\" and \"Saga Siglar\". Forte writes: \"The fact that a reconstruction of the Gokstad ship successfully crossed the Atlantic should not be interpreted as indicating that this was the type of vessel that travelled the North Atlantic runs to Iceland and Greenland a thousand years ago.\" Binns says Magnus Andersen's replica of the Gokstad ship, with its deeper keel, buoyancy fender, continuous deck, and anachronistic rig (including staysails), cannot reasonably be considered evidence for the sailing characteristics of the original.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was regarded as a prolific and versatile poet. He was credited with introducing the epigram into Italian poetry.\nBiography.\nAlamanni was born in Florence. His father was a devoted adherent of the Medici party, but Luigi, smarting under a supposed injustice, joined an unsuccessful conspiracy against Giulio de' Medici, soon to be elected Pope Clement VII. Consequently, he was forced to take refuge in Venice, and, on the accession of Medici to pope, to flee to France. When Florence had exiled the Medici in 1527, Alamanni returned, and took a prominent part in the management of the affairs of the short-lived republic. \nThe Florentines had thrown off Medici rule and established a republic after the Sack of Rome in 1527; the Florentine Republic had continued to participate in the war on the side of the French. The French defeats at Naples in 1528 and Landriano in 1529, however, led to Francis I of France concluding the Treaty of Cambrai with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. When Pope Clement VII and the Republic of Venice also concluded treaties with the Emperor, Florence was left to fight alone. Charles, attempting to gain Clement's favor, ordered his armies to seize Florence and return the Medici to power.\nAfter the siege of Florence in 1530 by Imperial forces, succeeded in restoring the Medici to the duchy, Alamanni again fled, this time to France, where he composed the greater part of his works. He was a favourite with the French King Francis I, who sent him as ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V after the Peace of Cr\u00e9py in 1544.\nAn instance of Alammani's diplomatic tact is reflected in an encounter with the emperor. Alamanni, while giving a complimentary address to Charles, was interrupted by the emperor who quoted a line from a satirical poem of Alamanni: \"l'aquila grifagna, Che per piu devorar, duoi rostri porta\" (\"Two crooked bills the ravenous eagle bears, The better to devour\"). The double eagle was a symbol of the Hapsburg monarchy. Upon this interruption, Alamanni immediately replied that he spoke that line only as a poet using fictions, now as an ambassador, he could only speak the truth. The ready reply pleased Charles, who added some complimentary words.\nAfter the death of Francis, Alamanni enjoyed the confidence of his successor Henry II, and in 1551 was sent as his ambassador to Genoa. He died at Amboise on 18 April 1556.\nHe wrote a large number of poems, distinguished by the purity and excellence of their style. The best is a didactic poem, \"La Coltivazione\" (Paris, 1546; see 1546 in poetry), written in imitation of Virgil's \"Georgics\". His \"Opere Toscane\" (Lyon, 1532) consists of satirical pieces written in blank verse. His use of Horatian epistolary satire is important and his tenth satire was used as a model by Sir Thomas Wyatt in his poem 'Mine own John Poyntz' which introduced the form into English literature. An unfinished poem, \"Avarchide\", in imitation of the Iliad, was the work of his old age and has little merit.\nIt has been said by some that Alamanni was the first to use blank verse in Italian poetry, but that distinction belongs rather to his contemporary Giangiorgio Trissino.\nThe contemporary poet Isabella di Morra dedicated a sonnet to Alamanni called \"Non sol il ciel vi fu largo e cortese\" (\"Not only was heaven generous and courteous to you\").\nAlamanni is a minor speaker in Machiavelli's \"The Art of War\", a book structured as a dialogue between real people known to Machiavelli, and set in the gardens of Cosimo Rucellai. In this book, Alamanni is present as a loyal friend of the host, and is mentioned to be the youngest of Rucellai's friends present.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as the Archbishop of Arles from 1423 until his resignation in 1440 when he had resigned from the cardinalate. But he was later reinstated as a cardinal on 19 December 1449 at which point he served as the Protopriest and also reclaimed his titular church.\nAleman served as the Bishop of Maguelonne from 1418 until his archepiscopal elevation at which point he was later named a cardinal. Aleman once led opposition to Pope Eugene IV while pledging allegiance to an antipope which led to Eugene IV stripping Aleman of all ecclesiastical dignities that he had been entitled to. But he later convinced the antipope to abdicate as a means of ending the Western Schism at which stage Aleman was restored to the cardinalate and returned to full communion with the Roman see under Pope Nicholas V. He has often been dubbed as the \"Cardinal of Arles\".\nHis beatification received approval on 9 April 1527 from Pope Clement VII.\nLife.\nLouis Aleman was born to nobles circa 1390 at the castle in Arbent to Jean Aleman and Marie de Ch\u00e2tillon de Michaille. His archbishop grand-uncle was Fran\u00e7ois de Conzie (c.1356-31.12.1431/2).\nHe was present at the Council of Pisa in 1409. He studied canon law and graduated in that area with a doctorate in 1414 at the college in Avignon. In 1417 he was made the abbot commendatario of Saint-Pierre de la Tour.\nAleman served as the governor of the Romagna since 1424 and had to face the ongoing struggles between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines in Bologna. One of the Guelph families - the Canetols - even imprisoned Aleman for several weeks but Aleman was later released and moved to Rome to serve in the court of Pope Martin V. Aleman served as a noted advisor to the pope and also served as a courtier while in the papal court. He had served in the papal court for Martin V since July 1417.\nOn 22 June 1418 he was appointed as the Bishop of Maguelonne and he was installed into his new see on 17 May 1419. The pope himself granted episcopal consecration to Aleman in Mantua. He later became a diplomat to Siena in 1422. Aleman was later promoted as the newest Archbishop of Arles on 3 December 1423 and was installed in that see on 16 May 1424. Martin V named him a cardinal on 24 May 1426 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Cecilia - he received that title on 27 May. From 1427 until 1431 he served as the Camerlengo for the College of Cardinals. He served as a legate to Bologna from 1426 to 1428 and did not participate in the conclave of 1431.\nHe was a prominent member of the Council of Basel since 1432 and together with Cardinal Julian Cesarini led the forces that maintained the power of the general councils over the pope's own control of the Church. It was while the council was proceeding that he tended to victims of the plague. He later led opposition to the pope but Cesarini was reconciled with Pope Eugene IV and had a prominent part in the pope's convoked Council of Florence. In 1439 he led the effort to depose Eugene IV and the election of a successor. In 1440 he placed the tiara upon Antipope Felix V and consecrated him as a bishop. This was a misguided attempt at reforming the Church which Aleman believed was vital. Eugene IV was responded to this and excommunicated the antipope while also depriving Aleman of all his ecclesiastical dignities. This also meant that Aleman could no longer be considered a cardinal and he was deprived of the dignities that came with the cardinalate. This occurred on 11 April 1440: he was stripped of Arles as his archdiocese and was stripped of his titular church.\nAntipope Felix V made him the legate to the Diet of Frankfurt to the court of Emperor Friedrich III. He was further involved in the unsuccessful efforts to win over Europe's princes to Basel's antipope. In order to make an end of the schism the former cardinal advised Felix V to abdicate at which stage Pope Nicholas V restored the cardinal to all his honors and appointed him as a papal legate to the German kingdom] in 1449; his full restoration was on 19 December 1449. He was granted back his titular church as well and from that moment until his death served as the Protopriest of the College of Cardinals. It was due to his estrangement to the Roman see that he was not permitted to participate in the conclave of 1447. He returned to his former archdiocese where he dedicated himself with great zeal to the catechetical formation of the people.\nHe died on 16 September 1450 at the Franciscan convent in Salon at Arles. Aleman's remains are housed in Saint-Trophine d'Arles.\nBeatification.\nHis beatification was approved and celebrated on 9 April 1527 after Pope Clement VII confirmed that there had been a longstanding and popular cultus (otherwise known as an enduring public veneration) of the late cardinal.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution:"}

There are several variants of LR parsers: SLR parsers, LALR parsers, canonical LR(1) parsers, minimal LR(1) parsers, and generalized LR parsers (GLR parsers). LR parsers can be generated by a parser generator from a formal grammar defining the syntax of the language to be parsed. They are widely used for the processing of computer languages.\nAn LR parser (left-to-right, rightmost derivation in reverse) reads input text from left to right without backing up (this is true for most parsers), and produces a rightmost derivation in reverse: it does a bottom-up parse \u2013 not a top-down LL parse or ad-hoc parse. The name \"LR\" is often followed by a numeric qualifier, as in \"LR(1)\" or sometimes \"LR(\"k\")\". To avoid backtracking or guessing, the LR parser is allowed to peek ahead at \"k\" lookahead input symbols before deciding how to parse earlier symbols. Typically \"k\" is 1 and is not mentioned. The name \"LR\" is often preceded by other qualifiers, as in \"SLR\" and \"LALR\". The \"LR(\"k\")\" notation for a grammar was suggested by Knuth to stand for \"translatable from left to right with bound \"k\".\"\nLR parsers are deterministic; they produce a single correct parse without guesswork or backtracking, in linear time. This is ideal for computer languages, but LR parsers are not suited for human languages which need more flexible but inevitably slower methods. Some methods which can parse arbitrary context-free languages (e.g., Cocke\u2013Younger\u2013Kasami, Earley, GLR) have worst-case performance of O(n3) time. Other methods which backtrack or yield multiple parses may even take exponential time when they guess badly.\nThe above properties of L, R, and k are actually shared by all shift-reduce parsers, including precedence parsers. But by convention, the LR name stands for the form of parsing invented by Donald Knuth, and excludes the earlier, less powerful precedence methods (for example Operator-precedence parser).\nLR parsers can handle a larger range of languages and grammars than precedence parsers or top-down LL parsing. This is because the LR parser waits until it has seen an entire instance of some grammar pattern before committing to what it has found. An LL parser has to decide or guess what it is seeing much sooner, when it has only seen the leftmost input symbol of that pattern.\nOverview.\nBottom-up parse tree for example A * 2 + 1.\nAn LR parser scans and parses the input text in one forward pass over the text. The parser builds up the parse tree incrementally, bottom up, and left to right, without guessing or backtracking. At every point in this pass, the parser has accumulated a list of subtrees or phrases of the input text that have been already parsed. Those subtrees are not yet joined together because the parser has not yet reached the right end of the syntax pattern that will combine them.\nAt step 6 in an example parse, only \"A * 2\" has been parsed, incompletely. Only the shaded lower-left corner of the parse tree exists. None of the parse tree nodes numbered 7 and above exist yet. Nodes 3, 4, and 6 are the roots of isolated subtrees for variable A, operator *, and number 2, respectively. These three root nodes are temporarily held in a parse stack. The remaining unparsed portion of the input stream is \"+ 1\".\nShift and reduce actions.\nAs with other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser works by doing some combination of Shift steps and Reduce steps. \nIf the input has no syntax errors, the parser continues with these steps until all of the input has been consumed and all of the parse trees have been reduced to a single tree representing an entire legal input.\nLR parsers differ from other shift-reduce parsers in how they decide when to reduce, and how to pick between rules with similar endings. But the final decisions and the sequence of shift or reduce steps are the same.\nMuch of the LR parser's efficiency is from being deterministic. To avoid guessing, the LR parser often looks ahead (rightwards) at the next scanned symbol, before deciding what to do with previously scanned symbols. The lexical scanner works one or more symbols ahead of the parser. The lookahead symbols are the 'right-hand context' for the parsing decision.\nBottom-up parse stack.\nLike other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser lazily waits until it has scanned and parsed all parts of some construct before committing to what the combined construct is. The parser then acts immediately on the combination instead of waiting any further. In the parse tree example, the phrase A gets reduced to Value and then to Products in steps 1-3 as soon as lookahead * is seen, rather than waiting any later to organize those parts of the parse tree. The decisions for how to handle A are based only on what the parser and scanner have already seen, without considering things that appear much later to the right.\nReductions reorganize the most recently parsed things, immediately to the left of the lookahead symbol. So the list of already-parsed things acts like a stack. This parse stack grows rightwards. The base or bottom of the stack is on the left and holds the leftmost, oldest parse fragment. Every reduction step acts only on the rightmost, newest parse fragments. (This accumulative parse stack is very unlike the predictive, leftward-growing parse stack used by top-down parsers.)\nBottom-up parse steps for example A * 2 + 1.\nStep 6 applies a grammar rule with multiple parts:\n Products \u2192 Products * Value\nThis matches the stack top holding the parsed phrases \"... Products * Value\". The reduce step replaces this instance of the rule's right hand side, \"Products * Value\" by the rule's left hand side symbol, here a larger Products. If the parser builds complete parse trees, the three trees for inner Products, *, and Value are combined by a new tree root for Products. Otherwise, semantic details from the inner Products and Value are output to some later compiler pass, or are combined and saved in the new Products symbol.\nLR parse steps for example A * 2 + 1.\nIn LR parsers, the shift and reduce decisions are potentially based on the entire stack of everything that has been previously parsed, not just on a single, topmost stack symbol. If done in an unclever way, that could lead to very slow parsers that get slower and slower for longer inputs. LR parsers do this with constant speed, by summarizing all the relevant left context information into a single number called the LR(0) parser state. For each grammar and LR analysis method, there is a fixed (finite) number of such states. Besides holding the already-parsed symbols, the parse stack also remembers the state numbers reached by everything up to those points.\nAt every parse step, the entire input text is divided into a stack of previously parsed phrases, a current look-ahead symbol, and the remaining unscanned text. The parser's next action is determined by its current LR(0) state number (rightmost on the stack) and the lookahead symbol. In the steps below, all the black details are exactly the same as in other non-LR shift-reduce parsers. LR parser stacks add the state information in purple, summarizing the black phrases to their left on the stack and what syntax possibilities to expect next. Users of an LR parser can usually ignore state information. These states are explained in a later section.\nAt initial step 0, the input stream \"A * 2 + 1\" is divided into\nThe parse stack begins by holding only initial state 0. When state 0 sees the lookahead \"id\", it knows to shift that \"id\" onto the stack, and scan the next input symbol *, and advance to state 9.\nAt step 4, the total input stream \"A * 2 + 1\" is currently divided into \nThe states corresponding to the stacked phrases are 0, 4, and 5. The current, rightmost state on the stack is state 5. When state 5 sees the lookahead \"int\", it knows to shift that \"int\" onto the stack as its own phrase, and scan the next input symbol +, and advance to state 8.\nAt step 12, all of the input stream has been consumed but only partially organized. The current state is 3. When state 3 sees the lookahead \"eof\", it knows to apply the completed grammar rule\n Sums \u2192 Sums + Products\nby combining the stack's rightmost three phrases for Sums, +, and Products into one thing. State 3 itself doesn't know what the next state should be. This is found by going back to state 0, just to the left of the phrase being reduced. When state 0 sees this new completed instance of a Sums, it advances to state 1 (again). This consulting of older states is why they are kept on the stack, instead of keeping only the current state.\nGrammar for the example A * 2 + 1.\nLR parsers are constructed from a grammar that formally defines the syntax of the input language as a set of patterns. The grammar doesn't cover all language rules, such as the size of numbers, or the consistent use of names and their definitions in the context of the whole program. LR parsers use a context-free grammar that deals just with local patterns of symbols.\nThe example grammar used here is a tiny subset of the Java or C language:\nr0: Goal \u2192 Sums \"eof\"\nr1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products\nr2: Sums \u2192 Products\nr3: Products \u2192 Products * Value\nr4: Products \u2192 Value\nr5: Value \u2192 \"int\"\nr6: Value \u2192 \"id\"\nThe grammar's terminal symbols are the multi-character symbols or 'tokens' found in the input stream by a lexical scanner. Here these include + * and \"int\" for any integer constant, and \"id\" for any identifier name, and \"eof\" for end of input file. The grammar doesn't care what the \"int\" values or \"id\" spellings are, nor does it care about blanks or line breaks. The grammar uses these terminal symbols but does not define them. They are always leaf nodes (at the bottom bushy end) of the parse tree.\nThe capitalized terms like Sums are nonterminal symbols. These are names for concepts or patterns in the language. They are defined in the grammar and never occur themselves in the input stream. They are always internal nodes (above the bottom) of the parse tree. They only happen as a result of the parser applying some grammar rule. Some nonterminals are defined with two or more rules; these are alternative patterns. Rules can refer back to themselves, which are called \"recursive\". This grammar uses recursive rules to handle repeated math operators. Grammars for complete languages use recursive rules to handle lists, parenthesized expressions, and nested statements.\nAny given computer language can be described by several different grammars. An LR(1) parser can handle many but not all common grammars. It is usually possible to manually modify a grammar so that it fits the limitations of LR(1) parsing and the generator tool.\nThe grammar for an LR parser must be unambiguous itself, or must be augmented by tie-breaking precedence rules. This means there is only one correct way to apply the grammar to a given legal example of the language, resulting in a unique parse tree with just one meaning, and a unique sequence of shift/reduce actions for that example. LR parsing is not a useful technique for human languages with ambiguous grammars that depend on the interplay of words. Human languages are better handled by parsers like Generalized LR parser, the Earley parser, or the CYK algorithm that can simultaneously compute all possible parse trees in one pass.\nParse table for the example grammar.\nMost LR parsers are table driven. The parser's program code is a simple generic loop that is the same for all grammars and languages. The knowledge of the grammar and its syntactic implications are encoded into unchanging data tables called parse tables (or parsing tables). Entries in a table show whether to shift or reduce (and by which grammar rule), for every legal combination of parser state and lookahead symbol. The parse tables also tell how to compute the next state, given just a current state and a next symbol.\nThe parse tables are much larger than the grammar. LR tables are hard to accurately compute by hand for big grammars. So they are mechanically derived from the grammar by some parser generator tool like Bison.\nDepending on how the states and parsing table are generated, the resulting parser is called either a SLR (simple LR) parser, LALR (look-ahead LR) parser, or canonical LR parser. LALR parsers handle more grammars than SLR parsers. Canonical LR parsers handle even more grammars, but use many more states and much larger tables. The example grammar is SLR.\nLR parse tables are two-dimensional. Each current LR(0) parser state has its own row. Each possible next symbol has its own column. Some combinations of state and next symbol are not possible for valid input streams. These blank cells trigger syntax error messages.\nThe Action left half of the table has columns for lookahead terminal symbols. These cells determine whether the next parser action is shift (to state \"n\"), or reduce (by grammar rule r\"n\").\nThe Goto right half of the table has columns for nonterminal symbols. These cells show which state to advance to, after some reduction's Left Hand Side has created an expected new instance of that symbol. This is like a shift action but for nonterminals; the lookahead terminal symbol is unchanged.\nThe table column \"Current Rules\" documents the meaning and syntax possibilities for each state, as worked out by the parser generator. It is not included in the actual tables used at parsing time. The \u2022 (pink dot) marker shows where the parser is now, within some partially recognized grammar rules. The things to the left of \u2022 have been parsed, and the things to the right are expected soon. A state has several such current rules if the parser has not yet narrowed possibilities down to a single rule.\nIn state 2 above, the parser has just found and shifted-in the + of grammar rule\nr1: Sums \u2192 Sums + \u2022 Products\nThe next expected phrase is Products. Products begins with terminal symbols \"int\" or \"id\". If the lookahead is either of those, the parser shifts them in and advances to state 8 or 9, respectively. When a Products has been found, the parser advances to state 3 to accumulate the complete list of summands and find the end of rule r0. A Products can also begin with nonterminal Value. For any other lookahead or nonterminal, the parser announces a syntax error.\nIn state 3, the parser has just found a Products phrase, that could be from two possible grammar rules:\nr1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products \u2022\nr3: Products \u2192 Products \u2022 * Value\nThe choice between r1 and r3 can't be decided just from looking backwards at prior phrases. The parser has to check the lookahead symbol to tell what to do. If the lookahead is *, it is in rule 3, so the parser shifts in the * and advances to state 5. If the lookahead is \"eof\", it is at the end of rule 1 and rule 0, so the parser is done.\nIn state 9 above, all the non-blank, non-error cells are for the same reduction r6. Some parsers save time and table space by not checking the lookahead symbol in these simple cases. Syntax errors are then detected somewhat later, after some harmless reductions, but still before the next shift action or parser decision.\nIndividual table cells must not hold multiple, alternative actions, otherwise the parser would be nondeterministic with guesswork and backtracking. If the grammar is not LR(1), some cells will have shift/reduce conflicts between a possible shift action and reduce action, or reduce/reduce conflicts between multiple grammar rules. LR(\"k\") parsers resolve these conflicts (where possible) by checking additional lookahead symbols beyond the first.\nLR parser loop.\nThe LR parser begins with a nearly empty parse stack containing just the start state 0, and with the lookahead holding the input stream's first scanned symbol. The parser then repeats the following loop step until done, or stuck on a syntax error:\nThe topmost state on the parse stack is some state \"s\", and the current lookahead is some terminal symbol \"t\". Look up the next parser action from row \"s\" and column \"t\" of the Lookahead Action table. That action is either Shift, Reduce, Accept, or Error:\nShift the matched terminal \"t\" onto the parse stack and scan the next input symbol into the lookahead buffer.\nPush next state \"n\" onto the parse stack as the new current state.\nRemove the matched topmost L symbols (and parse trees and associated state numbers) from the parse stack.\nThis exposes a prior state \"p\" that was expecting an instance of the Lhs symbol.\nJoin the L parse trees together as one parse tree with new root symbol Lhs.\nLookup the next state \"n\" from row \"p\" and column \"Lhs\" of the LHS Goto table.\nPush the symbol and tree for Lhs onto the parse stack.\nPush next state \"n\" onto the parse stack as the new current state.\nThe lookahead and input stream remain unchanged.\nLR parser stack usually stores just the LR(0) automaton states, as the grammar symbols may be derived from them (in the automaton, all input transitions to some state are marked with the same symbol, which is the symbol associated with this state). Moreover, these symbols are almost never needed as the state is all that matters when making the parsing decision.\nLR generator analysis.\nThis section of the article can be skipped by most users of LR parser generators.\nLR states.\nState 2 in the example parse table is for the partially parsed rule \n r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + \u2022 Products\nThis shows how the parser got here, by seeing Sums then + while looking for a larger Sums. The \u2022 marker has advanced beyond the beginning of the rule. It also shows how the parser expects to eventually complete the rule, by next finding a complete Products. But more details are needed on how to parse all the parts of that Products.\nThe partially parsed rules for a state are called its \"core LR(0) items\". The parser generator adds additional rules or items for all the possible next steps in building up the expected Products:\n r3: Products \u2192 \u2022 Products * Value\n r4: Products \u2192 \u2022 Value\n r5: Value \u2192 \u2022 \"int\"\n r6: Value \u2192 \u2022 \"id\"\nThe \u2022 marker is at the beginning of each of these added rules; the parser has not yet confirmed and parsed any part of them. These additional items are called the \"closure\" of the core items. For each nonterminal symbol immediately following a \u2022, the generator adds the rules defining that symbol. This adds more \u2022 markers, and possibly different follower symbols. This closure process continues until all follower symbols have been expanded. The follower nonterminals for state 2 begins with Products. Value is then added by closure. The follower terminals are \"int\" and \"id\".\nThe kernel and closure items together show all possible legal ways to proceed from the current state to future states and complete phrases. If a follower symbol appears in only one item, it leads to a next state containing only one core item with the \u2022 marker advanced. So \"int\" leads to next state 8 with core\n r5: Value \u2192 \"int\" \u2022\nIf the same follower symbol appears in several items, the parser cannot yet tell which rule applies here. So that symbol leads to a next state that shows all remaining possibilities, again with the \u2022 marker advanced. Products appears in both r1 and r3. So Products leads to next state 3 with core\n r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products \u2022\n r3: Products \u2192 Products \u2022 * Value\nIn words, that means if the parser has seen a single Products, it might be done, or it might still have even more things to multiply together. All the core items have the same symbol preceding the \u2022 marker; all transitions into this state are always with that same symbol.\nSome transitions will be to cores and states that have been enumerated already. Other transitions lead to new states. The generator starts with the grammar's goal rule. From there it keeps exploring known states and transitions until all needed states have been found.\nThese states are called \"LR(0)\" states because they use a lookahead of \"k\"=0, i.e. no lookahead. The only checking of input symbols occurs when the symbol is shifted in. Checking of lookaheads for reductions is done separately by the parse table, not by the enumerated states themselves.\nFinite state machine.\nThe parse table describes all possible LR(0) states and their transitions. They form a finite-state machine (FSM). An FSM is a simple engine for parsing simple unnested languages, without using a stack. In this LR application, the FSM's modified \"input language\" has both terminal and nonterminal symbols, and covers any partially parsed stack snapshot of the full LR parse.\nRecall step 5 of the Parse Steps Example:\nThe parse stack shows a series of state transitions, from the start state 0, to state 4 and then on to 5 and current state 8. The symbols on the parse stack are the shift or goto symbols for those transitions. Another way to view this, is that the finite state machine can scan the stream \"Products\u00a0*\u00a0\"int\"\u00a0+\u00a01\" (without using yet another stack) and find the leftmost complete phrase that should be reduced next. And that is indeed its job!\nHow can a mere FSM do this when the original unparsed language has nesting and recursion and definitely requires an analyzer with a stack? The trick is that everything to the left of the stack top has already been fully reduced. This eliminates all the loops and nesting from those phrases. The FSM can ignore all the older beginnings of phrases, and track just the newest phrases that might be completed next. The obscure name for this in LR theory is \"viable prefix\".\nLookahead sets.\nThe states and transitions give all the needed information for the parse table's shift actions and goto actions. The generator also needs to calculate the expected lookahead sets for each reduce action.\nIn SLR parsers, these lookahead sets are determined directly from the grammar, without considering the individual states and transitions. For each nonterminal S, the SLR generator works out Follows(S), the set of all the terminal symbols which can immediately follow some occurrence of S. In the parse table, each reduction to S uses Follow(S) as its LR(1) lookahead set. Such follow sets are also used by generators for LL top-down parsers. A grammar that has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts when using Follow sets is called an SLR grammar.\nLALR parsers have the same states as SLR parsers, but use a more complicated, more precise way of working out the minimum necessary reduction lookaheads for each individual state. Depending on the details of the grammar, this may turn out to be the same as the Follow set computed by SLR parser generators, or it may turn out to be a subset of the SLR lookaheads. Some grammars are okay for LALR parser generators but not for SLR parser generators. This happens when the grammar has spurious shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts using Follow sets, but no conflicts when using the exact sets computed by the LALR generator. The grammar is then called LALR(1) but not SLR.\nAn SLR or LALR parser avoids having duplicate states. But this minimization is not necessary, and can sometimes create unnecessary lookahead conflicts. Canonical LR parsers use duplicated (or \"split\") states to better remember the left and right context of a nonterminal's use. Each occurrence of a symbol S in the grammar can be treated independently with its own lookahead set, to help resolve reduction conflicts. This handles a few more grammars. Unfortunately, this greatly magnifies the size of the parse tables if done for all parts of the grammar. This splitting of states can also be done manually and selectively with any SLR or LALR parser, by making two or more named copies of some nonterminals. A grammar that is conflict-free for a canonical LR generator but has conflicts in an LALR generator is called LR(1) but not LALR(1), and not SLR.\nSLR, LALR, and canonical LR parsers make exactly the same shift and reduce decisions when the input stream is the correct language. When the input has a syntax error, the LALR parser may do some additional (harmless) reductions before detecting the error than would the canonical LR parser. And the SLR parser may do even more. This happens because the SLR and LALR parsers are using a generous superset approximation to the true, minimal lookahead symbols for that particular state.\nSyntax error recovery.\nLR parsers can generate somewhat helpful error messages for the first syntax error in a program, by simply enumerating all the terminal symbols that could have appeared next instead of the unexpected bad lookahead symbol. But this does not help the parser work out how to parse the remainder of the input program to look for further, independent errors. If the parser recovers badly from the first error, it is very likely to mis-parse everything else and produce a cascade of unhelpful spurious error messages.\nIn the yacc and bison parser generators, the parser has an ad hoc mechanism to abandon the current statement, discard some parsed phrases and lookahead tokens surrounding the error, and resynchronize the parse at some reliable statement-level delimiter like semicolons or braces. This often works well for allowing the parser and compiler to look over the rest of the program.\nMany syntactic coding errors are simple typos or omissions of a trivial symbol. Some LR parsers attempt to detect and automatically repair these common cases. The parser enumerates every possible single-symbol insertion, deletion, or substitution at the error point. The compiler does a trial parse with each change to see if it worked okay. (This requires backtracking to snapshots of the parse stack and input stream, normally unneeded by the parser.) Some best repair is picked. This gives a very helpful error message and resynchronizes the parse well. However, the repair is not trustworthy enough to permanently modify the input file. Repair of syntax errors is easiest to do consistently in parsers (like LR) that have parse tables and an explicit data stack.\nVariants of LR parsers.\nThe LR parser generator decides what should happen for each combination of parser state and lookahead symbol. These decisions are usually turned into read-only data tables that drive a generic parser loop that is grammar- and state-independent. But there are also other ways to turn those decisions into an active parser.\nSome LR parser generators create separate tailored program code for each state, rather than a parse table. These parsers can run several times faster than the generic parser loop in table-driven parsers. The fastest parsers use generated assembler code.\nIn the recursive ascent parser variation, the explicit parse stack structure is also replaced by the implicit stack used by subroutine calls. Reductions terminate several levels of subroutine calls, which is clumsy in most languages. So recursive ascent parsers are generally slower, less obvious, and harder to hand-modify than recursive descent parsers.\nAnother variation replaces the parse table by pattern-matching rules in non-procedural languages such as Prolog.\nGLR Generalized LR parsers use LR bottom-up techniques to find all possible parses of input text, not just one correct parse. This is essential for ambiguous grammar such as used for human languages. The multiple valid parse trees are computed simultaneously, without backtracking. GLR is sometimes helpful for computer languages that are not easily described by a conflict-free LALR(1) grammar.\nLC Left corner parsers use LR bottom-up techniques for recognizing the left end of alternative grammar rules. When the alternatives have been narrowed down to a single possible rule, the parser then switches to top-down LL(1) techniques for parsing the rest of that rule. LC parsers have smaller parse tables than LALR parsers and better error diagnostics. There are no widely used generators for deterministic LC parsers. Multiple-parse LC parsers are helpful with human languages with very large grammars.\nTheory.\nLR parsers were invented by Donald Knuth in 1965 as an efficient generalization of precedence parsers. Knuth proved that LR parsers were the most general-purpose parsers possible that would still be efficient in the worst cases. \n \"LR(\"k\") grammars can be efficiently parsed with an execution time essentially proportional to the length of the string.\"\n For every \"k\" \u2265 1, \"a language can be generated by an LR(\"k\") grammar if and only if it is deterministic [and context-free], if and only if it can be generated by an LR(1) grammar.\"\nIn other words, if a language was reasonable enough to allow an efficient one-pass parser, it could be described by an LR(\"k\") grammar. And that grammar could always be mechanically transformed into an equivalent (but larger) LR(1) grammar. So an LR(1) parsing method was, in theory, powerful enough to handle any reasonable language. In practice, the natural grammars for many programming languages are close to being LR(1).\nThe canonical LR parsers described by Knuth had too many states and very big parse tables that were impractically large for the limited memory of computers of that era. LR parsing became practical when Frank DeRemer invented SLR and LALR parsers with much fewer states.\nFor full details on LR theory and how LR parsers are derived from grammars, see \"The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling, Volume 1\" (Aho and Ullman).\nEarley parsers apply the techniques and \u2022 notation of LR parsers to the task of generating all possible parses for ambiguous grammars such as for human languages.\nWhile LR(\"k\") grammars have equal generative power for all \"k\"\u22651, the case of LR(0) grammars is slightly different.\nA language \"L\" is said to have the \"prefix property\" if no word in \"L\" is a proper prefix of another word in \"L\".\nA language \"L\" has an LR(0) grammar if and only if \"L\" is a deterministic context-free language with the prefix property.\nAs a consequence, a language \"L\" is deterministic context-free if and only if \"L\"$ has an LR(0) grammar, where \"$\" is not a symbol of \"L\"'s alphabet.\nAdditional example 1 + 1.\nThis example of LR parsing uses the following small grammar with goal symbol E:\n (1) E \u2192 E * B\n (2) E \u2192 E + B\n (3) E \u2192 B\n (4) B \u2192 0\n (5) B \u2192 1\nto parse the following input:\n 1 + 1\nAction and goto tables.\nThe two LR(0) parsing tables for this grammar look as follows:\nThe action table is indexed by a state of the parser and a terminal (including a special terminal $ that indicates the end of the input stream) and contains three types of actions:\nThe goto table is indexed by a state of the parser and a nonterminal and simply indicates what the next state of the parser will be if it has recognized a certain nonterminal. This table is important to find out the next state after every reduction. After a reduction, the next state is found by looking up the goto table entry for top of the stack (i.e. current state) and the reduced rule's LHS (i.e. non-terminal).\nParsing steps.\nThe table below illustrates each step in the process. Here the state refers to the element at the top of the stack (the right-most element), and the next action is determined by referring to the action table above. A $ is appended to the input string to denote the end of the stream.\nWalkthrough.\nThe parser starts out with the stack containing just the initial state ('0'):\n [0]\nThe first symbol from the input string that the parser sees is '1'. To find the next action (shift, reduce, accept or error), the action table is indexed with the current state (the \"current state\" is just whatever is on the top of the stack), which in this case is 0, and the current input symbol, which is '1'. The action table specifies a shift to state 2, and so state 2 is pushed onto the stack (again, all the state information is in the stack, so \"shifting to state 2\" is the same as pushing 2 onto the stack). The resulting stack is\n [0 '1' 2]\nwhere the top of the stack is 2. For the sake of explaining the symbol (e.g., '1', B) is shown that caused the transition to the next state, although strictly speaking it is not part of the stack.\nIn state 2, the action table says to reduce with grammar rule 5 (regardless of what terminal the parser sees on the input stream), which means that the parser has just recognized the right-hand side of rule 5. In this case, the parser writes 5 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has one symbol), and pushes on the stack the state from the cell in the goto table for state 0 and B, i.e., state 4. The resulting stack is:\n [0 B 4]\nHowever, in state 4, the action table says the parser should now reduce with rule 3. So it writes 3 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack, and finds the new state in the goto table for state 0 and E, which is state 3. The resulting stack:\n [0 E 3]\nThe next terminal that the parser sees is a '+' and according to the action table it should then shift to state 6:\n [0 E 3 '+' 6]\nThe resulting stack can be interpreted as the history of a finite-state machine that has just read a nonterminal E followed by a terminal '+'. The transition table of this automaton is defined by the shift actions in the action table and the goto actions in the goto table.\nThe next terminal is now '1' and this means that the parser performs a shift and go to state 2:\n [0 E 3 '+' 6 '1' 2]\nJust as the previous '1' this one is reduced to B giving the following stack:\n [0 E 3 '+' 6 B 8]\nThe stack corresponds with a list of states of a finite automaton that has read a nonterminal E, followed by a '+' and then a nonterminal B. In state 8 the parser always performs a reduce with rule 2. The top 3 states on the stack correspond with the 3 symbols in the right-hand side of rule 2. This time we pop 3 elements off of the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has 3 symbols) and look up the goto state for E and 0, thus pushing state 3 back onto the stack\n [0 E 3]\nFinally, the parser reads a '$' (end of input symbol) from the input stream, which means that according to the action table (the current state is 3) the parser accepts the input string. The rule numbers that will then have been written to the output stream will be [5, 3, 5, 2] which is indeed a rightmost derivation of the string \"1 + 1\" in reverse.\nConstructing LR(0) parsing tables.\nThis section uses the same example grammar as the previous section:\n (1) E \u2192 E * B\n (2) E \u2192 E + B\n (3) E \u2192 B\n (4) B \u2192 0\n (5) B \u2192 1\nItems.\nThe construction of these parsing tables is based on the notion of \"LR(0) items\" (simply called \"items\" here) which are grammar rules with a special dot added somewhere in the right-hand side. For example, the rule (2) E \u2192 E + B has the following four corresponding items:\n E \u2192 \u2022 E + B\n E \u2192 E \u2022 + B\n E \u2192 E + \u2022 B\n E \u2192 E + B \u2022\nRules of the form \"A\" \u2192 \u03b5 have only a single item \"A\" \u2192 \u2022. The item E \u2192 E \u2022 + B, for example, indicates that the parser has recognized a string corresponding with E on the input stream and now expects to read a '+' followed by another string corresponding with B.\nItem sets.\nIt is usually not possible to characterize the state of the parser with a single item because it may not know in advance which rule it is going to use for reduction. For example, if there is also a rule E \u2192 E * B then the items E \u2192 E \u2022 + B and E \u2192 E \u2022 * B will both apply after a string corresponding with E has been read. Therefore, it is convenient to characterize the state of the parser by a set of items, in this case the set { E \u2192 E \u2022 + B, E \u2192 E \u2022 * B }.\nExtension of Item Set by expansion of non-terminals.\nAn item with a dot before a nonterminal, such as E \u2192 E + \u2022 B, indicates that the parser expects to parse the nonterminal B next. To ensure the item set contains all possible rules the parser may be in the midst of parsing, it must include all items describing how B itself will be parsed. This means that if there are rules such as B \u2192 1 and B \u2192 0 then the item set must also include the items B \u2192 \u2022 1 and B \u2192 \u2022 0. In general this can be formulated as follows:\n If there is an item of the form \"A\" \u2192 \"v\" \u2022 \"Bw\" in an item set and in the grammar there is a rule of the form \"B\" \u2192 \"w' \" then the item \"B\" \u2192 \u2022 \"w' \" should also be in the item set.\nClosure of item sets.\nThus, any set of items can be extended by recursively adding all the appropriate items until all nonterminals preceded by dots are accounted for. The minimal extension is called the \"closure\" of an item set and written as clos(\"I\") where \"I\" is an item set. It is these closed item sets that are taken as the states of the parser, although only the ones that are actually reachable from the begin state will be included in the tables.\nAugmented grammar.\nBefore the transitions between the different states are determined, the grammar is augmented with an extra rule\n (0) S \u2192 E eof\nwhere S is a new start symbol and E the old start symbol. The parser will use this rule for reduction exactly when it has accepted the whole input string.\nFor this example, the same grammar as above is augmented thus:\n (0) S \u2192 E eof\n (1) E \u2192 E * B\n (2) E \u2192 E + B\n (3) E \u2192 B\n (4) B \u2192 0\n (5) B \u2192 1\nIt is for this augmented grammar that the item sets and the transitions between them will be determined.\nTable construction.\nFinding the reachable item sets and the transitions between them.\nThe first step of constructing the tables consists of determining the transitions between the closed item sets. These transitions will be determined as if we are considering a finite automaton that can read terminals as well as nonterminals. The begin state of this automaton is always the closure of the first item of the added rule: S \u2192 \u2022 E eof:\n Item set 0\n S \u2192 \u2022 E eof\n + E \u2192 \u2022 E * B\n + E \u2192 \u2022 E + B\n + E \u2192 \u2022 B\n + B \u2192 \u2022 0\n + B \u2192 \u2022 1\nThe boldfaced \"+\" in front of an item indicates the items that were added for the closure (not to be confused with the mathematical '+' operator which is a terminal). The original items without a \"+\" are called the \"kernel\" of the item set.\nStarting at the begin state (S0), all of the states that can be reached from this state are now determined. The possible transitions for an item set can be found by looking at the symbols (terminals and nonterminals) found following the dots; in the case of item set 0 those symbols are the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminals E and B. To find the item set that each symbol formula_1 leads to, the following procedure is followed for each of the symbols:\nFor the terminal '0' (i.e. where x = '0') this results in:\n Item set 1\n B \u2192 0 \u2022\nand for the terminal '1' (i.e. where x = '1') this results in:\n Item set 2\n B \u2192 1 \u2022\nand for the nonterminal E (i.e. where x = E) this results in:\n Item set 3\n S \u2192 E \u2022 eof\n E \u2192 E \u2022 * B\n E \u2192 E \u2022 + B\nand for the nonterminal B (i.e. where x = B) this results in:\n Item set 4\n E \u2192 B \u2022\nThe closure does not add new items in all cases - in the new sets above, for example, there are no nonterminals following the dot.\nAbove procedure is continued until no more new item sets are found. For the item sets 1, 2, and 4 there will be no transitions since the dot is not in front of any symbol. For item set 3 though, we have dots in front of terminals '*' and '+'. For symbol formula_2 the transition goes to:\n Item set 5\n E \u2192 E * \u2022 B\n + B \u2192 \u2022 0\n + B \u2192 \u2022 1\nand for formula_3 the transition goes to:\n Item set 6\n E \u2192 E + \u2022 B\n + B \u2192 \u2022 0\n + B \u2192 \u2022 1\nNow, the third iteration begins.\nFor item set 5, the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but the resulting closed item sets for the terminals are equal to already found item sets 1 and 2, respectively. For the nonterminal B, the transition goes to:\n Item set 7\n E \u2192 E * B \u2022\nFor item set 6, the terminal '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but as before, the resulting item sets for the terminals are equal to the already found item sets 1 and 2. For the nonterminal B the transition goes to:\n Item set 8\n E \u2192 E + B \u2022\nThese final item sets 7 and 8 have no symbols beyond their dots so no more new item sets are added, so the item generating procedure is complete. The finite automaton, with item sets as its states is shown below.\nThe transition table for the automaton now looks as follows:\nConstructing the action and goto tables.\nFrom this table and the found item sets, the action and goto table are constructed as follows:\nThe reader may verify that these steps produce the action and goto table presented earlier.\nA note about LR(0) versus SLR and LALR parsing.\nOnly step 4 of the above procedure produces reduce actions, and so all reduce actions must occupy an entire table row, causing the reduction to occur regardless of the next symbol in the input stream. This is why these are LR(0) parse tables: they don't do any lookahead (that is, they look ahead zero symbols) before deciding which reduction to perform. A grammar that needs lookahead to disambiguate reductions would require a parse table row containing different reduce actions in different columns, and the above procedure is not capable of creating such rows.\nRefinements to the LR(0) table construction procedure (such as SLR and LALR) are capable of constructing reduce actions that do not occupy entire rows. Therefore, they are capable of parsing more grammars than LR(0) parsers.\nConflicts in the constructed tables.\nThe automaton is constructed in such a way that it is guaranteed to be deterministic. However, when reduce actions are added to the action table it can happen that the same cell is filled with a reduce action and a shift action (a \"shift-reduce conflict\") or with two different reduce actions (a \"reduce-reduce conflict\"). However, it can be shown that when this happens the grammar is not an LR(0) grammar. A classic real-world example of a shift-reduce conflict is the dangling else problem.\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a shift-reduce conflict is:\n (1) E \u2192 1 E\n (2) E \u2192 1\nOne of the item sets found is:\n Item set 1\n E \u2192 1 \u2022 E\n E \u2192 1 \u2022\n + E \u2192 \u2022 1 E\n + E \u2192 \u2022 1\nThere is a shift-reduce conflict in this item set: when constructing the action table according to the rules above, the cell for [item set 1, terminal '1'] contains s1 (shift to state 1) and r2 (reduce with grammar rule 2).\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a reduce-reduce conflict is:\n (1) E \u2192 A 1\n (2) E \u2192 B 2\n (3) A \u2192 1\n (4) B \u2192 1\nIn this case the following item set is obtained:\n Item set 1\n A \u2192 1 \u2022\n B \u2192 1 \u2022\nThere is a reduce-reduce conflict in this item set because in the cells in the action table for this item set there will be both a reduce action for rule 3 and one for rule 4.\nBoth examples above can be solved by letting the parser use the follow set (see LL parser) of a nonterminal \"A\" to decide if it is going to use one of \"A\"s rules for a reduction; it will only use the rule \"A\" \u2192 \"w\" for a reduction if the next symbol on the input stream is in the follow set of \"A\". This solution results in so-called Simple LR parsers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is considered the founder of European cryptography, a claim he shares with Johannes Trithemius.\nHe is often considered primarily an architect. However, according to James Beck, \"to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts\". Although Alberti is known mostly as an artist, he was also a mathematician\nand made significant contributions to that field. Among the most famous buildings he designed are the churches of San Sebastiano (1460) and Sant'Andrea (1472), both in Mantua.\nAlberti's life was told in Giorgio Vasari's \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLeon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in Genoa. His mother was Bianca Fieschi. His father, Lorenzo di Benedetto Alberti, was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city, but allowed to return in 1428. Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied law at Bologna. He lived for a time in Florence, then in 1431 travelled to Rome, where he took holy orders and entered the service of the papal court. During this time he studied the ancient ruins, which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.\nLeon Battista Alberti was thought to be a tall, strong athlete skilled in horseback riding. gifted in many ways. He distinguished himself as a writer while still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play that was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature. In 1435 he began his first major written work, \"Della pittura\", which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence in the early fifteenth century. In this work he analysed the nature of painting and explored the elements of perspective, composition, and colour.\nIn 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese Leonello d'Este of Ferrara, for whom he built a small triumphal arch to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father. In 1447 Alberti became architectural advisor to Pope Nicholas V and was involved in several projects at the Vatican.\nFirst major commission.\nHis first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the fa\u00e7ade of the Rucellai Palace in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from Sigismondo Malatesta to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in Rimini into a memorial chapel, the Tempio Malatestiano. In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the fa\u00e7ade for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years. In 1452, he completed , a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of Vitruvius and influenced by the ancient roman buildings. The work was not published until 1485. It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, \"De statua\", in which he examines sculpture. Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to Pisanello.\nAlberti was employed to design two churches in Mantua, San Sebastiano, which was never completed and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated upon, and the Basilica of Sant'Andrea. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti's death: the construction was completed after his death and is considered as his most significant work.\nAlberti as artist.\nAs an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the contemporary ordinary craftsmen educated in workshops. He was a humanist who studied Aristotle and Plotinus. He was among the rapidly growing group of intellectuals and artists who at that time were supported by the courts of nobility. As a member of a noble family and as part of the Roman curia, Alberti enjoyed special status. He was a welcomed guest at the Este court in Ferrara, and spent time with the soldier-prince Federico III da Montefeltro in Urbino. The Duke of Urbino was a shrewd military commander, who generously funded artists. Alberti planned to dedicate his treatise on architecture to him.\nAmong Alberti's minor but pioneering studies, were an essay on cryptography, \"De componendis cifris\", and the first Italian grammar. He collaborated with the Florentine cosmographer Paolo Toscanelli in astronomy, a science close to geography at that time. He also wrote a small Latin work on geography, \"Descriptio urbis Romae\" (\"The Panorama of the City of Rome\"). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed \"De iciarchia\" (\"On Ruling the Household\"), a dialogue about Florence during the Medici rule.\nAlberti took holy orders and never married. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, about whom he wrote a panegyric (\"Canis\"). Vasari describes Alberti as \"an admirable citizen, a man of culture... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was.\" Alberti died in Rome on 25 April 1472 at the age of 68.\nPublications.\nAlberti considered mathematics as the foundation of arts and sciences. \"To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on painting,\" Alberti began his treatise, \"Della Pittura\" (On Painting) dedicated to Brunelleschi, \"I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned.\"\n\"Della pittura\" (also known in Latin as \"De Pictura\") relied on the study classical optics to approach the perspective in artistic and architectural representations. Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of optics was connected to the tradition of the \"Kitab al-manazir\" (\"The Optics\"; \"De aspectibus\") of the Arab polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham, d. c.\u20091041), which was transmitted by Franciscan optical workshops of the thirteenth-century \"Perspectivae\" traditions of scholars such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham, and Witelo (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of Lorenzo Ghiberti, \"Commentario terzo\").\nIn both \"Della pittura\" and \"De statua\", Alberti stressed that \"all steps of learning should be sought from nature\". The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive \"through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature\". However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, \"for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary\". The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or to add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti \"the harmony of all parts in relation to one another,\" and subsequently \"this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony\". Alberti's thoughts on harmony were not new\u2014they could be traced back to Pythagoras\u2014but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse.\nIn Rome, Alberti spent considerable time studying its ancient sites, ruins, and arts. His detailed observations, included in his (1452, \"On the Art of Building\"), were inspired by the essay \"De architectura\" written by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius (fl. 46\u201330 BC). Alberti's work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, from engineering to the aesthetics. , a large and expensive book, was not published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects. However, the book was written \"not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts\", as Alberti put it. Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by Cosimo Bartoli was published in 1550. Pope Nicholas V, to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars, and others.\nAlberti wrote \"I Libri della famiglia\"\u2014which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money\u2014in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like Erasmus decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that \"the care of very young children is women's work, for nurses or the mother\", and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet. With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that \"he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author's futile enterprise along it\". \"Momus\", written between 1443 and 1450, was a notable comedy about the Olympian deities. It has been considered as a roman \u00e0 clef\u2014Jupiter has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from Lucian, one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, Momus, the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other deities come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm.\nArchitectural works.\nAlberti did not concern himself with engineering, and very few of his major projects were built. As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman architecture, he studied column and lintel based architecture, from a visual rather than structural viewpoint. He correctly employed the Classical orders, unlike his contemporary, Brunelleschi, who used the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Alberti reflected on the social effects of architecture, and was attentive to the urban landscape. This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement. Alberti anticipated the principle of street hierarchy, with wide main streets connected to secondary streets, and buildings of equal height.\nIn Rome he was employed by Pope Nicholas V for the restoration of the Roman aqueduct of Acqua Vergine, which debouched into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was later replaced by the Baroque Trevi Fountain.\nSome researchers suggested that the Villa Medici in Fiesole might have been designed by Alberti, rather than by Michelozzo. This hilltop residence commissioned by Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo il Vecchio's second son, with its view over the city, is sometimes considered the first example of a Renaissance villa: it reflects the writing by Alberti about country residential buildings as \"villa suburbana\". The building later inspired numerous other similar projects buildings from the end of the fifteenth century.\nTempio Malatestiano, Rimini.\nThe Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini (1447, 1453\u201360) is the rebuilding of a Gothic church. The fa\u00e7ade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.\nFa\u00e7ade of Palazzo Rucellai.\nThe design of the fa\u00e7ade of the Palazzo Rucellai (1446\u201351) was one of several commissioned by the Rucellai family. The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in classical style onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has Corinthian columns. The palace introduced set the use of classical building elements in civic buildings in Florence, and became very influential. The work was executed by Bernardo Rossellino.\nSanta Maria Novella.\nAt Santa Maria Novella, Florence, between (1448\u201370) the upper fa\u00e7ade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six Gothic niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches, such as San Miniato al Monte and the Baptistery of Florence. The design also incorporates an ocular window that was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire fa\u00e7ade in a manner that includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices, and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of church fa\u00e7ades in the later Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical Revival buildings.\nPienza.\nAlberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, Pienza. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459. It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, Pope Pius II, in whose employ Alberti served. Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat, but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position.\nThe piazza is a trapezoid shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, \"Palazzo Piccolomini\", is on the western side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted cross window set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti's Palazzo Rucellai in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by loggia on all three floors that overlook an enclosed Italian Renaissance garden with \"Giardino all'italiana\" era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the Val d'Orcia and Pope Pius's beloved Mount Amiata beyond. Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for a hundred horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall, and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning.\nSant' Andrea, Mantua.\nThe Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua was begun in 1471, the year before Alberti's death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the triumphal arch motif, both for its fa\u00e7ade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow. Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike Brunelleschi, he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.\nPainting.\nGiorgio Vasari, who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in Michelangelo, emphasized Alberti's scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: \"He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work.\" In \"On Painting\", Alberti uses the expression \"We Painters\", but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. \"In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty\", wrote Vasari. \"The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship.\" Jacob Burckhardt portrayed Alberti in \"The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy\" as a truly universal genius. \"And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari's work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo's nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived.\"\nAlberti is said to appear in Mantegna's great frescoes in the Camera degli Sposi, as the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of Ludovico Gonzaga, the ruler of Mantua. In Alberti's self-portrait, a large plaquette, he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, \"Quid tum?\" (what then), taken from Virgil's \"Eclogues\": \"So what, if Amyntas is dark? (\"quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?\") Violets are black, and hyacinths are black.\"\nContributions and cultural influence.\nAlberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nhttps:// Magda Saura, \"Building codes in the architectural treatise De re aedificatoria,\"\nhttps:// \"Third International Congress on Construction History\", Cottbus, May 2009.\nhttps:// \nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

He originated in an early comic strip by McCay, \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\", before receiving his own spin-off series, Little Nemo in Slumberland. The full-page weekly strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel. The strip is considered McCay's masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color and perspective, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, and its architectural and other details.\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" ran in the \"New York Herald\" from October 15, 1905 until July 23, 1911. The strip was renamed In the Land of Wonderful Dreams when McCay brought it to William Randolph Hearst's \"New York American\", where it ran from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914. When McCay returned to the \"Herald\" in 1924, he revived the strip, and it ran under its original title from August 3, 1924 until January 9, 1927, when McCay returned to Hearst.\nConcept.\nA weekly fantasy adventure, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" featured the young Nemo (\"No one\" in Latin) who dreamed himself into wondrous predicaments from which he awoke in bed in the last panel.\nThe first episode begins with a command from King Morpheus of Slumberland to a minion to collect Nemo. Nemo was to be the playmate of Slumberland's Princess, but it took months of adventures before Nemo finally arrived. A green, cigar-chewing clown named Flip was determined to disturb Nemo's sleep with a top hat emblazoned with the words \"Wake Up\". Nemo and Flip eventually become companions and are joined by an African Imp whom Flip finds in the Candy Islands. The group travels far and wide, from shanty towns to Mars, to Jack Frost's palace, to the bizarre architecture and distorted funhouse-mirror illusions of Befuddle Hall.\nThe strip shows McCay's understanding of dream psychology, particularly of dream fears\u2014falling, drowning, impalement. This dream world has its own moral code, perhaps difficult to understand. Breaking it has terrible consequences as when Nemo ignores instructions not to touch Queen Crystalette who inhabits a cave of glass. Overcome with his infatuation, he causes her and her followers to shatter and awakens with \"the groans of the dying guardsmen still ringing in his ears\".\nAlthough the strip began October 15, 1905, with King Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, making his first attempt to bring Little Nemo to his realm. Nemo did not get into Slumberland until March 4, 1906. Due to Flip's interfering, Nemo did not get to see the Princess until July 8. His dream quest is always interrupted, either by his falling out of bed, Nemo suddenly waking up, or by his parents forcing him to wake up.\nOn July 12, 1908, McCay made a major change of direction: Flip visits Nemo and tells him that he has had his uncle destroy Slumberland (it had been dissolved before, into day, but this time it appeared to be permanent). After this, Nemo's dreams take place in his home town, though Flip\u2014and a curious-looking boy named the Professor\u2014accompany him. These adventures range from the down-to-earth to Rarebit-fiend type fantasy; one very commonplace dream had the Professor pelting people with snowballs. The famous \"walking bed\" story was in this period. Slumberland continued to make sporadic appearances until it returned for good on December 26, 1909.\nStory-arcs included Befuddle Hall, a voyage to Mars (with a well-realized Martian civilization), and a trip around the world (including a tour of New York City).\nStyle.\nMcCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, and architectural and other detail. From the second installment, McCay had the panel sizes and layouts conform to the action in the strip: as a forest of mushrooms grew, so did the panels, and the panels shrank as the mushrooms collapsed on Nemo. In an early Thanksgiving episode, the focal action of a giant turkey gobbling Nemo's house receives an enormous circular panel in the center of the page. McCay also accommodated a sense of proportion with panel size and shape, showing elephants and dragons at a scale the reader could feel in proportion to the regular characters. McCay controlled narrative pacing through variation or repetition, as with equally-sized panels whose repeated layouts and minute differences in movement conveyed a feeling of buildup to some climactic action.\nIn his familiar Art Nouveau-influenced style, McCay outlined his characters in heavy blacks. Slumberland's ornate architecture was reminiscent of the architecture designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, as well as Luna Park and Dreamland in Coney Island, and the Parisian Luxembourg Palace.\nMcCay made imaginative use of color, sometimes changing the backgrounds' or characters' colors from panel to panel in a psychedelic imitation of a dream experience. The colors were enhanced by the careful attention and advanced Ben Day lithographic process employed by the \"Herald\"'s printing staff. McCay annotated the \"Nemo\" pages for the printers with the precise color schemes he wanted.\nFor the first five months the pages were accompanied with captions beneath them, and at first the captions were numbered. In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in the speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility, and \"disfigur[ing McCay's] otherwise flawless work\", according to critic R. C. Harvey. The level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering highlights what seems to be the little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition.\nMcCay used ethnic stereotypes prominently in \"Little Nemo\", as in the ill-tempered Irishman Flip, and the nearly-mute African Impie.\nBackground.\nWinsor McCay\u00a0(c.\u20091867\u201371\u00a0\u2013 1934) had worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist in carnivals and dime museums before he began working for newspapers and magazines in 1898. In 1903, he joined the staff of the \"New York Herald\" family of newspapers, where he had success with comic strips such as \"Little Sammy Sneeze\" (1904\u201306). and \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" (1904\u201311)\nIn 1905, McCay got \"an idea from the \"Rarebit Fiend\" to please the little folk\". That October, the full-page Sunday strip \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" debuted in the \"Herald\". Considered McCay's masterpiece, its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay's son Robert, had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel. McCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail.\nPublication history.\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" debuted on the last page of the Sunday comics section of \"The New York Herald\" newspaper, on October 15, 1905. The full-page, color comic strip ran until July 23, 1911. In spring 1911, McCay moved to William Randolph Hearst's \"New York American\" and took \"Little Nemo\"'s characters with him. The \"Herald\" held the strip's copyright, but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters. In the \"American\", the strip ran under the title \"In the Land of Wonderful Dreams\". The \"Herald\" was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip.\nMcCay left Hearst in May 1924 and returned to the \"Herald Tribune\". He began \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" afresh on August 3 of that year. The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid. Nemo took a more passive role in the stories, and there was no continuity. The strip came to an end in January 1927, as it was not popular with readers. Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the \"American\", and they succeeded in 1927. Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo's success, the \"Herald Tribune\" signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.\nIn 1937, McCay's son Robert attempted to carry on his father's legacy by reviving \"Little Nemo\". Comic book packager Harry \"A\" Chesler's syndicate announced a Sunday and daily \"Nemo\" strip, credited to \"Winsor McCay, Jr.\" Robert also drew a comic-book version for Chesler called \"Nemo in Adventureland\" featuring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. Production continued on both after the syndicate was closed in 1938, being utilized in various comic books including Cocomalt Comics and Blue Ribbon, published by MLJ Publications (later Archie Publications). Chesler closed his shop (the first of several times) around 1940. Street &amp; Smith ran Little Nemo in 1942 in \"Shadow Comics\". In 1945, McCay was again with Chesler\u2019s shop, producing Little Nemo in Adventureland for Red Seal and Punch Comics until 1947, when the shop closed down for the final time.\nIn 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original \"Nemo\" strip from McCay's original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last. The McCay-Richardson Syndicate distributed this version from approximately March to December 1947.\nIn 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many \"Little Nemo\" strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Bob had worked. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of \"Little Nemo\" strips in Italy. His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University.\nIn 2005, collector Peter Maresca self-published a volume of \"Nemo\" Sundays as \"Little Nemo in Slumberland: So Many Splendid Sundays!\" via his Sunday Press Books. The volume was large enough to reproduce the pages at their original size, as they appeared in newspapers. Restoration work took Maresca between five and twenty hours per page. A second volume, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland: Many More Splendid Sundays!\", appeared in 2008.\nAdaptations.\nTheatre.\nAs early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to put \"Little Nemo\" on stage. In summer 1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant \"Little Nemo\" show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. It starred Gabriel Weigel, an actor with dwarfism, as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip. Reviews were positive, and it played to sold-out houses in New York. It went on the road for two seasons. McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where \"Little Nemo\" played. When a Keith circuit refused to let McCay perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise. In several cities, McCay brought his son, who sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo as publicity.\nAs part of an improvised story, Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a \"Whiffenpoof\". The word stuck with the public, and became the name of a and a singing group. One reviewer of the 1908 operetta gave a paragraph of praise to the comic hunting tales presented in a scene in which three hunters are trying to outdo each other with hunting stories about the \"montimanjack\", the \"peninsula\", and the \"whiffenpoof\". He calls it \"one of the funniest yarns ever spun\" and compares it favorably to Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark. One source indicates that the dialogue in fact began as an ad lib by actor Joseph Cawthorn, covering for some kind of backstage problem during a performance. The whiffenpoof is also referred in one of the Little Nemo . After being held down by nine policemen during a hysteria crisis, Nemo's father tells the doctor: \"Just keep those whiffenpoofs away. Will you?\".\n starts with a hunt for whiffenpoofs but instead the hunters find a \"montemaniac\" and a \"peninsula\".\nDespite the show's success, it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses, and came to an end in December 1910. In mid-2012 Toronto-based theatre company Frolick performed an adaptation of the strip into \"Adventures in Slumberland\", a multimedia show featuring puppets large and small and a score that included as a refrain \"Wake Up Little Nemo\", set to the tune of The Everly Brothers' 1957 hit \"Wake Up Little Susie\". Talespinner Children's Theatre in Cleveland, OH produced a scaled-down, \"colorful and high-energy 45-minute\" adaptation in 2013, \"Adventures In Slumberland\" by David Hansen.\nIn March 2017, a short, one-act adaptation of the \"Little Nemo\" adventures was staged at Fordham University in New York City. The play, simply entitled \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\", was written by Aladdin Lee Grant Rutledge Collar, and directed by student Peter McNally. The six person cast, as well as creative team, consisted of students and alums at the university.\nFilm.\nMcCay played an important role in the early history of animation. In 1911, he completed his first film, \"Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics\" (also known as \"Little Nemo\"), first in theatres and then as part of his vaudeville act. McCay made the 4,000 rice-paper drawings for the animated portion of the film. The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film's total length. Photography was done at the Vitagraph Studios under the supervision of animation pioneer James Stuart Blackton. During the live-action portion of the film, McCay bets his colleagues he can make his drawings move. He wins the bet by animating his \"Little Nemo\" characters, who shapeshift and transform.\nIn 1984, Arnaud S\u00e9lignac produced and directed a film titled \"Nemo\", a.k.a. \"Dream One\", starring Jason Connery, Harvey Keitel, and Carole Bouquet. It involves a little boy called Nemo, who wears pajamas and travels to a fantasy world, but otherwise the connection to McCay's strip is a loose one. The fantasy world is a dark and dismal beach, and Nemo encounters characters from other works of fiction rather than those from the original strip. Instead of Flip or the Princess, Nemo meets Zorro, Alice, and Jules Verne's Nautilus (which was led by Captain Nemo).\nA joint American-Japanese feature-length film \"\" was released in Japan in 1989 and in the United States in August 1992 from Hemdale Film Corporation, with contributions by Ray Bradbury, Chris Columbus, and Moebius, and music by the Sherman Brothers. The story tells of a quest by Nemo and friends to rescue King Morpheus from the Nightmare King. The Princess is named Princess Camille, Flip has a bird companion named Flap, and Nemo has a pet flying squirrel named Icarus. It received mixed reviews from critics, where it earned $11.4 million on a $35 million budget and was a box-office bomb, but it sold well on home video and has since developed into a cult film.\nA live-action film adaptation, \"Slumberland\", directed by Francis Lawrence, was released in 2022. It features a gender-swapped version of the title character played by Marlow Barkley. Jason Momoa stars as a radically altered version of Flip, who is described as a \"nine-foot tall creature that is half-man, half-beast, has shaggy fur and long curved tusks\". The plot centers on Nemo and Flip traveling to Slumberland in search of the former's father.\nOpera.\nThe Sarasota Opera commissioned composer Daron Hagen and librettist J. D. McClatchy to create an opera based on \"Little Nemo\". Two casts of children alternated performances when it debuted in November 2012. The dreamlike nonlinear story told of Nemo, the Princess, and their comrades trying to prevent the Emperor of Sol and the Guardian of Dawn from bringing daylight to Slumberland. Special effects and shifting backgrounds were produced with projections onto a scaffolding of boxes. The work was first performed on November 10 and 11, by members of the Sarasota Opera, Sarasota Youth Opera, Sarasota Prep Chorus, The Sailor Circus and students from Booker High school.\nVideo games.\nIn 1990, Capcom produced a video game for the NES, titled \"\" (known as \"Pajama Hero Nemo\" in Japan), a licensed game based on the 1989 film. The film would not see a US release until 1992, two years after the game's Japanese release, so the game is often thought to be a standalone adaptation of \"Little Nemo\", not related to the film. An arcade game called simply \"Nemo\" was also released in 1990. In 2021, a new game, titled \"Little Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends\" based on the original comic strip was launched on Kickstarter. It is developed by Chris Totten of Pie For Breakfast Studios and Benjamin Cole of PXLPLZ. In 2022, a new game, titled \"Little Nemo and the Guardians of Slumberland\" based on the original comic strip was launched on Kickstarter. It is developed by Dave Mauro of DIE SOFT. \nOther media.\nThroughout the years, various pieces of Little Nemo merchandise have been produced. In 1941, Rand, McNally &amp; Co. published a Little Nemo children's storybook. \"Little Nemo in Slumberland in 3-D\" was released by Blackthorne Publishing in 1987; this reprinted Little Nemo issues with 3-D glasses. A set of 30 Little Nemo postcards was available through Stewart Tabori &amp; Chang in 1996. In 1993, as promotion for the 1989 animated film, Hemdale produced a Collector's Set which includes a VHS movie, illustrated storybook, and cassette soundtrack. In 2001, Dark Horse Comics released a Little Nemo statue and tin lunchbox.\nCultural influence.\nLittle Nemo itself is influenced by children stories in general, and some French comic pages in particular. Since its publishing, \"Little Nemo\" has had an influence on other artists, including Peter Newell (\"The Naps of Polly Sleepyhead\"), Frank King (\"Bobby Make-Believe\"), Clare Briggs (\"Danny Dreamer\") or George McManus (\"Nibsy the Newsboy in Funny Fairyland\"). Through the Paris edition of the New York Herald, his influence reached France and other European countries.\nIn children's literature, Maurice Sendak said that this strip inspired his book \"In the Night Kitchen\", and William Joyce included several elements from Little Nemo in his children's book \"Santa Calls\", including appearances by Flip and the walking bed. Another tribute to Little Nemo is the comic, then made into a short film, \"Little Remo in Pinchmeland\", by Ellen Duthie and Daniela Martag\u00f3n.\nThe character and themes from the comic strip \"Little Nemo\" were used in a song \"Scenes from a Night's Dream\" written by Tony Banks and Phil Collins of the progressive rock group Genesis on their 1978 recording, \"...And Then There Were Three...\".\nA progressive rock group from Germany named Scara Brae also recorded a musical impression of the comic on their rare self-titled disc from 1981 (the track was actually recorded 2 years earlier). Their concept piece was revived on the second album by the Greek band Anger Department, titled \"The Strange Dreams of a Rarebit Fiend\", again after a McCay-comic. Their \"Little Nemo\" was chosen for a theatre play, which was suggested for the cultural program for the Olympic Games in 2004.\nIn 1984, Italian comic artist Vittorio Giardino started producing a number of stories under the title \"Little Ego\", a parodic adaptation of \"Little Nemo\", in the shape of adult-oriented erotic comics. Brian Bolland's early comic strip \"Little Nympho in Slumberland\" employed a similar technique.\nThe bar in \"\" is called 'Little Nemo's'.\nThe strip influenced Alan Moore, in \"Miracleman\" #4, when the Miracleman family end up in a palace called \"Sleepy Town\", which has imagery similar to Little Nemo's. In Moore (and J.H. Williams III)'s \"Promethea\", a more direct pastiche \u2013 \"Little Margie in Misty Magic Land\" \u2013 showed Moore's inspiration and debt to McCay's landmark 1905 strip. Little Nemo makes a visual cameo in Volume 4, issue #4 of Moore and Kevin O'Neill's \"League of Extraordinary Gentleman\", during the Shakespearean Theatre scene that includes many other cameos.\nThe Sandman comics and graphic novel series occasionally references \"Little Nemo\" as well. Examples include ', where an abused child escapes into dreams styled after McCay's comics and using a similar \"wake-up\" mechanism, and ' (pub. 1996), which features George Alec Effinger's short \"Seven Nights in Slumberland\" (where Nemo interacts with Neil Gaiman's characters The Endless).\nIn 1989, teen comic book Power Pack ran an issue (#47) which paid direct homage to one of McCay's Nemo storylines, featuring a castle that was drawn sideways and Katie Power re-enacting a classic Nemo panel with a sideways-drawn hallway that served as a bottomless pit with the line \"Don't fall in, y'hear?\"\nThe video of the 1989 song for \"Runnin' Down a Dream\" by Tom Petty is directly inspired by \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" by Winsor McCay, which features a drawing style reminiscent of McCay's and showing Petty and a character who resembles Flip travelling through Slumberland.\nThe band Queensr\u00ffche paid homage to Little Nemo in their 1990 video Silent Lucidity.\nIn 1994\u20131995, French artist Moebius wrote the story to a sequel comic series, \"Little Nemo\", drawn by Bruno Marchand in two albums. In 2000\u20132002, Marchand continued the story with two additional albums.\nIn 2006, electronic artist Daedelus used Little Nemo artwork for his album \"Denies the Day's Demise\".\nThe comic strip \"Cul de Sac\" includes a strip-within-the-strip, \"Little Neuro\", a parody of Little Nemo. Neuro is a little boy who hardly ever leaves his bed.\nIn 2009, the Pittsburgh ToonSeum established its NEMO Award, given to notable individuals \"for excellence in the cartoon arts\". Recipients to date include veteran comic-book artist, Ron Frenz, editorial and comic-strip artist, Dick Locher, cartoonist and comics historian, Trina Robbins, and comics artist, editorial cartoonist and artists' rights advocate Jerry Robinson.\nOn October 15, 2012, celebrating the 107th anniversary of the first \"Little Nemo\" story, Google displayed an interactive animated \"Google Doodle\" called \"Little Nemo in Google-land\" on its homepage. The doodle showed a typical Little Nemo adventure through a series of panels, each featuring a letter from the word \"Google\". The doodle also ends in the same way as the comic strips, with Nemo falling from his bed.\nEric Shanower and Gabriel Rodriguez revived the characters in 2014 in an IDW comic book series entitled \"Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland\". That same year, Locust Moon Press released a new anthology and Taschen published the complete series (1905\u20131926).\nA comic strip \"Mutts\" has one of the strip's recurring characters, a naughty squirrel, \"bonking\" Nemo with an acorn, and wishing him \"sweet dreams\".\nLegacy.\nComics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay \"the first original genius of the comic strip medium\". Harvey claims that McCay's contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon. Cartoonist Robert Crumb called McCay a \"genius\" and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman's \"In the Shadow of No Towers\" (2004) appropriated some of McCay's imagery, and included a page of \"Little Nemo\" in its appendix. Federico Fellini read \"Little Nemo\" in the children's magazine \"Il corriere dei piccoli\", and the strip was a \"powerful influence\" on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella.\nMcCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection survived him, but much of it was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection into his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay's surviving artwork remained in family hands.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18039", "revid": "50734473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18039", "title": "Lydia", "text": "Ancient Anatolian kingdom\nLydia (; ) was an Iron Age kingdom situated in western Anatolia, in modern-day Turkey. Later, it became an important province of the Achaemenid Empire and then the Roman Empire. Its capital was Sardis.\nAt some point before 800 BCE, the Lydian people achieved some sort of political cohesion, and existed as an independent kingdom by the 600s BCE. At its greatest extent, during the 7th century BCE, it covered all of western Anatolia. In 546 BCE, it became a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, known as \"Sparda\" in Old Persian. In 133 BCE, it became part of the Roman province of Asia.\nLydian coins, made of electrum, are among the oldest in existence, dated to around the 7th century BCE.\nGeography.\nLydia is generally located east of ancient Ionia in the modern western Turkish provinces of U\u015fak, Manisa and inland \u0130zmir.\nThe boundaries of historical Lydia varied across the centuries. It was bounded first by Mysia, Caria, Phrygia and coastal Ionia. Later, the military power of Alyattes and Croesus expanded Lydia, which, with its capital at Sardis, controlled all Asia Minor west of the River Halys, except Lycia. After the Persian conquest the River Maeander was regarded as its southern boundary, and during imperial Roman times Lydia comprised the country between Mysia and Caria on the one side and Phrygia and the Aegean Sea on the other.\nLanguage.\nThe Lydian language, which became extinct during the 1st century BCE, was an Indo-European language in the Anatolian language family, related to Luwian and Hittite. However, Lydian is usually not categorized as part of the Luwic subgroup, unlike the other nearby Anatolian languages Luwian, Carian, and Lycian.\nDue to its fragmentary attestation, the meanings of many words are unknown but much of the grammar has been determined. Similar to other Anatolian languages, it featured extensive use of prefixes and grammatical particles to chain clauses together. Lydian had also undergone extensive syncope, leading to numerous consonant clusters atypical of most Indo-European languages.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nLydia's early history remains shrouded in obscurity. During the Late Bronze Age (1600 BCE-1200 BCE), the territory that later became Lydia was part of a broader polity called Arzawa; in particular, Lydia would subsume sub-kingdoms of Arzawa named Mira and \u0160e\u1e2ba, as well as the city-state of Apasa (the precursor of the Greek E\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 Ephesus). Like the other Arzawa sub-states, they had tumultuous relations with the Hittite Empire, acting both as allies, enemies, and vassals at various points in time.\nBy roughly 800 BCE, the Lydian people appear to have established their presence and achieved some degree of political cohesion. However, precise dates and events are impossible to determine due to the absence of contemporary written records. The only firm evidence for this early period comes from the archaeological excavations at Sardis. Although certain literary accounts purport the existence of two early Lydian dynasties, namely the house of Atys \u2013 after whose son Lydus the Lydians were supposedly named \u2013 and the Heraclids, who allegedly ruled for twenty-two generations before 685 BCE, these sources are steeped in mythology and lack historical credibility.\nKingdom of Lydia.\nLydia was an independent kingdom from an unknown time until 546 BCE.\nCandaules.\nAccording to Herodotus, one of Lydus's descendants was Iardanus, with whom Heracles was in service at one time. Heracles had an affair with one of Iardanus' slave-girls and their son Alcaeus was the first of the Heraclid Dynasty said to have ruled Lydia for 22 generations starting with Agron. In the 8th century BCE, Meles became the 21st and penultimate Heraclid king and the last was his son Candaules (died c. 687 BCE).\nThe Mermnad Empire (680-546 BCE).\nGyges.\nGyges was the first Lydian king whose existence is demonstrable from contemporary records. According to semi-mythical accounts of his reign, he was the son of a man named Dascylus and came to power by overthrowing King Candaules with the assistance of a Carian prince from Mylasa named Arselis. Gyges's rise to power happened in the context of a period of turmoil following the invasion of the Cimmerians, a nomadic people from the Pontic steppe who had invaded Western Asia, who around 675 BCE destroyed the previous major power in Anatolia, the kingdom of Phrygia.\nGyges took advantage of the power vacuum created by the Cimmerian invasions to consolidate his kingdom and make it a military power, he contacted the Neo-Assyrian court by sending diplomats to Nineveh to seek help against the Cimmerian invasions, and he attacked the Ionian Greek cities of Miletus, Smyrna, and Colophon. Gyges's extensive alliances with the Carian dynasts allowed him to recruit Carian and Ionian Greek soldiers to send overseas to assist the Egyptian king Psamtik I of the city of Sais, with whom he had established contacts around 662 BCE. With the help of these armed forces, Psamtik I united Egypt under his rule after eliminating the eleven other kinglets with whom he had been co-ruling Lower Egypt.\nIn 644 BCE, Lydia faced a third attack by the Cimmerians, led by their king Lygdamis. This time, the Lydians were defeated, Sardis was sacked, and Gyges was killed.\nArdys and Sadyattes.\nGyges was succeeded by his son Ardys, who resumed diplomatic activity with Assyria and would also have to face the Cimmerians. Ardys attacked the Ionian Greek city of Miletus and succeeded in capturing the city of Priene, after which Priene would remain under direct rule of the Lydian kingdom until its end.\nArdys's reign was short-lived, and in 637 BCE, that is in Ardys's seventh regnal year, the Thracian Treres tribe who had migrated across the Thracian Bosporus and invaded Anatolia, under their king Kobos, and in alliance with the Cimmerians and the Lycians, attacked Lydia. They defeated the Lydians again and for a second time sacked the Lydian capital of Sardis, except for its citadel. It is probable that Ardys was killed during this Cimmerian attack.\nArdys was succeeded by his son, Sadyattes, who had an even more short-lived reign. Sadyattes died in 635 BCE, and it is possible that, like his grandfather Gyges and maybe his father Ardys as well, he died fighting the Cimmerians.\nAlyattes.\nAmidst extreme turmoil, Sadyattes was succeeded in 635 BCE by his son Alyattes, who would transform Lydia into a powerful empire.\nSoon after Alyattes's ascension and early during his reign, with Assyrian approval and in alliance with the Lydians, the Scythians under their king Madyes entered Anatolia, expelled the Treres from Asia Minor, and defeated the Cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat again, following which the Scythians extended their domination to Central Anatolia until they were themselves expelled by the Medes from Western Asia in the 590s BCE. This final defeat of the Cimmerians was carried out by the joint forces of Madyes, whom Strabo credits with expelling the Treres and Cimmerians from Asia Minor, and of Alyattes, whom Herodotus and Polyaenus claim finally defeated the Cimmerians.\nAlyattes turned towards Phrygia in the east, where he extended Lydian rule eastwards to Phrygia. Alyattes continued his expansionist policy in the east, and of all the peoples to the west of the Halys River whom Herodotus claimed Alyattes's successor Croesus ruled over - the Lydians, Phrygians, Mysians, Mariandyni, Chalybes, Paphlagonians, Thyni and Bithyni Thracians, Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians, and Pamphylians - it is very likely that a number of these populations had already been conquered under Alyattes, and it is not impossible that the Lydians might have subjected Lycia, given that the Lycian coast would have been important for the Lydians because it was close to a trade route connecting the Aegean region, the Levant, and Cyprus.\nAlyattes's eastern conquests brought the Lydian Empire in conflict in the 590s BCE with the Medes, and a war broke out between the Median and Lydian Empires in 590 BCE which was waged in eastern Anatolia lasted five years, until a solar eclipse occurred in 585 BCE during a battle (hence called the Battle of the Eclipse) opposing the Lydian and Median armies, which both sides interpreted as an omen to end the war. The Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II and the king Syennesis of Cilicia acted as mediators in the ensuing peace treaty, which was sealed by the marriage of the Median king Cyaxares's son Astyages with Alyattes's daughter Aryenis, and the possible wedding of a daughter of Cyaxares with either Alyattes or with his son Croesus.\nCroesus.\nAlyattes died shortly after the Battle of the Eclipse, in 585 BCE itself, following which Lydia faced a power struggle between his son Pantaleon, born from a Greek woman, and his other son Croesus, born from a Carian noblewoman, out of which the latter emerged successful.\nCroesus brought Caria under the direct control of the Lydian Empire, and he subjugated all of mainland Ionia, Aeolis, and Doris, but he abandoned his plans of annexing the Greek city-states on the islands of the Aegean Sea and he instead concluded treaties of friendship with them, which might have helped him participate in the lucrative trade the Aegean Greeks carried out with Egypt at Naucratis. According to Herodotus, Croesus ruled over all the peoples to the west of the Halys River, although the actual border of his kingdom was further to the east of the Halys, at an undetermined point in eastern Anatolia.\nCroesus continued the friendly relations with the Medes concluded between his father Alyattes and the Median king Cyaxares, and he continued these good relations with the Medes after he succeeded Alyattes and Astyages succeeded Cyaxares. And, under Croesus's rule, Lydia continued its good relations started by Gyges with the Saite Egyptian kingdom, then ruled by the pharaoh Amasis II. Croesus also established trade and diplomatic relations with the Neo-Babylonian Empire of Nabonidus, and he further increased his contacts with the Greeks on the European continent by establishing relations with the city-state of Sparta.\nIn 550 BCE, Croesus's brother-in-law, the Median king Astyages, was overthrown by his own grandson, the Persian king Cyrus the Great, and Croesus responded by attacking Pteria, the capital of a Phrygian state vassal to the Lydians which might have attempted to declare its allegiance to the new Persian Empire of Cyrus. Cyrus retaliated by intervening in Cappadocia and defeated the Lydians at Pteria in a battle, and again at Thymbra before besieging and capturing the Lydian capital of Sardis, thus bringing an end to the rule of the Mermnad dynasty and to the Lydian Empire. Lydia would never regain its independence and would remain a part of various successive empires.\nAlthough the dates for the battles of Pteria and Thymbra and of end of the Lydian empire have been traditionally fixed to 547 BCE, more recent estimates suggest that Herodotus's account being unreliable chronologically concerning the fall of Lydia means that there are currently no ways of dating the end of the Lydian kingdom; theoretically, it may even have taken place after the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE.\nPersian Empire.\nIn 547 BC, the Lydian king Croesus besieged and captured the Persian city of Pteria in Cappadocia and enslaved its inhabitants. The Persian king Cyrus The Great marched with his army against the Lydians. The Battle of Pteria resulted in a stalemate, forcing the Lydians to retreat to their capital city of Sardis. Some months later the Persian and Lydian kings met at the Battle of Thymbra. Cyrus won and captured the capital city of Sardis by 546 BCE. Lydia became a province (satrapy) of the Persian Empire.\nHellenistic Empire.\nLydia remained a satrapy after Persia's conquest by Alexander the Great.\nWhen Alexander's empire ended after his death, Lydia was possessed by the major Asian diadoch dynasty, the Seleucids, and when it was unable to maintain its territory in Asia Minor, Lydia was acquired by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamum. Its last king avoided the spoils and ravage of a Roman war of conquest by leaving the realm by testament to the Roman Empire.\nRoman province of Asia.\nWhen the Romans entered the capital Sardis in 133 BCE, Lydia, as the other western parts of the Attalid legacy, became part of the province of Asia, a very rich Roman province, worthy of a governor with the high rank of proconsul. The whole west of Asia Minor had Jewish colonies very early, and Christianity was also soon present there. Acts of the Apostles 16:14\u201315 mentions the baptism of a merchant woman called \"Lydia\" from Thyatira, known as Lydia of Thyatira, in what had once been the satrapy of Lydia. Christianity spread rapidly during the 3rd century CE, based on the nearby Exarchate of Ephesus.\nRoman province of Lydia.\nUnder the tetrarchy reform of Emperor Diocletian in 296 CE, Lydia was revived as the name of a separate Roman province, much smaller than the former satrapy, with its capital at Sardis.\nTogether with the provinces of Caria, Hellespontus, Lycia, Pamphylia, Phrygia prima and Phrygia secunda, Pisidia (all in modern Turkey) and the Insulae (Ionian islands, mostly in modern Greece), it formed the diocese (under a \"vicarius\") of Asiana, which was part of the praetorian prefecture of Oriens, together with the dioceses Pontiana (most of the rest of Asia Minor), Oriens proper (mainly Syria), Aegyptus (Egypt) and Thraciae (on the Balkans, roughly Bulgaria).\nEastern Roman Empire (and Crusader) age.\nUnder the Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius (610\u2013641), Lydia became part of Anatolikon, one of the original \"themata\", and later of Thrakesion. Although the Seljuk Turks conquered most of the rest of Anatolia, forming the Sultanate of Ikonion (Konya), Lydia remained part of the Byzantine Empire. While the Venetians occupied Constantinople and Greece as a result of the Fourth Crusade, Lydia continued as a part of the Eastern Roman rump state called the Nicene Empire based at Nicaea until 1261.\nUnder Turkish rule.\nLydia was captured finally by Turkish \"beyliks\", which were all absorbed by the Ottoman state in 1390. The area became part of the Ottoman Aidin Vilayet (\"province\"), and is now in the modern republic of Turkey.\nLegacy.\nFirst coinage.\nAccording to Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to use gold and silver coins and the first to establish retail shops in permanent locations. It is not known, however, whether Herodotus meant that the Lydians were the first to use coins of pure gold and pure silver or the first precious metal coins in general. Despite this ambiguity, this statement of Herodotus is one of the pieces of evidence most often cited on behalf of the argument that Lydians invented coinage, at least in the West, although the first coins (under Alyattes I, reigned c.591\u2013c.560 BCE) were neither gold nor silver but an alloy of the two called electrum.\nThe dating of these first stamped coins is one of the most frequently debated topics of ancient numismatics, with dates ranging from 700 BCE to 550 BCE, but the most common opinion is that they were minted at or near the beginning of the reign of King Alyattes (sometimes referred to incorrectly as Alyattes II). The first coins were made of electrum, an alloy of gold and silver that occurs naturally but that was further debased by the Lydians with added silver and copper.\nThe largest of these coins are commonly referred to as a 1/3 stater (\"trite\") denomination, weighing around 4.7\u00a0grams, though no full staters of this type have ever been found, and the 1/3 stater probably should be referred to more correctly as a stater, after a type of a transversely held scale, the weights used in such a scale (from ancient Greek \u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9=to stand), which also means \"standard.\" These coins were stamped with a lion's head adorned with what is likely a sunburst, which was the king's symbol. The most prolific mint for early electrum coins was Sardis which produced large quantities of the lion head thirds, sixths and twelfths along with lion paw fractions. To complement the largest denomination, fractions were made, including a \"hekte\" (sixth), \"hemihekte\" (twelfth), and so forth down to a 96th, with the 1/96 stater weighing only about 0.15\u00a0grams. There is disagreement, however, over whether the fractions below the twelfth are actually Lydian.\nAlyattes' son was Croesus (Reigned c.560\u2013c.546 BCE), who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the \"Croeseid\", the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation, and the world's first bimetallic monetary system circa 550 BC.\nIt took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day's subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread. The first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions, Hemiobol, Ancient Greek coinage minted in Cyme (Aeolis) under Hermodike II then by the Ionian Greeks in the late sixth century BC.\nSardis was renowned as a beautiful city. Around 550 BCE, near the beginning of his reign, Croesus paid for the construction of the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, which became one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Croesus was defeated in battle by Cyrus II of Persia in 546 BCE, with the Lydian kingdom losing its autonomy and becoming a Persian satrapy.\nIn Greek mythology.\nFor the Greeks, Tantalus was a primordial ruler of mythic Lydia, and Niobe his proud daughter; her husband Amphion associated Lydia with Thebes in Greece, and through Pelops the line of Tantalus was part of the founding myths of Mycenae's second dynasty. (In reference to the myth of Bellerophon, Karl Kerenyi remarked, in \"The Heroes of The Greeks\" 1959, p.\u00a083. \"As Lykia was thus connected with Crete, and as the person of Pelops, the hero of Olympia, connected Lydia with the Peloponnesos, so Bellerophontes connected another Asian country, or rather two, Lykia and Karia, with the kingdom of Argos\".)\nIn Greek myth, Lydia had also adopted the double-axe symbol, that also appears in the Mycenaean civilization, the \"labrys\". Omphale, daughter of Iardanos, was a princess of Lydia, whom Heracles was required to serve for a time. His adventures in Lydia are the adventures of a Greek hero in a peripheral and foreign land: during his stay, Heracles enslaved the Itones; killed Syleus, who forced passers-by to hoe his vineyard; slew the serpent of the river Sangarios (which appears in the heavens as the constellation Ophiucus) and captured the simian tricksters, the Cercopes. Accounts tell of at least one son of Heracles who was born to either Omphale or a slave-girl: Herodotus (\"Histories\" i. 7) says this was Alcaeus who began the line of Lydian Heracleidae which ended with the death of Candaules c. 687 BC. Diodorus Siculus (4.31.8) and Ovid (\"Heroides\" 9.54) mentions a son called Lamos, while pseudo-Apollodorus (\"Bibliotheke\" 2.7.8) gives the name Agelaus and Pausanias (2.21.3) names Tyrsenus as the son of Heracles by \"the Lydian woman\". All three heroic ancestors indicate a Lydian dynasty claiming Heracles as their ancestor. Herodotus (1.7) refers to a Heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled Lydia, yet were perhaps not descended from Omphale. He also mentions (1.94) the legend that the Etruscan civilization was founded by colonists from Lydia led by Tyrrhenus, brother of Lydus. Dionysius of Halicarnassus was skeptical of this story, indicating that the Etruscan language and customs were known to be totally dissimilar to those of the Lydians. In addition, the story of the \"Lydian\" origins of the Etruscans was not known to Xanthus of Lydia, an authority on the history of the Lydians.\nLater chronologists ignored Herodotus' statement that Agron was the first Heraclid to be a king, and included his immediate forefathers Alcaeus, Belus, and Ninus in their list of kings of Lydia. Strabo (5.2.2) has Atys, father of Lydus and Tyrrhenus, as a descendant of Heracles and Omphale but that contradicts virtually all other accounts which name Atys, Lydus, and Tyrrhenus among the pre-Heraclid kings and princes of Lydia. The gold deposits in the river Pactolus that were the source of the proverbial wealth of Croesus (Lydia's last king) were said to have been left there when the legendary king Midas of Phrygia washed away the \"Midas touch\" in its waters.\nIn Euripides' tragedy \"The Bacchae\", Dionysus, while maintaining his human disguise, declares his country to be Lydia.\nLydians, the Tyrrhenians and the Etruscans.\nThe relationship between the Etruscans of northern and central Italy and the Lydians has long been a subject of conjecture. The Greek historian Herodotus believed they came from Lydia, but Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a 1st-century BC historian, argued that the Etruscans were indigenous to Italy and unrelated to the Lydians. Dionysius pointed out that the 5th-century historian Xanthus of Lydia, who was regarded as an important source and authority for the history of Lydia, never linked the Etruscans to Lydia or mentioned Tyrrhenus as a Lydian ruler.\nIn contemporary scholarship, Etruscologists overwhelmingly support an indigenous origin for the Etruscans, dismissing Herodotus' account as based on erroneous etymologies. Michael Grant argue that the Etruscans may have propagated this narrative to facilitate their trading in Asia Minor, when many cities in Asia Minor, and the Etruscans themselves, were at war with the Greeks. The French scholar Dominique Briquel contends that \"the story of an exodus from Lydia to Italy was a deliberate political fabrication created in the Hellenized milieu of the court at Sardis in the early 6th century BC.\" Ultimately, these Greek-authored accounts of the Etruscan origins are only the expression of the image that Etruscans' allies or adversaries wanted to divulge and should not be considered historical.\nArchaeological evidence does not support the idea of Lydian migration to Etruria. The Etruscan civilization's earliest phase, the Villanovan culture, emerged around 900 BC, which itself developed from the previous Proto-Villanovan culture of Italy in the late Bronze Age. This culture has no ties to Asia Minor or the Near East. Linguists have identified an Etruscan-like language in a set of inscriptions on Lemnos island, in the Aegean Sea. Since the Etruscan language was a Pre-Indo-European language and neither Indo-European or Semitic, Etruscan was not related to Lydian, which was a part of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European languages. Instead, Etruscan language is considered part of the pre-Indo-European Tyrrhenian language family, along with the Lemnian and Rhaetian language.\nA 2013 genetic study suggested that the maternal lineages of western Anatolians and modern Tuscans had been largely separate for 5,000 to 10,000 years, with Etruscan mtDNA closely resembling modern Tuscans and Neolithic Central European populations. This suggests Etruscans descended from the Villanovan culture, indicating their indigenous roots, and a link between Etruria, modern Tuscany, and Lydia dating back to the Neolithic period during the migration of Early European Farmers from Anatolia to Europe. A 2019 genetic study revealed that Etruscans (900\u2013600 BC) and Latins (900\u2013500 BC) from Latium vetus shared genetic similarities, with both groups having a mixture of two-thirds Copper Age ancestry and one-third Steppe-related ancestry. This study also suggested indigenous origins for the Etruscans, despite their pre-Indo-European language.\nA 2021 study confirmed these findings, showing that Etruscans and Latins in the Iron Age had similar genetic profiles and were part of the European cluster. The Etruscan DNA was completely absent a signal of recent admixture with Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean. Etruscans exhibited a blend of WHG, EEF, and Steppe ancestry, with 75% of males belonging to haplogroup R1b and the most common mitochondrial DNA haplogroup being H.\nCulture and society.\nReligion.\nEarly Lydian religion.\nThe Lydians in early Antiquity adhered to a religion which remains marginally attested due to the known sources covering it being largely of Greek origin, while Lydian inscriptions regarding religion are small in number and no Lydian corpus of ritual texts like the Hittite ritual tablets have been recovered.\nDespite the small size of the recorded Lydian corpus, the various inscriptions relating to religion date from c.\u2009650 to c.\u2009330-325 BC, thus covering the period beginning with the establishment of the Mermnad dynasty under Gyges and ending with the aftermath of the Macedonian conquest under Alexander III and the beginning of the Hellenistic period. Based on limited evidence, Lydian religious practices were centred around the fertility of nature, as was common among ancient societies which depended on the successful cultivation of land.\nThe early Lydian religion exhibited strong connections to Anatolian as well as Greek traditions, and its pantheon was composed of native Lydian deities who were reflexes of earlier Aegean-Balkan ones, as well as Anatolian deities, the latter of whom held lesser roles.\nAlthough Lydia had been conquered by the Achaemenid Empire in c.\u2009547 BC, native Lydian traditions were not destroyed by Persian rule, and most Lydian inscriptions were written during this period.\nThe Lydian religion was polytheistic in nature and was composed of a number of deities:\nBecause of a lack of evidence, little is known on the organisation of Lydian cults.\nDue to the meagre evidence for Lydian religious spaces, little is known about their shapes, sizes, administration, and location: Lydian cultic spaces ranged from small places of worship to prestigious temples of the state cult which also had a political role, although the evidence for them dates from after the end of Lydian independence, while those from the Lydian empire are primarily known from Greek literature rather than from archaeological evidence.\nThe early Lydian religion possessed at least three cultic officiants, consisting of:\nIn addition to these clerical offices, the religious role of the kings among other Anatolian peoples suggests that Lydian kings were also religious high functionaries who participated in the cult as a representative of divine power on earth and claimed their legitimacy to rule from the gods. Anatolian and Hellenistic Greek parallels also suggest that Lydian kings might have been deified after their deaths.\nChristianity.\nLydia later had numerous Christian communities and, after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, Lydia became one of the provinces of the diocese of Asia in the Patriarchate of Constantinople. \nThe ecclesiastical province of Lydia had a metropolitan diocese at Sardis and suffragan dioceses for Philadelphia, Thyatira, Tripolis, Settae, Gordus, Tralles, Silandus, Maeonia, Apollonos Hierum, Mostene, Apollonias, Attalia, Hyrcania, Bage, Balandus, Hermocapella, Hierocaesarea, Acrassus, Dalda, Stratonicia, Cerasa, Gabala, Satala, Aureliopolis and Hellenopolis. Bishops from the various dioceses of Lydia were well represented at the Council of Nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils.\nJudaism.\nThe first Jews in Lydia were set up by Antiochus III in the wake of a revolt in Lydia and Phrygia from 209-204 BC and consisted of 2000 Jewish families who lived in military settlements in Lydia and Phrygia. Each of these families was given land where they would build a house the cultivate the rest as farmland, they would also be given a 10 year tax exemption and have their basic needs provided for them by the government to help them establish themselves. One they were established the Jews of Lydia were given special autonomy to practice Judaism and the Lydian settlements became the epicenter of Judaism across Asia Minor.\nLydia remained under the control of the Selucids until the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC when it was given to king Eumenes of Pergamum. in 133 BC Attalus III bequeathed the kingdom to the Romans. With most information about Lydian Jews coming from the Roman Era, with many documents about the Jewish community in Sardis having been found. During this time the Jews still had the right to live according to Jewish law and be judged under Halachic Law. During this time every Jew in Lydia was expected to give 1/2 a shekel to the Second Temple, and this was controversial among the general population who resented the Jews sending money to a foreign power.\nIn the 1960s the ancient synagogue in Sardis was discovered.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nhttps://"}

To the east of it is the English Channel, and to the west the Celtic Sea.\nLand's End is the most westerly point of mainland England. However, it is not the westernmost point on mainland Great Britain. This title narrowly goes to Corrachadh M\u00f2r in the Scottish Highlands.\nGeography.\nThe actual Land's End, or Peal Point, is a modest headland compared with nearby headlands such as Pedn-men-dhu overlooking Sennen Cove and Pordenack, to the south. The present hotel and tourist complex is at Carn Kez, south of the actual Land's End. Land's End has a particular resonance because it is often used to suggest distance. Land's End to John o' Groats in Scotland is a distance of by road and this \"Land's End to John o' Groats\" distance is often used to define charitable events such as end-to-end walks and races in the UK. Land's End to the northernmost point of England is a distance of by road.\nThe westernmost promontory at Land's End is known as Dr Syntax's Head. The character Dr Syntax was invented by the writer William Combe in his 1809 comic verse \"The Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque\", which satirised the work of seekers of the \"picturesque\" such as William Gilpin. A nearby promontory is called Dr Johnson's Head after Samuel Johnson, who referred to a hypothetical Cornish declaration of independence in his 1775 essay \"Taxation no Tyranny\".\nThe area around Land's End has been designated part of an Important Plant Area, by the organisation Plantlife, for rare species of flora.\nLand's End is a popular venue for rock climbers.\nThe Longships, a group of rocky islets are just over offshore, and together with the Seven Stones Reef and the Isles of Scilly which lie about southwest \u2013 are part of the mythical lost land of Lyonesse, referred to in Arthurian literature.\nGeology.\nThe cliffs are made of granite, an igneous rock, which means they are resistant to weathering, and have steep cliff faces. There are two varieties of granite represented at Land's End. Adjacent to the hotel the granite is coarse-grained with large phenocrysts of orthoclase, sometimes more than in length. To the north, at the First and Last House, there is a finer-grained granite with fewer and smaller phenocrysts, and the different granites can be seen from a distance by the smoother weathering of the finer variety. The granite dates to 268\u2013275 million years ago of the Permian period. The contact zone between the Land's End granite pluton and the altered \"country rocks\" is nearby and the Longships Lighthouse, offshore, is built on the country rock.\nHistory.\nIn 1769, the antiquarian William Borlase wrote:\nOf this time we are to understand what Edward I. says (Sheringham. p. 129.) that Britain, Wales, and Cornwall, were the portion of Belinus, elder son of Dunwallo, and that that part of the Island, afterwards called England, was divided in three shares, viz. Britain, which reached from the Tweed, Westward, as far as the river Ex; Wales inclosed by the rivers Severn, and Dee; and Cornwall from the river Ex to the Land's-End.\nTourists have been visiting Land's End for over three hundred years. In 1649, an early visitor was the poet John Taylor, who was hoping to find subscribers for his new book \"Wanderings to see the Wonders of the West\". In 1878 people left Penzance by horse-drawn vehicles from outside the Queens and Union hotels and travelled via St Buryan and Treen, to see the Logan Rock. There was a short stop to look at Porthcurno and the Eastern Telegraph Company followed by refreshments at the First and Last Inn in Sennen. They then headed for Land's End, often on foot or horse, because of the uneven and muddy lanes. Over one hundred people could be at Land's End at any one time. At Carn Kez, the First and Last Inn owned a small house which looked after the horses while visitors roamed the cliffs. The house at Carn Kez developed into the present hotel. The earliest part of the house was damaged by the Luftwaffe when a plane returning from a raid on Cardiff jettisoned its remaining bombs. 53 fisherman were injured or killed. In the build-up to D-Day American troops were billeted in the hotel leaving the building in a bad state.\nLand's End was owned by a Cornish family until 1982, when it was sold to David Goldstone. In 1987, Peter de Savary outbid the National Trust to purchase Land's End for almost \u00a37 million from David Goldstone. He had two new buildings erected and much of the present theme park development was instigated by him. He sold both Land's End and John o' Groats to businessman Graham Ferguson Lacey in 1991. The current owners purchased Land's End in 1996 and formed a company named Heritage Great Britain PLC. Attractions at the theme park include children's playgrounds and recorded music. Twice a week in August, Land's End hosts 'Magic in the Skies', a night-time firework spectacular with music by British composer Christopher Bond and narrated by actress Miriam Margolyes. Within the complex is the Land's End Hotel.\nOn 6 May 1985, four schoolchildren died in what is known as the Land's End disaster.\nIn May 2012, Land's End received worldwide publicity as the starting point of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.\nEnd to end.\nLand's End is either the start or finishing point of end to end journeys with John o' Groats in Scotland. One of the earliest was by R. H. Carlisle who left Land's End on 23 September 1879, went to John O'Groats House and arrived back at Land's End on 15 December; taking 72 days (exclusive of Sundays); covering . To prove his journey, he kept a log book which was stamped at any post office he passed. An early end to end on bicycle was completed by Messrs Blackwell and Harman of Canonbury Bicycle Club. Starting at Land's End they covered in thirteen days in July/August 1880. Nearly two years later the Hon I Keith-Falconer travelled from Land's End, in twelve days, 23&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 hours, on a bicycle.\nGreeb.\nOn the south side of Carn Kez the land slopes away to a shallow valley containing a small stream and the former Greeb Farm. In 1879 a derrick was used for hauling seaweed from the beach 40 feet below for use as a soil improver.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the latter's reign, Andrewes served successively as Bishop of Chichester, of Ely, and of Winchester and oversaw the translation of the King James Version of the Bible (or Authorized Version). In the Church of England he is commemorated on 25 September with a lesser festival.\nEarly life, education and ordination.\nAndrewes was born in 1555 near All Hallows, Barking, by the Tower of London, of an ancient Suffolk family later domiciled at Chichester Hall, at Rawreth in Essex; his father, Thomas, was master of Trinity House. Andrewes attended the Cooper's free school in Ratcliff in the parish of Stepney and then the Merchant Taylors' School under Richard Mulcaster. In 1571 he entered Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, proceeding to a Master of Arts degree in 1578. His academic reputation spread so quickly that on the foundation in 1571 of Jesus College, Oxford he was named in the charter as one of the founding scholars \"without his privity\" (Isaacson, 1650); his connection with the college seems to have been purely notional, however. In 1576 he was elected fellow of Pembroke College; on 11 June 1580 he was ordained a priest by William Chaderton, Bishop of Chester, and in 1581 was incorporated Master of Arts (MA) at Oxford. As catechist at his college he read lectures on the Decalogue (published in 1630), which aroused great interest.\nOnce a year he would spend a month with his parents and, during this vacation, he would find a master from whom he would learn a language of which he had no previous knowledge. In this way, after a few years, he acquired most of the modern languages of Europe.\nAndrewes was the elder brother of the scholar and cleric Roger Andrewes, who also served as a translator for the King James Version of the Bible.\nDuring Elizabeth's reign.\nIn 1588, following a period as chaplain to Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, Lord President of the Council in the North, he became vicar of St Giles, Cripplegate, in the City of London, where he delivered striking sermons on the temptation in the wilderness and the Lord's Prayer. In a sermon (during Easter week) on 10 April 1588, he stoutly vindicated the Reformed character of the Church of England against the claims of Roman Catholicism and adduced John Calvin as a new writer, with lavish praise and affection.\nYet, Andrewes was certainly no Calvinist. It has been said that he developed a proto-Arminian soteriology while at Cambridge and that he maintained this non-Calvinist theology throughout his life. He made it a point to refuse to repeat the common Calvinist slogans of his time. During the first half of the seventeenth century, he argued that Calvinism was incompatible with civil government, preaching, and ministry. Throughout his sermons, he unashamedly criticized Calvinist doctrine and practice. He has been referred to as an avant-garde conformist, which is understood as an implicitly proto-Arminian precursor to Laudianism and explicit English-Arminianism. He outright decried the translation and Calvinistic notes in the Geneva translation of the Bible. He taught that God condemned Cain for his own freely chosen sin and he denied that God unconditionally predestined any to salvation or that he unconditionally condemned anyone. He argued for soteriological synergism, using Lot's wife as a picture that one's salvation is not secure post-conversion apart from an ongoing and freely chosen cooperation with God's saving grace. John Overall and Andrewes were more sympathetic to the Remonstrants than the Calvinists at the time of the Synod of Dort. Andrewes, out of fear, denied his support for the Remonstrants when letters sent to him from that party were intercepted. He was not on friendly terms with the delegates to the synod and he made it clear that he did not support the results. He and the Remonstrants attempted to use the ecclesiological similarities between the Contra-Remonstrants and the Puritans to persuade James I not to involve himself in the Synod of Dort or to support the Remonstrant cause if he did.\nThrough the influence of Francis Walsingham, Andrewes was appointed prebendary of St Pancras in St Paul's Cathedral, in 1589, and subsequently became master of his own college of Pembroke, as well as a chaplain to John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury. From 1589 to 1609 he was prebendary of Southwell. On 4 March 1590, as a chaplain of Elizabeth I, he preached before her an outspoken sermon and, in October that year, gave his introductory lecture at St Paul's, undertaking to comment on the first four chapters of the Book of Genesis. These were later compiled as \"The Orphan Lectures\" (1657).\nAndrewes liked to move among the people, yet found time to join a society of antiquaries, of which Walter Raleigh, Philip Sidney, Burghley, Arundel, the Herberts, Saville, John Stow and William Camden were members. Elizabeth I had not advanced him further on account of his opposition to the alienation of ecclesiastical revenues. In 1598 he declined the bishoprics of Ely and Salisbury, because of the conditions attached. On 23 November 1600, he preached at Whitehall a controversial sermon on justification. In July 1601 he was appointed Dean of Westminster and gave much attention to the school there.\nWhen plague struck in 1603 he retreated to Chiswick to teach the boys of Westminster School, where he preached a plague sermon on 21 August arguing in favour of leaving London under such circumstances. His argument rested on the Old Testament's commands to avoid exposing oneself to contagion, to avoid contact with lepers, etc. Andrewes said the plague was caused by \"inventions\" like \"new meats in diet\" and \"new fashions in apparel\" that had roused the wrath of God. He condemns changes in Christian tradition that \"our fathers never knew of\".\nDuring the reign of James I.\nOn the accession of James I, Andrewes rose into great favour. He assisted at the coronation of James I and Anne, and in 1604 took part in the Hampton Court Conference.\nAndrewes' name is the first on the list of divines appointed to compile the \"Authorized Version\" of the Bible, which was commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611. He headed the \"First Westminster Company\" which took charge of the first books of the Old Testament (Genesis to 2 Kings). He acted, furthermore, as a sort of general editor for the project as well.\nOn 31 October 1605 his election as Bishop of Chichester was confirmed; he was consecrated a bishop on 3 November, installed at Chichester Cathedral on 18 November and made Lord High Almoner (until 1619). Following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, Andrewes was asked to prepare a sermon to be presented to the king in 1606 (Sermons Preached upon the V of November, in Lancelot Andrewes, XCVI Sermons, 3rd. Edition (London, 1635) pp.\u00a0889, 890, 900\u20131008 ). In this sermon Andrewes justified the need to commemorate the deliverance and defined the nature of celebrations. This sermon became the foundation of celebrations which continue 400 years later. In 1609 he published \"Tortura Torti\", a learned work which grew out of the Gunpowder Plot controversy and was written in answer to Bellarmine's \"Matthaeus Tortus\", which attacked James I's book on the oath of allegiance. After moving to Ely (his election to that see was confirmed on 22 September), he again controverted Bellarmine in the \"Responsio ad Apologiam\".\nIn 1617 he accompanied James I to Scotland with a view to persuading the Scots that Episcopacy was preferable to Presbyterianism. He was made dean of the Chapel Royal and translated (by the confirmation of his election to that see in February 1619) to Winchester, a diocese that he administered with great success. \nFollowing his death in 1626 in Winchester Palace, the bishop's residence in Southwark, he was mourned alike by leaders in church and state, and buried in St Saviour's Church (now Southwark Cathedral, then in the Diocese of Winchester). He was buried in a small chapel at the east end. After the destruction of the Bishop's Chapel in 1830, his tomb was moved to a new position, immediately behind the high altar. His monument is by Gerard Janssen; the canopy was restored by Arthur Blomfield with colouring by Ninian Comper.\nLegacy.\nTwo generations later, Richard Crashaw caught up the universal sentiment, when in his lines \"Upon Bishop Andrewes' Picture before his Sermons\" he exclaims:\n This reverend shadow cast that setting sun,\n Whose glorious course through our horizon run,\n Left the dim face of this dull hemisphere,\n All one great eye, all drown'd in one great teare.\nAndrewes was a friend of Hugo Grotius, and one of the foremost contemporary scholars, but is chiefly remembered for his style of preaching. As a churchman he was typically Anglican, equally removed from the Puritan and the Roman positions. A good summary of his position is found in his \"First Answer to Cardinal Perron\", who had challenged James I's use of the title \"Catholic\". His position in regard to the Eucharist is naturally more mature than that of the first reformers.\nAs to the Real Presence we are agreed; our controversy is as to the mode of it. As to the mode we define nothing rashly, nor anxiously investigate, any more than in the Incarnation of Christ we ask how the human is united to the divine nature in One Person. There is a real change in the elements\u2014we allow \"ut panis iam consecratus non-sit panis quem natura formavit; sed, quem benedictio consecravit, et consecrando etiam immutavit\" [i.e., \"that the bread once consecrated is not the bread which nature has formed, but that which the blessing has consecrated and, by consecrating it, has also changed\"]. (\"Responsio\", p. 263)\nAdoration is permitted, and the use of the terms \"sacrifice\" and \"altar\" maintained as being consonant with scripture and antiquity. Christ is \"a sacrifice\u2014so, to be slain; a propitiatory sacrifice\u2014so, to be eaten.\" (\"Sermons\", vol. ii. p. 296)\nBy the same rules that the Passover was, by the same may ours be termed a sacrifice. In rigour of speech, neither of them; for to speak after the exact manner of divinity, there is but one only sacrifice, \"veri nominis\", that is Christ's death. And that sacrifice but once actually performed at His death, but ever before represented in figure, from the beginning; and ever since repeated in memory to the world's end. That only absolute, all else relative to it, representative of it, operative by it ... Hence it is that what names theirs carried, ours do the like, and the Fathers make no scruple at it\u2014no more need we.(\"Sermons,\" vol. ii. p. 300)\nAndrewes preached regularly and submissively before James I and his court on the anniversaries of the Gowrie Conspiracy and the Gunpowder Plot. These sermons were used to promulgate the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings.\nHis \"Life\" was written by Alexander Whyte (Edinburgh, 1896), M. Wood (New York, 1898), and Robert Lawrence Ottley (Boston, 1894). His services to his church have been summed up thus: (1) he has a keen sense of the proportion of the faith and maintains a clear distinction between what is fundamental, needing ecclesiastical commands, and subsidiary, needing only ecclesiastical guidance and suggestion; (2) as distinguished from the earlier protesting standpoint, e.g. of the Thirty-nine Articles, he emphasised a positive and constructive statement of the Anglican position.\nHis best-known work is the \"Preces Privatae\" or \"Private Prayers\", edited by Alexander Whyte (1896), which has widespread appeal and has remained in print since renewed interest in Andrewes developed in the 19th century. The \"Preces Privatae\" were first published by R. Drake in 1648; an improved edition by F. E. Brightman appeared in 1903. John Rutter set some of those prayers to music. Andrewes's other works occupy eight volumes in the \"Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology\" (1841\u20131854). Ninety-six of his sermons were published in 1631 by command of Charles I, have been occasionally reprinted, and are considered among the most rhetorically developed and polished sermons of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. Because of these, Andrewes was commemorated by T. S. Eliot.\nAndrewes was considered, next to James Ussher, to be the most learned churchman of his day, and enjoyed a great reputation as an eloquent and impassioned preacher, but the stiffness and artificiality of his style render his sermons unsuited to modern taste. Nevertheless, there are passages of extraordinary beauty and profundity. His doctrine was High Church, and in his life he was humble, pious and charitable. He continues to influence religious thinkers to the present day, and was cited as an influence by T. S. Eliot, among others. Eliot borrowed, almost word for word and without his usual acknowledgement, a passage from Andrewes' 1622 Christmas Day sermon for the opening of his poem \"Journey of the Magi\". In his 1997 novel \"Timequake\", Kurt Vonnegut suggested that Andrewes was \"the greatest writer in the English language\", citing as proof the first few verses of the 23rd Psalm. His translation work has also led him to appear as a character in three plays dealing with the King James Bible, Howard Brenton's \"Anne Boleyn\" (2010), Jonathan Holmes' \"Into Thy Hands\" (2011) and David Edgar's \"Written on the Heart\" (2011).\nHe has an academic cap named after him, known as the Bishop Andrewes cap, which is like a mortarboard but made of velvet, floppy and has a tump or tuff instead of a tassel. This was in fact the ancient version of the mortarboard before the top square was stiffened and the tump replaced by a tassel and button. This cap is still used by Cambridge D.D.s and at certain institutions as part of their academic dress.\nA block of flats in the https://, central London, is named https://. All the Barbican's residential buildings are named after famous people with a connection to the locale.\nThere is a stained glass window depicting Bishop Andrewes in https://, central London.\nCollected works.\nAndrewes created a significant personal library. In his will, he bequeathed approximately 400 volumes to Pembroke College (Cambridge) where they remain. \nHis collection included: \nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He reigned for thirty-eight years. Tarquinius expanded Roman power through military conquest and grand architectural constructions. His wife was the prophetess Tanaquil.\nNot much is known about the early life of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. According to Livy, Tarquin came from Etruria. Livy claims that his original Etruscan name was , but since \"lucumo\" is the latinized form of the Etruscan word \"king\", there is reason to believe that his name and title have been confused in the official tradition. After inheriting his father's entire fortune, Lucius attempted to gain a political office. However, he was prohibited from obtaining political office in Tarquinii because of the ethnicity of his father, Demaratus, who came from the Greek city of Corinth. As a result, his wife Tanaquil advised him to relocate to Rome. Legend has it that on his arrival in Rome in a chariot, an eagle took his cap, flew away and then returned it back upon his head. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, interpreted this as an omen of his future greatness. In Rome, he attained respect through his courtesy. King Ancus Marcius noticed Tarquinius and, by his will, appointed Tarquinius guardian of his own sons.\nKing of Rome.\nRise to power.\nAlthough Ancus Marcius was the grandson of Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome, the principle of hereditary monarchy was not yet established at Rome; none of the first three kings had been succeeded by their sons, and each subsequent king had been acclaimed by the people. Upon the death of Marcius, Tarquin addressed the \"Comitia Curiata\" and convinced them that he should be elected king over his predecessor's natural sons, who were still only youths, making him the first Roman king to ever actively succeed at lobbying for the throne. In one tradition, the sons were away on a hunting expedition at the time of their father's death, and were thus unable to affect the assembly's choice.\nPolitical reform.\nAccording to Livy, Tarquin increased the number of the Senate to 200 by adding one hundred men from the leading minor families, and were accordingly called the \"patres minorum gentium\". Among these was the family of the Octavii, from whom the first emperor, Augustus, was descended. He did so with the hope that those added to the Senate would be grateful for their position and thus loyal to him, strengthening his rule as king.\nMilitary conquest.\nLucius Tarquinius Priscus is accredited with expanding Rome's borders. He did so through conquest of the surrounding tribes. Those tribes were the Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans.\nWar with the Latins.\nTarquin's first war was waged against the Latins. Tarquinius took the Latin town of Apiolae by storm and took great booty from there back to Rome. According to the \"Fasti Triumphales\", this war must have occurred prior to 588 BC. The Latins claimed that peace treaties developed by Romulus and the other Roman kings no longer applied and as such, launched the first set of attacks. Seeing the opportunity to incorporate the Latins into Rome's ranks, Tarquin quickly responded by conquering multiple Latin cities. As a result, the Latins requested help from the Sabines and Etruscans. Choosing not to split up his military power, Tarquin chose to keep the attack on the Latins, leading to a Roman victory.\nWar with the Sabines.\nAfter conquering the Latins Tarquin began his assault on the Sabines. Having their basecamp at the corner of two rivers, the Sabines were able to move their troops quickly and efficiently. Using his military cunning Tarquin chose to launch a surprise attack on the base at night. He did this by setting a fleet of small boats aflame and then sending them down the river to set the Sabine camp on fire. While the Sabines were focused on dousing the flames, Tarquin and his troops moved in to dismantle the camp.\nLater, his military ability was then tested by an attack from the Sabines. Tarquin doubled the numbers of equites to help the war effort. The Sabines were defeated after difficult street fighting in the city of Rome. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquin received the town of Collatia, and appointed his nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, better known as \"Egerius\", as commander of the garrison there. Tarquin returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph on September 13, 585 BC.\nSubsequently, the Latin cities of Corniculum, old Ficulea, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum were subdued and became Roman.\nWar with the Etruscans.\nTarquin also wished to seek peace with the Etruscans, but they refused. Since Tarquin had kept the captured Etruscan auxiliaries prisoners for meddling in the war with the Sabines, the five Etruscan cities who had taken part declared war on Rome. Seven other Etruscan cities joined forces with them. The Etruscans soon captured the Roman colony at Fidenae, which thereupon became the focal point of the war. After several bloody battles, Tarquin was once again victorious, and he subjugated the Etruscan cities who had taken part in the war. At the successful conclusion of each of his wars, Rome was enriched by Tarquin's plunder.\nConstruction.\nTarquin is said to have built the Circus Maximus, the first and largest stadium at Rome, for chariot racing. The Circus Maximus started out as an underwhelming piece of land, but was built into a grand and beautiful stadium. Raised seating was erected privately by the senators and equites, and other areas were marked out for private citizens. There the king established a series of annual games; according to Livy, the first horses and boxers to participate were brought from Etruria. It received the name Circus Maximus as a way to set it apart from the other stadiums built at this time in a similar fashion.\nAfter a great flood, Tarquin drained the damp lowlands of Rome by constructing the Cloaca Maxima, Rome's great sewer. The arch was constructed in 578 BC and took inspiration from Etruscan structures of the earlier period. He also constructed a stone wall around the city, and began the construction of a temple in honour of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill. The latter is said to have been funded in part by the plunder seized from the Sabines.\nShows of triumph.\nTarquinius was the first Roman ruler to ever celebrate a Roman triumph. According to Florus, Tarquin celebrated his triumphs in the Etruscan fashion, riding a golden chariot drawn by four horses, while wearing a gold-embroidered toga and the tunica palmata, a tunic upon which palm-leaves were embroidered. He also introduced other Etruscan insignia of civilian authority and military distinction: the sceptre of the king; the trabea, a purple garment that varied in form, but was perhaps most often used as a mantle; the fasces carried by the lictors; the curule chair; the toga praetexta, later worn by various magistrates and officials; the rings worn by senators; the paludamentum, a cloak associated with military command; and the phalera, a disc of metal worn on a soldier's breastplate during parades, or displayed on the standards of various military units. Strabo reports that Tarquin introduced Etruscan sacrificial and divinatory rites, as well as the tuba, a straight horn used chiefly for military purposes. As a result, most classical Roman symbols for war harken back to his time as king.\nDeath and succession.\nTarquin is said to have reigned for thirty-eight years. According to legend, the sons of his predecessor, Ancus Marcius, believed that the throne should have been theirs. They arranged the king's assassination, disguised as a riot, during which Tarquin received a fatal blow to the head by an ax. However, the queen, Tanaquil, gave out that the king was merely wounded, and took advantage of the confusion to establish Servius Tullius as regent; when the death of Tarquin was confirmed, Tullius became king, in place of Tarquin's sons, or those of Ancus Marcius.\nTullius, said to have been the son of Servius Tullius, a prince of Corniculum who had fallen in battle against Tarquin, was brought to the palace as a child with his mother, Ocreisia. According to legend, Tanaquil discovered his potential for greatness by means of various omens, and therefore preferred him to her own sons. Tullius married Tarquinia, one of the daughters of Priscus, thus providing a vital link between the families. His own daughters were subsequently married to Tarquin's sons (or, in some traditions, grandsons), Lucius and Arruns.\nMost ancient writers regarded Tarquin as the father of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, but some stated that the younger Tarquin was his grandson. As the younger Tarquin died about 496 BC, more than eighty years after Tarquinius Priscus, the chronology seems to support the latter tradition. An Etruscan legend related by the emperor Claudius equates Servius Tullius with \"Macstarna\" (apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin \"magister\"), a companion of the Etruscan heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna, who helped free the brothers from captivity, slaying their captors, including a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius. This episode is depicted in a fresco at the tomb of the Etruscan Saties family at Vulci, now known as the Fran\u00e7ois Tomb. This tradition suggests that perhaps the sons of the elder Tarquin attempted to seize power, but were defeated by the regent, Servius Tullius, and his companions; Tullius would then have attempted to end the dynastic struggle by marrying his daughters to the grandsons of Tarquinius Priscus. However, this plan ultimately failed, as Tullius was himself assassinated at the instigation of his son-in-law, who succeeded him.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18047", "revid": "50976975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18047", "title": "Lucius Tarquinius Superbus", "text": "Seventh and last King of Rome\nLucius Tarquinius Superbus (died 495\u00a0BC) was the legendary seventh and final king of Rome, reigning 25 years until the popular uprising that led to the establishment of the Roman Republic. He is commonly known as Tarquin the Proud, from his cognomen \"Superbus\" (Latin for \"proud, arrogant, lofty\").\nAncient accounts of the regal period mingle history and legend. Tarquin was said to have been either the son or grandson of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth king of Rome, and to have gained the throne through the murders of both his wife and his elder brother, followed by the assassination of his predecessor, Servius Tullius. His reign has been described as a tyranny that justified the abolition of the monarchy.\nBackground.\nThe most ancient sources, such as that of Quintus Fabius Pictor, assert Tarquin was the son of Tarquinius Priscus, but modern historians believe that to be impossible under the traditional chronology, indicating either he was Priscus' grandson or that the traditional chronology itself is unsound.\nHis mother supposedly was Tanaquil. Tanaquil had engineered her husband's succession to the Roman kingdom on the death of Ancus Marcius. When the sons of Marcius subsequently arranged the elder Tarquin's assassination in 579\u00a0BC, Tanaquil placed Servius Tullius on the throne, in preference to her own sons or grandsons.\nAccording to an Etruscan tradition, the hero Macstarna, usually equated with Servius Tullius, defeated and killed a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius, and rescued the brothers Caelius and Aulus Vibenna from captivity. This may recollect an otherwise forgotten attempt by the sons of Tarquin the Elder to reclaim the throne.\nTo forestall further dynastic strife, Servius married his daughters, known to history as Tullia Major and Tullia Minor, to Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the future king, and his brother Arruns. One of Tarquin's sisters, Tarquinia, married Marcus Junius Brutus, and was the mother of Lucius Junius Brutus, one of the men who would later lead the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom.\nThe elder sister, Tullia Major, was of mild disposition, yet married the ambitious Tarquin. Her younger sister, Tullia Minor, was of fiercer temperament, but her husband Arruns was not. She came to despise him, and conspired with Tarquin to bring about the deaths of Tullia Major and Arruns. After the murder of their spouses, Tarquin and Tullia were married. They had three sons: Titus, Arruns, and Sextus, and a daughter, Tarquinia, who married Octavius Mamilius, the prince of Tusculum.\nOverthrow of Servius Tullius.\nTullia encouraged her husband to advance his own position, ultimately persuading him to usurp her father, King Servius. Tarquin solicited the support of the patrician senators, especially those from houses that had been raised to senatorial rank under Tarquin the Elder. He bestowed presents upon them, and spread criticism of Servius the king.\nIn time, Tarquin felt ready to seize the throne. He went to the senate house with a group of armed men, seated himself on the throne, and summoned the senators to attend upon him. He then spoke to the senators, denigrating Servius as a slave born of a slave; for failing to be elected by the senate and the people during an interregnum, as had been the tradition for the election of kings of Rome; for having become king through the machinations of a woman; for favouring the lower classes of Rome over the wealthy, and for taking the land of the upper classes for distribution to the poor; and for instituting the census so that the wealth of the upper classes might be exposed in order to excite popular envy.\nWhen word of this brazen deed reached Servius, he hurried to the curia to confront Tarquin, who levelled the same accusations against his father-in-law, and then in his youth and vigour carried the king outside and flung him down the steps of the senate house and into the street. The king's retainers fled, and as he made his way towards the palace, the aged Servius was set upon and murdered by Tarquin's assassins, perhaps on the advice of his own daughter.\nTullia drove in her chariot to the senate house, where she was the first to hail her husband as king. But Tarquin bade her return home, concerned that the crowd might do her violence. As she drove toward the Urbian Hill, her driver stopped suddenly, horrified at the sight of the king's body lying in the street. But in a frenzy, Tullia herself seized the reins, and drove the wheels of her chariot over her father's corpse. The king's blood spattered against the chariot and stained Tullia's clothes, so that she brought a gruesome relic of the murder back to her house. The street where Tullia disgraced the dead king afterwards became known as the \"Vicus Sceleratus,\" the Street of Crime.\nReign.\nTarquin commenced his reign by refusing to bury the dead Servius, and then putting to death several leading senators, whom he suspected of remaining loyal to Servius. By not replacing the slain senators, and not consulting the senate on matters of government, he diminished both the size and the authority of the senate. In another break with tradition, Tarquin judged capital crimes without the advice of counsellors, causing fear amongst those who might think to oppose him. He made a powerful ally when he betrothed his daughter to Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, among the most eminent of the Latin chiefs.\nEarly in his reign, Tarquin called a meeting of the Latin leaders to discuss the bonds between Rome and the Latin towns. The meeting was held at a grove sacred to the goddess Ferentina. At the meeting, Turnus Herdonius inveighed against Tarquin's arrogance, and warned his countrymen against trusting the Roman king. Tarquin then bribed Turnus' servant to store a large number of swords in his master's lodging. Tarquin called together the Latin leaders, and accused Turnus of plotting his assassination. The Latin leaders accompanied Tarquin to Turnus' lodging and, the swords then being discovered, the Latin's guilt was then speedily inferred. Turnus was condemned to be thrown into a pool of water in the grove with a wooden frame, or \"cratis\", placed over his head, into which stones were thrown, drowning him. The meeting of the Latin chiefs then continued, and Tarquin persuaded them to renew their treaty with Rome, becoming her allies rather than her enemies. It was agreed that the soldiers of the Latins would attend at the grove on an appointed day, and form a united military force with the Roman army.\nNext, Tarquin instigated a war against the Volsci, taking the wealthy town of Suessa Pometia. He celebrated a triumph, and with the spoils of this conquest, he commenced the erection of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, which Tarquin the Elder had vowed. He then engaged in a war with Gabii, one of the Latin cities that had rejected the treaty with Rome. Unable to take the city by force of arms, Tarquin resorted to another stratagem. His son, Sextus, pretending to be ill-treated by his father, and covered with the bloody marks of stripes, fled to Gabii. The infatuated inhabitants entrusted him with the command of their troops, and when he had obtained the unlimited confidence of the citizens, he sent a messenger to his father to inquire how he should deliver the city into his hands. The king, who was walking in his garden when the messenger arrived, made no reply but kept striking off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick. Sextus took the hint, and put to death, or banished on false charges, all the leading men of Gabii, after which he had no difficulty in compelling the city to submit.\nTarquin agreed upon a peace with the Aequi, and renewed the treaty of peace between Rome and the Etruscans. According to the Fasti Triumphales, he won a victory over the Sabines, and established Roman colonies at the towns of Signia and Circeii.\nAt Rome, Tarquin levelled the top of the Tarpeian Rock, overlooking the Forum, and removed a number of ancient Sabine shrines to make way for the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill. He constructed tiers of seats in the circus, and ordered the excavation of Rome's great sewer, the \"cloaca maxima\".\nAccording to one story, Tarquin was approached by the Cumaean Sibyl, who offered him nine books of prophecy at an exorbitant price. Tarquin abruptly refused, and the Sibyl proceeded to burn three of the nine. She then offered him the remaining books, but at the same price. He hesitated, but refused again. The Sibyl then burned three more books before offering him the three remaining books at the original price. At last, Tarquin accepted, in this way obtaining the Sibylline Books.\nOverthrow and exile.\nIn 509 BC, having angered the Roman populace through the pace and burden of constant building, Tarquin embarked on a campaign against the Rutuli. At that time, the Rutuli were a very wealthy nation, and Tarquin was keen to obtain the spoils that would come with victory, in hopes of assuaging the ire of his subjects. Failing to take their capital of Ardea by storm, the king determined to take the city by siege instead.\nWith little prospect of battle, the young noblemen in the king's army fell to drinking and boasting. When the subject turned to the virtue of their wives, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus claimed to have the most dedicated of spouses. With his companions, they secretly visited each other's homes, and discovered all of the wives enjoying themselves, except for Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, who was engaged in domestic activities. Lucretia received the princes graciously, and together her beauty and virtue kindled the flame of desire in Collatinus' cousin, Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son.\nAfter a few days, Sextus returned to Collatia, where he implored Lucretia to give herself to him. When she refused, he threatened that if she did not yield herself to him, he would kill her, and claim that he had discovered her in the act of adultery with a slave, for which reason he had slain the unfaithful Lucretia, delivering the punishment as her husband's kinsman.\nTo spare her husband the shame threatened by Sextus, Lucretia submitted to his desire. But when he had departed for the camp, Lucretia sent for her husband and father, revealing the whole matter, and accusing Sextus of raping her. Despite the pleas of her family, Lucretia stabbed herself to spare Collatinus any suspicion that she had betrayed him. Her grieving husband, together with his father-in-law, Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, and his companions, Lucius Junius Brutus and Publius Valerius, swore an oath to expel the king and his family from Rome.\nAs Tribune of the Celeres, Brutus was head of the king's personal bodyguard, and entitled to summon the Roman comitia. This he did, and by recounting the various grievances of the people, the king's abuses of power, and by inflaming public sentiment with the tale of the rape of Lucretia, Brutus persuaded the comitia to revoke the king's imperium and send him into exile. Tullia fled the city in fear of the mob, while Sextus Tarquinius, his deed revealed, fled to Gabii, where he hoped for the protection of the Roman garrison. However, his previous conduct there had made him many enemies, and he was soon assassinated. In place of the king, the \"comitia centuriata\" resolved to elect two consuls to hold power jointly. Lucretius, the prefect of the city, presided over the election of the first consuls, Brutus and Collatinus.\nWhen word of the uprising reached the king, Tarquin abandoned Ardea and sought support from his allies in Etruria. The cities of Veii and Tarquinii sent contingents to join the king's army, and he prepared to march upon Rome. Meanwhile, Brutus prepared a force to meet the returning army. In a surprising reversal, Brutus demanded that his colleague Collatinus resign the consulship and go into exile because he bore the hated name of Tarquinius. Stunned by this betrayal, Collatinus complied, and his father-in-law was chosen to succeed him.\nMeanwhile, the king sent ambassadors to the senate, ostensibly to request the return of his personal property, but in reality to subvert a number of Rome's leading men. When this plot was discovered, those found guilty were put to death by the consuls. Brutus was forced to condemn his two sons Titus and Tiberius to death because they had taken part in the conspiracy. Leaving Lucretius in charge of the city, Brutus departed to meet the king on the field of battle. At the Battle of Silva Arsia, the Romans won a hard-fought victory over the king and his Etruscan allies. Each side sustained painful losses; the consul Brutus and his cousin, Arruns Tarquinius, fell in battle against each other.\nAfter this failure, Tarquin turned to Lars Porsena, the king of Clusium. Porsena's march on Rome and the valiant defence of the Romans achieved legendary status, giving rise to the story of Horatius at the bridge, and the bravery of Gaius Mucius Scaevola. Accounts vary as to whether Porsena finally entered Rome, or was thwarted, but modern scholarship suggests that he was able to occupy the city briefly before withdrawing. Ultimately, his efforts were of no avail to the exiled Roman king.\nTarquin's final attempt to regain the Roman kingdom came in 499 or 496 BC, when he persuaded his son-in-law, Octavius Mamilius, dictator of Tusculum, to march on Rome at the head of a Latin army. The Roman army was led by the dictator Aulus Postumius Albus and his Master of the Horse, Titus Aebutius Elva, while the elderly king and his last remaining son, Titus Tarquinius, accompanied by a force of Roman exiles, fought alongside the Latins. Once more the battle was hard-fought and narrowly decided, with both sides suffering great losses. Mamilius was slain, the master of the horse grievously injured, and Titus Tarquinius barely escaped with his life. But in the end, the Latins abandoned the field, and Rome retained her independence.\nAfter the Latin defeat and the death of his son-in-law, Tarquin went to the court of Aristodemus at Cumae, where he died in 495.\nModern representations.\nWilliam Shakespeare describes the events leading to Tarquin's downfall in his long poem \"The Rape of Lucrece\". He also alludes to Tarquin in his plays, \"Titus Andronicus\", \"Julius Caesar\", \"Coriolanus\", \"Macbeth\", and \"Cymbeline\".\nIn 1765, Patrick Henry gave a speech before the Virginia House of Burgesses in opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765. Toward the end of his speech, he inserted as a rhetorical flourish a comparison between King George III and various historical figures who were brought low by their enemies, including Charles I, Caesar, and, in some accounts, Tarquin.\nThe cultural phenomenon known as \"tall poppy syndrome,\" in which persons of unusual merit are attacked or resented because of their achievements, derives its name from the episode in Livy in which Tarquin is said to have instructed his son Sextus to weaken the city of Gabii by destroying its leading men. The motif of using an unwitting messenger to deliver such a message through the metaphor of cutting the heads off the tallest poppies may have been borrowed from Herodotus, whose \"Histories\" contain a similar story involving ears of wheat instead of poppies. A passage concerning Livy's version of the story appears in Kierkegaard's \"Fear and Trembling\".\nBenjamin Britten employed the character in his 1946 chamber opera \"The Rape of Lucretia\".\nTarquin also appears in the fourth book of \"The Trials of Apollo\" series by Rick Riordan. He is depicted as a zombie king who attacks the demigods for trying to rewrite the Sibylline Books.\nTarquin Superbus is a character in Claire-Louis Bennet's novel \"Checkout-19\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18048", "revid": "43320205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18048", "title": "Libertarian socialism", "text": "Political philosophy\nLibertarian socialism is an anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist political current that emphasises self-governance and workers' self-management. It is contrasted from other forms of socialism by its rejection of state ownership and from other forms of libertarianism by its rejection of private property. Broadly defined, it includes schools of both anarchism and Marxism, as well as other tendencies that oppose the state and capitalism.\nWith its roots in the Age of Enlightenment, libertarian socialism was first constituted as a tendency by the anti-authoritarian faction of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA), during their conflict with the Marxist faction. Libertarian socialism quickly spread throughout Europe and the American continent, reaching its height during the early stages of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and particularly during the Spanish Revolution of 1936. Its defeat during these revolutions led to its brief decline, before its principles were resurrected by the New Left and new social movements of the late 20th century.\nWhile its key principles of decentralisation, workers' control, and mutual aid are generally shared across the many schools of libertarian socialism, differences have emerged over the questions of revolutionary spontaneity, reformism, and whether to prioritise the abolition of the state or of capitalism.\nPolitical principles.\nLibertarian socialism strives for a free and equal society, aiming to transform work and everyday life. Broadly defined, libertarian socialism encapsulates any political ideology that favours workers' control of the means of production and the replacement of capitalism with a system of cooperative economics, or common ownership. Libertarian socialists tend to see the working class as agents of social revolution, reject representative democracy and electoralism, and advocate for self-organisation and direct action as means to engage in class conflict.\nAnti-authoritarianism.\nLibertarian socialism has a grassroots and direct democratic approach to socialism, rejecting parliamentarism and bureaucracy. Libertarian socialists advocate the empowerment of individuals to control their own lives and encourage them to voluntarily cooperate with each other, rather than allow themselves to be controlled by a state. Libertarian socialists therefore uphold civil liberties such as freedom of choice, freedom of expression and freedom of thought.\nIn contrast to authoritarian forms of socialism, libertarian socialism rejects state ownership and centralisation. Instead it upholds a decentralised model of self-governance, envisioning free association based on co-operative or participatory economics. Some libertarian socialists see such systems as complementary to statism, while others hold them to be an alternative to the state.\nLibertarian socialists tend to reject the view that political institutions such as the state represent an inherently good, or even neutral, power. Some libertarian socialists, such as Peter Kropotkin, consider the state to be an inherent instrument of landlordism and capitalism, therefore opposing the state with equal intensity as they oppose capitalism.\nAnti-capitalism.\nLibertarian socialism views corporate power as an institutional problem, rather than as a result of the influence of certain immoral individuals. It thus opposes capitalism, which it sees as an economic system that upholds greed, the exploitation of labour and coercion, and calls for its overthrow in a social revolution.\nLibertarian socialists reject private property, as they consider capitalist property relations to be incompatible with freedom. Instead, libertarian socialism upholds individual self-ownership, as well as the collective ownership of the means of production. In the place of capitalism, libertarian socialists favour an economic system based on workers' control of production, advocating for a system of cooperative economics, or common ownership. They also advocate for workers' self-management, as they consider workers able to cooperate productively without supervisors, whether appointed by employers or by the state.\nThey also tend to see free trade as inevitably resulting in the redistribution of income and wealth from workers to their corporate employers. They advocate for the elimination of social and economic inequality through the coercive expropriation of property from the wealthy.\nHistory.\nThe roots of libertarian socialism extend back to the classical radicalism of the early modern period, claiming the English Levellers and the French Encyclop\u00e9distes as their intellectual forerunners, and admiring figures of the Age of Enlightenment such as Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine. According to Mikhail Bakunin and Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, while authoritarian socialism had its origins in Germany, libertarian socialism was born in France. The modern foundations of libertarian socialism lay in the utopian socialism expounded by Charles Fourier, Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon, who envisioned a democratic socialism guided by communitarianism, moralism and feminism.\nEmergence.\nLibertarian socialism first emerged from the anti-authoritarian faction of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA), after it was expelled from the organisation by the Marxist faction at the Hague Congress of 1872. The libertarian socialist Mikhail Bakunin had rejected Karl Marx's calls for a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", as he predicted it would only create a new ruling class, composed of a privileged minority, which would use the state to oppress the working classes. He concluded that: \"no dictatorship can have any other aim than to perpetuate itself, and it can only give rise to and instill slavery in the people that tolerates it.\" Marxists responded to this by insisting on the eventual \"withering away of the state\", in which society would transition from dictatorship to anarchy, in an apparent attempt to synthesise authoritarian and libertarian forms of socialism.\nThis put libertarian socialists into direct competition with social democrats and communists for influence over left-wing politics, in a contest which lasted for over fifty years. Libertarian socialism proved attractive to British writers such as Edward Carpenter, Oscar Wilde, and William Morris, the latter of whom developed a kind of libertarian socialism based in a strong critique of civilisation, which he aimed to overthrow and replace with what he called a \"beautiful society\". Morris drove the development of impossibilism, which became increasingly concerned with the bureaucratisation and moderation of the socialist movement, leading to the establishment of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.\nBy the early 20th century, libertarian socialists had gained a leading influence over the left-wing in the Netherlands, France and Italy and went on to play major roles in the Mexican and Russian Revolutions. In India, the libertarian socialist tradition was represented in the early twentieth century anti-colonial movement by Bhagat Singh.\nRussian Revolution.\nRussian libertarian socialists, including anarchists, populists and left socialist-revolutionaries, led the opposition to the Tsarist autocracy throughout the late-19th century. They created a network of both clandestine and legal organisations throughout Russia, with the aim of overthrowing the Russian nobility and bringing land under the common ownership of the mir. Their agitation for land reform in the Russian countryside culminated with the establishment of rural soviets during the 1905 Revolution.\nAnarchists also organised among the urban proletariat, forming clandestine factory committees that proved more attractive to revolution-minded workers than the more reformist trade unions favoured by the Bolsheviks. During the 1917 Revolution, in which libertarian socialists played a leading role, the Bolsheviks changed tack and adopted elements of the libertarian socialist programme in their appeals to the workers. But by 1919, the new Bolshevik government had come to view the libertarian socialists as a threat to their power and moved to eliminate their influence. Libertarian socialist organisations were banned and many of their members were arrested, deported to Siberia or executed by the Cheka.\nThe Revolutions of 1917\u20131923 ended in defeat for the libertarian socialists, with either the social democrats, the Bolsheviks or nationalists rising to power. Libertarian socialists responded by reevaluating their positions, emphasising mass organisation over intellectual vanguardism and revolutionary spontaneity over substitutionism. They also came to conceive the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" as a form of class power, rather than as the dictatorship of a political party. Many Marxists of the period were attracted to this position, including Rosa Luxemburg in Germany, Antonie Pannekoek in the Netherlands, Sylvia Pankhurst in Britain, Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs in Hungary and Antonio Gramsci in Italy.\nSpanish Revolution.\nLibertarian socialism reached its apex of popularity with the Spanish Revolution of 1936, during which libertarian socialists led \"the largest and most successful revolution against capitalism to ever take place in any industrial economy\".\nIn Spain, traditional forms of self-management and common ownership dated back to the 15th century. The Levante, where collective self-management of irrigation was commonplace, became the hotbed of anarchist collectivisation. Building on this traditional collectivism, from 1876, the Spanish libertarian socialist movement grew through sustained agitation and the establishment of alternative institutions that culminated in the Spanish Revolution. During this period, a series of workers' congresses, first convoked by the Spanish Regional Federation of the IWA, debated and refined proposals for the construction of a libertarian socialist society. Over several decades, resolutions from these congresses formed the basis of a specific program on a range of issues, from the structure of communes and the post-revolutionary economy to libertarian cultural and artistic initiatives. These proposals were published in the pages of widely distributed libertarian socialist periodicals, such as \"Solidaridad Obrera\" and \"Tierra y Libertad\", which each circulated tens of thousands of copies. By the outbreak of the revolution, the anarcho-syndicalist Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) enjoyed widespread popularity, counting 1.5 million members within its ranks.\nDuring the revolution, the means of production were brought under workers' control and worker cooperatives formed the basis for the new economy. According to Gaston Leval, the CNT established an agrarian federation in the Levante that encompassed 78% of Spain's most arable land. The regional federation was populated by 1,650,000 people, 40% of whom lived on the region's 900 agrarian collectives, which were self-organised by peasant unions.\nAlthough industrial and agricultural production was at its highest in the anarchist-controlled areas of the Spanish Republic, and the anarchist militias displayed the strongest military discipline, liberals and communists alike blamed the \"sectarian\" libertarian socialists for the defeat of the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. These charges have been disputed by contemporary libertarian socialists, such as Robin Hahnel and Noam Chomsky, who have accused such claims of lacking substantial evidence.\nDecline.\nFollowing the defeat of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, libertarian socialism fell into decline. Left-wing politics throughout the world came to be dominated either by social democracy or Marxism-Leninism, which attained power in a number of countries and thus had the means to support their ideological allies. In contrast, Hahnel argues, libertarian socialists were not able to gain influence within the labour movement. At a time when reformist trade unions were consistently winning concessions, the libertarian socialists' anti-reformist message gained little traction. Their platform of workers' self-management also failed to appeal to industrial workers. Until the 1960s, libertarian socialists were limited mostly to making critiques of authoritarian socialism and capitalism, although Hahnel asserts that these arguments were largely overshadowed by those from neoconservatives and Marxists respectively.\nNew Left.\nLibertarian socialist themes received a revival during the 1960s, when it was reconstituted as part of the nascent New Left. This revival occurred largely unconsciously, as new leftists were often unaware of their libertarian socialist predecessors. The concepts of grassroots democracy, workers' control, solidarity and autonomy were thus reinvented by the new generation. They also picked up the principles of decentralisation, participatory democracy and mutual aid. These libertarian socialist themes drove the growth of the New Left, which by this point was disillusioned by the mainstream social democratic and Marxist-Leninist political groupings, due to the capitalistic tendencies of the former and the rigid authoritarianism of the latter.\nSociologist C. Wright Mills, who displayed strong libertarian socialist tendencies in his appeals to the New Left, reformulated Marxism for the modern age in his work on \"The Power Elite\" (1956). Wilhelm Reich's Freudo-Marxist theses on the authoritarian personality were also rediscovered by the New Left, who developed his programme for individual self-governance into a libertarian system of education used by the Summerhill School. Drawing on the Freudo-Marxist conception of civilisation as \"organised domination\", Herbert Marcuse developed a critique of alienation in modern Western societies, concluding that creativity and political dissent had been undermined by social repression. Meanwhile, Lewis Mumford published denunciations of the military-industrial complex and Paul Goodman advocated for decentralisation. In the process, the new generation of Marxists gravitated towards libertarian tendencies, sometimes closely resembling anarchism. Following on from Marcuse, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, E. P. Thompson, Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall all adopted forms of \"libertarian Marxism\", opposed to the bureaucracy and parliamentarism of statist tendencies.\nA specific and explicit libertarian socialist tendency also began to emerge. While some more libertarian Marxists adopted the term in order to distinguish themselves from authoritarian socialists, anarchists began calling themselves \"libertarian socialist\" in order to avoid the negative connotations associated with anarchism. The libertarian socialist Daniel Gu\u00e9rin specifically attempted to synthesise anarchism and Marxism into a single tendency, which inspired the growth of the French libertarian communist movement. For a time, even the American anarcho-capitalist theorist Murray Rothbard attempted to make common cause with libertarian socialists, but later shifted away from socialism and towards right-wing populism.\nMany libertarian socialists of this period were particularly influenced by the analysis of Cornelius Castoriadis and his group Socialisme ou Barbarie. This new generation included the non-vanguardist Marxist organisation Facing Reality, the British libertarian socialist group Solidarity, and the Australian councilists of the Self-Management Group. Some of this new generation of libertarian socialists also joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), swelling the old union's numbers, organising agricultural workers and launching a new journal, \"The Rebel Worker\". This libertarian socialist milieu, with their criticisms of democratic centralism and trade unionism, and their advocacy of workers' self-management and council democracy, went on to inspire the French situationists and Italian autonomists.\nOf the figures in the New Left, the American linguist Noam Chomsky became the most prominent spokesperson for libertarian socialism. Inspired by the humanism of Bertrand Russell, the individualism of Wilhelm von Humboldt and the syndicalism of Rudolf Rocker, Chomsky championed a libertarian socialism that upheld individual liberty and self-ownership. Chomsky has been outspoken advocate of anti-authoritarianism, opposing limits on individual freedoms by the state. He has also focused much of his libertarian socialist critique on mass media in the United States, due to its role in the military-industrial complex.\nWhile most sections of the New Left expressed a form of libertarian socialism, others were instead being inspired by the Cuban and Chinese Communist Revolutions to embrace forms of authoritarian socialism such as Maoism\u2013Third Worldism. As such, according to Hahnel, the New Left failed to form a coherent ideological program or establish lasting support to carry forward the momentum of the late 1960s, resulting in many dropping out of activism altogether.\nNew social movements.\nA minority from the New Left continued their radical activism within the new social movements of the 1970s and 1980s, becoming involved in second-wave feminism, the gay liberation movement, environmental movement and eventually the anti-globalization movement. In this period, many libertarian socialists, such as Murray Bookchin, Cornelius Castoriadis, Andr\u00e9 Gorz, Ivan Illich, E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams, were committed to \" in rethinking what socialism might come to mean in an age of ecological limit\".\nAccording to Robin Hahnel, new social movements continued the New Left's tendency of failing to develop a \"comprehensive libertarian socialist theory and practice\". Libertarian socialist activism became focused on achieving practical reforms and theoretical developments centred around common \"core values\" such as economic democracy, economic justice and sustainable development, without building a coherent critique of capitalism. Activists from the 1970s and 1980s influenced by libertarian socialism did not advance coherent alternatives to markets and central planning, and had no reformist campaign. Eventually, Hahnel argues, they turned to traditional single-issue campaigns and abandoned their \"big picture\" libertarian socialist approach.\nThese movements were somewhat successful in achieving their goals: the movements for gay and women's rights changed societal outlook on gender oppression; the anti-racist movement proved it necessary to tackle the social aspects of racialisation; the anti-imperialist movement reconceived of anti-imperialism outside of economic terms; and the environmentalist movement launched a wave of ecological defense and restoration. Together, Hahnel argues, they broke from the class reductionism prevalent in traditional forms of libertarian socialism, proving intersectional oppressions other than class also demanded attention. Through the new social movements, libertarian socialism developed an awareness of different aspects of oppression, beyond class analysis.\nContemporary era.\nLibertarian socialism again received a revival of interest in the wake of the fall of communism and concurrent rise of neoliberalism. It proved particularly attractive to people from the former Eastern Bloc, who saw it as an alternative both to western capitalism and Marxism-Leninism. Since the end of the Cold War, there have been two major experiments in libertarian socialism: the Zapatista uprising in Mexico and the Rojava Revolution in Syria.\nIn reaction against the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the privatisation of indigenous lands by the Mexican state, in 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) rose up against the government, enabling the formation of a self-governing autonomous territory in the Mexican state of Chiapas. The Zapatistas have roundly rejected political sectarianism and ideological doctrine, including the state socialist model of seizing state power, with spokesman Subcomandante Marcos famously declaring \"I shit on all the revolutionary vanguards of this planet.\" As such, they have commonly been characterised as libertarian socialist, or inspired by libertarian socialism. They have in turn become a source of inspiration for libertarian socialists, including the autonomist Marxists Harry Cleaver and John Holloway, as well as some anarchists.\nIn 2012, the Rojava Revolution established the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES; or \"Rojava\") to put \"libertarian socialist ideas ... into practice\", and whose cantons present themselves as a \"libertarian socialist alternative to the colonially established state boundaries in the Middle East.\" Various sources have drawn parallels between the Rojava Revolution and the Zapatista uprising of 1994 or the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and noted the influence of libertarian socialist Murray Bookchin, specifically his concept of libertarian municipalism, on the revolution.\nLibertarian socialist ideas have influenced some currents of the anti-austerity and new municipalist movements, such as Ada Colau's Barcelona en Com\u00fa party, in which they ally with democratic socialists.\nIn Chile, there have been several libertarian socialist movements active since the 2010s in groups including Libertarian Left and the Broad Front (FA). Gabriel Boric founded Social Convergence in 2018, bringing together the Autonomist Movement, Libertarian Left and other libertarian socialist groups. Boric, who describes himself as libertarian socialist, was elected president in 2021.\nNotable tendencies.\nLibertarian socialism encompasses both the libertarian wing of socialism and the socialist wing of libertarianism, including many different schools of thought under its banner. The most commonly cited tendencies of libertarian socialism are anarchist communism, anarcho-syndicalism, and council communism. Other Marxist strands of libertarian socialism include Western Marxism, Bordigism and impossibilism. Additionally, utopian socialism, guild socialism, socialist feminism and social ecology, as well as various strands of the New Left, new social movements and contemporary anarchism, have been listed among the other wings of libertarian socialism.\nAnarchist.\nThe currents of classical anarchism that developed in the 19th century were committed to autonomy and freedom, decentralization, opposing hierarchy, and opposing the vanguardism of authoritarian socialism.\nIn the 20th century, social anarchism emerged as a significant current of anarchism and explicitly identified as libertarian socialist. Anarcho-syndicalist Gaston Leval explained: \"We therefore foresee a Society in which all activities will be coordinated, a structure that has, at the same time, sufficient flexibility to permit the greatest possible autonomy for social life, or for the life of each enterprise, and enough cohesiveness to prevent all disorder. [...] In a well-organised society, all of these things must be systematically accomplished by means of parallel federations, vertically united at the highest levels, constituting one vast organism in which all economic functions will be performed in solidarity with all others and that will permanently preserve the necessary cohesion\".\nSignificant thinkers in the anarchist tradition who are described as libertarian socialist include Colin Ward and David Graeber.\nMarxist.\nA broad scope of economic and political philosophies that draw on the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism have been described as \"libertarian Marxism\", a tendency which emphasises autonomy, federalism and direct democracy. Wayne Price identified it most closely with the tendency of autonomist Marxism and identified libertarian characteristics within council communism, the Johnson\u2013Forest Tendency, the Socialisme ou Barbarie group and the Situationist International, contrasting them with orthodox Marxism, social democracy, and Marxism\u2013Leninism. Michael L\u00f6wy and Olivier Besancenot have identified Rosa Luxemburg, Walter Benjamin, Andr\u00e9 Breton and Daniel Gu\u00e9rin as prominent figures of libertarian Marxism. Ojeili identifies William Morris, Daniel De Leon, the Socialist Party of Great Britain, Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Korsch, Anton Pannekoek, Roland Holst, Hermann Gorter, Sylvia Pankhurst, Antonio Gramsci, Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs, Socialisme ou Barbarie, Henri Simon, \u00c9changes et mouvement and Paul Mattick as significant Marxian libertarian socialists.\nDemocratic socialist.\nThere was a strong left-libertarian current in the British labour movement and the term \"libertarian socialist\" has been applied to a number of democratic socialists, including some prominent members of the British Labour Party. The Socialist League was formed in 1885 by William Morris and others critical of the authoritarian socialism of the Social Democratic Federation. It was involved in the new unionism, the rank-and-file union militancy of the 1880s\u20131890s, which anticipated syndicalism in some key ways (Tom Mann, a New Unionist leader, was one of the first British syndicalists). The Socialist League was dominated by anarchists by the 1890s.\nThe Common Wealth Party was inspired by Christian socialism as well as libertarian socialism. Others in the tradition of the ILP and described as libertarian socialists included G. D. H. Cole (the founder of guild socialism and influenced by Morris), George Orwell, Michael Foot, Raymond Williams, and Tony Benn. Another is former Labour Party minister Peter Hain, who has written in support of libertarian socialism, identifying an axis involving a \"bottom-up vision of socialism, with anarchists at the revolutionary end and democratic socialists [such as himself] at its reformist end\" as opposed to the axis of state socialism with Marxist\u2013Leninists at the revolutionary end and social democrats at the reformist end. Another mainstream Labour politician who has been described as a libertarian socialist is Robin Cook.\nDebates.\nReasons for decline.\nAmerican economist Robin Hahnel claimed that libertarian socialists \"were by far the worst underachievers among 20th century anti-capitalists.\" He contrasted libertarian socialist failings with those of social democracy, arguing that while the latter had abandoned their principles of economic democracy and justice in favour of reformism, the former had proved incapable of sustaining anti-capitalist uprisings and largely ignored the importance of political and economic reform. Hahnel consequently suggested that, in the 21st century, libertarian socialists should work together with other anti-capitalist social movements, organize for reform without abandoning anti-capitalist principles and strive to build grassroots institutions of self-management, even if those projects are \"imperfect\".\nPriorities.\nWhile most libertarian socialists consider it necessary to combat both economic and political power in tandem, regarding each as fundamental to the survival of the other, some consider it a priority to combat one or the other first. Some, such as Mikhail Bakunin and Alexander Berkman, considered capitalism to rely on the support and protection of the state. They thus concluded that if the state were to be abolished, capitalism would naturally dissolve in its wake. But others, including Noam Chomsky, believe that the state is only inherently oppressive because of its control by a plutocratic class and that \"society is governed by those who own it\". Chomsky holds that government, while not benign, can at least be held accountable, while corporate power is neither benign nor accountable. Though he holds the abolition of the state to be desirable, Chomsky considers the abolition of capitalism to be of greater urgency.\nTheoretical coherence.\nLibertarian socialism has faced criticism from some scholars who argue that its core principles contain internal contradictions. Economist Robin Hahnel notes that while libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized, anti-authoritarian models of organization, historical attempts to implement such systems\u2014such as during the Spanish Revolution\u2014often struggled with practical challenges like coordinating defense against external threats or maintaining economic efficiency without centralized structures. Hahnel suggests these difficulties stem from tensions between the ideology's emphasis on radical autonomy and the pragmatic requirements of sustaining large-scale social movements, calling it a \"self-limiting\" theory that inadvertently undermines its own goals. Similarly, political theorist Noam Chomsky has acknowledged that libertarian socialist ideals, while morally compelling, face inherent logistical hurdles in balancing collective self-management with functional governance, observing that \"the gap between doctrine and reality\" often reveals unresolved theoretical gaps.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
