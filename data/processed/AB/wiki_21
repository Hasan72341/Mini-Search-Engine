{"id": "12688", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12688", "title": "Shock site", "text": "Website intended to offend and/or disgust its viewers\nA shock site is a website that is intended to be offensive or disturbing to its viewers, though it can also contain elements of humor or evoke (in some viewers) sexual arousal. Shock-oriented websites generally contain material that is pornographic, scatological, racist, antisemitic, sexist, graphically violent, insulting, vulgar, profane, or of some other provocative nature. Websites that are primarily fixated on real death and graphic violence are particularly referred to as gore sites. Some shock sites display a single picture, animation, video clip or small gallery, and are circulated via email or disguised in posts to discussion sites as a prank. Steven Jones distinguishes these sites from those that collect galleries where users search for shocking content, such as Rotten.com. Gallery sites can contain beheadings, execution, electrocution, suicide, murder, stoning, torching, police brutality, hangings, terrorism, cartel violence, drowning, vehicular accidents, war victims, rape, necrophilia, genital mutilation and other sexual crimes.\nSome shock sites have also gained their own subcultures and have become internet memes on their own. Goatse.cx featured a page devoted to fan-submitted artwork and tributes to the site's codice_1, and a parody of the image was unwittingly shown by a BBC newscast as an alternative for for the 2012 Summer Olympics. A 2007 shock video known as \"2 Girls 1 Cup\" also quickly became an Internet phenomenon, with videos of reactions, homages, and parodies widely posted on video sharing sites such as YouTube.\nHistory.\nThere have been several shock galleries that have launched and shut down. Rotten.com hosted murder videos and images of deceased people, and brandished the motto \"Pure Evil Since 1996\". During their operation, the owners of Rotten.com launched several new sites, one of which was Shockumentary.com in 2006. Shockumentary.com was created to sell mondo films like \"Traces of Death\" (1993). Ogrish.com, which was established in 2000, hosted \"mutilated corpses, car accidents, burn victims, congenital malformations and other grotesqueries\". Ogrish.com's reputation rested on its publication of gore media from terrorists and war. In 2006, Ogrish.com was rebranded as Liveleak.com. Bestgore.com, established in 2008 by Mark Marek, was notorious for its extremely graphic content, such as photos and videos of murders, suicides and violent accidents with an estimated 15\u201320 million monthly visits during its operation. Marek pleaded guilty and was given a six-month conditional sentence for his role in a case where he was accused of corrupting public morals in Alberta, Canada. Some shock galleries, however, established more specific niches. In the early 2000s, the site Necrobabes hosted images of women pretending to be dead, while the sites Cannibal Caf\u00e9 and Gourmet tailored themselves to would-be cannibals. The latter sites gained attention in 2003 when Armin Meiwes, an aspiring cannibal, used the sites to connect with J\u00fcrgen Brandes, a man who desired to be eaten. Additionally, Graham Coutts visited Necrobabes, Rapepassion, Violentpleasure, and Hangingbitches frequently before strangling teacher Jane Longhurst.\nThere have also been several individual videos that received viral attention. Goatse was one of the earliest and best-known shock sites, featuring an image of a man stretching his anus with his hands. The site featured a page devoted to fan-submitted artwork and tributes to the site. The site was shut down in 2004; however, various mirror sites featuring the image still exist. In 2012, it was resurrected as an e-mail service. In 2008, the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs posted the graphic murder video \"3 Guys 1 Hammer\". This was followed years later by Eric Clinton Kirk Newman's (known now as Luka Rocco Magnotta) video \"1 Lunatic 1 Icepick\" in 2012\u2014a video of Newman murdering Chinese student Jun Lin that contained dismemberment, cannibalism, and necrophilia, and was posted on Bestgore.com. Newman also shared a video one year prior of him using a vacuum and plastic bag to suffocate two kittens to the song \"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\" by John Lennon to several gore sites. Meatspin is a shock site containing a looping video (set playing to \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" by Dead or Alive) of two people engaging in anal sex, while the penis of the receiving partner swings in a circle endlessly. Although frequently reported to be gay pornography, it has been mentioned that the clip was derived from a transgender pornography film. A counter keeps track of how many \"spins\" the viewer has watched. In 2013, a student at Florida State University hacked the wireless network of his campus and redirected all traffic to Meatspin. In 2015, consternation followed when a family restaurant played the website in front of young children. In 2016, the website was played on a public digital billboard in Sweden, resulting in international media attention. An advertising industry website documenting this incident referred to it as creating Swedish MeatSpin. The site first went live on March 10, 2005. John-Michael Bond of \"The Daily Dot\" stated that to an extent, \"casual homophobia\" of the 2000s helped popularize Meatspin.\nLegality.\nCurrently, there is no federal or state legislation in the United States that outlaws possessing or viewing videos or images that depict the death of a human being. In 2000, a bill was introduced in the California State Legislature to outlaw these films, but after the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised protest over First Amendment concerns, the bill failed to pass. No other bill has passed since. In the case of \"Miller v. California\", the Supreme Court of the United States established a test to determine whether content falls under the category of unprotected obscenity. The Miller test requires that content \"appeals to the prurient interest\" to be obscene, meaning content must have a sexual component.\nThat test was modified by \"United States v. Richards\", which ruled that animal crush videos (videos that involve the killing of animals) can be obscene and therefore, are not protected by the First Amendment even though they do not clearly appeal to sexual interests. The court ruled animal crush videos to be unprotected obscenity for two reasons. First, animal crush videos can appeal to a \"specific sexual fetish,\" which fits the sexual conduct requirement of the \"Miller\" test. Second, \"United States v. Richards\" modified the \"Miller\" test by ruling that obscenity \"can also cover unusual deviant acts\" even if they are not directly sexual. Child pornography also falls under the category of unprotected obscenity by these tests. Due to the combination of murder and pornography depicted on shock sites that contain murder videos like gore2gasm.com, legal scholars have argued that murder videos also appeal to specific sexual interests and are thus unprotected under \"United States v. Richards\".\nIn terms of liability, unless death videos are illegal, third party providers like shock sites that host death videos are protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). However, websites that require users to upload illegal content or actively encourage users to create and share illegal content can be held liable. Additionally, courts have granted increasing privacy rights to families over the publication and distribution of images of deceased relatives. The owners of Rotten.com were successfully sued by families for hosting photos of dead people and videos of their deaths on the site.\nIn the United Kingdom, Parliament passed the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which included a section outlawing extreme pornography (that which is intended to sexually arouse viewers that threatens a person's life, is likely to seriously harm a person's anus, breasts, or genitals, or involves a human corpse or an animal). This has resulted in shock sites, as well as American pornographers including Max Hardcore and Extreme Associates, being convicted of obscenity in the United Kingdom.\nDuring the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, the shooter broadcast the first shooting at Al Noor Mosque live on Facebook. The video was shared on Facebook and uploaded to YouTube shortly after. Footage of the mass murder was hosted on 4chan, 8chan, LiveLeak, Voat, Zero Hedge, and KiwiFarms. Rather than the Australian government trying to ban this specific instance of murder video, internet service providers in Australia chose to place temporary blocks on any sites that hosted the footage until all the footage was believed to be removed.\nEthics.\nSeveral ethical concerns have been raised on the topic of shock sites and murder videos. One concern is that the popularity of shock sites will encourage an increase in violent murders, which can result in more extreme and violent videos that will likely generate more views on shock sites. Murder videos can inspire copycats to replicate the snuff films. After one of the Dnepropetrovsk Maniacs' videos leaked on the internet as \"3 Guys 1 Hammer\" in 2007, Luka Magnotta murdered Lin Jun, a Chinese student, and uploaded the video (including scenes of dismemberment, cannibalism, and necrophilia) under the similar title of \"1 Lunatic 1 Icepick\" in 2012.\nAnother concern is the right of a victim and the victim's family to privacy after death. This is the issue of whether Lin Jun's parents have a right to remove the video of their son's murder from the internet. Murder victims cannot consent to the footage of their deaths being used and uploaded, and several court cases have agreed that parents and loved ones should have a right to prevent the widespread viewership of a personal tragedy and stop the video from being published.\nFinally, while shock value is not sufficient to justify banning content legally (as was determined by Cohen v. California), there are still ethical concerns about the emotional damages caused by the jarring nature and content of shock sites. Viewing violent content such as murder videos on social media as part of work can cause or trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cause other emotional distress.\nMedia.\nAs more people upload and view murder videos on shock sites, some believe that this practice is being mirrored in the horror movie genre. The presence of CCTV in \"Saw\" and the online torture auctions in \"\" raise questions on the nefarious use of monitoring systems and the widespread access to videos of Al-Qaeda beheadings, executions in American prisons, and other real depictions of violence and murder on the internet. In examples like \"Saw\", the contemporary horror genre reflects real horror on the internet.\nAdditionally, a parody of Goatse was shown by a BBC newscast as an alternative for the then recently unveiled logo for the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12691", "revid": "22619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12691", "title": "Geography of Albania", "text": " \nAlbania is a country in southeastern Europe that lies along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, with a coastline spanning approximately . Situated on the Balkan Peninsula, it is one of the most mountainous countries in Europe. It is bounded by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east and Greece to the southeast and south.\nMost of Albania rises into mountains and hills, tending to run the length of the country from north to south, as for instance the Albanian Alps in the north, the Sharr Mountains in the northeast, the Skanderbeg Mountains in the center, the Korab Mountains in the east, the Pindus Mountains in the southeast, and the Ceraunian Mountains in the southwest. Plains and plateaus extend in the west along the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea Coast.\nSome of the most considerable and oldest bodies of freshwater of Europe can be found in Albania. The second largest lake of Southern Europe, the Lake of Shkod\u00ebr, is located in the northwest surrounded by the Albanian Alps and the Adriatic Sea. And one of the oldest continuously existing lakes in the world, the Lake of Ohrid, lies in the southeast, while the highest tectonic lakes of the Balkan Peninsula, the Large and Small Lake of Prespa, are well hidden among high mountains in the southeast.\nRivers originate in the east of Albania and loop towards the west into the sea. They are encompassed by the drainage basins of the Adriatic, Aegean and Black Sea. The longest river in the country, measured from its mouth to its source, is the Drin that starts at the confluence of its two headwaters, the Black and White Drin, though also notable is the Vjos\u00eb, one of the last intact large river systems in Europe.\nFor a small country, Albania is characterized for its biological diversity and abundance of contrasting ecosystems and habitats, defined in an area of . This great diversity derives from Albania's geographic location on the Mediterranean Sea, with typical climatic conditions, varied topography, as well as the wealth of terrestrial and marine ecosystems providing a variety of habitats, each with its own typical flora and fauna.\nThere are 799 Albanian protected areas covering a surface of . These include two strict nature reserves, 14 national parks, one marine park, eight archaeological parks, 750 natural monuments, 22 habitat/species management areas, five protected landscapes, four protected landscapes, four managed resources areas, and four ramsar wetlands. The national parks cover a surface area of or roughly 13.65% of the overall territory.\nBorders.\nA total surface area of 28.748 square kilometres (11,100 sq mi), the country is located in the southeastern part of the Adriatic and the northeastern part of the Ionian Sea, both located within the Mediterranean Sea. It has a length of borders of about , of which are taken by terrestrial borders, of shore borders, river borders and of lake borders. Inland water surface is , composed by natural lakes , coastal lagoons , artificial lakes and rivers .\nThe countries of Montenegro () and Kosovo () border the country in the north and northeast, respectively. A significant portion of this border connects high points and follows mountain ridges through the largely inaccessible Albanian Alps. The eastern border is shared with North Macedonia, which stretches . This border is located at the tripoint between Albania, Kosovo, and North Macedonia passing through the Sharr and Korab Mountains and continues until it reaches Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa. The southern and southeastern border with Greece is long. The border is located at the tripoint border between Albania, North Macedonia, and Greece running across the Large and Small Lake Prespa until it reaches the Ionian Sea at the Strait of Corfu.\nPhysical geography.\nTopography.\nThe most significant feature of Albania is possibly its relief, with numerous successive mountain ranges and its average altitude, more than 700 metres above sea level. Much of the mountains lie to the north, east and south of the western lowlands in the northern, eastern and southern mountain ranges.\nThe Albanian Alps extend over 90 kilometres through the north of Albania, traversing an area of 2,000 square kilometres. These mountains represent an\nextension of the Dinaric Alps and no wider than 40 kilometres. They are deeply fragmented and often inaccessible. It holds the Maja Jezerc\u00eb, which is the highest point of the Dinarides and simultaneously the second highest point of Albania.\nThe Korab Mountains dominate the east of the country and expand 40 kilometres along the eastern border of the country, where peaks can clearly reach 2,500 metres. The mountains offer the country's most prominent peak at Mount Korab, which is fragmented by many deep structural depressions. Another distinguishing feature remains the evidence of the last ice age in form of glacial lakes at relatively low altitudes.\nOne of the most remarkable features about the south of Albania is the presence of the Ceraunian Mountains that cut across the landscape for nearly 100 kilometres. Thousand meter high mountains fall vertically into the Mediterranean Sea constituting at least the first barrier to communication between the sea and the country's southern inland.\nHydrography.\nThe country has a dense network of rivers and streams characterized by a high flow rate. They belong to the drainage basins of the Adriatic, Aegean and Black Sea. They mostly rise in the mountainous eastern half of the country and have their mouths in the west along the coasts. They are sustained from snowmelt of the snow-capped mountains or from the abundant precipitation that falls at loftier elevations.\nEight notable rivers, along with their numerous tributaries, make up the river system of the country. The longest river is the Drin, which flows for within the country. Its catchment area is one of the most biodiverse places in Europe and encompasses the lakes of Shkod\u00ebr, Ohrid and Prespa. Of particular concern represent the river of Vjosa as it is considered as the last remaining wild river in Europe. The country's other rivers are Fan, Ish\u00ebm, Erzen, Mat, Seman and Shkumbin.\nWith more than 250 lakes, the country is home to two of the largest lakes in Southern Europe and one of the oldest in the World. The lakes of the country are predominantly of karstic or glacial origin. The largest lake in Southern Europe is the Lake of Shkod\u00ebr geographically located in the north, shared with Montenegro. One of the ancientest lakes in the world is the Lake of Ohrid located in the southeast, shared with North Macedonia. The highest positioned lakes in Southern Europe are the Large and Small Lake of Prespa in the southeast, shared with North Macedonia and Greece.\nThe country is also home to many lagoons of varied shape, size and structure. They are primarily positioned along the coast in the west of the country and also in the southeast. They contribute to the overall productivity of the coastal waters by supporting a variety of habitats and ecosystems. The largest lagoon in the country is the Lagoon of Karavasta located between the mouth of Shkumbin and Seman. Another significant lagoons are the lagoons of Patoku, Narta, Kun\u00eb-Vain and Butrint.\nBiodiversity.\nThe proximity to the Mediterranean Sea and the convergence of exceptional climatic, geological and hydrological conditions, have contributed for the development of a diverse biodiversity, making Albania one of the biodiversity hotspots of Europe.\nIn terms of phytogeography, the land area of Albania extends within the Boreal Kingdom, specifically within the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region. Its territory can be subdivided into four terrestrial ecoregions of the Palearctic realm \u2013 the Illyrian, Balkan, Pindus and Dinaric forests.\nIn Albania forest cover is around 29.% of the total land area, equivalent to 788,900 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 788,800 hectares (ha) in 1990. Of the naturally regenerating forest 11% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 0% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 97% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 3% private ownership and 0% with ownership listed as other or unknown.\nThe northern edge of the country has an affinity for those of Continental Europe, while those of the southern edge refer to the affinity with that of the Mediterranean Basin. They are substantial because they provide shelter for a vast array of rare and endangered species of animals, among others the brown bear, Balkan lynx, grey wolf, golden jackal, Egyptian vulture and golden eagle. Albania had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.77/10, ranking it 64th globally out of 172 countries.\nThe Mediterranean monk seal, short-beaked common dolphin and common bottlenose dolphin can frequently be seen in the coastal waters of the country. Outstanding is the presence of the Dalmatian pelican, the rarest pelican in the world. The biodiversity of Albania is conserved in its protected areas, which provide protection to hundreds of threatened and endangered species.\nProtected areas.\nNumerous parts of Albania are protected in accordance with a number of national and international designations due to their natural, historical or cultural value. Protected areas belong to the most principal instruments of conservation which in turn contributes effectively to the maintenance of species, habitats and ecosystems.\nThe country has currently fifteen designated national parks, whereby one is specified as a marine park. Ranging from the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea to the Albanian Alps and the Ceraunian Mountains, they possess outstanding landscapes constituting habitats to thousands of plant and animal species. Butrint, Divjak\u00eb-Karavasta, Karaburun-Sazan, Llogara, Prespa, Shebenik-Jabllanic\u00eb, Theth and Valbon\u00eb are among the most spectacular national parks of the country.\nClimate.\nAlbania has a combination of a mediterranean climate and a continental climate, with four distinct seasons. The climatic conditions are highly variable and modified locally by altitude and latitude. Its climate is strongly influenced by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and the mountains that raise in every corner around the country.\nIts diverse regions have a remarkable range of microclimates, with the weather system on the coasts contrasting with that prevailing in the interior. Moreover, the weather varies from the north and towards the south and the west to the east. Albania occupies the climate ranges from temperate climate on the coasts to continental climate in the interior. The warmest areas of the country are at the coasts, which are characterized by a Mediterranean climate (Csa, Csb and Cfa) as defined by the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. The highlands experiences an Oceanic climate. Winters in Albania are characteristically mild and wet while summers are warm and dry. The northern areas of country such as the Albanian Alps experiences a subarctic climate with frequently very cold winters, and short, mild summers.\nThe lowlands of Albania have mild winters, averaging about . The summer temperatures average , however, humidity is low. In the southern lowlands, specifically the areas on the Ionian sea, temperatures average about in the winter and during the summer.\nPhysiographic regions.\nThe country is divided into four physiographic regions, the Northern Mountain Range, Central Mountain Range, Southern Mountain Range and Western Lowlands with two subdivisions corresponding roughly to the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea Coast.\nWestern Lowlands.\nExcept for its sea coast in the west, the western lowlands are ringed by a great arc-shaped line of mountains spreading in the north, east and south. The predominantly flat and regular landscape is morphologically characterized by the sea and rivers, in terms of topography and soil, and also in its climate and biodiversity. The region experiences mild and short winters, with low rainfalls, and long hot and dry summers. It is mostly dominated by the extensive Myzeqe plain, a large alluvial plain traversed by three main rivers, the Shkumbin, Seman and Vjos\u00eb.\nThe Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast stretches from the mouth of the river Buna near the Lake of Shkod\u00ebr in the north, across the Gulf of Drin, to the Bay of Vlor\u00eb in the south. The two largest coastal cities Durr\u00ebs and Vlor\u00eb are located in the northern and the southern part of the region, respectively. The total length of the coastline is approximately , mostly of which are taken up by sandy beaches, wetlands and alluvial deposits, occurred by quaternary sediments of the main rivers of the country.\nThe coastline is lined with different habitats and ecosystems, providing optimal conditions for a rich biodiversity. Of particular importance is the presence of numerous lagoons and ponds, representing one of the wealthiest scenery of the country, in terms of biology. Likely, the lagoons of Karavasta and Narta, in the immediate proximity to the sea, are among the most important ones in the Mediterranean Sea.\nWhile the Adriatic coast is relatively low, the Ionian coast is, with few exceptions, rugged and mountainous. The Albanian Ionian Sea Coast stretches from the Peninsula of Karaburun in the north, through the Albanian Riviera, to the Straits of Corfu in the south. The largest coastal city Sarand\u00eb is located in the southern part of the region, while smaller villages include Borsh, Dhermi, Himara, Qeparo, Piqeras, and Lukov\u00eb. The total length of the coastline is approximately .\nThe most characteristic features of the coastline are the Ceraunian Mountains, which extend nearly along the Albanian Riviera roughly in a southeast\u2013northwest direction. The region is particular fertile and known for its citrus fruits and viticulture, that has a long and special tradition in the region. The coastline is abundant in dolomite from the triassic period, the carbonate rocks follows with limestone from the jurassic period and bituminous schists, cretaceous porcelain and phosphate limestone. \nNorthern Mountain Range.\nThe northern mountain range is the most mountainous region in the country and its physical geography and shape is distinguished by the convergence of two distinct geological regions, the Albanian Alps and Mirdita Highlands. A dominant feature of the region's landscape is the presence of several u-shaped valleys, such as the Valley of Valbon\u00eb, formed by the process of glaciation.\nThe Albanian Alps are the southernmost extension of the Dinaric Alps and simultaneously the highest and most imposing mountains of the country. Despite the fact that the ice ages had relatively little geological influence on the alps, the southernmost glaciers of Europe were recently discovered on the alps.\nThe Albanian Alps are home to many important rivers of Western Balkans. The main drainage basins of the Alps are those of the Drin and Danube Rivers. Rivers on the Alps fall roughly into two categories, those that flow into the Lim and those that enter the White Drin and meet the Black Drin downstream at the Drin confluence. However, Drin dominates, draining most of the Alps with its tributaries and when measured from the source of the White Drin to the mouth of the Drin near Lezh\u00eb. But not all of the Drin flows near or parallel to the Alps. One Drin tributary is the Valbona River, which drains into the Adriatic Sea, and its eastern tributary the Gashi River. \nCentral Mountain Range.\nThe terrain of the central mountain range is predominantly mountainous and extremely fragmented carved into its present shape by the glaciers of the last ice age. The region is dominated by three mountain ranges, each running from north-northeast to south-southwest, roughly parallel to the eastern border of Albania.\nThe Korab Mountains are certainly the most striking feature of the physical geography of the region. They hold the highest mountain of the country, the Mount Korab. The mountains extends over 40 kilometres and covers an area of 560 square kilometres. Between the valleys of Shkumbin and Devoll rise the mountains that constitute to the Valamara Mountains, while farther north stretches the connected mountain massifs of Shebenik and Jabllanic\u00eb.\nThe vast majority of the region's natural lakes are located in the southern half of the region and most of them are the product of a long contiguous history. The Lake of Ohrid lie adjacent to the border shared with North Macedonia. It is one of the oldest continuously existing lakes in the world with a unique biodiversity. Further south, well hidden among high mountains, extend the Lake of Prespa that is linked by a small channel with a sluice that separates the two lakes.\nSouthern Mountain Range.\nThe Ceraunian Mountains, a coastal mountain range in southwestern Albania, stretches about besides the Ionian Sea from Sarand\u00eb in south-east-northwest direction along the Albanian Riviera to Orikum. The relief is varied, with many mountain passes, canyons, gorges, hills and other landforms. The mountains are characterized by housing Black pines, Bulgarian firs, Bosnian pines and Ash trees. The mountain chain is home to many large mammals, including brown bears, grey wolves, lynx, golden eagles and others. The highest point on the chain is Maja e \u00c7ik\u00ebs, that rises to an elevation of above the Adriatic. From the peak, there is a view of the Albanian Riviera, the northern Ionian Islands as well as the Italian coast of Apulia and Otranto. The section has wide and long beaches, with a number of bays and headlands.\nStretching until the Llogara Pass at , the mountain chain gets separated into the Ceraunians in the west and the Akroceraunians (or \"Reza e Kanalit\") in the east within the Karaburun Peninsula. The villages of Palas\u00eb, Dh\u00ebrmi, Vuno, Himar\u00eb, Qeparo, Borsh, Pilur, Kudh\u00ebs and Ilias are located on the Ceraunian range. The Llogara National Park covers an area of .\nThe Karaburun Peninsula is situated at the eastern side of Strait of Otranto, where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea. Its area is , having a length of , and a width of only . The Mesokanali is the narrow channel, that separates the peninsula from the Sazan Island. Geologically, it is made up of carbonic limestone, dating back to the Mesozoic period, while in the northwestern it is composed of terrigenous sediment. Furthermore, these formations have been continuously under the effect of Karst and are exploited as marble. The relief of the peninsula comprises a number of hills with an average altitude of about above the Adriatic. The highest summits are Maja e\nIlq\u00ebs , Maja e Flamurit and Maja \u00c7ad\u00ebri .\nThe coastal landscape is characterized by a rough relief, that dips vertically into the Ionian Sea, it features several solitary peaks, large canyons, bays, caves and gulfs. Examples of typical landforms include Gjipe Canyon, Gjiri i Arush\u00ebs, Gjiri i Dafin\u00ebs, Gjiri i Gram\u00ebs and so on. The geological evolution has formed also capes such as Haxhi Aliu, Galloveci and Kepi i Gjuh\u00ebz\u00ebs, and other of 20 caves along the entire shoreline. The climate is Mediterranean, having hot summers and generally warm to cool, dry winters. Due to its climatic, hydrological and geological conditions, the area is characterized by its unique flora and fauna. Most of the territory consists of forests and is relatively well preserved, it includes many types of trees, such as Mediterranean oak, Manna ash, Kermes oak, and Field maple.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In physics, they describe how the symmetry group of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system.\nThe term \"representation of a group\" is also used in a more general sense to mean any \"description\" of a group as a group of transformations of some mathematical object. More formally, a \"representation\" means a homomorphism from the group to the automorphism group of an object. If the object is a vector space we have a \"linear representation\". Some people use \"realization\" for the general notion and reserve the term \"representation\" for the special case of linear representations. The bulk of this article describes linear representation theory; see the last section for generalizations.\nBranches of group representation theory.\nThe representation theory of groups divides into subtheories depending on the kind of group being represented. The various theories are quite different in detail, though some basic definitions and concepts are similar. The most important divisions are:\nRepresentation theory also depends heavily on the type of vector space on which the group acts. One distinguishes between finite-dimensional representations and infinite-dimensional ones. In the infinite-dimensional case, additional structures are important (e.g. whether or not the space is a Hilbert space, Banach space, etc.).\nOne must also consider the type of field over which the vector space is defined. The most important case is the field of complex numbers. The other important cases are the field of real numbers, finite fields, and fields of p-adic numbers. In general, algebraically closed fields are easier to handle than non-algebraically closed ones. The characteristic of the field is also significant; many theorems for finite groups depend on the characteristic of the field not dividing the order of the group.\nDefinitions.\nA representation of a group \"G\" on a vector space \"V\" over a field \"K\" is a group homomorphism from \"G\" to GL(\"V\"), the general linear group on \"V\". That is, a representation is a map \nformula_1 \nsuch that\nformula_2\nHere \"V\" is called the representation space and the dimension of \"V\" is called the dimension or degree of the representation. It is common practice to refer to \"V\" itself as the representation when the homomorphism is clear from the context.\nIn the case where \"V\" is of finite dimension \"n\" it is common to choose a basis for \"V\" and identify GL(\"V\") with GL(\"n\", \"K\"), the group of formula_3 invertible matrices on the field \"K\".\nformula_4\n A faithful representation is one in which the homomorphism \"G\" \u2192 GL(\"V\") is injective; in other words, one whose kernel is the trivial subgroup {\"e\"} consisting only of the group's identity element.\nformula_5\nExamples.\nConsider the complex number \"u\" = e2\u03c0i / 3 which has the property \"u\"3 = 1. The set \"C\"3 = {1, \"u\", \"u\"2} forms a cyclic group under multiplication. This group has a representation \u03c1 on formula_6 given by:\nformula_7\nThis representation is faithful because \u03c1 is a one-to-one map.\nAnother representation for \"C\"3 on formula_6, isomorphic to the previous one, is \u03c3 given by:\nformula_9\nThe group \"C\"3 may also be faithfully represented on formula_10 by \u03c4 given by:\nformula_11\nwhere\nformula_12\nA possible representation on formula_13 is given by the set of cyclic permutation matrices \"v\":\nformula_14\nAnother example:\nLet formula_15 be the space of homogeneous degree-3 polynomials over the complex numbers in variables formula_16\nThen formula_17 acts on formula_15 by permutation of the three variables.\nFor instance, formula_19 sends formula_20 to formula_21.\nReducibility.\nA subspace \"W\" of \"V\" that is invariant under the group action is called a \"subrepresentation\". If \"V\" has exactly two subrepresentations, namely the zero-dimensional subspace and \"V\" itself, then the representation is said to be irreducible; if it has a proper subrepresentation of nonzero dimension, the representation is said to be reducible. The representation of dimension zero is considered to be neither reducible nor irreducible, just as the number 1 is considered to be neither composite nor prime.\nUnder the assumption that the characteristic of the field \"K\" does not divide the size of the group, representations of finite groups can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations (see Maschke's theorem). This holds in particular for any representation of a finite group over the complex numbers, since the characteristic of the complex numbers is zero, which never divides the size of a group.\nIn the example above, the first two representations given (\u03c1 and \u03c3) are both decomposable into two 1-dimensional subrepresentations (given by span{(1,0)} and span{(0,1)}), while the third representation (\u03c4) is irreducible.\nGeneralizations.\nSet-theoretical representations.\nA \"set-theoretic representation\" (also known as a group action or \"permutation representation\") of a group \"G\" on a set \"X\" is given by a function \u03c1 : \"G\" \u2192 \"X\"\"X\", the set of functions from \"X\" to \"X\", such that for all \"g\"1, \"g\"2 in \"G\" and all \"x\" in \"X\":\nformula_22\nformula_23\nwhere formula_24 is the identity element of \"G\". This condition and the axioms for a group imply that \u03c1(\"g\") is a bijection (or permutation) for all \"g\" in \"G\". Thus we may equivalently define a permutation representation to be a group homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S\"X\" of \"X\".\nFor more information on this topic see the article on group action.\nRepresentations in other categories.\nEvery group \"G\" can be viewed as a category with a single object; morphisms in this category are just the elements of \"G\". Given an arbitrary category \"C\", a \"representation\" of \"G\" in \"C\" is a functor from \"G\" to \"C\". Such a functor selects an object \"X\" in \"C\" and a group homomorphism from \"G\" to Aut(\"X\"), the automorphism group of \"X\".\nIn the case where \"C\" is Vect\"K\", the category of vector spaces over a field \"K\", this definition is equivalent to a linear representation. Likewise, a set-theoretic representation is just a representation of \"G\" in the category of sets.\nWhen \"C\" is Ab, the category of abelian groups, the objects obtained are called \"G\"-modules.\nFor another example consider the category of topological spaces, Top. Representations in Top are homomorphisms from \"G\" to the homeomorphism group of a topological space \"X\".\nTwo types of representations closely related to linear representations are:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "12697", "revid": "44721228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12697", "title": "Gardnerian Wicca", "text": "Tradition in Wiccan religion\nGardnerian Wicca, or Gardnerian witchcraft, is a \ntradition in the neopagan religion of Wicca, whose members can trace initiatory descent from Gerald Gardner. The tradition is itself named after Gardner (1884\u20131964), a British civil servant and amateur scholar of magic. The term \"Gardnerian\" was probably coined by the founder of Cochranian Witchcraft, Robert Cochrane in the 1950s or 1960s, who himself left that tradition to found his own.\nGardner claimed to have learned the beliefs and practices that would later become known as Gardnerian Wicca from the New Forest coven, who allegedly initiated him into their ranks in 1939. For this reason, Gardnerian Wicca is usually considered to be the earliest created tradition of Wicca, from which most subsequent Wiccan traditions are derived.\nFrom the supposed New Forest coven, Gardner formed his own Bricket Wood coven, and in turn initiated many Witches, including a series of High Priestesses, founding further covens and continuing the initiation of more Wiccans into the tradition. In the UK, Europe, and most Commonwealth countries, someone self-defined as Wiccan is usually understood to be claiming initiatory descent from Gardner, either through Gardnerian Wicca, or through a derived branch such as Alexandrian Wicca. Elsewhere, these original lineaged traditions are termed \"British Traditional Wicca\".\nBeliefs and practices.\nCovens and initiatory lines.\nGardnerian Wiccans organize into covens that traditionally, although not always, are limited to thirteen members. Covens are led by a High Priestess and the High Priest of her choice, and celebrate both a Goddess and a God.\nGardnerian Wicca and other forms of British Traditional Wicca operate as an initiatory mystery cult; membership is gained only through initiation by a Wiccan High Priestess or High Priest. Any valid line of initiatory descent can be traced all the way back to Gerald Gardner, and through him back to the New Forest coven.\nRituals and coven practices are kept secret from non-initiates, and many Wiccans maintain secrecy regarding their membership in the religion. Whether any individual Wiccan chooses secrecy or openness often depends on their location, career, and life circumstances. In all cases, Gardnerian Wicca absolutely forbids any member to share the name, personal information, fact of membership, and so on without advanced individual consent of that member for that specific instance of sharing.\nIn Gardnerian Wicca, there are three grades of initiation. Ronald Hutton suggests that \"the outlines of the first two [initiation] rituals are very clearly Masonic.\"\nTheology.\nIn Gardnerian Wicca, the two principal deities are the Horned God and the Mother Goddess. Gardnerians use specific names for the God and the Goddess in their rituals. Doreen Valiente, a Gardnerian High Priestess, revealed that there were more than one.\nEthics and morality.\nThe Gardnerian tradition teaches a core ethical guideline, often referred to as \"The Rede\" or \"The Wiccan Rede\". In the archaic language often retained in some Gardnerian lore, the Rede states: \"An it harm none, do as thou wilt.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA second ethical guideline is often called the Law of Return, sometimes the Rule of Three. Like the Rede, this guideline teaches Gardnerians that whatever energy or intention one puts out into the world, whether magical or not, will return to that person \"multiplied by three\". This law is controversial, as discussed by John Coughlin, author of \"The Pagan Resource Guide\", in an essay, \"The Three-Fold Law\".\nThe religion tends to be non-dogmatic, allowing each initiate to find for themselves what the ritual experience means by using the basic language of the shared ritual tradition, to be discovered through the Mysteries. The tradition is often characterized as an orthopraxy (correct practice) rather than an orthodoxy (correct thinking), with adherents placing greater emphasis on a shared body of practices as opposed to faith.\nHistory.\nGardner and the New Forest coven.\nIn the early 20th century, Margaret Murray promoted the hypothesis that persecuted witches had actually been followers of a surviving pagan religion, but this theory is now rejected by academia. Nevertheless, it was an influence on some neo-pagans. On retirement from the British Colonial Service, Gerald Gardner moved to London but then before World War II moved to Highcliffe, east of Bournemouth and near the New Forest on the south coast of England. After attending a performance staged by the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, he reports meeting a group of people who had preserved their historic occult practices. They recognised him as being \"one of them\" and convinced him to be initiated. It was only halfway through the initiation, he says, that it dawned on him what kind of group it was, and that witchcraft was still being practised in England.\nThe group into which Gardner was initiated, known as the New Forest coven, was small and utterly secret as the Witchcraft Act 1735 (9 Geo. 2. c. 5) made it illegal to claim to predict the future, conjure spirits, or cast spells; it likewise made an accusation of witchcraft a criminal offence. Gardner's enthusiasm for the coven led him to wish to document it, but both the witchcraft laws and the coven's secrecy forbade that, despite his excitement. After World War II, Gardner's High Priestess and coven leader relented sufficiently to allow a fictional treatment that did not expose them to prosecution, \"High Magic's Aid\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Anyhow, I soon found myself in the circle and took the usual oaths of secrecy which bound me not to reveal any secrets of the cult. But, as it is a dying cult, I thought it was a pity that all the knowledge should be lost, so in the end I was permitted to write, as fiction, something of what a witch believes in the novel High Magic's Aid.\nAfter the witchcraft laws were repealed in 1951, and replaced by the Fraudulent Mediums Act, Gerald Gardner went public, publishing his first non-fiction book, \"Witchcraft Today\" (1954). Gardner continued, as the text often iterates, to respect his oaths and the wishes of his High Priestess in his writing. Gardner said that the \"Witchcraft\" religion was dying out, and he pursued publicity and welcomed new initiates during the last years of his life. Gardner even courted the attentions of the tabloid press, to the consternation of some more conservative members of the tradition. In Gardner's own words: \"Witchcraft doesn't pay for broken windows!\"\nGardner knew many famous occultists. Ross Nichols was a friend and fellow Druid (until 1964 member of the Druid Order, when he left to found his own Druidic Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids). Nichols edited Gardner's \"Witchcraft Today\" and is mentioned extensively in Gardner's \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\". Near the end of Aleister Crowley's life, Gardner met with him for the first time on 1 May 1947 and visited him twice more before Crowley's death that autumn; at some point, Crowley gave Gardner an Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) charter and the 4th OTO degree\u2014the lowest degree authorising use of the charter.\nDoreen Valiente, one of Gardner's priestesses, identified the woman who initiated Gardner as Dorothy Clutterbuck, referenced in \"A Witches' Bible\" by Janet and Stewart Farrar. Valiente's identification was based on references Gardner made to a woman he called \"Old Dorothy\" whom Valiente remembered. Biographer Philip Heselton corrects Valiente, clarifying that Clutterbuck (Dorothy St. Quintin-Fordham, n\u00e9e Clutterbuck), a Pagan-minded woman, owned the Mill House, where the New Forest coven performed Gardner's initiation ritual. Scholar Ronald Hutton argues in his \"Triumph of the Moon\" that Gardner's tradition was largely the inspiration of members of the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship and especially that of a woman known by the magical name of \"Dafo\". Dr. Leo Ruickbie, in his \"Witchcraft Out of the Shadows\", analysed the documented evidence and concluded that Aleister Crowley played a crucial role in inspiring Gardner to establish a new pagan religion. Ruickbie, Hutton, and others further argue that much of what has been published of Gardnerian Wicca, as Gardner's practice came to be known, was written by Blake, Yeats, Valiente and Crowley and contains borrowings from other identifiable sources.\nThe witches Gardner was originally introduced to were originally referred to by him as \"the Wica\" and he would often use the term \"Witch Cult\" to describe the religion. Other terms used, included \"Witchcraft\" or \"the Old Religion.\" Later publications standardised the spelling to \"Wicca\" and it came to be used as the term for the Craft, rather than its followers. \"Gardnerian\" was originally a pejorative term used by Gardner's contemporary Roy Bowers (also known as Robert Cochrane), a British cunning man, who nonetheless was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca a couple of years following Gardner's death.\nReconstruction of the Wiccan rituals.\nGardner stated that the rituals of the existing group were fragmentary at best, and he set about fleshing them out, drawing on his library and knowledge as an occultist and amateur folklorist. Gardner borrowed and wove together appropriate material from other artists and occultists, most notably Charles Godfrey Leland's \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", the Key of Solomon as published by S.L. MacGregor Mathers, Masonic ritual, Crowley, and Rudyard Kipling. Doreen Valiente wrote much of the best-known poetry, including the much-quoted Charge of the Goddess.\nBricket Wood coven.\nIn 1948\u20131949, Gardner and Dafo were running a coven separate from the original New Forest coven at a naturist club near Bricket Wood to the north of London. By 1952 Dafo's health had begun to decline, and she was increasingly wary of Gardner's publicity-seeking.\nIn 1953, Gardner met Doreen Valiente, who was to become his High Priestess in succession to Dafo. The question of publicity led to Doreen and others formulating thirteen proposed 'Rules for the Craft', which included restrictions on contact with the press. Gardner responded with the sudden production of the Wiccan Laws which led to some of his members, including Valiente, leaving the coven.\nGardner reported that witches were taught that the power of the human body can be released, for use in a coven's circle, by various means, and released more easily without clothing. A simple method was dancing round the circle singing or chanting; another method was the traditional \"binding and scourging\". In addition to raising power, \"binding and scourging\" can heighten the initiates' sensitivity and spiritual experience.\nFollowing the time Gardner spent on the Isle of Man, the coven began to experiment with circle dancing as an alternative. It was also about this time that the lesser 4 of the 8 Sabbats were given greater prominence. Bricket Wood coven members liked the Sabbat celebrations so much, they decided that there was no reason to keep them confined to the closest full moon meeting, and made them festivities in their own right. As Gardner had no objection to this change suggested by the Bricket Wood coven, this collective decision resulted in what is now the standard eight festivities in the Wiccan Wheel of the year.\nThe split with Valiente led to the Bricket Wood coven being led by Jack Bracelin and a new High Priestess, Dayonis. This was the first of a number of disputes between individuals and groups, but the increased publicity only seems to have allowed Gardnerian Wicca to grow much more rapidly. Certain others also helped fuel this publicity, such as Alex Sanders (real name Orrell Alexander Carter) and Raymond Buckland. Sanders started his own separate tradition, together with his wife Maxine, known as Alexandrian Wicca and frequently were covered by the press. Buckland, who authored dozens of books on the subject, brought the Gardnerian tradition to the United States in 1964, later to start his own tradition known as Seax Wicca.\nControversy over transgender individuals and male/female polarity.\nOn July 18, 2022, \"A Declaration of the Traditional Gardnerian Wica\", was released, with The Wild Hunt reporting that \"the document was signed and sealed by 47 Gardnerians who are either third-degree or autonomous second-degree,\" before further clarifying that \"there is no central Gardnerian authority akin to a sovereign spiritual leader found in other faiths.\" The declaration asserts that Gardnerian Wicca is fundamentally rooted in \"fertility and the generative powers of the universe,\" and that its core Mysteries are transmitted specifically through ritual polarity between biological males and biological females. These claims which were \"labeled transphobic by a number of prominent Gardnerians\" were met with \"strong condemnations and widespread dismissal\" from others in the community, with at least three on record describing the signatories as a \"minority\" spreading transphobic rhetoric that contradicts the writings of Gerald Gardner. Pagan news site \"The Wild Hunt\" noted that because of Gardnerian Wicca's decentralized structure and emphasis on coven autonomy, the declaration \"effectively only applies to covens that are led by or hive from the documents' signers.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At different times in the past, it has been calculated in different ways, including being calculated from noon; as a consequence, it cannot be used to specify a particular time unless a context is given. The term \"GMT\" is also used as one of the names for the time zone and, in UK law, is the basis for civil time in the United Kingdom.\nBecause of Earth's uneven angular velocity in its elliptical orbit and its axial tilt, noon (12:00:00) GMT is rarely the exact moment the Sun crosses the Greenwich Meridian and reaches its highest point in the sky there. This event may occur up to 16 minutes before or after noon GMT, a discrepancy described by the equation of time. Noon GMT is the annual average (the arithmetic mean) moment of this event, which accounts for the word \"mean\" in \"Greenwich Mean Time\".\nOriginally, astronomers considered a GMT day to start at noon, while for almost everyone else it started at midnight. To avoid confusion, the name Universal Time was introduced in 1928 to denote GMT as counted from midnight. Today, Universal Time usually refers to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or else to UT1; English speakers often use GMT as a synonym for UTC. For navigation, it is considered equivalent to UT1 (the modern form of mean solar time at 0\u00b0 longitude); but this meaning can differ from UTC by up to 0.9s. The term \"GMT\" should thus not be used for purposes that require precision.\nThe term \"GMT\" is especially used by institutional bodies within the United Kingdom, such as the BBC World Service, the Royal Navy, and the Met Office; and others particularly in Arab countries, such as the Middle East Broadcasting Centre and Dubai-based OSN.\nHistory.\nAs the United Kingdom developed into an advanced maritime nation, British mariners kept at least one chronometer on GMT to calculate their longitude from the Greenwich meridian, which was considered to have longitude zero degrees, by a convention adopted in the International Meridian Conference of 1884. Synchronisation of the chronometer on GMT did not affect shipboard time, which was still solar time. But this practice, combined with mariners from other nations drawing from Nevil Maskelyne's method of lunar distances based on observations at Greenwich, led to GMT being used worldwide as a standard time independent of location. Most time zones were based upon GMT, as an offset of a number of hours (and occasionally half or quarter hours) \"ahead of GMT\" or \"behind GMT\".\nGreenwich Mean Time was adopted across the island of Great Britain by the Railway Clearing House in 1847 and by almost all railway companies by the following year, from which the term \"railway time\" is derived. It was gradually adopted for other purposes, but a legal case in 1858 held \"local mean time\" to be the official time. On 14 May 1880, a letter signed by \"Clerk to Justices\" appeared in \"The Times\", stating that \"Greenwich time is now kept almost throughout England, but it appears that Greenwich time is not legal time. For example, our polling booths were opened, say, at 8 13 and closed at 4 13 p.m.\" This was changed later in 1880, when Greenwich Mean Time was legally adopted throughout the island of Great Britain. GMT was adopted in the Isle of Man in 1883, in Jersey in 1898 and in Guernsey in 1913. Ireland adopted GMT in 1916, supplanting Dublin Mean Time. Hourly time signals from Greenwich Observatory were first broadcast by shortwave radio on 5 February 1924 at 17:30:00 UTC, providing a rival accurate time-source to the time ball at the Greenwich Observatory.\nThe daily rotation of the Earth is irregular (see \u0394T) and has a slowing trend; therefore atomic clocks constitute a much more stable timebase. On 1 January 1972, GMT as the international civil time standard was superseded by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), maintained by an ensemble of atomic clocks around the world. \"Universal Time\" (\"UT\"), a term introduced in 1928, initially represented mean time at Greenwich determined in the traditional way to accord with the originally defined universal day; from 1 January 1956 (as decided by the International Astronomical Union in Dublin in 1955, at the initiative of William Markowitz) this \"raw\" form of UT was re-labelled \"UT0\" and effectively superseded by refined forms UT1 (UT0 equalised for the effects of polar wandering) and UT2 (UT1 further equalised for annual seasonal variations in Earth rotation rate).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Indeed, even the Greenwich meridian itself is not quite what it used to be\u2014defined by \"the centre of the transit instrument at the Observatory at Greenwich\". Although that instrument still survives in working order, it is no longer in use and now the meridian of origin of the world's longitude and time is not strictly defined in material form but from a statistical solution resulting from observations of all time-determination stations which the BIPM takes into account when co-ordinating the world's time signals. Nevertheless, the line in the old observatory's courtyard today differs no more than a few metres from that imaginary line which is now the prime meridian of the world. \u2014\u200a\nAmbiguity in the definition of GMT.\nHistorically, GMT has been used with two different conventions for numbering hours. The long-standing astronomical convention, dating from the work of Ptolemy, was to refer to noon as zero hours (see Julian day). This contrasted with the civil convention of referring to midnight as zero hours dating from the Roman Empire. The latter convention was adopted on and after 1 January 1925 for astronomical purposes, resulting in a discontinuity of 12 hours, or half a day. The instant that was designated as \"December 31.5 GMT\" in 1924 almanacs became \"January 1.0 GMT\" in 1925 almanacs. The term \"Greenwich Mean Astronomical Time\" (\"GMAT\") was introduced to unambiguously refer to the previous noon-based astronomical convention for GMT. The more specific terms \"UT\" and \"UTC\" do not share this ambiguity, always referring to midnight as \"zero hours\".\nGMT in legislation.\nUnited Kingdom.\nLegally, the civil time used in the UK is called \"Greenwich mean time\" (without capitalisation), with an exception made for those periods when the Summer Time Act 1972 orders an hour's shift for daylight saving. The Interpretation Act 1978, section 9, provides that whenever an expression of time occurs in any Act, the time referred to shall (unless otherwise specifically stated) be held to be Greenwich mean time. Under subsection 23, the same rule applies to deeds and other instruments.\nDuring the experiment of 1968 to 1971, when the British Isles did not revert to Greenwich Mean Time during the winter, the all-year British Summer Time was called \"British Standard Time\" (\"BST\").\nIn the UK, UTC+00:00 is disseminated to the general public in winter and in summer.\nBBC radio stations broadcast the \"six pips\" of the Greenwich Time Signal. It is named from its original generation at the Royal Greenwich Observatory but is calibrated to UTC. If announced (such as near the start of summer time or of winter time), announcers on domestic channels declare the time as \"GMT\" or \"BST\" as appropriate. As the BBC World Service is broadcast to all time zones, the announcers use the term \"Greenwich Mean Time\" consistently throughout the year.\nOther countries.\nSeveral countries define their local time by reference to Greenwich Mean Time. Some examples are:\nTime zone.\nGreenwich Mean Time (UTC+00:00) is defined in law as standard time in the following countries and areas, which also advance their clocks one hour to in summer.\nGreenwich Mean Time is used during the summer in the following areas, which switch their clocks to during the winter months:\nGreenwich Mean Time is used as standard time all year round in the following countries and areas:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12702", "revid": "3382231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12702", "title": "GIF", "text": "Bitmap image file format family\nThe Graphics Interchange Format (GIF; or , &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;) is a bitmap image format that was developed by a team at the online services provider CompuServe led by American computer scientist Steve Wilhite and released on June 15, 1987.\nThe format can contain up to 8 bits per pixel, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It can also represent multiple images in a file, which can be used for animations, and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients but well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.\nGIF images are compressed using the Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. While once in widespread usage on the World Wide Web because of its wide implementation and portability between applications and operating systems, usage of the format has declined for space and quality reasons, often being replaced with newer formats such as PNG for static images and MP4 for videos. In this context, short video clips are sometimes termed \"GIFs\" despite having no relation to the original file format.\nHistory.\nCompuServe introduced GIF on 15 June 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas. This replaced their earlier run-length encoding format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch data compression. Since this was more efficient than the run-length encoding used by PCX and MacPaint, fairly large images could be downloaded reasonably quickly even with slow modems.\nThe original version of GIF was called 87a. This version already supported multiple images in a stream.\nIn 1989, CompuServe released an enhanced version, called 89a, This version added:\nThe two versions can be distinguished by looking at the first six bytes of the file (the \"magic number\" or signature), which, when interpreted as ASCII, read \"GIF87a\" or \"GIF89a\", respectively.\nCompuServe encouraged the adoption of GIF by providing downloadable conversion utilities for many computers. By December 1987, for example, an Apple IIGS user could view pictures created on an Atari ST or Commodore 64. GIF was one of the first two image formats commonly used on Web sites, the other being the black-and-white XBM.\nIn September 1995 Netscape Navigator 2.0 added the ability for animated GIFs to loop.\nWhile GIF was developed by CompuServe, it used the Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch (LZW) lossless data compression algorithm patented by Unisys in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between Unisys and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) standard. In 2004, all patents relating to the proprietary compression used for GIF expired.\nThe feature of storing multiple images in one file, accompanied by control data, is used extensively on the Web to produce simple animations.\nThe optional interlacing feature, which stores image scan lines out of order in such a fashion that even a partially downloaded image was somewhat recognizable, also helped GIF's popularity, as a user could abort the download if it was not what was required.\nIn May 2015 Facebook added support for GIF. In 2014, Twitter, also added support to GIF as well as Instagram in 2018.\nIn 2016, the Internet Archive released a searchable library of GIFs from their GeoCities archive.\nTerminology.\nAs a noun, the word \"GIF\" is found in the newer editions of many dictionaries. In 2012, the American wing of the Oxford University Press recognized \"GIF\" as a verb as well, meaning \"to create a GIF file\", as in \"GIFing was the perfect medium for sharing scenes from the Summer Olympics\". The press's lexicographers voted it their word of the year, saying that GIFs have evolved into \"a tool with serious applications including research and journalism\".\nPronunciation.\nThe pronunciation of the first letter of \"GIF\" has been disputed since the 1990s. The most common pronunciations in English are (with a soft \"g\" as in \"gin\") and (with a hard \"g\" as in \"gift\"), differing in the phoneme represented by the letter \"G\". The creators of the format pronounced the acronym \"GIF\" as , with a soft \"g\", with Wilhite stating that he intended for the pronunciation to deliberately echo the American peanut butter brand Jif, and CompuServe employees would often quip \"choosy developers choose GIF\", a spoof of Jif's television commercials. However, the word is widely pronounced as , with a hard \"g\", and polls have generally shown that this hard \"g\" pronunciation is more prevalent.\n\"Dictionary.com\" cites both pronunciations, indicating as the primary pronunciation, while \"Cambridge Dictionary of American English\" offers only the hard-\"g\" pronunciation. \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\" and Oxford Dictionaries cite both pronunciations, but place the hard \"g\" first: . The \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" gave only in its second edition but updated it to in the third edition.\nThe disagreement over the pronunciation has led to heated Internet debate. On the occasion of receiving a lifetime achievement award at the 2013 Webby Awards ceremony, Wilhite publicly rejected the hard-\"g\" pronunciation; his speech led to more than 17,000 posts on Twitter and dozens of news articles. The White House and the TV program \"Jeopardy!\" also entered the debate in 2013. In February 2020, The J.M. Smucker Company, the owners of the Jif brand, partnered with the animated image database and search engine Giphy to release a limited-edition \"Jif vs. GIF\" (hashtagged as #JIFvsGIF) jar of peanut butter that had a label humorously declaring the soft-\"g\" pronunciation to refer exclusively to the peanut butter, and \"GIF\" to be exclusively pronounced with the hard-\"g\" pronunciation.\nUsage.\nGIFs are suitable for sharp-edged line art with a limited number of colors, such as logos. This takes advantage of the format's lossless compression, which favors flat areas of uniform color with well defined edges. They can also be used to store low-color sprite data for games. GIFs can be used for small animations and low-resolution video clips, or as reactions in online messaging used to convey emotion and feelings instead of using words. They are popular on social media platforms such as Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter.\nFile format.\nConceptually, a GIF file describes a fixed-sized graphical area (the \"logical screen\") populated with zero or more \"images\". Many GIF files have a single image that fills the entire logical screen. Others divide the logical screen into separate sub-images. The images may also function as animation frames in an animated GIF file, but again these need not fill the entire logical screen.\nGIF files start with a fixed-length header (\"GIF87a\" or \"GIF89a\") giving the version, followed by a fixed-length Logical Screen Descriptor giving the pixel dimensions and other characteristics of the logical screen. The screen descriptor may also specify the presence and size of a Global Color Table (GCT), which follows next if present.\nThereafter, the file is divided into segments of the following types, each introduced by a 1-byte sentinel:\nAn image starts with a fixed-length Image Descriptor, which may specify the presence and size of a Local Color Table (which follows next if present). The image data follows: one byte giving the bit width of the unencoded symbols (which must be at least 2 bits wide, even for bi-color images), followed by a series of sub-blocks containing the LZW-encoded data.\nExtension blocks (blocks that \"extend\" the 87a definition via a mechanism already defined in the 87a spec) consist of the sentinel, an additional byte specifying the type of extension, and a series of sub-blocks with the extension data. Extension blocks that modify an image (like the Graphic Control Extension that specifies the optional animation delay time and optional transparent background color) must immediately precede the segment with the image they refer to.\nEach sub-block begins with a byte giving the number of subsequent data bytes in the sub-block (1 to 255). The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a 0 byte).\nThis structure allows the file to be parsed even if not all parts are understood. A GIF marked 87a may contain extension blocks; the intent is that a decoder can read and display the file without the features covered in extensions it does not understand.\nThe full detail of the file format is covered in the GIF specification.\nPalettes.\nGIF is a palette-based image format: each frame contains up to 256 colors chosen from the full 24-bit RGB color space. These colors are defined in a table (palette), and each pixel refers to an index in this palette. Originally, this was appropriate for hardware with limited color support; today, it makes GIF ideal for simple graphics, line drawings, logos, and basic animations. To approximate more colors, dithering techniques are sometimes used, but these can reduce image clarity or increase file size.\nA GIF file may have a global color table, and each frame may also have a local color table. To conserve space, the specification allows color tables of 2\"n\" colors for any \"n\" from 1 through 8. Most graphics applications will read and display GIF images with any of these table sizes; but many do not support all sizes when \"creating\" images. Tables of 2, 16, and 256 colors are widely supported.\nGIF supports transparency, allowing one color to be marked as transparent so that backgrounds or layered effects can show through.\nTrue color.\nAlthough GIF is almost never used for true color images, it is possible to do so. A GIF image can include multiple image blocks, each of which can have its own 256-color palette, and the blocks can be tiled to create a complete image. Alternatively, the GIF89a specification introduced the idea of a \"transparent\" color where each image block can include its own palette of 255 visible colors plus one transparent color. A complete image can be created by layering image blocks with the visible portion of each layer showing through the transparent portions of the layers above.\nTo render a full-color image as a GIF, the original image must be broken down into smaller regions having no more than 255 or 256 different colors. Each of these regions is then stored as a separate image block with its own local palette and when the image blocks are displayed together (either by tiling or by layering partially transparent image blocks), the complete, full-color image appears. For example, breaking an image into tiles of 16 by 16 pixels (256 pixels in total) ensures that no tile has more than the local palette limit of 256 colors, although larger tiles may be used and similar colors merged resulting in some loss of color information.\nSince each image block can have its own local color table, a GIF file having many image blocks can be very large, limiting the usefulness of full-color GIFs. Additionally, not all GIF rendering programs handle tiled or layered images correctly. Many rendering programs interpret tiles or layers as animation frames and display them in sequence as an animation with most web browsers automatically displaying the frames with a delay time of 0.1 seconds or more.\nExample GIF file.\nThe hex numbers in the following tables are in little-endian byte order, as the format specification prescribes.\nImage coding.\nThe image pixel data, scanned horizontally from top left, are converted by LZW encoding to codes that are then mapped into bytes for storing in the file. The pixel codes typically don't match the 8-bit size of the bytes, so the codes are packed into bytes by a \"little-Endian\" scheme: the least significant bit of the first code is stored in the least significant bit of the first byte, higher order bits of the code into higher order bits of the byte, spilling over into the low order bits of the next byte as necessary. Each subsequent code is stored starting at the least significant bit not already used.\nThis byte stream is stored in the file as a series of \"sub-blocks\". Each sub-block has a maximum length 255 bytes and is prefixed with a byte indicating the number of data bytes in the sub-block. The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a single 0 byte, indicating a sub-block with 0 data bytes).\nFor the sample image above the reversible mapping between 9-bit codes and bytes is shown below.\nA slight compression is evident: pixel colors defined initially by 15 bytes are exactly represented by 12 code bytes including control codes.\nThe encoding process that produces the 9-bit codes is shown below. A local string accumulates pixel color numbers from the palette, with no output action as long as the local string can be found in a code table. There is special treatment of the first two pixels that arrive before the table grows from its initial size by additions of strings. After each output code, the local string is initialized to the latest pixel color (that could not be included in the output code).\n Table 9-bit\n string --&gt; code code Action\n #0 | 000h Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n palette | :\n colors | :\n #255 | 0FFh\n clr | 100h\n end | 101h\n | 100h Clear\n Pixel Local |\n color Palette string |\n BLACK #40 28 | 028h 1st pixel always to output\n WHITE #255 FF | String found in table\n 28 FF | 102h Always add 1st string to table\n FF | Initialize local string\n WHITE #255 FF FF | String not found in table\n | 0FFh - output code for previous string\n FF FF | 103h - add latest string to table\n FF | - initialize local string\n WHITE #255 FF FF | String found in table\n BLACK #40 FF FF 28 | String not found in table\n | 103h - output code for previous string\n FF FF 28 | 104h - add latest string to table\n 28 | - initialize local string\n WHITE #255 28 FF | String found in table\n WHITE #255 28 FF FF | String not found in table\n | 102h - output code for previous string\n 28 FF FF | 105h - add latest string to table\n FF | - initialize local string\n WHITE #255 FF FF | String found in table\n WHITE #255 FF FF FF | String not found in table\n | 103h - output code for previous string\n FF FF FF | 106h - add latest string to table\n FF | - initialize local string\n WHITE #255 FF FF | String found in table\n WHITE #255 FF FF FF | String found in table\n WHITE #255 FF FF FF FF | String not found in table\n | 106h - output code for previous string\n FF FF FF FF| 107h - add latest string to table\n FF | - initialize local string\n WHITE #255 FF FF | String found in table\n WHITE #255 FF FF FF | String found in table\n WHITE #255 FF FF FF FF | String found in table\n No more pixels\n 107h - output code for last string\n 101h End\nFor clarity the table is shown above as being built of strings of increasing length. That scheme can function but the table consumes an unpredictable amount of memory. Memory can be saved in practice by noting that each new string to be stored consists of a previously stored string augmented by one character. It is economical to store at each address only two words: an existing address and one character.\nThe LZW algorithm requires a search of the table for each pixel. A linear search through up to 4096 addresses would make the coding slow. In practice the codes can be stored in order of numerical value; this allows each search to be done by a SAR (Successive Approximation Register, as used in some ADCs), with only 12 magnitude comparisons. For this efficiency an extra table is needed to convert between codes and actual memory addresses; the extra table upkeeping is needed only when a new code is stored which happens at much less than pixel rate.\nImage decoding.\nDecoding begins by mapping the stored bytes back to 9-bit codes. These are decoded to recover the pixel colors as shown below. A table identical to the one used in the encoder is built by adding strings by this rule:\n shift\n 9-bit ----&gt; Local Table Pixel\n code code code --&gt; string Palette color Action\n 100h 000h | #0 Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n : | palette\n : | colors\n 0FFh | #255\n 100h | clr\n 101h | end\n 028h | #40 BLACK Decode 1st pixel\n 0FFh 028h | Incoming code found in table\n | #255 WHITE - output string from table\n 102h | 28 FF - add to table\n 103h 0FFh | Incoming code not found in table\n 103h | FF FF - add to table\n | - output string from table\n | #255 WHITE\n | #255 WHITE\n 102h 103h | Incoming code found in table\n | - output string from table\n | #40 BLACK\n | #255 WHITE\n 104h | FF FF 28 - add to table\n 103h 102h | Incoming code found in table\n | - output string from table\n | #255 WHITE\n | #255 WHITE\n 105h | 28 FF FF - add to table\n 106h 103h | Incoming code not found in table\n 106h | FF FF FF - add to table\n | - output string from table\n | #255 WHITE\n | #255 WHITE\n | #255 WHITE\n 107h 106h | Incoming code not found in table\n 107h | FF FF FF FF - add to table\n | - output string from table\n | #255 WHITE\n | #255 WHITE\n | #255 WHITE\n | #255 WHITE\n 101h | End\nLZW code lengths.\nShorter code lengths can be used for palettes smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If the palette is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width can be taken to be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match the palette size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in the palette, the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and the palette size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, if only the first four colors (values 0 to 3) of the palette are used, the symbols can be taken to be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.\nConversely, the symbol width could be set at 8, even if only values 0 and 1 are used; these data would only require a two-color table. Although there would be no point in encoding the file that way, something similar typically happens for bi-color images: the minimum symbol width is 2, even if only values 0 and 1 are used.\nThe code table initially contains codes that are one bit longer than the symbol size in order to accommodate the two special codes \"clr\" and \"end\" and codes for strings that are added during the process. When the table is full the code length increases to give space for more strings, up to a maximum code 4095 = FFF(hex). As the decoder builds its table it tracks these increases in code length and it is able to unpack incoming bytes accordingly.\nUncompressed GIF.\nThe GIF encoding process can be modified to create a file without LZW compression that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally as a way to avoid patent infringement. Uncompressed GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.\nThe modified encoding method ignores building the LZW table and emits only the root palette codes and the codes for CLEAR and STOP. This yields a simpler encoding (a 1-to-1 correspondence between code values and palette codes) but sacrifices all of the compression: each pixel in the image generates an output code indicating its color index. When processing an uncompressed GIF, a standard GIF decoder will not be prevented from writing strings to its dictionary table, but the code width must never increase since that triggers a different packing of bits to bytes.\nIf the symbol width is n, the codes of width \"n\"+1 fall naturally into two blocks: the lower block of 2\"n\" codes for coding single symbols, and the upper block of 2\"n\" codes that will be used by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2\"n\" for CLEAR and 2\"n\" + 1 for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2\"n\"+1 \u2212 1, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2\"n\" \u2212 3 codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate 2\"n\" \u2212 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore, the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2\"n\" \u2212 2 codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.\nFor the sample 3\u00d75 image above, the following 9-bit codes represent \"clear\" (100) followed by image pixels in scan order and \"stop\" (101).\n 100 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 101\nAfter the above codes are mapped to bytes, the uncompressed file differs from the compressed file thus:\nCompression example.\nThe trivial example of a large image of solid color demonstrates the variable-length LZW compression used in GIF files.\nThe code values shown are packed into bytes which are then packed into blocks of up to 255 bytes. A block of image data begins with a byte that declares the number of bytes to follow. The last block of data for an image is marked by a zero block-length byte.\nInterlacing.\nThe GIF Specification allows each image within the logical screen of a GIF file to specify that it is interlaced; i.e., that the order of the raster lines in its data block is not sequential. This allows a partial display of the image that can be recognized before the full image is painted.\nAn interlaced image is divided from top to bottom into strips 8 pixels high, and the rows of the image are presented in the following order:\nThe pixels within each line are not interlaced, but presented consecutively from left to right. As with non-interlaced images, there is no break between the data for one line and the data for the next. The indicator that an image is interlaced is a bit set in the corresponding Image Descriptor block.\nAnimated GIF.\nAlthough GIF was not designed as an animation medium, its ability to store multiple images in one file naturally suggested using the format to store the frames of an animation sequence. To facilitate \"displaying\" animations, the GIF89a spec added the Graphic Control Extension (GCE), which allows the images (frames) in the file to be painted with time delays, forming a video clip. Each frame in an animation GIF is introduced by its own GCE specifying the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information at the start of the file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.\nBy default, an animation displays the sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. To enable an animation to loop, Netscape in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to the GIF file) to implement the Netscape Application Block (NAB). This block, placed immediately before the sequence of animation frames, specifies the number of times the sequence of frames should be played (1 to 65535 times) or that it should repeat continuously (zero indicates loop forever). Support for these repeating animations first appeared in Netscape Navigator version 2.0, and then spread to other browsers. Most browsers now recognize and support NAB, though it is not strictly part of the GIF89a specification.\nThe following example shows the structure of the animation file \"\" shown (as a thumbnail) in the article's infobox.\nThe animation delay for each frame is specified in the GCE in hundredths of a second. Some economy of data is possible where a frame need only rewrite a portion of the pixels of the display, because the Image Descriptor can define a smaller rectangle to be rescanned instead of the whole image. Browsers or other displays that do not support animated GIFs typically show only the first frame.\nThe size and color quality of animated GIF files can vary significantly depending on the application used to create them. Strategies for minimizing file size include using a common global color table for all frames (rather than a complete local color table for each frame) and minimizing the number of pixels covered in successive frames (so that only the pixels that change from one frame to the next are included in the latter frame). More advanced techniques involve modifying color sequences to better match the existing LZW dictionary, a form of lossy compression. Simply packing a series of independent frame images into a composite animation tends to yield large file sizes. Tools are available to minimize the file size given an existing GIF.\nMetadata.\nMetadata can be stored in GIF files as a comment block, a plain text block, or an application-specific application extension block. Several graphics editors use unofficial application extension blocks to include the data used to generate the image, so that it can be recovered for further editing.\nAll of these methods technically require the metadata to be broken into sub-blocks so that applications can navigate the metadata block without knowing its internal structure.\nThe Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) metadata standard introduced an unofficial but now widespread \"XMP Data\" application extension block for including XMP data in GIF files. Since the XMP data is encoded using UTF-8 without NUL characters, there are no 0 bytes in the data. Rather than break the data into formal sub-blocks, the extension block terminates with a \"magic trailer\" that routes any application treating the data as sub-blocks to a final 0 byte that terminates the sub-block chain.\nUnisys and LZW patent enforcement.\nIn 1977 and 1978, Jacob Ziv and Abraham Lempel published a pair of papers on a new class of lossless data-compression algorithms, now collectively referred to as LZ77 and LZ78. In 1983, Terry Welch developed a fast variant of LZ78 which was named Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch (LZW).\nWelch filed a patent application for the LZW method in June 1983. The resulting patent, US4558302, granted in December 1985, was assigned to Sperry Corporation who subsequently merged with Burroughs Corporation in 1986 and formed Unisys. Further patents were obtained in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada.\nIn addition to the above patents, Welch's 1983 patent also includes citations to several other patents that influenced it, including:\nIn June 1984, an article by Welch was published in the IEEE magazine which publicly described the LZW technique for the first time. LZW became a popular data compression technique and, when the patent was granted, Unisys entered into licensing agreements with over a hundred companies.\nThe popularity of LZW led CompuServe to choose it as the compression technique for their version of GIF, developed in 1987. At the time, CompuServe was not aware of the patent. Unisys became aware that the version of GIF used the LZW compression technique and entered into licensing negotiations with CompuServe in January 1993. The subsequent agreement was announced on 24 December 1994. Unisys stated that they expected all major commercial on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate, but that they would not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial, non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line services.\nFollowing this announcement, there was widespread condemnation of CompuServe and Unisys, and many software developers threatened to stop using GIF. The PNG format (see below) was developed in 1995 as an intended replacement. However, obtaining support from the makers of Web browsers and other software for the PNG format proved difficult and it was not possible to replace GIF, although PNG has gradually increased in popularity. Therefore, GIF variations without LZW compression were developed. For instance the libungif library, based on Eric S. Raymond's giflib, allows creation of GIFs that followed the data format but avoided the compression features, thus avoiding use of the Unisys LZW patent. A 2001 \"Dr. Dobb's\" article described a way to achieve LZW-compatible encoding for data that would compress well under a run-length encoding mechanism without infringing on its patents.\nIn August 1999, Unisys changed the details of their licensing practice, announcing the option for owners of certain non-commercial and private websites to obtain licenses on payment of a one-time license fee of $5000 or $7500. Such licenses were not required for website owners or other GIF users who had used licensed software to generate GIFs. Nevertheless, Unisys was subjected to thousands of online attacks and abusive emails from users believing that they were going to be charged $5000 or sued for using GIFs on their websites. Despite giving free licenses to hundreds of non-profit organizations, schools and governments, Unisys was completely unable to generate any good publicity and continued to be condemned by individuals and organizations such as the League for Programming Freedom who started the \"Burn All GIFs\" campaign in 1999.\nThe United States LZW patent expired on 20 June 2003. The counterpart patents in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy expired on 18 June 2004, the Japanese patents expired on 20 June 2004, and the Canadian patent expired on 7 July 2004. Consequently, while Unisys has further patents and patent applications relating to improvements to the LZW technique, LZW itself (and consequently GIF) have been free to use since July 2004.\nAlternatives.\nPNG.\nPortable Network Graphics (PNG) was designed as a replacement for GIF in order to avoid infringement of Unisys' patent on the LZW compression technique. PNG offers better compression and more features than GIF, animation being the only significant exception. PNG is more suitable than GIF in instances where true-color imaging and alpha transparency are required.\nAlthough support for PNG format came slowly, new web browsers support PNG. Older versions of Internet Explorer do not support all features of PNG. Versions 6 and earlier do not support alpha channel transparency without using Microsoft-specific HTML extensions. Gamma correction of PNG images was not supported before version 8, and the display of these images in earlier versions may have the wrong tint.\nFor identical 8-bit (or lower) image data, PNG files are typically smaller than the equivalent GIFs, due to the more efficient compression techniques used in PNG encoding. Complete support for GIF is complicated chiefly by the complex canvas structure it allows, though this is what enables the compact animation features.\nAnimation formats.\nVideos resolve many issues that GIFs present through common usage on the web. They include drastically smaller file sizes, the ability to surpass the 8-bit color restriction, and better frame-handling and compression through inter-frame coding. Virtually universal support for the GIF format in web browsers and a lack of official support for video in the HTML standard caused GIF to rise to prominence for the purpose of displaying short video-like files on the web.\n The PNG group officially rejected APNG as an official extension on 20 April 2007.\n There have been several subsequent proposals for a simple animated graphics format based on PNG using several different approaches. Nevertheless, APNG is still under development by Mozilla and is supported in Firefox 3.0 while MNG support was dropped. APNG is currently supported by all major web browsers including Chrome (since version 59.0), Opera, Firefox and Edge.\n Notable examples are Gfycat and Imgur and their GIFV metaformat, which is really a video tag playing a looped MP4 or WebM compressed video.\n Compared to the GIF format, which lacks DCT compression, HEIF allows significantly more efficient compression. HEIF stores more information and produces higher-quality animated images at a small fraction of an equivalent GIF's size.\nUses.\nIn April 2014, 4chan added support for silent WebM videos that are under 3 MB in size and 2 min in length, and in October 2014, Imgur started converting any GIF files uploaded to the site to H.264 video and giving the link to the HTML player the appearance of an actual file with a codice_2 extension.\nIn January 2016, Telegram started re-encoding all GIFs to MPEG-4 videos that \"require up to 95% less disk space for the same image quality.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He specialises in hard science fiction stories with mathematical and quantum ontology themes, including the nature of consciousness. Other themes include genetics, simulated reality, posthumanism, mind uploading, sexuality, artificial intelligence, and the superiority of rational naturalism to religion. He often deals with complex technical material, like new physics and epistemology. He is a Hugo Award winner (with eight other works shortlisted for the Hugos) and has also won the John W.

His early stories feature strong elements of supernatural horror.\nEgan's short stories have been published in a variety of genre magazines, including regular appearances in \"Interzone\" and \"Asimov's Science Fiction\".\nMathematics.\nIn 2002, Egan co-authored two papers about Riemannian 10j symbols, spin networks appearing in Riemannian quantum gravity, together with John Baez and Dan Christensen. Spin networks also play a central role in his novel \"Schild's Ladder\" released the same year.\nIn 2014, Egan conjectured a generalization of the Grace\u2013Danielsson inequality about the relation of the radii of two spheres and the distance of their respective centres to fit a simplex between them to also hold in higher dimensions, which later became known as the Egan conjecture. A proof of the inequality being sufficient was published by him in 2014 under a blog post of John Baez. They were lost due to a rearrangement of the website, but the central parts were copied into the original blog post.

{"id": "12707", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12707", "title": "Guy Fawkes", "text": "English participant in the Gunpowder Plot (1570\u20131606)\nGuy Fawkes (; 13 April 1570\u00a0\u2013 31 January 1606), also known as Guido Fawkes while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics involved in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. He was born and educated in York; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic.\nFawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the Eighty Years' War against Protestant Dutch reformers in the Low Countries. He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success. He later met Thomas Wintour, with whom he returned to England. Wintour introduced him to Robert Catesby, who planned to assassinate King James I and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. The plotters leased an undercroft beneath the House of Lords; Fawkes was placed in charge of the gunpowder that they stockpiled there. The authorities were prompted by an anonymous letter to search Westminster Palace during the early hours of 5 November, and they found Fawkes guarding the explosives. He was questioned and tortured over the next few days and confessed to wanting to blow up the House of Lords.\nFawkes was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. However, at his execution on 31 January, he died when his neck was broken as he was hanged, with some sources claiming that he deliberately jumped to make this happen; he thus avoided the agony of his sentence. He became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been commemorated in the UK as Guy Fawkes Night since 5 November 1605, when his effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, commonly accompanied by fireworks.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nGuy Fawkes was born in 1570 in Stonegate, York. He was the second of four children born to Edward Fawkes, a proctor and an advocate of the consistory court at York, and his wife, Edith. Guy's parents were regular communicants of the Church of England, as were his paternal grandparents; his grandmother, born Ellen Harrington, was the daughter of a prominent merchant, who served as Lord Mayor of York in 1536. Guy's mother's family were recusant Catholics, and his cousin, Richard Cowling, became a Jesuit priest. \"Guy\" was an uncommon name in England, but may have been popular in York on account of a local notable, Sir Guy Fairfax of Steeton.\nThe date of Fawkes's birth is unknown, but he was baptised in the church of St Michael le Belfrey, York on 16 April. As the customary gap between birth and baptism was three days, he was probably born about 13 April. In 1568, Edith had given birth to a daughter named Anne, but the child died aged about seven weeks, in November that year. She bore two more children after Guy: Anne (b.\u00a01572), and Elizabeth (b.\u00a01575). Both were married, in 1599 and 1594, respectively.\nIn 1579, when Guy was eight years old, his father died. His mother remarried several years later, to the Catholic Dionis Baynbrigge (or Denis Bainbridge) of Scotton, Harrogate. Fawkes may have become a Catholic through the Baynbrigge family's recusant tendencies, and also the Catholic branches of the Pulleyn and Percy families of Scotton, but also from his time at St. Peter's School in York. A governor of the school had spent about 20\u00a0years in prison for recusancy, and its headmaster, John Pulleyn, came from a family of noted Yorkshire recusants, the Pulleyns of Blubberhouses. In her 1915 work \"The Pulleynes of Yorkshire\", author Catharine Pullein suggested that Fawkes's Catholic education came from his Harrington relatives, who were known for harbouring priests, one of whom later accompanied Fawkes to Flanders in 1592\u201393. Fawkes's fellow students included John Wright and his brother Christopher (both later involved with Fawkes in the Gunpowder Plot) and Oswald Tesimond, Edward Oldcorne and Robert Middleton, who became priests (the latter executed in 1601).\nAfter leaving school Fawkes entered the service of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu. The Viscount took a dislike to Fawkes and after a short time dismissed him; he was subsequently employed by Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu, who succeeded his grandfather at the age of\u00a018. At least one source claims that Fawkes married and had a son, but no known contemporary accounts confirm this.\nMilitary career.\nIn October 1591 Fawkes sold the estate in Clifton in York that he had inherited from his father. He travelled to the continent to fight in the Eighty Years' War for Catholic Spain against the new Dutch Republic and, from 1595 until the Peace of Vervins in 1598, France. Although England was not by then engaged in land operations against Spain, the two countries were still at war, and the attempted invasion of England, led by the Spanish Armada in 1588, was only five years in the past. He joined Sir William Stanley, an English Catholic and veteran commander in his mid-forties who had raised an army in Ireland to fight in Leicester's expedition to the Netherlands. Stanley had been held in high regard by Elizabeth I, but following his surrender of Deventer to the Spanish in 1587 he, and most of his troops, had switched sides to serve Spain. Fawkes became an or junior officer, fought well at the siege of Calais in 1596, and by 1603 had been recommended for a captaincy. That year, he travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England. He used the occasion to adopt the Italian version of his name, Guido, and in his memorandum described James I (who became king of England that year) as \"a heretic\", who intended \"to have all of the Papist sect driven out of England\". He denounced Scotland, and the king's favourites among the Scottish nobles, writing \"it will not be possible to reconcile these two nations, as they are, for very long\". Although he was received politely, the court of Philip III was unwilling to offer him any support.\nGunpowder Plot.\nIn 1604 Fawkes became involved with a small group of English Catholics, led by Robert Catesby, who planned to assassinate the Protestant King James and replace him with his daughter, third in the line of succession, Princess Elizabeth. Fawkes was described by the Jesuit priest and former school friend Oswald Tesimond as \"pleasant of approach and cheerful of manner, opposed to quarrels and strife\u00a0... loyal to his friends\". Tesimond also claimed Fawkes was \"a man highly skilled in matters of war\", and that it was this mixture of piety and professionalism that endeared him to his fellow conspirators. The author Antonia Fraser describes Fawkes as \"a tall, powerfully built man, with thick reddish-brown hair, a flowing moustache in the tradition of the time, and a bushy reddish-brown beard\", and that he was \"a man of action\u00a0... capable of intelligent argument as well as physical endurance, somewhat to the surprise of his enemies.\"\nThe first meeting of the five central conspirators took place on Sunday 20 May 1604, at an inn called the Duck and Drake, in the fashionable Strand district of London. Catesby had already proposed at an earlier meeting with Thomas Wintour and John Wright to kill the king and his government by blowing up \"the Parliament House with gunpowder\". Wintour, who at first objected to the plan, was convinced by Catesby to travel to the continent to seek help. Wintour met with the Constable of Castile, the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would receive no support from Spain. Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Fawkes, who had by then been away from England for many years, and thus was largely unknown in the country. Wintour and Fawkes were contemporaries; each was militant, and had first-hand experience of the unwillingness of the Spaniards to help. Wintour told Fawkes of their plan to \"doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott\", and thus in April 1604 the two men returned to England. Wintour's news did not surprise Catesby; despite positive noises from the Spanish authorities, he feared that \"the deeds would nott answere\".\nOne of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was appointed a Gentleman Pensioner in June 1604, gaining access to a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe. Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story may have been a government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel. If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby undercroft, directly beneath the House of Lords.\nThe plotters purchased the lease to the room, which also belonged to John Whynniard. Unused and filthy, it was considered an ideal hiding place for the gunpowder the plotters planned to store. According to Fawkes, twenty barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by sixteen more on 20 July. On 28 July, however, the ever-present threat of the plague delayed the opening of Parliament until Tuesday, 5 November.\nOverseas.\nIn an attempt to gain foreign support, in May 1605 Fawkes travelled overseas and informed Hugh Owen of the plotters' plan. At some point during this trip his name made its way into the files of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who employed a network of spies across Europe. One of these spies, Captain William Turner, may have been responsible. Although the information he provided to Salisbury usually amounted to no more than a vague pattern of invasion reports, and included nothing which regarded the Gunpowder Plot, on 21 April he told how Fawkes was to be brought by Tesimond to England. Fawkes was a well-known Flemish mercenary, and would be introduced to \"Mr Catesby\" and \"honourable friends of the nobility and others who would have arms and horses in readiness\". Turner's report did not, however, mention Fawkes's pseudonym in England, John Johnson, and did not reach Cecil until late in November, well after the plot had been discovered.\nIt is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed. More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it. Fawkes's final role in the plot was settled during a series of meetings in October. He was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames. Simultaneously, a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth. Acts of regicide were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to the continent, where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the king and his retinue.\nDiscovery.\nA few of the conspirators were concerned about fellow Catholics who would be present at Parliament during the opening. On the evening of 26 October, Lord Monteagle received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away, and to \"retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for\u00a0... they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament\". Despite quickly becoming aware of the letter\u2014informed by one of Monteagle's servants\u2014the conspirators resolved to continue with their plans, as it appeared that it \"was clearly thought to be a hoax\". Fawkes checked the undercroft on 30 October, and reported that nothing had been disturbed. Monteagle's suspicions had been aroused, however, and the letter was shown to King James. The king ordered Sir Thomas Knyvet to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November. Fawkes had taken up his station late on the previous night, armed with a slow match and a watch given to him by Percy \"becaus he should knowe howe the time went away\". He was found leaving the cellar, shortly after midnight, and arrested. Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.\nTorture.\nFawkes gave his name as John Johnson and was first interrogated by members of the king's Privy chamber, where he remained defiant. When asked by one of the lords what he was doing in possession of so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered that his intention was \"to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains.\" He identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his father's name as Thomas and his mother's as Edith Jackson. Wounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of pleurisy. Fawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so. His steadfast manner impressed King James, who described Fawkes as possessing \"a Roman resolution\".\nJames's respect did not, however, prevent him from ordering on 6 November that \"John Johnson\" be tortured, to reveal the names of his co-conspirators. He directed that the torture be light at first, referring to the use of manacles, but more severe if necessary, authorising the use of the rack: \"the gentler Tortures are to be first used unto him [and so by degrees proceeding to the worst]\". Fawkes was transferred to the Tower of London. The king composed a list of questions to be put to \"Johnson\", such as \"\"as to what he is\", For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him\", \"When and where he learned to speak French?\", and \"If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it?\" The room in which Fawkes was interrogated subsequently became known as the Guy Fawkes Room.\nSir William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, supervised the torture and obtained Fawkes's confession. He searched his prisoner, and found a letter addressed to Guy Fawkes. To Waad's surprise, \"Johnson\" remained silent, revealing nothing about the plot or its authors. On the night of 6 November he spoke with Waad, who reported to Salisbury \"He [Johnson] told us that since he undertook this action he did every day pray to God he might perform that which might be for the advancement of the Catholic Faith and saving his own soul\". According to Waad, Fawkes managed to rest through the night, despite his being warned that he would be interrogated until \"I had gotton the inwards secret of his thoughts and all his complices\". His composure was broken at some point during the following day.\nThe observer Sir Edward Hoby remarked \"Since Johnson's being in the Tower, he beginneth to speak English\". Fawkes revealed his true identity on 7 November, and told his interrogators that there were five people involved in the plot to kill the king. He began to reveal their names on 8 November, and told how they intended to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne. His third confession, on 9 November, implicated Francis Tresham. Following the Ridolfi plot of 1571, prisoners were made to dictate their confessions, before copying and signing them, if they still could. Although it is uncertain if he was tortured on the rack, Fawkes's scrawled signature suggests the suffering he endured at the hands of his interrogators.\nTrial and execution.\nThe trial of eight of the plotters began on Monday 27 January 1606. Fawkes shared the barge from the Tower to Westminster Hall with seven of his co-conspirators. They were kept in the Star Chamber before being taken to Westminster Hall, where they were displayed on a purpose-built scaffold. The king and his close family, watching in secret, were among the spectators as the Lords Commissioners read out the list of charges. Fawkes was identified as Guido Fawkes, \"otherwise called Guido Johnson\". He pleaded not guilty, despite his apparent acceptance of guilt from the moment he was captured.\nThe jury found all the defendants guilty, and the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham pronounced them guilty of high treason. The Attorney General Sir Edward Coke told the court that each of the condemned would be drawn backwards to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. They were to be \"put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both\". Their genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed. They would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become \"prey for the fowls of the air\". Fawkes's and Tresham's testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot. The last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells. The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy. When the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.\nOn 31 January 1606, Fawkes and three others\u2014Thomas Wintour, Ambrose Rookwood and Robert Keyes\u2014were dragged from the Tower on wattled hurdles to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had attempted to destroy. His fellow plotters were then hanged and quartered. Fawkes was the last to stand on the scaffold. He asked for forgiveness of the king and state, while keeping up his \"crosses and idle ceremonies\" (Catholic practices). Weakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck. His lifeless body was nevertheless quartered and, as was the custom, his body parts were then distributed to \"the four corners of the kingdom\", to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.\nLegacy.\nOn 5 November 1605, Londoners were encouraged to celebrate the king's escape from assassination by lighting bonfires, provided that \"this testemonye of joy be carefull done without any danger or disorder\". An Act of Parliament designated each 5 November as a day of thanksgiving for \"the joyful day of deliverance\", and remained in force until 1859. Fawkes was one of 13\u00a0conspirators, but he is the individual most associated with the plot.\nIn Britain, 5 November has variously been called Guy Fawkes Night, Guy Fawkes Day, Plot Night, and Bonfire Night (which can be traced directly back to the original celebration of 5 November 1605). Bonfires were accompanied by fireworks from the 1650s onwards, and it became the custom after 1673 to burn an effigy (usually of the pope) when heir presumptive James, Duke of York, converted to Catholicism. Effigies of other notable figures have found their way onto the bonfires, such as Paul Kruger, Margaret Thatcher, Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak and Vladimir Putin. The \"guy\" is normally created by children from old clothes, newspapers, and a mask. During the 19th century, \"guy\" came to mean an oddly dressed person, while in many places it has lost any pejorative connotation and instead refers to any male person and the plural form can refer to people of any gender (as in \"you guys\").\nJames Sharpe, professor of history at the University of York, has described how Guy Fawkes came to be toasted as \"the last man to enter Parliament with honest intentions\". William Harrison Ainsworth's 1841 historical romance \"Guy Fawkes; or, The Gunpowder Treason\" portrays Fawkes in a generally sympathetic light and his novel transformed Fawkes in the public perception into an \"acceptable fictional character\". Fawkes subsequently appeared as \"essentially an action hero\" in children's books and penny dreadfuls such as \"The Boyhood Days of Guy Fawkes; or, The Conspirators of Old London\", published around 1905. According to the historian Lewis Call, Fawkes is now \"a major icon in modern political culture\", whose face has become \"a potentially powerful instrument for the articulation of postmodern anarchism\" in the late 20th century. Fawkes is regarded by some as a martyr, political rebel or freedom-fighter, especially amongst a minority of Catholics in the United Kingdom.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Warnings about a computer virus named \"Good Times\" began being passed around among Internet users in 1994. The Goodtimes virus was supposedly transmitted via an email bearing the subject header \"Good Times\" or \"Goodtimes\", hence the virus's name, and the warning recommended deleting any such email unread. The virus described in the warnings did not exist, but the warnings themselves were, in effect, virus-like. In 1997 the Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective announced that they had been responsible for the perpetration of the \"Good Times\" virus hoax as an exercise to \"prove the gullibility of self-proclaimed 'experts' on the Internet\".\nHistory.\nThe first recorded email warnings about the Good Times virus showed up on 15 November 1994. The first message was brief, a simple five sentence email with a Christmas greeting, advising recipients not to open email messages with the subject \"GOOD TIMES!!\", as doing so would \"ruin\" their files. Later messages became more intricate. The most common versions\u2014the \"Infinite loop\" and \"ASCII buffer\" editions\u2014were much longer, containing descriptions of what exactly Good Times would do to the computer of someone who opened it, as well as comparisons to other viruses of the time, and references to a U.S. Federal Communications Commission warning. The warning emails themselves usually contained the very subject line warned against.\nSample email.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;FYI, a file, going under the name \"Good Times\" is being sent to some Internet users who subscribe to on-line services (Compuserve, Prodigy and America On Line). If you should receive this file, do not download it! Delete it immediately. I understand that there is a virus included in that file, which if downloaded to your personal computer, will ruin all of your files.\nPurported effects.\nThe longer version of the Good Times warning contained descriptions of what Good Times was supposedly capable of doing to computers. In addition to sending itself to every email address in a recipient's received or sent mail, the Good Times virus caused a wide variety of other effects. For example, one version said that if an infected computer contained a hard drive, it could be destroyed. If Good Times was not stopped in time, an infected computer would enter an \"nth-complexity infinite binary loop\" (a meaningless term), damaging the processor. The \"ASCII\" buffer email described the mechanism of Good Times as a buffer overflow.\nHoaxes similar to Good Times.\nA number of computer virus hoaxes appeared after the Good Times hoax had begun to be widely shared. These messages were similar in form to Good Times, warning users not to open messages bearing particular subject lines. Subject lines mentioned in these emails include \"Penpal greetings\", \"Free Money\", \"Deeyenda\", \"Invitation\", and \"Win a Holiday\".\nThe Bad Times computer virus warning is generally considered to be a spoof of the Good Times warning.\nViruses that function like Good Times.\nDevelopments in mail systems, such as Microsoft Outlook, without sufficient thought for security implications, made viruses that indeed propagate themselves via email possible. Notable examples include the Melissa worm, the ILOVEYOU virus, and the Anna Kournikova virus. In some cases, a user must open a document or program contained in an email message in order to spread the virus; in others, notably the Kak worm, merely opening or previewing an email message itself will trigger the virus.\nSome e-mail viruses written after the Good Times scare contained text announcing that \"This virus is called 'Good Times'\", presumably hoping to gain kudos amongst other virus writers by appearing to have created a worldwide scare. In general, virus researchers avoided naming these viruses as \"Good Times\", but an obvious potential for confusion exists, and some anti-virus tools may well detect a real virus they identify as \"Good Times\", though this will not be the cause of the original scare.\nSpoofs.\nWeird Al Yankovic made a song parody of the virus titled \"Virus Alert\".\nThe Bad Times virus hoax was created years later.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His early poetry has been associated with the Beat Generation and the San Francisco Renaissance and he has been described as the \"poet laureate of Deep Ecology\".\nSnyder is a winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the American Book Award. His work, in his various roles, reflects an immersion in both Buddhist spirituality and nature. He has translated literature into English from ancient Chinese and modern Japanese. For many years, Snyder was an academic at the University of California, Davis, and for a time served as a member of the California Arts Council.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nSnyder was born in San Francisco, California, to Harold and Lois Hennessy Snyder. Snyder is of German, Scottish, Irish and English ancestry. His family, impoverished by the Great Depression, moved to King County, Washington, when he was two years old. There, they tended dairy-cows, kept laying-hens, had a small orchard, and made cedar-wood shingles. At the age of seven, Snyder was bedridden for four months by an accident. \"So my folks brought me piles of books from the Seattle Public Library,\" he recalled in an interview, \"and it was then I really learned to read and from that time on was voracious \u2014 I figure that accident changed my life. At the end of four months, I had read more than most kids do by the time they're eighteen. And I didn't stop.\" Also during his ten childhood years in Washington, Snyder became aware of the presence of the Coast Salish people and developed an interest in the Native American peoples in general and their traditional relationship with nature.\nIn 1942, following his parents' divorce, Snyder moved to Portland, Oregon, with his mother and his younger sister, Anthea. Their mother, Lois Snyder Hennessy (born Wilkey), worked during this period as a reporter for \"The Oregonian\". One of his boyhood jobs was as a newspaper copy-boy at the \"Oregonian\". During his teen years, he attended Lincoln High School, worked as a camp counselor, and went mountain-climbing with the Mazamas youth-group. Climbing remained an interest of his, especially during his twenties and thirties. In 1947, he started attending Reed College on a scholarship. Here, he met, and, for a time, roomed with the writer Carl Proujan, and became acquainted with the young poets Philip Whalen and Lew Welch. During his time at Reed, Snyder published his first poems in a student journal. In 1948 he spent the summer working as a seaman. To get this job, he joined the now-defunct Marine Cooks and Stewards union, and would later work as a seaman in the mid-1950s to gain experience of other cultures in port cities. Snyder married Alison Gass in 1950; they separated after seven months, and divorced in 1952.\nWhile attending Reed, Snyder conducted folklore research on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in central Oregon. He graduated with a dual degree in anthropology and literature in 1951. Snyder's senior thesis, entitled \"The Dimensions of a Myth\", employed perspectives from anthropology, folklore, psychology, and literature to examine a myth of the Pacific Northwest's Haida people. He spent the following few summers working as a timber scaler at Warm Springs, developing relationships with its people that were rooted less in academia. This experience formed the basis for some of his earliest published poems (including \"A Berry Feast\"), later collected in the book \"The Back Country\". He also encountered the basic ideas of Buddhism and, through its arts, some East Asian traditional attitudes toward nature. He went to Indiana University with a graduate fellowship to study anthropology. (Snyder also began practicing self-taught Zen meditation.) He left after a single semester to return to San Francisco and to 'sink or swim as a poet'. Snyder worked for two summers in the North Cascades in Washington as a fire lookout, on Crater Mountain in 1952 and Sourdough Mountain in 1953 (both locations on the upper Skagit River). His attempts to get another lookout stint in 1954 (at the peak of McCarthyism), however, failed. He found himself barred from working for the government due to his association with the Marine Cooks and Stewards. Instead, he went back to Warm Springs to work in logging as a choker setter. This experience contributed to his \"Myths and Texts\" and the essay \"Ancient Forests of the Far West\".\nThe Beats.\nBack in San Francisco, Snyder lived with Whalen, who shared his growing interest in Zen. Snyder's reading of the writings of D. T. Suzuki had in fact been a factor in his decision not to continue as a graduate student in anthropology, and in 1953 he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to study Asian culture and languages. He studied ink and wash painting under Chiura Obata and Tang dynasty poetry under Ch'en Shih-hsiang. Snyder continued to spend summers working in the forests, including one summer as a trail-builder in Yosemite. He spent some months in 1955 and 1956 living in a cabin (which he dubbed \"Marin-an\") outside Mill Valley, California with Jack Kerouac. It was also at this time that Snyder was an occasional student at the American Academy of Asian Studies, where Saburo Hasegawa and Alan Watts, among others, were teaching. Hasegawa introduced Snyder to the treatment of landscape painting as a meditative practice. This inspired Snyder to attempt something equivalent in poetry, and with Hasegawa's encouragement, he began work on \"Mountains and Rivers Without End\", which would be completed and published 40 years later. During these years, Snyder was writing and collecting his own work, as well as embarking on the translation of the \"Cold Mountain\" poems by the 8th-century Chinese recluse Han Shan; this work appeared in chapbook form in 1959, under the title \"Riprap &amp; Cold Mountain Poems\".\nSnyder met Allen Ginsberg when the latter sought Snyder out on the recommendation of Kenneth Rexroth. Then, through Ginsberg, Snyder and Kerouac came to know each other. This period provided the materials for Kerouac's novel \"The Dharma Bums\", and Snyder was the inspiration for the novel's main character, Japhy Ryder, in the same way Neal Cassady had inspired Dean Moriarty in \"On the Road\". As the large majority of people in the Beat movement had urban backgrounds, writers like Ginsberg and Kerouac found Snyder, with his backcountry and manual-labor experience and interest in things rural, a refreshing and almost exotic individual. Lawrence Ferlinghetti later referred to Snyder as 'the Thoreau of the Beat Generation'.\nSnyder read his poem \"A Berry Feast\" at the poetry reading at the Six Gallery in San Francisco (October 7, 1955) that heard the first reading of Ginsberg's poem \"Howl\" and marked the emergence into mainstream publicity of the Beats. This also marked Snyder's first involvement with the Beats, although he was not a member of the original New York circle, having entered the scene through his association with Whalen and Welch. As recounted in Kerouac's \"Dharma Bums\", even at age 25 Snyder felt he could have a role in the fateful future meeting of West and East. Snyder's first book, \"Riprap\", which drew on his experiences as a forest lookout and on the trail crew in Yosemite, was published in 1959.\nJapan and India.\nIndependently, some of the Beats, including Whalen, had become interested in Zen, but Snyder was one of the more serious scholars of the subject among them, preparing in every way he could think of for eventual study in Japan. In 1955, the First Zen Institute of America offered him a scholarship for a year of Zen training in Japan, but the State Department refused to issue him a passport, informing him that \"it has been alleged you are a Communist.\" A subsequent District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruling forced a change in policy, and Snyder got his passport. In the end, his expenses were paid by Ruth Fuller Sasaki, for whom he was supposed to work; but initially he served as personal attendant and English tutor to Zen abbot Miura Isshu, at Rinko-in, a temple in Shokoku-ji in Kyoto, where American Buddhist popularizer Dwight Goddard and British author and Japanese culture devotee R. H. Blyth had preceded him. Mornings, after \"zazen\", \"sutra\" chanting, and chores for the abbot, he took Japanese classes, bringing his spoken Japanese up to a level sufficient for \"k\u014dan\" study. He developed a friendship with Philip Yampolsky, an eminent translator and scholar of Zen Buddhism, who took him around Kyoto. In early July 1955, he took refuge and requested to become Miura's disciple, thus formally becoming a Buddhist.\nIn 1958, he returned to California via the Persian Gulf, Turkey, Sri Lanka and various Pacific Islands, voyaging as a crewman in the engine room on the oil tanker \"Sappa Creek\", and took up residence at Marin-an again. He turned one room into a \"zendo\", with about six regular participants. In early June, he met the poet Joanne Kyger. She became his girlfriend, and eventually his wife. In 1959, he shipped for Japan again, where he rented a cottage outside Kyoto. He became the first foreign disciple of Rinzai \"R\u014dshi\" Oda Sesso, the new abbot of Daitoku-ji. He married Kyger on February 28, 1960, immediately after her arrival in Japan, which Fuller Sasaki insisted they do, if they were to live together and be associated with the Nichibei Daiichi Zen Kyokai. Snyder and Kyger were married from 1960 to 1965.\nDuring the period between 1956 and 1969, Snyder went back and forth between California and Japan, studying Zen, working on translations with Fuller Sasaki, and finally living for a while with a group of other people on the small, volcanic island of Suwanosejima. His previous study of written Chinese assisted his immersion in the Zen tradition, which has its roots in Tang dynasty China, and enabled him to support himself while he was living in Japan. Snyder received the Zen precepts and his dharma name of \"Chofu\" (\"Listen to the Wind\"), and lived occasionally as a \"de facto\" monk, but never registered to become a priest, planning eventually to return to the United States to \"turn the wheel of the dharma\". During this time, he published two collections of his poems from the early to mid 1950s, \"Myths &amp; Texts\" (1960), and \"Six Sections from Mountains and Rivers Without End\" (1965). This last was the beginning of a project that he was to continue working on until the late 1990s. Much of Snyder's poetry expresses experiences, environments, and insights involved with the work he has done for a living: logger, fire-lookout, steam-freighter crew, translator, carpenter, and itinerant poet, among other things. During his years in Japan, Snyder was also initiated into \"Shugendo\", a highly syncretic ascetic religious cult.\nIn the early 1960s he traveled for six months through India with Kyger, Ginsberg, and Ginsberg's partner, the poet and actor Peter Orlovsky. Their sojourn took them to Sri Lanka, then to south India, and eventually travelling up into the north. They observed the folkways of the various peoples, went on hikes, stopped at landmarks, temples, burning ghats, monastic caves, and ashrams. As they went, they learned in part through conversations with many Indians and Europeans who could speak English. They visited numerous cities, including Madras, Calcutta, Mumbai, Banaras, Old Delhi and New Delhi, as well as Rishikesh and Hardwar, and Bodh Gaya (where Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, attained enlightenment). Especially important to Snyder and Ginsberg, in Dharamashala the Dalai Lama met with them and they discussed Buddhist principles and practices.\nSnyder and Kyger separated soon after their trip to India, and divorced in 1965.\nDharma Bums.\nIn the 1950s, Snyder took part in the rise of a strand of Buddhist anarchism emerging from the Beat movement. Snyder was the inspiration for the Japhy Ryder character in Kerouac's novel \"The Dharma Bums\" (1958). Snyder had spent considerable time in Japan studying Zen Buddhism, and in 1961 published an essay, \"Buddhist Anarchism\", where he described the connection he saw between these two traditions, originating in different parts of the world: \"The mercy of the West has been social revolution; the mercy of the East has been individual insight into the basic self/void.\" He advocated \"using such means as civil disobedience, outspoken criticism, protest, pacifism, voluntary poverty and even gentle violence\" and defended \"the right of individuals to smoke ganja, eat peyote, be polygynous, polyandrous or homosexual\" which he saw as being banned by \"the Judaeo-Capitalist-Christian-Marxist West\".\nKitkitdizze.\nIn 1966, Snyder joined Allen Ginsberg, Richard Baker, future Roshi of the San Francisco Zen Center, and Kriyananda aka Donald J Walters, to buy in the San Juan Ridge area of the Sierra-Nevada foothills, north of Nevada City, Northern California. In 1967 Snyder's book \"The Back Country\" appeared, again mainly a collection of poems stretching back over about fifteen years. Snyder devoted a section at the end of the book to his translations of eighteen poems by Kenji Miyazawa. In 1970, Kitkitdizze (as he named his portion of the San Juan Ridge property) would become his home. (Snyder borrowed the name from the Miwok word for \"Chamaebatia foliolosa\", a North American species of evergreen shrub used in herbal remedies by them and other indigenous peoples.) By that point, Snyder had already spent the summers of 1967 and 1968 with a group of Japanese back-to-the-land drop-outs known as \"the Tribe\" on Suwanosejima (a small Japanese island in the East China Sea), where they combed the beaches, gathered edible plants, and fished. On the island, on August 6, 1967, he married Masa Uehara, whom he had met in Osaka a year earlier. In 1968, they moved to California with their infant son, Kai (born April 1968). Their second son, Gen, was born a year later. They were shortly able to move onto the San Juan Ridge property, near the South Yuba River, where they and friends built a house that drew on rural-Japanese and Native-American architectural ideas.\nLater life and writings.\n\"Regarding Wave\" appeared in January 1970, a stylistic departure offering poems that were more emotional, metaphoric, and lyrical. From the late 1960s, the content of Snyder's poetry increasingly had to do with family, friends, and community. He continued to publish poetry throughout the 1970s, much of it reflecting his re-immersion in life on the American continent and his involvement in the back-to-the-land movement in the Sierra foothills. His 1974 book \"Turtle Island\", titled after a Native American name for the North American continent, won a Pulitzer Prize. It also influenced numerous West Coast Generation X writers, including Alex Steffen, Bruce Barcott and Mark Morford. His 1983 book \"Axe Handles\", won an American Book Award. Snyder wrote numerous essays setting forth his views on poetry, culture, social experimentation, and the environment. Many of these were collected in \"Earth House Hold\" (1969), \"The Old Ways\" (1977), \"The Real Work\" (1980), \"The Practice of the Wild\" (1990), \"A Place in Space\" (1995), and \"The Gary Snyder Reader\" (1999). In 1979, Snyder published \"He Who Hunted Birds in His Father's Village: The Dimensions of a Haida Myth\", based on his Reed thesis. Snyder's journals from his travel in India in the mid-1960s appeared in 1983 under the title \"Passage Through India\". In these, his wide-ranging interests in cultures, natural history, religions, social critique, contemporary America, and hands-on aspects of rural life, as well as his ideas on literature, were given full-blown articulation.\nIn 1986, Snyder became a professor in the writing program at the University of California, Davis. Snyder is now professor emeritus of English.\nSnyder was married to Uehara for twenty-two years; the couple divorced in 1989. Snyder married Carole Lynn Koda (October 3, 1947 \u2013 June 29, 2006), who would write \"Homegrown: Thirteen brothers and sisters, a century in America\", in 1991, and remained married to her until her death of cancer. She had been born in the third generation of a successful Japanese-American farming family, noted for its excellent rice. She shared Buddhism, extensive travels, and work with Snyder, and performed independent work as a naturalist.\nAs Snyder's involvement in environmental issues and his teaching grew, he seemed to move away from poetry for much of the 1980s and early 1990s. However, in 1996 he published the complete \"Mountains and Rivers Without End\", a mixture of the lyrical and epic modes celebrating the act of inhabitation on a specific place on the planet. This work was written over a 40-year period. It has been translated into Japanese, French and Russian. In 2004 Snyder published \"Danger on Peaks\", his first collection of new poems in twenty years.\nSnyder was awarded the Levinson Prize from the journal \"Poetry\", the American Poetry Society Shelley Memorial Award (1986), was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1987), and won the 1997 Bollingen Prize for Poetry and, that same year, the John Hay Award for Nature Writing. Snyder also has the distinction of being the first American to receive the Buddhism Transmission Award (for 1998) from the Japan-based Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai Foundation. For his ecological and social activism, Snyder was named as one of the 100 visionaries selected in 1995 by \"Utne Reader\".\nSnyder's life and work were celebrated in John J. Healy's 2010 documentary \"The Practice of the Wild.\" The film, which debuted at the 53rd San Francisco International Film Festival, features wide-ranging, running conversations between Snyder and poet, writer and longtime colleague Jim Harrison, filmed mostly on the Hearst Ranch in San Simeon, California. The film also shows archival photographs and film of Snyder's life.\nWork.\nPoetics.\nSnyder uses mainly common speech-patterns as the basis for his lines, though his style has been noted for its \"flexibility\" and the variety of different forms his poems have taken. He typically uses neither conventional meters nor intentional rhyme. \"Love and respect for the primitive tribe, honour accorded the Earth, the escape from city and industry into both the past and the possible, contemplation, the communal\", such, according to Glyn Maxwell, is the awareness and commitment behind the specific poems.\nThe author and editor Stewart Brand once wrote: \"Gary Snyder's poetry addresses the life-planet identification with unusual simplicity of style and complexity of effect.\" According to Jody Norton, this simplicity and complexity derives from Snyder's use of natural imagery (geographical formations, flora, and fauna) in his poems. Such imagery can be both sensual at a personal level yet universal and generic in nature. In the 1968 poem \"Beneath My Hand and Eye the Distant Hills, Your Body,\" the author compares the intimate experience of a lover's caress with the mountains, hills, cinder cones, and craters of the Uintah Mountains. Readers become explorers on both a very private level as well as a very public and grand level. A simplistic touch becoming a very complex interaction occurring at multiple levels. This is the effect Snyder intended. In an interview with Faas, he states, \"There is a direction which is very beautiful, and that's the direction of the organism being less and less locked into itself, less and less locked into its own body structure and its relatively inadequate sense organs, towards a state where the organism can actually go out from itself and share itself with others.\"\nSnyder has always maintained that his personal sensibility arose from his interest in Native Americans and their involvement with nature and knowledge of it; indeed, their ways seemed to resonate with his own. And he has sought something akin to this through Buddhist practices, Yamabushi initiation, and other experiences and involvements. However, since his youth he has been quite literate, and he has written about his appreciation of writers of similar sensibilities, like D. H. Lawrence, William Butler Yeats, and some of the great ancient Chinese poets. William Carlos Williams was another influence, especially on Snyder's earliest published work. Starting in high school, Snyder read and loved the work of Robinson Jeffers, his predecessor in poetry of the landscape of the American West, but whereas Jeffers valued nature over humankind, Snyder saw humankind as part of nature. Snyder commented in interviews, \"I have some concerns that I'm continually investigating that tie together biology, mysticism, prehistory, general systems theory\". Snyder argues that poets, and humans in general, need to adjust to very long timescales, especially when judging the consequences of their actions. His poetry examines the gap between nature and culture so as to point to ways in which the two can be more closely integrated.\nIn 2004, receiving the Masaoka Shiki International Haiku Awards Grand Prize, Snyder highlighted traditional ballads and folk songs, Native American songs and poems, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Jeffers, Ezra Pound, Noh drama, Zen aphorisms, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, and Robert Duncan as significant influences on his poetry, but added, \"the influence from haiku and from the Chinese is, I think, the deepest.\"\nRomanticism.\nSnyder is among those writers who have sought to dis-entrench conventional thinking about primitive peoples that has viewed them as simple-minded, ignorantly superstitious, brutish, and prone to violent emotionalism. In the 1960s Snyder developed a \"neo-tribalist\" view akin to the \"post-modernist\" theory of French Sociologist Michel Maffesoli. The \"re-tribalization\" of the modern, mass-society world envisioned by Marshall McLuhan, with all of the ominous, dystopian possibilities that McLuhan warned of, subsequently accepted by many modern intellectuals, is not the future that Snyder expects or works toward. Snyder's is a positive interpretation of the tribe and of the possible future.\nTodd Ensign describes Snyder's interpretation as blending ancient tribal beliefs and traditions, philosophy, physicality, and nature with politics to create his own form of Postmodern environmentalism. Snyder rejects the perspective which portrays nature and humanity in direct opposition to one another. Instead, he chooses to write from multiple viewpoints. He purposely sets out to bring about change on the emotional, physical, and political levels by emphasizing the ecological problems faced by today's society.\nBeat.\nSnyder is widely regarded as a member of the Beat Generation circle of writers: he was one of the poets that read at the famous \"Six Gallery\" event, and was written about in one of Kerouac's most popular novels, \"The Dharma Bums\". Some critics argue that Snyder's connection with the Beats is exaggerated and that he might better be regarded as a part of the San Francisco Renaissance, which developed independently. Snyder himself has some reservations about the label \"Beat\", but does not appear to have any strong objection to being included in the group. He often talks about the Beats in the first person plural, referring to the group as \"we\" and \"us\".\nA quotation from a 1974 interview at the University of North Dakota Writers Conference (published in \"The Beat Vision\"):\nI never did know exactly what was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the original meeting, association, comradeship of Allen [Ginsberg], myself, Michael [McClure], Lawrence [Ferlinghetti], Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory [Corso], for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory as well as the others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.\nSnyder has also commented \"The term Beat is better used for a smaller group of writers ... the immediate group around Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, plus Gregory Corso and a few others. Many of us ... belong together in the category of the San Francisco Renaissance. ... Still, beat can also be defined as a particular state of mind ... and I was in that mind for a while\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "12712", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12712", "title": "Gonzo journalism", "text": "Style of journalism\nGonzo journalism is a style of journalism that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story using a first-person narrative. The word \"gonzo\" is believed to have been first used in 1970 to describe an article about the Kentucky Derby by Hunter S. Thompson, who popularized the style. It is an energetic first-person participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist, and it draws its power from a combination of social critique and self-satire. It has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors.\nGonzo journalism involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties. Gonzo journalism disregards the strictly edited product once favored by newspaper media and strives for a more personal approach; the personality of a piece is as important as the event or actual subject of the piece. Use of sarcasm, humour, exaggeration, and profanity is common.\nThompson, who was among the forefathers of the New Journalism movement, said in the February 15, 1973, issue of \"Rolling Stone\", \"If I'd written the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people\u2014including me\u2014would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.\"\nEtymology.\nThe term \"gonzo\" was first used in connection with Hunter S. Thompson by \"The Boston Globe\" magazine editor Bill Cardoso in 1970. He described Thompson's article \"The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved\", which was written for the June 1970 edition of \"Scanlan's Monthly\", as \"pure Gonzo journalism\". This predates the December 1970 debut of the Muppet Gonzo in \"The Great Santa Claus Switch\". Cardoso said \"gonzo\" was South Boston Irish slang describing the last man standing after an all-night drinking marathon. He also said it was a corruption of the Canadian French word , which means 'shining path', although this is disputed.\nAnother speculation is that the word may have been inspired by the 1960 hit song \"Gonzo\" by the rhythm and blues pianist James Booker. This possibility is supported by a 2007 oral biography of Thompson, which states that the term is taken from a song by Booker but does not explain why Thompson or Cardoso would have chosen the term to describe Thompson's journalism. The 2013 documentary \"\" quotes Thompson's literary executor as saying that the song was the origin of the term. According to a Greg Johnson biographical note on Booker, the song title \"Gonzo\" comes from a character in a movie called \"The Pusher\", which in turn may have been inspired by a 1956 Evan Hunter novel of the same title.\nIn 2025, David S. Wills, author of \"High White Notes: The Rise and Fall of Gonzo Journalism\", investigated the origins of the word \"gonzo\" and discovered that Cardoso had found it in an article he had edited for \"The\" \"Boston Globe Sunday Magazine\" just a week prior to calling Thompson's story \"pure Gonzo journalism.\" The article was about countercultural icon Baba Ram Dass and \"gonzo\" was used \"with the context suggesting 'going wild' or 'losing control' on a hallucinogenic substance.\" The original article said that Dass \"smoked pot and went gonzo on STP, the most powerful hallucinogenic ever concocted.\"\nHunter S. Thompson.\nThompson based his style on William Faulkner's notion that \"fiction is often the best fact\". While the things that Thompson wrote about are basically true, he used satirical devices to drive his points home. He often wrote about recreational drugs and alcohol use, which added subjective flair to his reporting. The term \"gonzo\" has also come into (sometimes pejorative) use to describe journalism in Thompson's style, characterized by a drug-fueled stream of consciousness writing technique.\n\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" followed the Mint 400 piece in 1971 and included a main character by the name of Raoul Duke, accompanied by his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, with defining art by Ralph Steadman. Although this book is considered a prime example of gonzo journalism, Thompson regarded it as a failed experiment. He had intended it to be an unedited record of everything he did as it happened, but he edited the book five times before publication.\nThompson would instigate events himself, often in a prankish or belligerent manner, and then document both his actions and those of others. Notoriously neglectful of deadlines, Thompson often annoyed his editors because he submitted articles late, \"too late to be edited, yet still in time for the printer\". Thompson wanted his work to be read as he wrote it, in its \"true Gonzo\" form. Historian Douglas Brinkley said gonzo journalism requires virtually no rewriting and frequently uses transcribed interviews and verbatim telephone conversations.\n\"I don't get any satisfaction out of the old traditional journalist's view: 'I just covered the story. I just gave it a balanced view,'\" Thompson said in an interview for the online edition of \"The Atlantic\". \"Objective journalism is one of the main reasons American politics has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long. You can't be objective about Nixon.\"\nThe Gonzo Studies Society proposes eleven features that, to varying degrees, are included in Hunter S. Thompson's Gonzo journalism:\nInfluence and legacy.\nThompson felt that objectivity in journalism was a myth. Gonzo journalism has now become a \"bona fide\" style of writing that is similar to the New Journalism of the 1960s, led primarily by Tom Wolfe and also championed by Lester Bangs, George Plimpton, Terry Southern, and John Birmingham, and is considered a subgenre of New Journalism. When asked whether there was a difference between the two, Thompson answered, \"Yeah, I think so. Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, for instance, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then I don't really think of myself as a reporter.\"\nIn 1998, Christopher Locke asserted that the webzine genre is descended from gonzo journalism, a claim that has since been extended to social media. Thompson's gonzo journalism influence is reflected in the current website \"Gonzo Today\" which features a top banner by Thompson's longtime illustrator Ralph Steadman, with rotating contributions by others including Thompson associate, poet Ron Whitehead.\nIt has been claimed that Thai writer Rong Wongsawan wrote in a style that was Gonzo, beginning in the 1960s when he reported from San Francisco. However he wrote in Thai, and he probably developed the style independently of Hunter S. Thompson. He also used the style in his books \"Sattahip\" and \"Takli\" which describe American soldiers and Thai bar girls during the Vietnam War. His book \"The Man from Bangkok: San Francisco Culture in the 60s\" is an English translation of a book published in Thai in 1978.\nAspects of Gonzo Journalism.\nJesse Jarnow states the main parts of Gonzo journalism are total subjectivity and the first/best draft mentality. This mentality is described by William McKeen, a journalism professor at Boston University and author of \"Outlaw Journalist: The Life and Times of Hunter S. Thompson\", as where the journalist does \u201cvirtually no rewriting\u201d. He adds that everything within the reporting process is documented, including: notes, interviews, transcribed telephone conversations, telegrams, etc. Jason Mosser states that Gonzo journalism is unique in the way that it places the narrator as the center of the story. Still, gonzo journalism relies primarily on being grounded in the truth.\nThompson believed primarily in all of these aspects of Gonzo journalism; however, he was also quoted as sharing a similar affinity with George Orwell of making political writing into art. Thompson\u2019s style of writing relied heavily on verb-driven syntax along with metaphors, allusions, ellipsis and more. Critics essay this was used to create feelings of despair, degradation, and desperation within his narrators.\nGonzo Journalism in Other Countries.\nEuropean Countries.\nMillar is an example of gonzo journalism outside of the United States. Millar is a Uzbekistan television news program. As of September 2025, the program has 27,500 subscribers on YouTube. Though the television is regarded as slightly controversial due to its usage of sensationalism and staged footage, scholars in the field regard it as partially fitting the category of Gonzo journalism. Scholars argue the program counts as Gonzo journalism because of the subjective tone, perspectives of those involved, and internal coverage.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12713", "revid": "40491554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12713", "title": "Giant panda", "text": "Species of bear\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh and are typically long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.\nThe giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to . It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on\u00a0olfactory communication\u00a0to communicate and uses scent marks\u00a0as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.\nAs a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived. The Fourth National Survey (2011\u20132014), published in 2015, estimated that the wild population of giant pandas aged over 1.5 years (i.e. excluding dependent young) had increased to 1,864 individuals; based on this number, and using the available estimated percentage of cubs in the population (9.6%), the IUCN estimated the total number of Pandas to be approximately 2,060. Since 2016, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also classified the giant panda as vulnerable. It is a conservation-reliant species. By 2007, the captive population comprised 239 giant pandas in China and another 27 outside the country. It has often served as China's national symbol, appeared on Chinese Gold Panda coins since 1982 and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"panda\" was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word \"panda\" has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word \"ponya,\" possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. In many older sources, the name \"panda\" or \"common panda\" refers to the red panda (\"Ailurus fulgens\"), which was described some 40 years earlier and over that period was the only animal known as a panda. The binomial name \"Ailuropoda melanoleuca\" means black and white (melanoleuca) cat-foot (ailuropoda).\nSince the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear many different names, including \"m\u00f2\" (, ancient Chinese name for giant panda), \"hu\u0101xi\u00f3ng\" (; \"spotted bear\") and \"zh\u00faxi\u00f3ng\" (; \"bamboo bear\"). The most popular names in China today are \"d\u00e0xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o\" (; lit.\u2009'giant bear cat'), or simply \"xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o\" (; lit.\u2009'bear cat'). As with the word panda in English, \"xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o\" () was originally used to describe just the red panda, but \"d\u00e0xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o\" () and \"xi\u01ceoxi\u00f3ngm\u0101o\" (; lit.\u2009'little bear cat') were coined to differentiate between the species.\nIn Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted \"d\u00e0m\u0101oxi\u00f3ng\" (; lit.\u2009'giant cat bear'), though many encyclopedias and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the \"bear cat\" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, \"bear\" instead of \"cat\" is the base noun, making the name more grammatically and logically correct, which have led to the popular choice despite official writings. This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.\nTaxonomy.\nFor many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. In 1985, molecular studies indicated that the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it diverged about https://\u00a0million years ago from the common ancestor of the Ursidae; it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species.\nSubspecies.\nTwo subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics.\nA detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinling population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinling population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.\nPhylogeny.\nOf the eight extant species in the bear family Ursidae, the giant panda's lineage branched off the earliest.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe giant panda is endemic to China. It is found in small, fragmented populations in six mountainous regions in the country, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. Successful habitat preservation has seen a rise in panda numbers, though loss of habitat due to human activities remains its biggest threat. In areas with a high concentration of medium-to-large-sized mammals\u2014such as domestic cattle, a species known to degrade the landscape\u2014the giant panda population is generally low. This is mainly attributed to the panda's avoidance of interspecific competition.\nThe species has been located at elevations of above sea level. They frequent habitats with a healthy concentration of bamboos, typically old-growth forests, but may also venture into secondary forest habitats. The Daxiangling Mountain population inhabits both coniferous and broadleaf forests. Additionally, the Qinling population often selects evergreen broadleaf and conifer forests, while pandas in the Qionglai mountainous region exclusively select upland conifer forests. The remaining two populations, namely those occurring in the Liangshan and Xiaoxiangling mountains, predominantly occur in broadleaf evergreen and conifer forests.\nGiant pandas once roamed across Southeast Asia from Myanmar to northern Vietnam. Their range in China spanned much of the southeast region. By the Pleistocene, climate change affected panda populations, and the subsequent domination of modern humans led to large-scale habitat loss. In 2001, it was estimated that the range of the giant panda had declined by about 99% of its range in earlier millenniums.\nDescription.\nThe giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, limbs, shoulders and around the eyes. The rest of the animal's coat is white. The giant panda's distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate. The white areas serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs conceal them in shade. Studies in the wild have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration, while up close, they rely more on blending in. The black ears may be used to display aggression, while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another. The giant panda's thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.\nThe panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A study revealed that a giant panda had a bite force of 1298.9 Newton (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 Newton (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth. Finite element analysis has found that pandas have the highest bite force relative to their body size among ursids. The giant panda has the largest masticatory muscles among bears, being more than twice as large as those of the American black bear with an equivalent brain weight; digastric muscle is equal to 30% of brain weight in giant panda compared to 10% in black bear. \nAdults measure around long, including a tail of about and tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to . Females are generally 10\u201320% smaller than males. They weigh between and . The average weight for adults is .\nThe giant panda's paw has a digit similar to a thumb and five fingers; the thumb-like digit is actually a modified sesamoid bone that helps it to hold bamboo while eating. The evolution of the panda's pseudo-thumb may have occurred because the first digit of its forepaws, equivalent to the thumb in primates, is not opposable and is aligned with the rest of the digits. The giant panda's tail, measuring , is the second-longest in the bear family after the sloth bear.\nEcology.\nDiet.\nDespite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, with approximately 99% of its diet consisting of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from the consumption of bamboo. The ability to break down cellulose and lignin is very weak, and their main source of nutrients comes from starch and hemicelluloses. The most important part of their bamboo diet is the shoots, that are rich in starch and have up to 32% protein content. Accordingly, pandas have evolved a higher capability to digest starches than strict carnivores. Raw bamboo is toxic, containing cyanide compounds. Pandas' body tissues are less able than herbivores to detoxify cyanide, but their gut microbiomes are significantly enriched in putative genes coding for enzymes related to cyanide degradation, suggesting that they have cyanide-digesting gut microbes. It has been estimated that an adult panda absorbs of cyanide a day through its diet. To prevent poisoning, they have evolved anti-toxic mechanisms to protect themselves. About 80% of the cyanide is metabolized to less toxic thiocyanate and discharged in urine, while the remaining 20% is detoxified by other minor pathways.\nDuring the shoot season from April to August, the giant panda stores a large amount of food in preparation for the months succeeding this seasonal period, in which it lives off a diet of bamboo leaves.\nThe average giant panda eats of bamboo shoots per day to compensate for the limited energy content of its diet. Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible and necessary because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material through the short, straight digestive tract. Such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda defecates up to 40 times a day.\nThe limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the giant panda's behaviour. It tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures. Their field metabolic rate, the amount of energy used by an animal in its daily life, is one of the lowest reported among mammals, comparable to that of sloths.\nTwo of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: \"[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo.\" The giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw. Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.\nThe enzyme Alanine\u2014glyoxylate transaminase is also expressed in the peroxisome of giant panda cells instead of only in the mitochondria like carnivorous mammals, which would enable glyoxylate to be metabolised from glycolate in plant matter. Proteins make up 50% of the macronutrients absorbed, similar to proportion of carnivorous mammals at 52\u201354%; the nutritional contribution of protein from bamboo is 61% when only the leaves and shoots are considered, and 48% when the digestible parts of cellulose and hemicellulose are included. This indicates that the transition to herbivory was not as extreme in this species as it might appear.\nThe morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2\u20132.4 mya with the emergence of \"A. microta\". Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole umami taste receptor, encoded by the genes TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 (also known as T1R1 and T1R3), resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons. Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda. Although the pseudogenisation (conversion into a pseudogene) of the umami taste receptor in \"Ailuropoda\" coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change. The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya, signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.\nGiant pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, with the most common including \"Fargesia dracocephala\" and \"Fargesia rufa\". Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less. Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.\nGiant pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction.\nInterspecific interactions.\nAlthough adult giant pandas have few natural predators other than humans, young cubs are vulnerable to attacks by snow leopards, yellow-throated martens, eagles, feral dogs, and the Asian black bear. Sub-adults weighing up to may be vulnerable to predation by leopards.\nGiant pandas are sympatric with other large mammals and bamboo feeders, such as the takin (\"Budorcas taxicolor\"). The takin and giant panda share a similar ecological niche, and they consume the same resources. When competition for food is fierce, pandas disperse to the outskirts of takin distribution. Other possible competitors include but is not limited to, the wild boar (\"Sus scrofa\"), Chinese goral (\"Naemorhedus griseus\") and the Asian black bear (\"Ursus thibetanus\"). Giant pandas avoid areas with a mid-to-high density of livestock, as they depress the vegetation. The Tibetan Plateau is the only known area where both giant and red pandas occur. Although sharing near-identical ecological niches, competition between the two species has rarely been observed. Nearly 50% of their respective distribution overlaps, and successful coexistence is achieved through distinct habitat selection.\nPathogens and parasites.\nA captive female died from toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by \"Toxoplasma gondii\" that infects most warm-blooded animals. They are likely susceptible to diseases from \"Baylisascaris\u00a0schroederi\", a parasitic nematode known to infect giant panda intestines. This nematode species is known to cause \"baylisascariasis\", a deadly disease that kills more wild giant pandas than any other cause. Additionally, the giant panda is susceptible to canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, rotavirus, canine adenovirus, and canine coronavirus. Bacteria, such as \"Clostridium welchii\", \"Proteus mirabilis\", \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\", and \"Escherichia coli\", may also be lethal.\nBehavior.\nThe giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub. Pandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. The low nutrition quality of bamboo means pandas need to eat more frequently, and due to their lack of major predators they can be active at any time of the day. Activity is highest in June and decreases in late summer to autumn with an increase from November through the following March. Activity is also directly related to the amount of sunlight during colder days. There is a significant interaction of solar radiation, such that solar radiation has a stronger positive effect on activity levels of panda bears.\nPandas communicate through vocalisation and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine. They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures. Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory. Though the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans on rare occasions. Pandas have been known to cover themselves in horse manure to protect themselves against cold temperatures.\nThe species communicates foremost through a blatting sound; they achieve peaceful interactions through the emission of this sound. When in oestrus, a female emits a chirp. In hostile confrontations or during fights, the giant panda emits vocalizations such as a roar or growl. On the other hand, squeals typically indicate inferiority and submission in a dispute. Other vocalizations include honks and moans.\nOlfactory communication.\nGiant pandas heavily rely on olfactory communication to communicate with one another. Scent marks are used to spread these chemical cues and are placed on landmarks like rocks or trees. Chemical communication in giant pandas plays many roles in their social situations. Scent marks and odors are used to spread information about sexual status, whether a female is in estrus or not, age, gender, individuality, dominance over territory, and choice of settlement. Giant pandas communicate by excreting volatile compounds, or scent marks, through the anogenital gland. Giant pandas have unique positions in which they will scent mark. Males deposit scent marks or urine by lifting their hind leg, rubbing their backside, or standing in order to rub the anogenital gland onto a landmark. Females, however, exercise squatting or simply rubbing their genitals onto a landmark.\nThe season plays a major role in mediating chemical communication. Depending on the season, mainly whether it is breeding season or not, may influence which odors are prioritized. Chemical signals can have different functions in different seasons. During the non-breeding season, females prefer the odors of other females because reproduction is not their primary motivation. However, during breeding season, odors from the opposite sex will be more attractive. Because they are solitary mammals and their breeding season is so brief, female pandas secrete chemical cues in order to let males know their sexual status. The chemical cues female pandas secrete can be considered to be pheromones for sexual reproduction. Females deposit scent marks through their urine which induces an increase in androgen levels in males. Androgen is a sex hormone found in both males and females; testosterone is the major androgen produced by males. Civetone and decanoic acid are chemicals found in female urine which promote behavioral responses in males; both chemicals are considered giant panda pheromones. Male pandas also secrete chemical signals that include information about their sexual reproductivity and age, which is beneficial for a female when choosing a mate. For example, age can be useful for a female to determine sexual maturity and sperm quality. Pandas are also able to determine when the signal was placed, further aiding in the quest to find a potential mate. However, chemical cues are not just used for communication between males and females, pandas can determine individuality from chemical signals. This allows them to be able to differentiate between a potential partner or someone of the same sex, which could be a potential competitor.\nChemical cues, or odors, play an important role in how a panda chooses their habitat. Pandas look for odors that tell them not only the identity of another panda, but if they should avoid them or not. Pandas tend to avoid their species for most of the year, breeding season being the brief time of major interaction. Chemical signaling allows for avoidance and competition. Pandas whose habitats are in similar locations will collectively leave scent marks in a unique location which is termed \"scent stations\". When pandas come across these scent stations, they are able to identify a specific panda and the scope of their habitat. This allows pandas to be able to pursue a potential mate or avoid a potential competitor.\nPandas can assess an individual's dominance status, including their age and size, via odor cues and may choose to avoid a scent mark if the signaler's competitive ability outweighs their own. A panda's size can be conveyed through the height of the scent mark. Since larger animals can place higher scent marks, an elevated scent mark advertises a higher competitive ability. Age must also be taken into consideration when assessing a competitor's fighting ability. For example, a mature panda will be larger than a younger, immature panda and possess an advantage during a fight.\nReproduction.\nGiant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20. The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year. When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time ranges from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilisation. The gestation period is somewhere between 95 and 160 days - the variability is due to the fact that the fertilized egg may linger in the reproductive system for a while before implanting on the uterine wall. Giant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies. If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker cub will die due to starvation. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs since she does not store fat. The father has no part in helping raise the cub.\nWhen the cub is first born, it is pink, blind, and toothless, weighing only , or about of the mother's weight, proportionally the smallest baby of any placental mammal. It nurses from its mother's breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. For three to four hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns grey where its hair will eventually become black. A slight pink colour may appear on the cub's fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mother's saliva. A month after birth, the colour pattern of the cub's fur is fully developed. Its fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days; mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo after six months, though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh at one year and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.\nInitially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured. This led some scientists to trying methods such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra). In the 2000s, researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species.\nIn July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm. The technique for freezing the sperm in liquid nitrogen was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a solution to the dwindling availability of giant panda semen, which had led to inbreeding. Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the species. As of 2009, it is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and Mexico City will be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas.\nAttempts have also been made to reproduce giant pandas by interspecific pregnancy where cloned panda embryos were implanted into the uterus of an animal of another species. This has resulted in panda fetuses, but no live births.\nHuman interaction.\nEarly references.\nIn Ancient China, people thought pandas to be rare and noble creatures \u2013 the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menstruation as described in the Qin dynasty encyclopedia \"Erya\".\nThe creature named \"mo\" (\u8c98) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda. The dictionary \"Shuowen Jiezi\" (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the \"mo\", from Shu (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black, although the older \"Erya\" describes \"mo\" simply as a \"white leopard\". The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature \"pixiu\" (\u8c94\u8c85) as referring to the giant panda is also common.\nDuring the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a captured \"zouyu\" (), and another \"zouyu\" was sighted in Shandong. \"Zouyu\" is a legendary \"righteous\" animal, which, similarly to a \"qilin\", only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch.\nIn captivity.\nPandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos. Chi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol. A 2006 \"New York Times\" article outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than keeping the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1\u00a0million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost. The last contract, with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.\nIn the 1970s, gifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between China and the West. This practice has been termed \"panda diplomacy\". By 1984, however, giant pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, China began to offer giant pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans for a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and with the provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of China. As a result of this change in policy, nearly all the giant pandas in the world are owned by China, and individuals and all cubs leased to foreign zoos are eventually returned to China. As of 2022, Xin Xin at the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City, was the last living descendant of the gifted giant pandas.\nSince 1998, because of a WWF lawsuit, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service only allows US zoos to import a panda if the zoo can ensure China channels more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts for giant pandas and their habitat. In May 2005, China offered a breeding pair to Taiwan. The issue became embroiled in cross-Strait relations \u2013 due to both the underlying symbolism and technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered \"domestic\" or \"international\" or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange. A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland, resulting in the politically charged names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (from , implying reunification). China's offer was initially rejected by Chen Shui-bian, then President of Taiwan. However, when Ma Ying-jeou assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted and the pandas arrived in December of that year.\nIn the 2020s, certain \"celebrity pandas\" have gained a cult following amongst internet users, with dedicated fan accounts existing to keep tabs on the animals. Known as \"giant panda fever\" or \"panda-monium\", individual pandas are known to get billions of views and engagements on social media, as well as product lines specifically emulating them. At Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, certain of these \"celebrity pandas\" are known to garner hours-long lines specifically to see them.\nConservation.\nThe giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation, and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity. Its range is confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam. The species is scattered into more than 30 subpopulations of relatively few animals. Building of roads and human settlement near panda habitat, result in population declines. Diseases from domesticated pets and livestock is another threat. By 2100, it is estimated that the distribution of the giant panda will shrink by up to 100%, mainly due to the effects of climate change. The giant panda is listed on CITES Appendix I, meaning trade of its parts is prohibited and that it requires this protection to avoid extinction. It has been protected by China's 1988 Wildlife Conservation Law.\nThe giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. After the Chinese economic reform, demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the black market, acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time. In 1963, the PRC government set up Wolong National Nature Reserve to save the declining panda population.\nThe giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, located in the southwest province of Sichuan and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006. A 2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an umbrella species as the preservation of their habitat also helps other endemic species in China, including 70% of the country's forest birds, 70% of mammals and 31% of amphibians.\nIn 2012, Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called \"On the Trail of Giant Panda\". This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives. Efforts to preserve the panda bear populations in China have come at the expense of other animals in the region, including snow leopards, wolves, and dholes. In order to improve living and mating conditions for the fragmented populations of pandas, nearly 70 natural reserves have been combined to form the Giant Panda National Park in 2020. With a size of 10,500 square miles, the park is roughly three times as large as Yellowstone National Park and incorporates the Wolong National Nature Reserve. Small, isolated populations run the risk of inbreeding and smaller genetic variety makes the individuals more vulnerable to various defects and genetic mutation.\nPopulation.\nIn 2006, scientists reported that the number of giant pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild giant panda population, but using a new method that analyzes DNA from giant panda droppings, scientists believed the wild population were as large as 3,000. In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, but just 13 reserves in 1998. As the species has been reclassified from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\" in 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level of the giant panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.\nIn 2020, the giant panda population of the new national park was already above 1,800 individuals, which is roughly 80 percent of the entire panda population in China. Establishing the new protected area in the Sichuan Province also gives various other endangered or threatened species, like the Siberian tiger, the possibility to improve their living conditions by offering them a habitat. Other species who benefit from the protection of its habitat include the snow leopard, the golden snub-nosed monkey, the red panda and the complex-toothed flying squirrel.\nIn July 2021, Chinese conservation authorities announced that giant pandas are no longer endangered in the wild following years of conservation efforts, with a population in the wild exceeding 1,800. China has received international praise for its conservation of the species, which has also helped the country establish itself as a leader in endangered species conservation.8\nAs of November 26, 2024, the global captive giant panda population had reached 757 individuals, while about 1,900 were estimated to live in the wild, bringing the total to approximately 2,657.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an Italianized musical term derived from the French \"glisser\", \"to glide\". In some contexts, it is equivalent to portamento, which is a continuous, seamless glide between notes. In other contexts, it refers to discrete, stepped glides across notes, such as on a piano. Some terms that are similar or equivalent in some contexts are slide, sweep bend, smear, rip (for a loud, violent glissando to the beginning of a note), lip (in jazz terminology, when executed by changing one's embouchure on a wind instrument), plop, or falling hail (a glissando on a harp using the back of the fingernails). On wind instruments, a scoop is a glissando ascending to the onset of a note achieved entirely with the embouchure, except on instruments that have a slide (such as a trombone).\nNotation.\nThe glissando is indicated by following the initial note with a line, sometimes wavy, in the desired direction, often accompanied by the abbreviation \"gliss.\". Occasionally, the desired notes are notated in the standard method (i.e. semiquavers) accompanied by the word 'glissando'.\nDiscrete glissando.\nOn some instruments (e.g., piano, harp, xylophone), discrete tones are clearly audible when sliding. For example, on a keyboard, a player's fingernails can be made to slide across the white keys or over the black keys, producing either a C major scale or an F\u266f major pentatonic scale, or their relative modes; by performing both at once, it is possible to produce a full chromatic scale. Maurice Ravel used glissandi in many of his piano compositions, and \"Alborada del Gracioso\" contains notable piano glissando passages in thirds executed by the right hand. Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Liszt and Gershwin have all used glissandi for piano in notable compositions.\nOrgan players\u2014particularly in contemporary music\u2014sometimes employ an effect known as the palm glissando, where over the course of the glissando the flat of the hand is used to depress a wide area of keys simultaneously, resulting in a dramatic atonal sweep. \nA similar device on the piano is cluster-glissandos, used extensively by Karlheinz Stockhausen in \"Klavierst\u00fcck X\", and which \"more than anything else, lend the work its unique aural flavour\". On a harp, the player can slide their finger across the strings, quickly playing the scale (or on pedal harp even arpeggios such as C\u266d\u2013D\u2013E\u266f\u2013F\u2013G\u266f\u2013A\u266d\u2013B). Wind, brass, and fretted-stringed-instrument players can perform an extremely rapid chromatic scale (e.g., sliding up or down a string quickly on a fretted instrument).\nArpeggio effects (likewise named glissando) are also obtained by bowed strings (playing harmonics) and brass, especially the horn.\nContinuous glissando.\nMusical instruments with are capable of continuous glissando, sometimes called portamento, over a substantial range. These include unfretted chordophones (such as the violin, viola, cello and double bass, and fretless guitars), stringed instruments with a way of stretching the strings (such as the guitar, veena, sitar or pipa), a fretted guitar or lap steel guitar when accompanied with the use of a slide, wind instruments without valves or stops (such as the trombone or slide whistle), timpani (kettledrums), electronic instruments (such as the theremin, the ondes Martenot, synthesizers and keytars), the water organ, and the human voice.\nWind instruments can effect a similar limited slide by altering the lip pressure (on trumpet, for example) or a combination of embouchure and rolling the head joint (as on the flute), while others such as the clarinet can achieve this by slowly dragging fingers off tone holes or changing the oral cavity's resonance by manipulating tongue position, embouchure, and throat shaping.\nMany electric guitars are fitted with a tremolo arm which can produce either a portamento, a vibrato, or a combination of both (but not a true tremolo despite the name).\nPrescriptive attempts to distinguish the glissando from the portamento by limiting the former to discrete, stepped glides conflict with established usage of the term for instruments like the trombone and timpani. The clarinet gesture that opens \"Rhapsody in Blue\" was originally notated as a stepped glissando (Gershwin's score labels each individual note) but is in practice played as a portamento.\nBent note.\nA bent note is a musical note that is varied in pitch. With unfretted strings or other continuous-pitch instruments such as the trombone, or with the human voice, such variation is more properly described in terms of intonation. A note is commonly bent to a higher pitch on fretted instruments literally by bending the string with excess finger pressure, and to a lower pitch on harmonica (a free-reed aerophone) by altering the vocal tract to shift the resonance of the reed. On brass instruments such as the trumpet, the note is bent by using the lip. \"Indeterminately pitched instruments [such as unpitched percussion instruments and friction drum rolls]...produce a pitch or pitch spectrum that becomes higher with an increase of dynamic and lower with a decrease of dynamic.\"\nThe bent note is commonly found in various forms of jazz, blues, and rock.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12717", "revid": "49679309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12717", "title": "Giraffe", "text": "Tall African hoofed mammal\nThe giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, \"Giraffa camelopardalis\", with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species, with seven subspecies, which can be distinguished morphologically by their fur coat patterns. Six valid extinct species of \"Giraffa\" are known from the fossil record.\nThe giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach. Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large groups. Males establish social hierarchies through \"necking\", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.\nThe giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction. It has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in many national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of \"Giraffa\" in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"giraffe\" has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word (), of an ultimately unclear Sub-Saharan African language origin. The Middle English and early Modern English spellings, and , derive from the Arabic form-based Spanish and Portuguese \"girafa\". The modern English form developed around 1600 from the French .\n\"Camelopard\" () is an archaic English name for the giraffe; it derives from the Ancient Greek (), from (), \"camel\", and (), \"leopard\", referring to its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.\nTaxonomy.\nEvolution.\nThe giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. They are ruminants of the clade Pecora, along with Antilocapridae (pronghorns), Cervidae (deer), Bovidae (cattle, antelope, goats and sheep) and Moschidae (musk deer). A 2019 genome study (cladogram below) finds that Giraffidae are a sister taxon to Antilocapridae, with an estimated split of over 20 million years ago.\nThe family Giraffidae was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was \"Canthumeryx\", which has been dated variously to have lived https:// 20, 17\u201315\u00a0mya or 18\u201314.3\u00a0mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal resembled an antelope and had a medium-sized, lightly built body. \"Giraffokeryx\" appeared 15\u201312\u00a0mya on the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones. \"Giraffokeryx\" may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like \"Sivatherium\" and \"Bramatherium\".\nGiraffids like \"Palaeotragus\", \"Shansitherium\" and \"Samotherium\" appeared 14\u00a0mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia. These animals had broader skulls with reduced frontal cavities. \"Paleotragus\" resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor. Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before \"Giraffokeryx\". \"Samotherium\" was a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage, as the length and structure of its cervical vertebrae were between those of a modern giraffe and an okapi, and its neck posture was likely similar to the former's. \"Bohlinia\", which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9\u20137 mya, was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe. \"Bohlinia\" closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.\n\"Bohlinia\" colonised China and northern India and produced the \"Giraffa\", which, around https://\u00a0million years ago, reached Africa. Climate changes led to the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around https://\u00a0million years ago in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from \"G. jumae\"; others find \"G. gracilis\" a more likely candidate. \"G. jumae\" was larger and more robust, while \"G. gracilis\" was smaller and more slender.\nThe changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8\u00a0mya, are believed to be the main driver for the evolution of giraffes. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat, coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.\nThe giraffe genome is around 2.9 billion base pairs in length, compared to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appears responsible for the animal's height and associated circulatory adaptations.\nSpecies and subspecies.\nCarl Linnaeus originally classified living giraffes as one species in 1758. He gave it the binomial name \"Cervus camelopardalis\". Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the generic name \"Giraffa\" in 1762. During the 1900s, various taxonomies with two or three species were proposed. A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species. A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the phylogenetic species concept, described eight species of living giraffes. A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for one to two million years.\nA 2020 study showed that, depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six species can be considered for the genus \"Giraffa\". That study also found that multi-species coalescent methods can lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species. The three-species hypothesis, which recognises \"G. camelopardalis\", \"G. giraffa\", and \"G. tippelskirchi\", is highly supported by phylogenetic analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi-species coalescent analyses. A 2021 whole genome sequencing study suggests the existence of four distinct species and seven subspecies, which was supported by a 2024 study of cranial morphology. A 2024 study found a higher amount of ancient gene flow than expected between populations.\nThe cladogram below shows the phylogenetic relationship between the four species and seven subspecies based on a 2021 genome analysis. The eight lineages correspond to eight traditional subspecies in the one-species hypothesis. The Rothschild giraffe is subsumed into \"G. camelopardalis camelopardalis\".\nThe following table compares the different hypotheses for giraffe species. The description column shows the traditional nine subspecies in the one-species hypothesis.\nThe first extinct species to be described was \"Giraffa sivalensis\" from Pakistan, the holotype of which was reevaluated as a vertebra of separate species within the genus that was initially described as a fossil of the living giraffe. Another extinct species \"Giraffa punjabiensis\" is known from Pakistan. Four other valid extinct species of \"Giraffa\" known from Africa are \"Giraffa gracilis\", \"Giraffa jumae\", \"Giraffa pygmaea\" and \"Giraffa stillei\". \"G.\" \"pomeli\" from Algeria and Tunisia is not a species of Giraffinae, but a species of Palaeotraginae related to \"Mitilanotherium\".\nAnatomy.\nFully grown giraffes stand tall, with males taller than females. The average weight is for an adult male and for an adult female. Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short. The skin is mostly gray or tan, and can reach a thickness of . The long tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.\nThe coat has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black, surrounded by light hair, usually white or cream coloured. Male giraffes become darker as they grow old. The coat pattern to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more important for calves. Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern. Calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits is correlated with calf survival. The skin under the blotches may regulate the animal's body temperature, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Spotless or solid-colour giraffes are very rare, but have been observed.\nThe fur may give the animal chemical defense, as its parasite repellents give it a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because males have a stronger odour than females, it may also have a sexual function.\nHead.\nBoth sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, which can reach . They are formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin, and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularised, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation, and are used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males tend to be bald and knobbed on top. A lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges in the middle of the skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. Multiple sinuses lighten a giraffe's skull. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The occipital condyles at the bottom of the skull allow the animal to tip its head over 90 degrees and grab food on the branches directly above them with the tongue.\nWith eyes located on the sides of the head, the giraffe has a broad visual field from its great height. Compared to other ungulates, giraffe vision is more binocular and the eyes are larger with a greater retinal surface area. Giraffes may see in colour, and their senses of hearing and smell are sharp. The ears are movable. The nostrils are slit-shaped, possibly to withstand blowing sand. The giraffe's tongue is about long. It is black, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and can grasp foliage and delicately pick off leaves. The upper lip is flexible and hairy to protect against sharp prickles. The upper jaw has a hard palate instead of front teeth. The molars and premolars are wide with low crowns on the surface.\nNeck.\nThe giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to in length. Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The neck typically rests at an angle of 50\u201360 degrees, though juveniles are closer to 70 degrees. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over long. They comprise 52\u201354 per cent of the length of the giraffe's vertebral column, compared with the 27\u201333 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe's closest living relative, the okapi. This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a nuchal ligament, which are anchored by long thoracic vertebrae spines, giving them a hump.\nThe giraffe's neck vertebrae have ball and socket joints. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike in most other ruminants, where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.\nThere are several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks. Charles Darwin originally suggested the \"competing browsers hypothesis\", which has been challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, like kudu, steenbok and impala, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about high. There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy. However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers, and a 2010 study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter-necked counterparts. This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients, which puts longer-necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage.\nAnother theory, the sexual selection hypothesis, proposes that long necks evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic, giving males an advantage in \"necking\" contests to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, some studies have stated that necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and that males do not employ other forms of combat. However, a 2024 study found that, while males have thicker necks, females actually have proportionally longer ones, which is likely because of their greater need to find more food to sustain themselves and their dependent young. It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.\nLegs, locomotion and posture.\nThe front legs tend to be longer than the hind legs, and males have proportionally longer front legs than females, which gives them better support when swinging their necks during fights. The leg bones lack first, second and fifth metapodials. It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight. The hooves of large male giraffes reach in diameter. The fetlock of the leg is low to the ground, allowing the hoof to better support the animal's weight. Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. While the pelvis is relatively short, the ilium has stretched-out crests.\nA giraffe has only two gaits: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body, then doing the same on the other side. When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward, and the tail will curl up. The movements of the head and neck provide balance and control momentum while galloping. The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to , and can sustain for several kilometres. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they might be able to float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the water's surface.\nA giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its front knees and positions its backside on top of its hindlegs. It then pulls the backside upwards, and the front legs stand straight up again. At each stage, the animal swings its head for balance. If the giraffe wants to reach down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Studies in captivity found the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down; however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short \"deep sleep\" phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep.\nInternal systems.\nIn mammals, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right; in the giraffe, it is over longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal; the left nerve is over long. Each nerve cell in this path begins in the brainstem and passes down the neck along the vagus nerve, then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly in the largest giraffes. Despite its long neck and large skull, the brain of the giraffe is typical for an ungulate. Evaporative heat loss in the nasal passages keep the giraffe's brain cool. The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass. Its long neck gives it a large amount of dead space, though this is limited by its narrow windpipe. The giraffe also has a high tidal volume, so the balance of dead space and tidal volume is much the same as other mammals. The animal can still provide enough oxygen for its tissues, and it can increase its respiratory rate and oxygen diffusion when running.\nThe giraffe's circulatory system has several adaptations to compensate for its great height. Its and heart must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as . Giraffes have relatively high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute. When the animal lowers its head, the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck, with its large cross-sectional area, prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and push blood into the brain so the animal does not faint. The jugular veins contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight, preventing too much blood from pouring into them.\nGiraffes have oesophageal muscles that are strong enough to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for rumination. They have four-chambered stomachs, which are adapted to their specialized diet. The intestines of an adult giraffe measure more than in length and have a relatively small ratio of small to large intestine. The giraffe has a small, compact liver. In fetuses there may be a small gallbladder that vanishes before birth.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nHabitat and feeding.\nGiraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer areas dominated by Acacieae, \"Commiphora\", \"Combretum\" and \"Terminalia\" trees over \"Brachystegia\" which are more densely spaced. The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments. Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera \"Commiphora\" and \"Terminalia\", which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate. They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit. A giraffe eats around of plant matter daily. When stressed, giraffes may chew on large branches, stripping them of bark. Giraffes are also recorded to chew old bones.\nDuring the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe will go no more than three days without drinking.\nGiraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving \"waistlines\" to particularly tall trees. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.\nSocial life.\nGiraffes usually form groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors. Traditionally, the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever-changing. For research purposes, a \"group\" has been defined as \"a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction\". More recent studies have found that giraffes have long-lasting social groups or cliques based on kinship, sex or other factors, and these groups regularly associate with other groups in larger communities or sub-communities within a fission\u2013fusion society. Proximity to humans can disrupt social arrangements. Masai giraffes in Tanzania sort themselves into different subpopulations of 60\u201390 adult females with overlapping ranges, each of which differ in reproductive rates and calf mortality. Dispersal is male biased, and can include spatial and/or social dispersal. Adult female subpopulations are connected by males into super communities of around 300 animals.\nThe number of giraffes in a group can range from one up to 66 individuals. Giraffe groups tend to be sex-segregated although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur. Female groups may be matrilineally related. Generally, females are more selective than males when deciding which individuals of the same sex they associate with. Particularly stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older, males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlements. Male giraffes occasionally roam far from areas that they normally frequent.\nEarly biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to create enough air flow to vibrate their vocal folds. This has been proved to the contrary; they have been recorded to communicate using snorts, sneezes, coughs, snores, hisses, bursts, moans, grunts, growls and flute-like sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Snorting and hissing is associated with vigilance. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other. There is some evidence that giraffes use Helmholtz resonance to create infrasound. They also communicate with body language. Dominant males display to other males with an erect posture; holding the chin and head up while walking stiffly and displaying their side. The less dominant show submissiveness by dropping the head and ears, lowering the chin and fleeing.\nReproduction and parental care.\nReproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males mate with the fertile females. Females can reproduce throughout the year and experience oestrus cycling approximately every 15 days. Female giraffes in oestrus are dispersed over space and time, so reproductive adult males adopt a strategy of roaming among female groups to seek mating opportunities, with periodic hormone-induced rutting behaviour approximately every two weeks. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults.\nMale giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step process known as the flehmen response. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, lay his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his ossicones. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.\nGiraffe gestation lasts 400\u2013460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions. The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the fetal membranes, and falls to the ground, severing the umbilical cord. A newborn giraffe is tall. Within a few hours of birth, the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a one-week-old. However, for the first one to three weeks, it spends most of its time hiding, its coat pattern providing camouflage. The ossicones, which have lain flat in the womb, raise up in a few days.\nMothers with calves will gather in nursery herds, moving or browsing together. Mothers in such a group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere. This is known as a \"calving pool\". Calves are at risk of predation, and a mother giraffe will stand over them and kick at an approaching predator. Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance, although the others will take notice and follow. Allo-sucking, where a calf will suckle a female other than its mother, has been recorded in both wild and captive giraffes. Calves first ruminate at four to six months and stop nursing at six to eight months. Young may not reach independence until they are 14 months old. Females are able to reproduce at four years of age, while spermatogenesis in males begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.\nNecking.\nMale giraffes use their necks as weapons in combat, a behaviour known as \"necking\". Necking is used to establish dominance, and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low-intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean on each other. The male that can keep itself more upright wins the bout. In high-intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then prepare to counter. The power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are. Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.\nAfter a duel, it is common for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such interactions between males have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30 to 75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.\nMortality and health.\nGiraffes have high adult survival probability, and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, up to 38 years. Adult female survival is significantly correlated with the number of social associations. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are mostly safe from predation, with lions being their only major threats. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults and are also preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates.\nThe local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability. In turn, it has been suggested that other ungulates may benefit from associating with giraffes, as their height allows them to spot predators from further away. Zebras were found to assess predation risk by watching giraffes and spend less time looking around when giraffes are present.\nSome parasites feed on giraffes. They are often hosts for ticks, especially in the area around the genitals, which have thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera \"Hyalomma\", \"Amblyomma\" and \"Rhipicephalus\". Red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers clean giraffes of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasites and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which comes in the form of wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. As much as 79% of giraffes have symptoms of the disease in Ruaha National Park, but it did not cause mortality in Tarangire and is less prevalent in areas with fertile soils.\nHuman relations.\nCultural significance.\nWith its lanky build and spotted coat, the giraffe has been a source of fascination throughout human history, and its image is widespread in culture. It has represented flexibility, far-sightedness, femininity, fragility, passivity, grace, beauty and the continent of Africa itself.\nGiraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent. The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes, dated 8,000 years ago, that has been called the \"world's largest rock art petroglyph\". Judging from evidence including incised clay pots, archaeologists now believe that, in the ancient Kushite societies located in Nubia, or what is now northern Sudan, giraffes may have featured in popular religion and women's religion, though not in elite or royal religion, and may have also had a connection to beliefs about the sun. The Tugen people of modern Kenya used the giraffe to depict their god Mda. The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own hieroglyph; 'sr' in Old Egyptian and 'mmy' in later periods. How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales.\nGiraffes have a presence in modern Western culture. Salvador Dal\u00ed depicted them with burning manes in some surrealist paintings. Dali considered the giraffe to be a masculine symbol. A flaming giraffe was meant to be a \"masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster\". Several children's books feature the giraffe, including David A. Ufer's \"The Giraffe Who Was Afraid of Heights\", Giles Andreae's \"Giraffes Can't Dance\" and Roald Dahl's \"The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me\". Giraffes have appeared in animated films as minor characters in Disney's \"Dumbo\" and \"The Lion King\", and in more prominent roles in \"The Wild\" and the \"Madagascar\" films. Sophie the Giraffe has been a popular teether since 1961. Another famous fictional giraffe is the Toys \"R\" Us mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe.\nThe giraffe has also been used for some scientific experiments and discoveries. Scientists have used the properties of giraffe skin as a model for astronaut and fighter pilot suits because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to their legs. Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using reaction\u2013diffusion mechanisms. The constellation of Camelopardalis, introduced in the 17th century, depicts a giraffe. The Tswana people of Botswana traditionally see the constellation Crux as two giraffes\u2014Acrux and Mimosa forming a male, and Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female.\nCaptivity.\nThe Egyptians were among the earliest people to keep giraffes in captivity and shipped them around the Mediterranean. The giraffe was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in 46\u00a0BC. With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.\nIndividual captive giraffes were given celebrity status throughout history. In 1414, a giraffe from Malindi was taken to China by explorer Zheng He and placed in a Ming dynasty zoo. The animal was a source of fascination for the Chinese people, who associated it with the mythical Qilin. The Medici giraffe was a giraffe presented to Lorenzo de' Medici in 1486. It caused a great stir on its arrival in Florence. Zarafa, another famous giraffe, was brought from Egypt to Paris in the early 19th century as a gift for Charles\u00a0X of France. A sensation, the giraffe was the subject of numerous memorabilia or \"giraffanalia\".\nGiraffes have become popular attractions in modern zoos, though keeping them is difficult as they prefer large areas and need to eat large amounts of browse. Captive giraffes in North America and Europe appear to have a higher mortality rate than in the wild, the most common causes being poor husbandry, nutrition, and management. Giraffes in zoos display stereotypical behaviours, particularly the licking of inanimate objects and pacing. Zookeepers may offer various activities to stimulate giraffes, including training them to take food from visitors. Stables for giraffes are built particularly high to accommodate their height.\nExploitation.\nGiraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs were flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces, and threads. Shields, sandals, and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. In Buganda, the smoke of burning giraffe skin was traditionally used to treat nosebleeds. The Humr people of Kordofan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh, which is prepared from the liver and bone marrow of giraffes. Richard Rudgley hypothesised that Umm Nyolokh might contain DMT. The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts, by the Humr.\nConservation status.\nIn 2016, giraffes were assessed as Vulnerable from a conservation perspective by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 1985, it was estimated there were 155,000 giraffes in the wild. This declined to over 140,000 in 1999. Estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of \"Giraffa\" in the wild. The Masai and reticulated subspecies are endangered, and the Rothschild subspecies is near threatened. The Nubian subspecies is critically endangered. In 2025, the IUCN currently accepted four species of giraffe with seven subspecies.\nThe primary causes for giraffe population declines are habitat loss and direct killing for bushmeat markets. Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range, including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also have disappeared from Angola, Mali, and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Eswatini. As of 2010[ [update]], there were more than 1,600 in captivity at Species360-registered zoos. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe. In the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they avoid direct competition by feeding above them. In 2017, severe droughts in northern Kenya led to increased tensions over land and the killing of wildlife by herders, with giraffe populations being particularly hit.\nProtected areas like national parks provide important habitat and anti-poaching protection to giraffe populations. Community-based conservation efforts outside national parks are also effective at protecting giraffes and their habitats. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in eastern and southern Africa. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law, and unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. The UN-backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. In 2019, giraffes were listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which means international trade including in parts/derivatives is regulated.\nTranslocations are sometimes used to augment or re-establish diminished or extirpated populations, but these activities are risky and difficult to undertake using the best practices of extensive pre- and post-translocation studies and ensuring a viable founding population. Aerial survey is the most common method of monitoring giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and can be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Griffith's findings were followed by research in the late 1930s and early 40s that isolated DNA as the material that communicated this genetic information.\nPneumonia was a serious cause of death in the wake of the post-WWI Spanish influenza pandemic, and Griffith was studying the possibility of creating a vaccine. Griffith used two strains of pneumococcus (\"Streptococcus pneumoniae\") bacteria which infect mice \u2013 a type III-S (smooth) which was virulent, and a type II-R (rough) strain which was nonvirulent. The III-S strain synthesized a polysaccharide capsule that protected itself from the host's immune system, resulting in the death of the host, while the II-R strain did not have that protective capsule and was defeated by the host's immune system. A German bacteriologist, Fred Neufeld, had discovered the three pneumococcal types (Types I, II, and III) and discovered the quellung reaction to identify them \"in vitro\". Until Griffith's experiment, bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable, from one generation to another.\nIn this experiment, bacteria from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither alone harmed the mice, the combination was able to kill its host. Griffith was also able to isolate both live II-R and live III-S strains of pneumococcus from the blood of these dead mice. Griffith concluded that the type II-R had been \"transformed\" into the lethal III-S strain by a \"transforming principle\" that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.\nScientific advances since then have revealed that the \"transforming principle\" Griffith observed was the DNA of the III-s strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the smooth protective polysaccharide capsule. Equipped with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host. The exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was verified in the experiments done by Avery, McLeod and McCarty and by Hershey and Chase.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n(References the original experiment by Griffith. http:// and https:// available.\")"}

An example of this was the American Civil War which Molinari believed to be far more about the trade interests of Northern industrialists than about slavery, although he did not deny that abolitionism was a part of the picture. According to Ralph Raico, Molinari never relented in his last work published a year before his death in 1912, writing:\nThe American Civil War had not been simply a humanitarian crusade to free the slaves. The war \"ruined the conquered provinces,\" but the Northern plutocrats pulling the strings achieved their aim: the imposition of a vicious protectionism that led ultimately \"to the regime of trusts and produced the billionaires.\"\nMolinari supported his liberal views by citing evolutionary concepts, claiming that the \"economic state\" (an international commercial system) would have a complete laissez-faire. He argued this was the ultimate stage of social evolution, caused by a struggle for existence between competing commercial actors. War has been the driver of early social systems, he felt, which encouraged invention as a result. After industry developed, however, wars grew detrimental rather than beneficial, replaced with economic competition. Molinari felt this would be better, since it applied to all classes in society. As the less fit were eliminated by competition, the entire society would be raised over time. He argued competition like this would never end, but continue forever. Molinari opposed both monarchy and socialism as a result of being detrimental to this process. Acknowledging that great poverty had risen in tandem with wealth, he argued it would be eliminated through moral evolution occurring alongside the economic progress, which was necessary for it.\nInfluence.\nSome anarcho-capitalists consider Molinari to be the first proponent of anarcho-capitalism. In the preface to the 1977 English translation by Murray Rothbard called \"The Production of Security\" the \"first presentation anywhere in human history of what is now called anarcho-capitalism\", although admitting that \"Molinari did not use the terminology, and probably would have balked at the name\". Austrian School economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe said that \"the 1849 article 'The Production of Security' is probably the single most important contribution to the modern theory of anarcho-capitalism\". In the past, Molinari influenced some of the political thoughts of individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker and the \"Liberty\" circle. The Molinari Institute directed by philosopher Roderick T. Long is named after him, whom it terms the \"originator of the theory of Market Anarchism\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12720", "revid": "10248457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12720", "title": "Guerrilla warfare", "text": "Form of irregular warfare\nGuerrilla warfare is a type of unconventional warfare in which small groups of irregular military, such as rebels, partisans, paramilitary personnel or armed civilians, which may include children in the military, use ambushes, sabotage, terrorism, raids, petty warfare or hit-and-run tactics in a rebellion, in a violent conflict, in a war or in a civil war to fight against regular military, police or rival insurgent forces.\nAlthough the term \"guerrilla warfare\" was coined in the context of the Peninsular War in the 19th century, the tactical methods of guerrilla warfare have long been in use. In the 6th century BC, Sun Tzu proposed the use of guerrilla-style tactics in \"The Art of War\". The 3rd century BC Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus is also credited with inventing many of the tactics of guerrilla warfare through what is today called the Fabian strategy, and in China Peng Yue is also often regarded as the inventor of guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare has been used by various factions throughout history and is particularly associated with revolutionary movements and popular resistance against invading or occupying armies.\nGuerrilla tactics focus on avoiding head-on confrontations with enemy armies, typically due to inferior arms or forces, and instead engage in limited skirmishes with the goal of exhausting adversaries and forcing them to withdraw (see also attrition warfare). Organized guerrilla groups often depend on the support of either the local population or foreign backers who sympathize with the guerrilla group's efforts.\nEtymology.\nThe Spanish word is the diminutive form of (\"war\"); hence, \"little war\". The term became popular during the early-19th century Peninsular War, when, after the defeat of their regular armies, the Spanish and Portuguese people successfully rose against the Napoleonic troops and defeated a highly superior army using the guerrilla strategy in combination with a scorched earth policy and people's war (see also attrition warfare against Napoleon). In correct Spanish usage, a person who is a member of a unit is a () if male, or a (]) if female. Arthur Wellesley adopted the term \"guerrilla\" into English from Spanish usage in 1809, to refer to the individual \"fighters\" (e.g., \"I have recommended to set the Guerrillas to work\"), and also (as in Spanish) to denote \"a group or band\" of such fighters. However, in most languages \"guerrilla\" still denotes a specific style of warfare. The use of the diminutive evokes the differences in number, scale, and scope between the guerrilla army and the formal, professional army of the state.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric tribal warriors presumably employed guerrilla-style tactics against enemy tribes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Primitive (and guerrilla) warfare consists of war stripped to its essentials: the murder of enemies; the theft or destruction of their sustenance, wealth, and essential resources; and the inducement in them of insecurity and terror. It conducts the basic business of war without recourse to ponderous formations or equipment, complicated maneuvers, strict chains of command, calculated strategies, timetables, or other civilized embellishments.\nEvidence of conventional warfare, on the other hand, did not emerge until 3100 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu, in his \"The Art of War\" (6th century BC), became one of the earliest to propose the use of guerrilla warfare. This inspired developments in modern guerrilla warfare.\nIn the 3rd century BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, called \"Cunctator\" (\"delayer\"), used elements of guerrilla warfare, such as the evasion of battle, the attempt to wear down the enemy, to attack small detachments in an ambush and devised the Fabian strategy, which the Roman Republic used to great effect against Hannibal's army, see also \"His Excellency : George Washington\": the Fabian choice. The Roman general Quintus Sertorius is also noted for his skillful use of guerrilla warfare during his revolt against the Roman Senate. In China, Han dynasty general Peng Yue is often regarded as the inventor of guerrilla warfare due to his use of irregular warfare in the Chu-Han contention to attack Chu convoys and supplies.\nIn the Byzantine Empire, guerrilla warfare was frequently practiced between the eighth through tenth centuries along the eastern frontier with the Umayyad and then Abbasid caliphates. Tactics involved a heavy emphasis on reconnaissance and intelligence, shadowing the enemy, evacuating threatened population centres, and attacking when the enemy dispersed to raid. In the later tenth century this form of warfare was codified in a military manual known by its later Latin name as \"De velitatione bellica\" ('On Skirmishing') so it would not be forgotten in the future.\nThe Normans often made many forays into Wales, where the Welsh used the mountainous region, which the Normans were unfamiliar with, to spring surprise attacks upon them.\nGonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba successfully employed guerrilla warfare during the Italian Wars, where his Italian lieutenant and successor Prospero Colonna was called \"Cuntatore\" after Quintus Fabius Maximus due to their similar tactics. Guerrilla warfare eventually became one of the specialties of the Spanish \"tercios\", including techniques like the camisado.\nSince the Enlightenment, ideologies such as nationalism, liberalism, socialism, and religious fundamentalism have played an important role in shaping insurgencies and guerrilla warfare.\nIn the 17th century, Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, founder of the Maratha Kingdom, pioneered the \"Shiva sutra\" or \"Ganimi Kava\" (Guerrilla Tactics) to defeat the many times larger and more powerful armies of the Mughal Empire.\nThe Dominican Restoration War was a guerrilla war between 1863 and 1865 in the Dominican Republic between nationalists and Spain, the latter of which had recolonized the country 17 years after its independence. The war resulted in the withdrawal of Spanish forces and the establishment of a second republic in the Dominican Republic.\nThe Riffian Berber military leader Abd el-Krim (c.\u20091883 \u2013 1963) and his father unified the Berber tribes under their control and took up arms against the Spanish and French occupiers during the Rif War in 1920. For the first time in history, tunnel warfare was used alongside modern guerrilla tactics, which caused considerable damage to both the colonial armies in Morocco.\nIn the early 20th century Michael Collins and Tom Barry both developed many tactical features of guerrilla warfare during the guerrilla phase of the 1919\u20131921 Irish War of Independence. Collins developed mainly urban guerrilla warfare tactics in Dublin City (the Irish capital). Operations in which small Irish Republican Army (IRA) units (3 to 6 guerrillas) quickly attacked a target and then disappeared into civilian crowds. In County Cork, Tom Barry was the commander of the IRA West Cork brigade. Fighting in west Cork was rural, and the IRA fought in much larger units than their comrades in urban areas. These units, called \"flying columns\", engaged British forces in large battles, usually for between 10\u201330 minutes. \nThe Algerian Revolution of 1954 started with a handful of Algerian guerrillas. Primitively armed, the guerrillas fought the French for over eight years. This remains a prototype for modern insurgency and counterinsurgency, terrorism, torture, and asymmetric warfare prevalent throughout the world today. In South Africa, African National Congress (ANC) members studied the Algerian War, prior to the release and apotheosis of Nelson Mandela; in their intifada against Israel, Palestinian fighters have sought to emulate it. Additionally, the tactics of Al-Qaeda closely resemble those of the Algerians.\nTheoretical works.\nThe growth of guerrilla warfare was inspired in part by theoretical works on guerrilla warfare, starting with the \"Manual de Guerra de Guerrillas\" by Mat\u00edas Ram\u00f3n Mella written in the 19th century:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...our troops should...fight while protected by the terrain...using small, mobile guerrilla units to exhaust the enemy...denying them rest so that they only control the terrain under their feet.\nMore recently, Mao Zedong's \"On Guerrilla Warfare\", Che Guevara's \"Guerrilla Warfare\", and Lenin's \"Guerrilla warfare\", were all written after the successful revolutions carried out by them in China, Cuba and Russia, respectively. Those texts characterized the tactic of guerrilla warfare as, according to Che Guevara's text, being \"used by the side which is supported by a majority but which possesses a much smaller number of arms for use in defense against oppression\".\nFoco theory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Why does the guerrilla fighter fight? We must come to the inevitable conclusion that the guerrilla fighter is a social reformer, that he takes up arms responding to the angry protest of the people against their oppressors, and that he fights in order to change the social system that keeps all his unarmed brothers in ignominy and misery.\u2014\u200a\nIn the 1960s, the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara developed the \"foco\" () theory of revolution in his book \"Guerrilla Warfare\", based on his experiences during the 1959 Cuban Revolution. This theory was later formalized as \"focal-ism\" by R\u00e9gis Debray. Its central principle is that vanguardism by cadres of small, fast-moving paramilitary groups can provide a focus for popular discontent against a sitting regime, and thereby lead a general insurrection. Although the original approach was to mobilize and launch attacks from rural areas, many \"foco\" ideas were adapted into urban guerrilla warfare movements.\nStrategy, tactics and methods.\nStrategy.\nGuerrilla warfare is a type of asymmetric warfare: competition between opponents of unequal strength. It is also a type of irregular warfare: that is, it aims not simply to defeat an invading enemy, but to win popular support and political influence, to the enemy's cost. Accordingly, guerrilla strategy aims to magnify the impact of a small, mobile force on a larger, more cumbersome one. If successful, guerrillas weaken their enemy by attrition, eventually forcing them to withdraw.\nTactics.\nTactically, guerrillas usually avoid confrontation with large units and formations of enemy troops but seek and attack small groups of enemy personnel and resources to gradually deplete the opposing force while minimizing their own losses. The guerrilla prizes mobility, secrecy, and surprise, organizing in small units and taking advantage of terrain that is difficult for larger units to use. For example, Mao Zedong summarized basic guerrilla tactics at the beginning of the Chinese Civil War as:\"The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.\" At least one author credits the ancient Chinese work \"The Art of War\" with inspiring Mao's tactics. In the 20th century, other communist leaders, including North Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh, often used and developed guerrilla warfare tactics, which provided a model for their use elsewhere, leading to the Cuban \"foco\" theory and the anti-Soviet Mujahadeen in Afghanistan.\nUnconventional methods.\nGuerrilla groups may use improvised explosive devices and logistical support by the local population. The opposing army may come at last to suspect all civilians as potential guerrilla backers. The guerrillas might get political support from foreign backers and many guerrilla groups are adept at public persuasion through propaganda and use of force. Some guerrilla movements today also rely heavily on children as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles. Many governments and states also recruit children within their armed forces.\nComparison of guerrilla warfare and terrorism.\nNo commonly accepted definition of \"terrorism\" has attained clear consensus. The term \"terrorism\" is often used as political propaganda by belligerents (most often by governments in power) to denounce opponents whose status as terrorists is disputed.\nWhile the primary concern of guerrillas is the enemy's active military units, actual terrorists largely are concerned with non-military agents and target mostly civilians.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution:"}

The version given below attempts to represent all the steps in the proof and all the important ideas faithfully, while restating the proof in the modern language of mathematical logic. This outline should not be considered a rigorous proof of the theorem.\nAssumptions.\nWe work with first-order predicate calculus. Our languages allow constant, function and relation symbols. Structures consist of (non-empty) domains and interpretations of the relevant symbols as constant members, functions or relations over that domain.\nWe assume classical logic (as opposed to intuitionistic logic for example).\nWe fix some axiomatization (i.e. a syntax-based, machine-manageable proof system) of the predicate calculus: logical axioms and rules of inference. Any of the several well-known equivalent axiomatizations will do. G\u00f6del's original proof assumed the Hilbert-Ackermann proof system.\nWe assume without proof all the basic well-known results about our formalism that we need, such as the normal form theorem or the soundness theorem.\nWe axiomatize predicate calculus \"without equality\" (sometimes confusingly called \"without identity\"), i.e. there are no special axioms expressing the properties of (object) equality as a special relation symbol. After the basic form of the theorem has been proved, it will be easy to extend it to the case of predicate calculus \"with equality\".\nStatement of the theorem and its proof.\nIn the following, we state two equivalent forms of the theorem, and show their equivalence.\nLater, we prove the theorem. This is done in the following steps:\n \u2200x1\u2200x2...\u2200xk \u2203y1\u2203y2...\u2203ym \u03c6(x1...xk, y1...ym) is either refutable (its negation is always true) or satisfiable, i.e. there is some model in which it holds (it might even be always true, i.e. a tautology); this model is simply assigning truth values to the subpropositions from which B is built. The reason for that is the completeness of propositional logic, with the existential quantifiers playing no role.\nTheorem 1. Every valid formula (true in all structures) is provable..\nThis is the most basic form of the completeness theorem. We immediately restate it in a form more convenient for our purposes:\nWhen we say \"all structures\", it is important to specify that the structures involved are classical (Tarskian) interpretations I, where I\u00a0=\u00a0 (U is a non-empty (possibly infinite) set of objects, whereas F is a set of functions from expressions of the interpreted symbolism into U). [By contrast, so-called \"free logics\" allow possibly empty sets for U. For more regarding free logics, see the work of Karel Lambert.]\nTheorem 2. Every formula \u03c6 is either refutable or satisfiable in some structure..\n\"\"\u03c6\" is refutable\" means \"by definition\" \"\u00ac\"\u03c6\" is provable\".\nEquivalence of both theorems.\nIf Theorem 1 holds, and \u03c6 is not satisfiable in any structure, then \u00ac\u03c6 is valid in all structures and therefore provable, thus \u03c6 is refutable and Theorem 2 holds. If on the other hand Theorem 2 holds and \u03c6 is valid in all structures, then \u00ac\u03c6 is not satisfiable in any structure and therefore refutable; then \u00ac\u00ac\u03c6 is provable and then so is \u03c6, thus Theorem 1 holds.\nProof of theorem 2: first step.\nWe approach the proof of Theorem 2 by successively restricting the class of all formulas \u03c6 for which we need to prove \"\u03c6 is either refutable or satisfiable\". At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas \u03c6 in our language. However, suppose that for every formula \u03c6 there is some formula \u03c8 taken from a more restricted class of formulas C, such that \"\u03c8 is either refutable or satisfiable\" \u2192 \"\u03c6 is either refutable or satisfiable\". Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove \"\u03c6 is either refutable or satisfiable\" only for \u03c6's belonging to the class C. If \u03c6 is provably equivalent to \u03c8 (\"i.e.\", (\"\u03c6\"\u00a0\u2261\u00a0\"\u03c8\") is provable), then it is indeed the case that \"\u03c8 is either refutable or satisfiable\" \u2192 \"\"\u03c6\" is either refutable or satisfiable\" (the soundness theorem is needed to show this).\nThere are standard techniques for rewriting an arbitrary formula into one that does not use function or constant symbols, at the cost of introducing additional quantifiers; we will therefore assume that all formulas are free of such symbols. G\u00f6del's paper uses a version of first-order predicate calculus that has no function or constant symbols to begin with.\nNext we consider a generic formula \"\u03c6\" (which no longer uses function or constant symbols) and apply the prenex form theorem to find a formula \"\u03c8\" in \"normal form\" such that \"\u03c6\"\u00a0\u2261\u00a0\"\u03c8\" (\"\u03c8\" being in \"normal form\" means that all the quantifiers in \"\u03c8\", if there are any, are found at the very beginning of \"\u03c8\"). It follows now that we need only prove Theorem 2 for formulas \"\u03c6\" in normal form.\nNext, we eliminate all free variables from \"\u03c6\" by quantifying them existentially: if, say, \"x\"1...\"x\"\"n\" are free in \"\u03c6\", we form formula_1. If \"\u03c8\" is satisfiable in a structure \"M\", then certainly so is \"\u03c6\" and if \"\u03c8\" is refutable, then formula_2 is provable, and then so is \u00ac\"\u03c6\", thus \"\u03c6\" is refutable. We see that we can restrict \"\u03c6\" to be a \"sentence\", that is, a formula with no free variables.\nFinally, we would like, for reasons of technical convenience, that the \"prefix\" of \"\u03c6\" (that is, the string of quantifiers at the beginning of \"\u03c6\", which is in normal form) begin with a universal quantifier and end with an existential quantifier. To achieve this for a generic \"\u03c6\" (subject to restrictions we have already proved), we take some one-place relation symbol F unused in \"\u03c6\", and two new variables y and z.. If \"\u03c6\" = (P)\u03a6, where (P) stands for the prefix of \"\u03c6\" and \u03a6 for the \"matrix\" (the remaining, quantifier-free part of \"\u03c6\") we form formula_3. Since formula_4 is clearly provable, it is easy to see that formula_5 is provable.\nReducing the theorem to formulas of degree 1.\nOur generic formula \u03c6 now is a sentence, in normal form, and its prefix starts with a universal quantifier and ends with an existential quantifier. Let us call the class of all such formulas R. We are faced with proving that every formula in R is either refutable or satisfiable. Given our formula \u03c6, we group strings of quantifiers of one kind together in blocks:\nformula_6\nWe define the degree of formula_7 to be the number of universal quantifier blocks, separated by existential quantifier blocks as shown above, in the prefix of formula_7. The following lemma, which G\u00f6del adapted from Skolem's proof of the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, lets us sharply reduce the complexity of the generic formula formula_7 we need to prove the theorem for:\nLemma. Let \"k\"\u00a0\u2265\u00a01. If every formula in R of degree \"k\" is either refutable or satisfiable, then so is every formula in R of degree \"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01.\nComment: Take a formula \"\u03c6\" of degree \"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01 of the form formula_10, where formula_11 is the remainder of formula_7 (it is thus of degree \"k\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01). \u03c6 states that for every x there is a y such that... (something). It would have been nice to have a predicate \"Q' \" so that for every x, \"Q\"\u2032(\"x\",\"y\") would be true if and only if \"y\" is the required one to make (something) true. Then we could have written a formula of degree \"k\", which is equivalent to \u03c6, namely formula_13. This formula is indeed equivalent to \u03c6 because it states that for every x, if there is a y that satisfies Q'(x,y), then (something) holds, and furthermore, we know that there is such a y, because for every x', there is a y' that satisfies Q'(x',y'). Therefore \u03c6 follows from this formula. It is also easy to show that if the formula is false, then so is \u03c6. Unfortunately, in general there is no such predicate Q'. However, this idea can be understood as a basis for the following proof of the Lemma.\nProof. Let \u03c6 be a formula of degree \"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01; then we can write it as\nformula_10\nwhere (P) is the remainder of the prefix of formula_7 (it is thus of degree \"k\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a01) and formula_16 is the quantifier-free matrix of formula_7. x, y, u and v denote here \"tuples\" of variables rather than single variables; \"e.g.\" formula_18 really stands for formula_19 where formula_20 are some distinct variables.\nLet now x' and y' be tuples of previously unused variables of the same length as x and y respectively, and let Q be a previously unused relation symbol that takes as many arguments as the sum of lengths of x and y; we consider the formula\nformula_21\nClearly, formula_22 is provable.\nNow since the string of quantifiers formula_23 does not contain variables from x or y, the following equivalence is easily provable with the help of whatever formalism we're using:\nformula_24\nAnd since these two formulas are equivalent, if we replace the first with the second inside \u03a6, we obtain the formula \u03a6' such that \u03a6\u2261\u03a6':\nformula_25\nNow \u03a6' has the form formula_26, where (S) and (S') are some quantifier strings, \u03c1 and \u03c1' are quantifier-free, and, furthermore, no variable of (S) occurs in \u03c1' and no variable of (S') occurs in \u03c1. Under such conditions every formula of the form formula_27, where (T) is a string of quantifiers containing all quantifiers in (S) and (S') interleaved among themselves in any fashion, but maintaining the relative order inside (S) and (S'), will be equivalent to the original formula \u03a6'(this is yet another basic result in first-order predicate calculus that we rely on). To wit, we form \u03a8 as follows:\nformula_28\nand we have formula_29.\nNow formula_30 is a formula of degree \"k\" and therefore by assumption either refutable or satisfiable.\nIf formula_30 is satisfiable in a structure M, then, considering formula_32, we see that formula_7 is satisfiable as well.\nIf formula_30 is refutable, then so is formula_35, which is equivalent to it; thus formula_36 is provable.\nNow we can replace all occurrences of Q inside the provable formula formula_36 by some other formula dependent on the same variables, and we will still get a provable formula.\nIn this particular case, we replace Q(x',y') in formula_36 with the formula formula_40. Here (x,y\u00a0|\u00a0x',y') means that instead of \u03c8 we are writing a different formula, in which x and y are replaced with x' and y'. Q(x,y) is simply replaced by formula_41.\nformula_36 then becomes\nformula_43\nand this formula is provable; since the part under negation and after the formula_44 sign is obviously provable, and the part under negation and before the formula_44 sign is obviously \u03c6, just with x and y replaced by x' and y', we see that formula_46 is provable, and \u03c6 is refutable. We have proved that \u03c6 is either satisfiable or refutable, and this concludes the proof of the Lemma.\nNotice that we could not have used formula_40 instead of Q(x',y') from the beginning, because formula_30 would not have been a well-formed formula in that case. This is why we cannot naively use the argument appearing at the comment that precedes the proof.\nProving the theorem for formulas of degree 1.\nAs shown by the Lemma above, we only need to prove our theorem for formulas \u03c6 in R of degree 1. \u03c6 cannot be of degree 0, since formulas in R have no free variables and don't use constant symbols. So the formula \u03c6 has the general form:\nformula_49\nNow we define an ordering of the \"k\"-tuples of natural numbers as follows: formula_50 should hold if either formula_51, or formula_52, and formula_53 precedes formula_54 in lexicographic order. [Here formula_55 denotes the sum of the terms of the tuple.] Denote the nth tuple in this order by formula_56.\nSet the formula formula_57 as formula_58. Then put formula_59 as \nformula_60\nLemma: For every \"n\", formula_61.\nProof: By induction on \"n\"; we have formula_62, where the latter implication holds by variable substitution, since the ordering of the tuples is such that formula_63. But the last formula is equivalent to formula_64\u03c6.\nFor the base case, formula_65 is obviously a corollary of \u03c6 as well. So the Lemma is proven.\nNow if formula_66 is refutable for some \"n\", it follows that \u03c6 is refutable. On the other hand, suppose that formula_66 is not refutable for any \"n\". Then for each \"n\" there is some way of assigning truth values to the distinct subpropositions formula_68 (ordered by their first appearance in formula_59; \"distinct\" here means either distinct predicates, or distinct bound variables) in formula_70, such that formula_66 will be true when each proposition is evaluated in this fashion. This follows from the completeness of the underlying propositional logic.\nWe will now show that there is such an assignment of truth values to formula_68, so that all formula_59 will be true: The formula_68 appear in the same order in every formula_66; we will inductively define a general assignment to them by a sort of \"majority vote\": Since there are infinitely many assignments (one for each formula_66) affecting formula_77, either infinitely many make formula_77 true, or infinitely many make it false and only finitely many make it true. In the former case, we choose formula_77 to be true in general; in the latter we take it to be false in general. Then from the infinitely many \"n\" for which formula_77 through formula_81 are assigned the same truth value as in the general assignment, we pick a general assignment to formula_68 in the same fashion.\nThis general assignment must lead to every one of the formula_83 and formula_84 being true, since if one of the formula_83 were false under the general assignment, formula_59 would also be false for every \"n &gt; k\". But this contradicts the fact that for the finite collection of general formula_68 assignments appearing in formula_84, there are infinitely many \"n\" where the assignment making formula_59 true matches the general assignment.\nFrom this general assignment, which makes all of the formula_84 true, we construct an interpretation of the language's predicates that makes \u03c6 true. The universe of the model will be the natural numbers. Each i-ary predicate formula_30 should be true of the naturals formula_92 precisely when the proposition formula_93 is either true in the general assignment, or not assigned by it (because it never appears in any of the formula_84).\nIn this model, each of the formulas formula_95 is true by construction. But this implies that \u03c6 itself is true in the model, since the formula_96 range over all possible k-tuples of natural numbers. So \u03c6 is satisfiable, and we are done.\nIntuitive explanation.\nWe may write each \"B\"\"i\" as \u03a6(\"x\"1...\"x\"\"k\",\"y\"1...\"y\"\"m\") for some \"x\"s, which we may call \"first arguments\" and \"y\"s that we may call \"last arguments\".\nTake \"B\"1 for example. Its \"last arguments\" are \"z\"2,\"z\"3...\"z\"\"m\"+1, and for every possible combination of \"k\" of these variables there is some \"j\" so that they appear as \"first arguments\" in \"B\"\"j\". Thus for large enough \"n\"1, \"D\"\"n\"1 has the property that the \"last arguments\" of \"B\"1 appear, in every possible combinations of \"k\" of them, as \"first arguments\" in other \"B\"\"j\"s within \"D\"\"n\". For every Bi there is a Dni with the corresponding property.\nTherefore, in a model that satisfies all the \"D\"\"n\"s, there are objects corresponding to \"z\"1, \"z\"2... and each combination of \"k\" of these appear as \"first arguments\" in some \"B\"\"j\", meaning that for every \"k\" of these objects \"z\"\"p\"1...\"z\"\"p\"\"k\" there are \"z\"\"q\"1...\"z\"\"q\"\"m\", which makes \u03a6(\"z\"\"p\"1...\"z\"\"p\"\"k\",\"z\"\"q\"1...\"z\"\"q\"\"m\") satisfied. By taking a submodel with only these \"z\"1, \"z\"2... objects, we have a model satisfying\u00a0\"\u03c6\".\nExtensions.\nExtension to first-order predicate calculus with equality.\nG\u00f6del reduced a formula containing instances of the equality predicate to ones without it in an extended language. His method involves replacing a formula \u03c6 containing some instances of equality with the formula\n formula_97 formula_98\n formula_99\n formula_100\n formula_101\n formula_102\n formula_99\n formula_104\nHere formula_105 denote the predicates appearing in \u03c6 (with formula_106 their respective arities), and \u03c6' is the formula \u03c6 with all occurrences of equality replaced with the new predicate \"Eq\". If this new formula is refutable, the original \u03c6 was as well; the same is true of satisfiability, since we may take a quotient of satisfying model of the new formula by the equivalence relation representing \"Eq\". This quotient is well-defined with respect to the other predicates, and therefore will satisfy the original formula \u03c6.\nExtension to countable sets of formulas.\nG\u00f6del also considered the case where there are a countably infinite collection of formulas. Using the same reductions as above, he was able to consider only those cases where each formula is of degree 1 and contains no uses of equality. For a countable collection of formulas formula_107 of degree 1, we may define formula_108 as above; then define formula_109 to be the closure of formula_110. The remainder of the proof then went through as before.\nExtension to arbitrary sets of formulas.\nWhen there is an uncountably infinite collection of formulas, the Axiom of Choice (or at least some weak form of it) is needed. Using the full AC, one can well-order the formulas, and prove the uncountable case with the same argument as the countable one, except with transfinite induction. Other approaches can be used to prove that the completeness theorem in this case is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weak form of AC."}

It is eaten primarily in the United States. Grits are cooked in warm salted water or milk. They are often served with flavorings as a breakfast dish, though it also served as a lunch or supper dish, particularly with meat. Grits can be savory or sweet, with savory seasonings being more common. Grits are similar to other thick maize-based porridges from around the world, such as polenta, , and m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103. The dish originated in the Southern United States but is now available nationwide. Grits are part of the dinner entr\u00e9e shrimp and grits, served primarily in the Southern United States.\nThe word \"grits\" is derived from the Old English word , meaning \"coarse meal\". In the Charleston, South Carolina area, cooked hominy grits were primarily referred to as \"hominy\" until the 1980s.\nOrigin.\nThe dish originated with the Native American Muscogee tribe using maize. American colonists learned to make the dish from the Native Americans, and it quickly became an American staple.\nAt that time, maize or hominy for grits was ground on a stone mill. The ground material was passed through screens, the finer sifted material used as grit meal, and the coarser as grits.\nThree-quarters of the grits sold in the U.S. are bought in the South, in an area stretching from Lower Texas to Washington, D.C., that is sometimes called the \"grits belt\". The state of Georgia declared grits to be its official prepared food in 2002. A similar bill was introduced in South Carolina to name it the official state food, but it did not advance. Nevertheless, South Carolina still has an entire chapter of legislation dealing exclusively with corn meal and grits. State law in South Carolina requires grits and rice meal to be enriched, similar to the requirement for flour.\nGrits may be either yellow or white, depending on the color of the maize used. The most common version in supermarkets is \"quick\" grits, which are made from non-hominy maize and have the germ and hull removed. Whole kernel grits are sometimes called \"speckled\".\nPreparation.\nGrits are prepared by mixing water or milk and the dry grits and stirring them over heat, if one uses cornmeal, the food is called mush. Whole-grain grits require much longer to become soft than \"quick grits\".\nDishes.\nGrits are eaten with a wide variety of foods, such as eggs and bacon, fried catfish, shrimp, salmon croquettes, or country ham.\nShrimp and grits is a traditional dish in the coastal communities in the South Carolina Lowcountry and Georgia's Lower Coastal Plain.\nGrits and grunts is a breakfast dish considered to be a staple of Floridian cuisine. The dish is prepared by serving small fried fish fillets, typically white grunts, over cooked grits. It was invented during the colonial period and became popular in Key West during the early 20th century. Barry Popik stated that this popularization occurred around 1900. Stetson Kennedy's book \"Grits and Grunts: Folkloric Key West\" was named after the dish. \nSolidified cooked grits can be sliced and fried in vegetable oil, butter, or bacon grease to make fried grits, or they can first be breaded in beaten egg and bread crumbs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2020, GE ranked among the \"Fortune\" 500 as the 33rd largest firm in the United States by gross revenue. In 2023, the company was ranked 64th in the \"Forbes\" Global 2000. In 2011, GE ranked among the Fortune 20 as the 14th most profitable company, but later very severely underperformed the market (by about 75%) as its profitability collapsed. Two employees of GE\u2014Irving Langmuir (1932) and Ivar Giaever (1973)\u2014have been awarded the Nobel Prize. From 1986 until 2013, GE was the owner of the NBC television network through its purchase of its former subsidiary RCA before its acquisition of NBC's parent company NBCUniversal by Comcast in 2011.\nFollowing the Great Recession of the late 2000s, General Electric began selling off various divisions and assets, including its appliances and financial capital divisions, under Jeff Immelt's leadership as CEO. John Flannery, Immelt's replacement in 2017, further divested General Electric's assets in locomotives and lighting in order to focus the company more on aviation. Restrictions on air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic caused General Electric's revenue to fall significantly in 2020. Ultimately, GE's final CEO Larry Culp announced in November 2021 that General Electric was to be broken up into three separate, public companies by 2024. GE Aerospace, the aerospace company, is GE's legal successor. GE HealthCare, the health technology company, was spun off from GE in 2023. GE Vernova, the energy company, was founded when GE finalized the split. Following these transactions, GE Aerospace took the General Electric name and ticker symbols, while the old General Electric ceased to exist as a conglomerate. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFormation.\nDuring 1889, Thomas Edison (1847\u20131931) had business interests in many electricity-related companies, including Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; Edison Machine Works, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; Bergmann &amp; Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and Edison Electric Light Company, the patent-holding company and financial arm for Edison's lighting experiments, backed by J. P. Morgan (1837\u20131913) and the Vanderbilt family.\nHenry Villard, a long-time Edison supporter and investor, proposed to consolidate all of these business interests. The proposal was supported by Samuel Insull - who served as his secretary and, later, financier - as well other investors. In 1889, Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.\u2014a company founded by J. P. Morgan and Anthony J. Drexel\u2014financed Edison's research and helped merge several of Edison's separate companies under one corporation, forming Edison General Electric Company, which was incorporated in New York on April 24, 1889. The new company acquired Sprague Electric Railway &amp; Motor Company in the same year. The consolidation did not involve all of the companies established by Edison; notably, the Edison Illuminating Company, which would later become Consolidated Edison, was not part of the merger.\nIn 1880, Gerald Waldo Hart formed the American Electric Company of New Britain, Connecticut, which merged a few years later with Thomson-Houston Electric Company, led by Charles Coffin. In 1887, Hart left to become superintendent of the Edison Electric Company. General Electric was formed through the 1892 merger of Edison General Electric Company and Thomson-Houston Electric Company with the support of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. The original plants of both companies continue to operate under the GE banner to this day.\nThe General Electric business was incorporated in New York, with the Schenectady plant used as headquarters for many years thereafter. Around the same time, General Electric's Canadian counterpart, Canadian General Electric, was formed.\nIn 1893, General Electric brought Charles Steinmetz on board through the acquisition of smaller New York company. A genius in both mathematics and electronics, he earned over 200 patents and proved a major force in advancing GE, recognized today in Steinmetz's equation, Steinmetz solids, Steinmetz curves, the Steinmetz equivalent circuit, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers prestigious IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award.\nPublic company.\nIn 1896, General Electric was one of the original 12 companies listed on the newly formed Dow Jones Industrial Average, where it remained a part of the index for 122 years, though not continuously.\nIn 1911, General Electric absorbed the National Electric Lamp Association (NELA) into its lighting business. GE established its lighting division headquarters at Nela Park in East Cleveland, Ohio. The lighting division has since remained in the same location.\nRCA and NBC.\nOwen D. Young, who was then GE's general counsel and vice president, through GE, founded the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919. This came after Young, while working with senior naval officers, purchased the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, which was a subsidiary of the British company Marconi Wireless and Signal Company. He aimed to expand international radio communications. GE used RCA as its retail arm for radio sales. In 1926, RCA co-founded the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), which built two radio broadcasting networks. In 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations and was ordered to divest itself of RCA.\nTelevision.\nIn 1927, Ernst Alexanderson of GE made the first demonstration of television broadcast reception at his General Electric Realty Plot home at 1132 Adams Road in Schenectady, New York. On January 13, 1928, he made what was said to be the first broadcast to the public in the United States on GE's W2XAD: the pictures were picked up on 1.5 square inches (9.7 square centimeters) screens in the homes of four GE executives. The sound was broadcast on GE's WGY (AM).\nExperimental television station W2XAD evolved into the station WRGB, which, along with WGY and WGFM (now WRVE), was owned and operated by General Electric until 1983. In 1965, the company expanded into cable with the launch of a franchise, which was awarded to a non-exclusive franchise in Schenectady through subsidiary General Electric Cablevision Corporation. On February 15, 1965, General Electric expanded its holdings in order to acquire more television stations to meet the maximum limit of the FCC, and more cable holdings through subsidiaries General Electric Broadcasting Company and General Electric Cablevision Corporation.\nThe company also owned television stations such as KOA-TV (now KCNC-TV) in Denver and WSIX-TV (later WNGE-TV, now WKRN) in Nashville, but like WRGB, General Electric sold off most of its broadcasting holdings, but held on to the Denver television station until in 1986, when General Electric bought out RCA and made it into an owned-and-operated station by NBC. It even stayed on until 1995 when it was transferred to a joint venture between CBS and Group W in a swap deal, alongside KUTV in Salt Lake City for longtime CBS O&amp;O in Philadelphia, WCAU-TV.\nFormer General Electric-owned stations.\nStations are arranged in alphabetical order by state and city of license.\nPower generation.\nLed by Sanford Alexander Moss, GE moved into the new field of aircraft turbosuperchargers. This technology also led to the development of industrial gas turbine engines used for power production. GE introduced the first set of superchargers during World War I and continued to develop them during the interwar period. Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately before World War II. GE supplied 300,000 turbosuperchargers for use in fighter and bomber engines. This work led the U.S. Army Air Corps to select GE to develop the nation's first jet engine during the war. This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the Whittle W.1 jet engine that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941. GE was ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. However, their early work with Whittle's designs was later handed to Allison Engine Company. GE Aviation then emerged as one of the world's largest engine manufacturers, bypassing the British company Rolls-Royce plc.\nSome consumers boycotted GE light bulbs, refrigerators, and other products during the 1980s and 1990s. The purpose of the boycott was to protest against GE's role in nuclear weapons production.\nIn 2002, GE acquired the wind power assets of Enron during its bankruptcy proceedings. Enron Wind was the only surviving U.S. manufacturer of large wind turbines at the time, and GE increased engineering and supplies for the Wind Division and doubled the annual sales to $1.2\u00a0billion in 2003. It acquired ScanWind in 2009.\nIn 2018, GE Power garnered press attention when a model 7HA gas turbine in Texas was shut down for two months due to the break of a turbine blade. This model uses similar blade technology to GE's newest and most efficient model, the 9HA. After the break, GE developed new protective coatings and heat treatment methods. Gas turbines represent a significant portion of GE Power's revenue, and also represent a significant portion of the power generation fleet of several utility companies in the United States. Chubu Electric of Japan and \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France also had units that were impacted. Initially, GE did not realize the turbine blade issue of the 9FB unit would impact the new HA units.\nComputing.\nGE was one of the eight major computer companies of the 1960s along with IBM, Burroughs, NCR, Control Data Corporation, Honeywell, RCA, and UNIVAC. GE had a line of general purpose and special purpose computers, including the GE 200, GE 400, and GE 600 series general-purpose computers, the GE/PAC 4000 series real-time process control computers, and the DATANET-30 and Datanet 355 message switching computers (DATANET-30 and 355 were also used as front end processors for GE mainframe computers). A Datanet 500 computer was designed but never sold.\nIn 1956 Homer Oldfield was promoted to General Manager of GE's Computer Department. He facilitated the invention and construction of the Bank of America ERMA system, the first computerized system designed to read magnetized numbers on checks. But he was fired from GE in 1958 by Ralph J. Cordiner for overstepping his bounds and successfully gaining the ERMA contract. Cordiner was strongly against GE entering the computer business because he did not see the potential in it.\nIn 1962, GE started developing its GECOS (later renamed GCOS) operating system, originally for batch processing, but later extended to time-sharing and transaction processing. Versions of GCOS are still in use today. From 1964 to 1969, GE and Bell Laboratories (which soon dropped out) joined with MIT to develop the Multics operating system on the GE 645 mainframe computer. The project took longer than expected and was not a major commercial success, but it demonstrated concepts such as single-level storage, dynamic linking, hierarchical file system, and ring-oriented security. Active development of Multics continued until 1985.\nGE got into computer manufacturing because, in the 1950s, they were the largest user of computers outside the United States federal government, aside from being the first business in the world to own a computer. Its major appliance manufacturing plant \"Appliance Park\" was the first non-governmental site to host one. However, in 1970, GE sold its computer division to Honeywell, exiting the computer manufacturing industry, though it retained its timesharing operations for some years afterward. GE was a big provider of computer time-sharing services through General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS), offering online computing services that included GEnie.\nIn 2000, when United Technologies Corp. planned to buy Honeywell, GE made a counter-offer that was approved by Honeywell. On July 3, 2001, the European Union issued a statement that \"prohibit the proposed acquisition by General Electric Co. of Honeywell Inc.\". The reasons given were it \"would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell\".\nOn June 27, 2014, GE partnered with collaborative design company Quirky to announce its connected LED bulb called Link. The Link bulb is designed to communicate with smartphones and tablets using a mobile app called Wink.\nAcquisitions and divestments.\nIn December 1985, GE reacquired the RCA Corporation, primarily to gain ownership of the NBC television network for $6.28\u00a0billion; this merger surpassed the Capital Cities/ABC merger from earlier that year as the largest non-oil company merger in world business history. The remainder of RCA's divisions and assets were sold to various companies, including Bertelsmann Music Group which acquired RCA Records. Thomson SA, which licensed the manufacture of RCA and GE branded electronics, traced its roots to Thomson-Houston, one of the original components of GE. Also in 1986, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a U.S.-based securities firm, was sold to GE and following heavy losses was sold to PaineWebber in 1994.\nIn 1993, GE sold its Aerospace business to Martin Marietta.\nIn 1997, Genpact was founded as a unit of General Electric in Gurgaon. The company was founded as GE Capital International Services (GECIS).\u00a0In the beginning, GECIS created processes for outsourcing back-office activities for GE Capital such as processing car loans and credit card transactions. It was an experimental concept at the time and the beginning of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. GE sold 60% stake in Genpact to General Atlantic and Oak Hill Capital Partners in 2005 and hived off Genpact into an independent business. GE is still a major client to Genpact today for services in customer service, finance, information technology, and analytics.\nIn 2001, GE acquired Spanish-language broadcaster Telemundo and incorporated it into its National Broadcasting Company, Inc. subsidiary.\nIn 2002, Francisco Partners and Norwest Venture Partners acquired a division of GE called GE Information Systems (GEIS). The new company, named GXS, is based in Gaithersburg, Maryland. GXS is a provider of business-to-business e-commerce solutions. GE maintains a minority stake in GXS. Also in 2002, GE Wind Energy was formed when GE bought the wind turbine manufacturing assets of Enron Wind after the Enron scandals.\nIn 2004, GE bought 80% of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the parent of Universal Pictures from Vivendi. Vivendi Universal was merged with NBC to form NBCUniversal. GE then owned 80% of NBCUniversal and Vivendi owned 20%. In 2004, GE completed the spin-off of most of its mortgage and life insurance assets into an independent company, Genworth Financial, based in Richmond, Virginia.\nIn May 2007, GE acquired Smiths Aerospace for $4.8\u00a0billion. Also in 2007, GE Oil &amp; Gas acquired Vetco Gray for $1.9\u00a0billion, followed by the acquisition of Hydril Pressure &amp; Control in 2008 for $1.1\u00a0billion.\nGE Plastics was sold in 2008 to SABIC (Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation).

The transaction would create a publicly traded entity controlled by GE. It was announced that GE Oil &amp; Gas would sell off its water treatment business, GE Water &amp; Process Technologies, as part of its divestment agreement with Baker Hughes. The deal was cleared by the EU in May 2017, and by the United States Department of Justice in June 2017. The merger agreement was approved by shareholders at the end of June 2017. On July 3, 2017, the transaction was completed, and Baker Hughes became a GE company and was renamed Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE).

GE denied wrongdoing.\nOn October 6, 2020, General Electric reported it received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission stating the SEC may take civil action for possible violations of securities laws.\nInsufficient reserves for long-term care policies.\nIt is alleged that GE is \"hiding\" (i.e., under-reserved) $29\u00a0billion in losses related to its long-term care business.\nAccording to an August 2019 Fitch Ratings report, there are concerns that GE has not set aside enough money to cover its long-term care liabilities.\nIn 2018, a lawsuit (the Bezio case) was filed in New York state court on behalf of participants in GE's 401(k) plan and shareowners alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 based on alleged misstatements and omissions related to insurance reserves and performance of GE's business segments.\nThe Kansas Insurance Department (KID) is requiring General Electric to make $14.5\u00a0billion of capital contributions for its insurance contracts during the 7-year period ending in 2024.\nGE reported the total liability related to its insurance contracts increased significantly from 2016 to 2019:\nDecember 31, 2016 $26.1\u00a0billion\nDecember 31, 2017 $38.6\u00a0billion\nDecember 31, 2018 $35.6\u00a0billion \nDecember 31, 2019 $39.6\u00a0billion\nIn 2018, GE announced that the issuance of the new standard by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regarding Financial Services \u2013 Insurance (Topic 944) would materially affect its financial statements. Mr. Markopolos estimated there would be a $US 10.5\u00a0billion charge when the new accounting standard is adopted in the first quarter of 2021.\nAnticipated $8 billion loss upon disposition of Baker Hughes.\nIn 2017, GE acquired a 62.5% interest in Baker Hughes (BHGE) when it combined its oil &amp; gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated.\nIn 2018, GE reduced its interest to 50.4%, resulting in the realization of a $2.1\u00a0billion loss. GE is planning to divest its remaining interest and has warned that the divestment will result in an additional loss of $8.4\u00a0billion (assuming a BHGE share price of $23.57 per share). In response to the fraud allegations, GE noted the amount of the loss would be $7.4\u00a0billion if the divestment occurred on July 26, 2019. Mr. Markopolos noted that BHGE is an asset available for sale and therefore mark-to-market accounting is required.\nMarkopolos noted GE's current ratio was only 0.67. He expressed concerns that GE may file for bankruptcy if there is a recession.\nFinal years and three-way split (2018\u20132024).\nIn 2018, the GE Pension Plan reported losses of US$3.3\u00a0billion on plan assets.\nIn 2018, General Electric changed the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial liabilities of its pension plans. The rate was increased from 3.64% to 4.34%. Consequently, the reported liability for the underfunded pension plans decreased by $7\u00a0billion year-over-year, from $34.2\u00a0billion in 2017 to $27.2\u00a0billion in 2018.\nIn October 2018, General Electric announced it would \"freeze pensions\" for about 20,000 salaried U.S. employees.

Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.\nIn November 2020, General Electric warned it would be cutting jobs waiting for a recovery due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn November 9, 2021, the company announced it would divide itself into three public companies. On July 18, 2022, GE unveiled the brand names of the companies it had devised through its planned separation: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare, and GE Vernova. The new companies are respectively focused on aerospace, healthcare, and energy (renewable energy, power, and digital). The first spin-off of GE HealthCare was finalized on January 4, 2023; GE continues to hold 10.24% of shares and intends to sell the remaining over time. This was followed by the spin-off of GE's portfolio of energy businesses, which became GE Vernova on April 2, 2024. Following these transactions, GE became an aviation-focused company; GE Aerospace is the legal successor of the original GE. The company's legal name is still General Electric Company.\nFinancial performance.\nDividends.\nGeneral Electric was a longtime \"dividend aristocrat\" (a company with a long history of maintaining dividend payments to shareholders). Until 2017, the company had never cut dividends for 119 years before a 50% dividend reduction from 24 cents per share to 12 cents per share. In 2018, GE further reduced its quarterly dividend from 12 cents to 1 cent per share.\nStock.\nAs a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, GE stock was one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1907 to 2018, the longest continuous presence of any company on the index, and during this time the only company that was part of the original Dow Jones Industrial Index created in 1896. In August 2000, the company had a market capitalization of $601\u00a0billion, and was the most valuable company in the world. On June 26, 2018, the stock was removed from the index and replaced with Walgreens Boots Alliance. In the years leading to its removal, GE was the worst performing stock in the Dow, falling more than 55 percent year on year and more than 25 percent year to date. The company continued to lose value after being removed from the index.\nGeneral Electric Co. announced on July 30, 2021 (the completion of) a reverse stock split of GE common stock at a ratio of 1-for-8 and trading on a split-adjusted basis with a new ISIN number (US3696043013) starting on August 2, 2021.\nCorporate affairs.\nIn 1959, General Electric was accused of promoting the largest illegal cartel in the United States since the adoption of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 in order to maintain artificially high prices. In total, 29 companies and 45 executives would be convicted. Subsequent Congressional inquiries revealed that \"white-collar crime\" was by far the most costly form of crime for the United States' finances.\nGE was a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. However its main offices were located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza at Rockefeller Center in New York City, known now as the Comcast Building. It was formerly known as the GE Building for the prominent GE logo on the roof; NBC's headquarters and main studios are also located in the building. Through its RCA subsidiary, it has been associated with the center since its construction in the 1930s. GE moved its corporate headquarters from the GE Building on Lexington Avenue to Fairfield, Connecticut in 1974. In 2016, GE announced a move to the South Boston Waterfront neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, partly as a result of an incentive package provide by state and city governments. The first group of workers arrived in the summer of 2016, and the full move will be completed by 2018. Due to poor financial performance and corporate downsizing, GE sold the land it planned to build its new headquarters building on, instead choosing to occupy neighboring leased buildings.\nGE's tax return is the largest return filed in the United States; the 2005 return was approximately 24,000 pages when printed out, and 237 megabytes when submitted electronically. As of 2011, the company spent more on U.S. lobbying than any other company.\nIn 2005, GE launched its \"Ecomagination\" initiative in an attempt to position itself as a \"green\" company.\nGE is one of the biggest players in the wind power industry and is developing environment-friendly products such as hybrid locomotives, desalination and water reuse solutions, and photovoltaic cells. The company \"plans to build the largest solar-panel-making factory in the U.S.\" and has set goals for its subsidiaries to lower their greenhouse gas emissions.\nOn May 21, 2007, GE announced it would sell its GE Plastics division to petrochemicals manufacturer SABIC for net proceeds of $11.6\u00a0billion.

Other rankings for 2011\u20132012 include the following:\nIn 2012, GE's brand was valued at $28.8\u00a0billion. CEO Jeff Immelt had a set of changes in the presentation of the brand commissioned in 2004, after he took the reins as chairman, to unify the diversified businesses of GE. The changes included a new corporate color palette, small modifications to the GE logo, a new customized font (GE Inspira) and a new slogan, \"Imagination at work\", composed by David Lucas, to replace the slogan \"We Bring Good Things to Life\" used since 1979. The standard requires many headlines to be lowercased and adds visual \"white space\" to documents and advertising. The changes were designed by Wolff Olins and are used on GE's marketing, literature, and website. In 2014, a second typeface family was introduced: GE Sans and Serif by Bold Monday, created under art direction by Wolff Olins.\nAs of 2016[ [update]], GE had appeared on the Fortune 500 list for 22 years and held the 11th rank. GE was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average on June 28, 2018, after the value had dropped below 1% of the index's weight.\nBusinesses.\nGE's primary business divisions were:\nThrough these businesses, GE participated in markets that included the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity (e.g. nuclear, gas and solar), industrial automation, medical imaging equipment, motors, aircraft jet engines, and aviation services. Through GE Commercial Finance, GE Consumer Finance, GE Equipment Services, and GE Insurance, it offered a range of financial services. In addition, General Imaging manufactured GE digital cameras. It had a presence in over 100 countries.\nEven though the first wave of conglomerates (such as ITT Corporation, Ling-Temco-Vought, Tenneco, etc.) fell by the wayside by the mid-1980s, in the late 1990s, another wave (consisting of Westinghouse, Tyco, and others) tried and failed to emulate GE's success.\nAs of August 2015[ [update]] GE was planning to set up a silicon carbide chip packaging R&amp;D center in coalition with SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica, New York. The project was projected to create 470 jobs with the potential to grow to 820 jobs within 10 years.\nOn September 14, 2015, GE announced the creation of a new unit: GE Digital, which would bring together its software and IT capabilities. The new business unit was headed by Bill Ruh, who joined GE in 2011 from Cisco Systems and had since worked on GE's software efforts.\nMorgan Stanley sold a stake in GE HealthCare Technologies for $1.1 billion as part of a deal to swap General Electric Co. debt for GE HealthCare stock.\nFormer divisions.\nGE Industrial was a division providing appliances, lighting, and industrial products; factory automation systems; plastics, silicones, and quartz products; security and sensors technology; and equipment financing, management, and operating services. As of 2007, it had 70,000 employees, generating $17.7\u00a0billion in revenue. After some major realignments in late 2007, GE Industrial was organized into two main sub-businesses:\nThe former GE Plastics division was sold in August 2007 and is now SABIC Innovative Plastics.\nOn May 4, 2008, it was announced that GE would auction off its appliances business for an expected sale of $5\u20138\u00a0billion. However, this plan fell through as a result of the recession.\nThe former GE Appliances and Lighting segment was dissolved in 2014 when GE's appliance division attempted to be sold to Electrolux for $5.4\u00a0billion, but eventually sold it to Haier in June 2016 due to an antitrust filing against Electrolux. GE Lighting (consumer lighting) and the newly created Current, powered by GE, which deals in commercial LED, solar, EV, and energy storage, became stand-alone businesses within the company, until the sale of the latter to American Industrial Partners in April 2019.\nThe former GE Transportation division merged with Wabtec on February 25, 2019, leaving GE with a 24.9% holding in Wabtec.\nOn July 1, 2020, GE Lighting was acquired by Savant Systems and remains headquartered at Nela Park in East Cleveland, Ohio.\nEnvironmental record.\nPollution.\nSome of GE's activities have given rise to large-scale air and water pollution. Based on data from 2000, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute listed the corporation as the fourth-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States (behind only E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., United States Steel Corp., and ConocoPhillips), with more than 4.4\u00a0million pounds per year (2,000 tons) of toxic chemicals released into the air. GE has also been implicated in the creation of toxic waste. According to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents, only the United States Government, Honeywell, and Chevron Corporation are responsible for producing more Superfund toxic waste sites.\nIn 1983, New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to compel GE to pay for the clean-up of what was claimed to be more than 100,000 tons of chemicals dumped from their plant in Waterford, New York, which polluted nearby groundwater and the Hudson River. In 1999, the company agreed to pay a $250\u00a0million settlement in connection with claims it polluted the Housatonic River (at Pittsfield, Massachusetts) and other sites with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous substances.\nIn 2003, acting on concerns that the plan proposed by GE did not \"provide for adequate protection of public health and the environment,\" EPA issued an administrative order for the company to \"address cleanup at the GE site\" in Rome, Georgia, also contaminated with PCBs.\nThe nuclear reactors involved in the 2011 crisis at Fukushima I in Japan were GE designs, and the architectural designs were done by Ebasco, formerly owned by GE. Concerns over the design and safety of these reactors were raised as early as 1972, but tsunami danger was not discussed at that time. As of 2014[ [update]], the same model nuclear reactors designed by GE are operating in the US; however, as of May 31, 2019, the controversial Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, has been shut down and is in the process of decommission.\nPollution of the Hudson River.\nGE heavily contaminated the Hudson River with PCBs between 1947 and 1977. This pollution caused a range of harmful effects to wildlife and people who eat fish from the river. In 1983 EPA declared a 200-mile (320\u00a0km) stretch of the river, from Hudson Falls to New York City, to be a Superfund site requiring cleanup. This Superfund site is considered to be one of the largest in the nation. In addition to receiving extensive fines, GE is continuing its sediment removal operations, pursuant to the Superfund orders, in the 21st century.\nPollution of the Housatonic River.\nFrom c.\u20091932 until 1977, GE polluted the Housatonic River with PCB discharges from its plant at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. EPA designated the Pittsfield plant and several miles of the Housatonic to be a Superfund site in 1997, and ordered GE to remediate the site. Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260, products manufactured by Monsanto, were the principal contaminants that were discharged into the river. The highest concentrations of PCBs in the Housatonic River are found in Woods Pond in Lenox, Massachusetts, just south of Pittsfield, where they have been measured up to 110\u00a0mg/kg in the sediment. About 50% of all the PCBs currently in the river are estimated to be retained in the sediment behind Woods Pond dam. This is estimated to be about of PCBs. Formerly filled oxbows are also polluted. Waterfowl and fish who live in and around the river contain significant levels of PCBs and can present health risks if consumed. In 2020 GE completed remediation and restoration of its 10 manufacturing plant areas within the city of Pittsfield. As of 2023[ [update]] plans for cleanup of the river south of the city are not finalized.\nSocial responsibility.\nEnvironmental initiatives.\nThe environmental work and research of GE can be seen as early as 1968 with the experimental Delta electric car built by the GE Research and Development Center led by Bruce Laumeister. The electric car led to the production shortly after of the cutting-edge technology of the first commercially produced all-electric Elec-Trak garden tractor, which was manufactured from around 1969 until 1975.\nDespite these initiatives, GE has been recognized as a source of PCB pollution in the case of GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY v. LOWE'S HOME CENTERS, INC.\nOn June 6, 2011, GE announced that it had licensed solar thermal technology from California-based eSolar for use in power plants that use both solar and natural gas.\nOn May 26, 2011, GE unveiled its EV Solar Carport, a carport that incorporates solar panels on its roof, with electric vehicle charging stations under its cover.\nIn May 2005, GE announced the launch of a program called \"Ecomagination\", intended, in the words of CEO Jeff Immelt, \"to develop tomorrow's solutions such as solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells, lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger durable materials, efficient lighting, and water purification technology\". The announcement prompted an op-ed piece in \"The New York Times\" to observe that, \"while General Electric's increased emphasis on clean technology will probably result in improved products and benefit its bottom line, Mr. Immelt's credibility as a spokesman on national environmental policy is fatally flawed because of his company's intransigence in cleaning up its own toxic legacy.\"\nGE has said that it will invest $1.4\u00a0billion in clean technology research and development in 2008 as part of its Ecomagination initiative. As of October 2008, the scheme had resulted in 70 green products being brought to market, ranging from halogen lamps to biogas engines. In 2007, GE raised the annual revenue target for its Ecomagination initiative from $20\u00a0billion in 2010 to $25\u00a0billion following positive market response to its new product lines. In 2010, GE continued to raise its investment by adding $10\u00a0billion into Ecomagination over the next five years.\nGE Energy's renewable energy business has expanded greatly to keep up with growing U.S. and global demand for clean energy. Since entering the renewable energy industry in 2002, GE has invested more than $850\u00a0million in renewable energy commercialization. In August 2008, it acquired Kelman Ltd, a Northern Ireland-based company specializing in advanced monitoring and diagnostics technologies for transformers used in renewable energy generation and announced an expansion of its business in Northern Ireland in May 2010. In 2009, GE's renewable energy initiatives, which include solar power, wind power and GE Jenbacher gas engines using renewable and non-renewable methane-based gases, employ more than 4,900 people globally and have created more than 10,000 supporting jobs.\nGE Energy and Orion New Zealand (Orion) have announced the implementation of the first phase of a GE network management system to help improve power reliability for customers. GE's ENMAC Distribution Management System is the foundation of Orion's initiative. The system of smart grid technologies will significantly improve the network company's ability to manage big network emergencies and help it restore power faster when outages occur.\nIn June 2018, GE Volunteers, an internal group of GE employees, along with the Malaysian Nature Society, transplanted more than 270 plants from the Taman Tugu forest reserve so that they may be replanted in a forest trail that is under construction.\nEducational initiatives.\nGE Healthcare is collaborating with the Wayne State University School of Medicine and the Medical University of South Carolina to offer an integrated radiology curriculum during their respective MD Programs led by investigators of the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study. GE has donated over one million dollars of Logiq E Ultrasound equipment to these two institutions.\nMarketing initiatives.\nBetween September 2011 and April 2013, GE ran a content marketing campaign dedicated to telling the stories of \"innovators\u2014people who are reshaping the world through act or invention.\" The initiative included 30 3-minute films from leading documentary film directors (Albert Maysles, Jessica Yu, Leslie Iwerks, Steve James, Alex Gibney, Lixin Fan, Gary Hustwit and others), and a user-generated competition that received over 600 submissions, out of which 20 finalists were chosen.\n\"Short Films, Big Ideas\" was launched at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival in partnership with cinelan. Stories included breakthroughs in Slingshot (water vapor distillation system), cancer research, energy production, pain management, and food access. Each of the 30 films received world premiere screenings at a major international film festival, including the Sundance Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival. The winning amateur director film, \"The Cyborg Foundation\", was awarded a US$ prize at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. According to GE, the campaign garnered more than 1.5\u00a0billion total media impressions, 14\u00a0million online views, and was seen in 156 countries.\nIn January 2017, GE signed an estimated $7\u00a0million deal with the Boston Celtics to have its corporate logo put on the NBA team's jersey.\nCharity.\nOn March 3, 2022, GE published an international memo pledging to donate $4.5 million to Ukraine amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to the memo, $4 million will be used for medical equipment, $400,000 for emergency cash for refugees, and $100,000 will go to Airlink, an NGO that helps communities in crisis.\nPolitical affiliation.\nGE has designed social programs, supported civil rights organizations, and funded minority education programs. In the 1950s, the company sponsored General Electric Theater, which solidified host Ronald Reagan's transition from movies to television, and launched him on the lecture circuit.\nNotable appearances in media.\nIn the early 1950s, Kurt Vonnegut was a writer for GE. A number of his novels and stories (notably \"Cat's Cradle\" and \"Player Piano\") refer to the fictional city of Ilium, which appears to be loosely based on Schenectady, New York. The Ilium Works is the setting for the short story \"Deer in the Works\".\nIn 1981, GE won a Clio award for its 30 Soft White Light Bulbs commercial, We Bring Good Things to Life. The slogan \"We Bring Good Things to Life\" was created by Phil Dusenberry at the ad agency BBDO.\nGE was the primary focus of a 1991 short subject Academy Award-winning documentary, \"Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons, and Our Environment\", that juxtaposed GE's \"We Bring Good Things To Life\" commercials with the true stories of workers and neighbors whose lives have been affected by the company's activities involving nuclear weapons.\nGE was frequently mentioned and parodied in the NBC comedy sitcom \"30 Rock\" from 2006 to 2013. Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch even cameoed as himself, appearing in the season four episode \"Future Husband\". The episode is a satirical reference to the real-world acquisition of NBC Universal from General Electric by Comcast in November 2009.\nIn 2013, GE received a National Jefferson Award for Outstanding Service by a Major Corporation.\nBranding.\nThe General Electric logo has a blue circle with a white outline.

Known as \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. \nAlthough most of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions, including \"Taxman\", \"Within You Without You\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\". Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; subsequent influences were Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as the sitar, which he had become acquainted with on the set of the film \"Help!.\" He played sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the band's embrace of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. Harrison's first marriage to model Pattie Boyd in 1966 ended in divorce in 1977. In the following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. \nAfter the Beatles disbanded, Harrison released the triple album \"All Things Must Pass\", a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974. He co-founded HandMade Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe's comedy film \"The Life of Brian\" (1979).\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood, and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 31 in their 2023 list of greatest guitarists of all time. He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004. A lifelong smoker, Harrison died of cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home.\nEarly years: 1943\u20131958.\nGeorge Harrison was born at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, on 25 February 1943. He was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison and Louise (n\u00e9e French). Harold was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the White Star Line, and Louise was a shop assistant of Irish Catholic descent. He had one sister, Louise, and two brothers, Harold and Peter.\nAccording to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: \"All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognised that nothing made George quite as happy as making music.\" Louise was an enthusiastic music fan, and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows. When Louise was pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast \"Radio India\". Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, \"Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb.\"\nHarrison lived at 12 Arnold Grove until 1 January 1950. A terraced house on a cul-de-sac, it had an outdoor toilet, and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In the autumn of 1949, the family was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke. In 1948, Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959. Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt that the school \"moulded [students] into being frightened\".\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael; by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences. In early 1956, he had an epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll. He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, \"I was totally into guitars.\" Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another early influence: \"The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in.\"\nWhen George Harrison was about 14, a friend of Harrison, Raymond Hughes, offered to sell a guitar. Harrison's mother then paid for the guitar, which cost \u00a33.10s.\u2013 (). One of his father's friends taught Harrison how to play \"Whispering\", \"Sweet Sue\" and \"Dinah\". Inspired by Donegan's music, Harrison formed a skiffle group, the Rebels, with his brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly. On the bus to school, Harrison met Paul McCartney, who also attended the Liverpool Institute, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.\nThe Beatles: 1958\u20131970.\nMcCartney and his friend John Lennon were in a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. In March 1958, at McCartney's urging, Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm's Morgue Skiffle Club, playing Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith's \"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\", but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band. McCartney arranged a second meeting, on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, during which Harrison impressed Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental \"Raunchy\". He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed, and then became accepted as a member. Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers, a local department store. During the group's first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym \"Carl Harrison\", in reference to Carl Perkins.\nIn 1960, promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the Indra and Kaiserkeller clubs in Hamburg, both owned by Bruno Koschmider. Their first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961, he polished up their image and later secured them a recording contract with EMI. The group's first single, \"Love Me Do\", peaked at number 17 on the \"Record Retailer\" chart, and by the time their debut album, \"Please Please Me\", was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived. Often serious and focused while on stage with the band, Harrison was known as \"the quiet Beatle\". That moniker arose when the Beatles arrived in the United States in early 1964, and Harrison was ill with a case of Strep throat and a fever and was medically advised to limit speaking as much as possible until he performed on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" as scheduled. As such, the press noticed Harrison's apparent laconic nature in public appearances on that tour and the subsequent nickname stuck, much to Harrison's amusement. He had two lead vocal credits on the LP, including the Lennon\u2013McCartney song \"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\", and three on their second album, \"With the Beatles\" (1963). The latter included \"Don't Bother Me\", Harrison's first solo writing credit.\nHarrison served as the Beatles' scout for new American releases, being especially knowledgeable about soul music. By 1965's \"Rubber Soul\", he had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". He later called \"Rubber Soul\" his \"favourite [Beatles] album\". \"Revolver\" (1966) included three of his compositions: \"Taxman\", selected as the album's opening track, \"Love You To\" and \"I Want to Tell You\". His drone-like tambura part on Lennon's \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments, while the sitar- and tabla-based \"Love You To\" represented the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music. According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck, the latter song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody. Author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1978 that following Harrison's increased association with the sitar after \"Norwegian Wood\", he became known as \"the maharaja of raga-rock\". Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\nBy late 1966, Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles. This was reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" in 1967. His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired \"Within You Without You\", to which no other Beatle contributed. He played sitar and tambura on the track, backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba, swarmandal and tabla. He later commented on the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album: \"It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry\u00a0... There's about half the songs I like and the other half I can't stand.\"\nIn January 1968, he recorded the basic track for his song \"The Inner Light\" at EMI's studio in Bombay, using a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments. Released as the B-side to McCartney's \"Lady Madonna\", it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single. Derived from a quotation from the \"Tao Te Ching\", the song's lyric reflected Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation. During the recording of \"The Beatles\" that same year, tensions within the group ran high, and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly. Harrison's four songwriting contributions to the double album included \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar, and the horn-driven \"Savoy Truffle\".\nDylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles. While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles. Tensions among the group surfaced again in January 1969, at Twickenham Studios, during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary \"Let It Be\". Frustrated by the cold and sterile film studio, by Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles, and by what he perceived as a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January. He returned 12 days later, after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to their own Apple Studio and to abandon McCartney's plan for making a return to public performance.\nRelations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, when the band recorded their 1969 album \"Abbey Road\". The LP included what Lavezzoli describes as \"two classic contributions\" from Harrison \u2013 \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\" \u2013 that saw him \"finally achieve equal songwriting status\" with Lennon and McCartney. During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, rejecting suggestions for changes to his music, particularly from McCartney. \"Something\" became his first A-side when issued on a double A-side single with \"Come Together\"; the song was number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany, and the combined sides topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in the United States. In the 1970s Frank Sinatra recorded \"Something\" twice (1970 and 1979) and later dubbed it \"the greatest love song of the past fifty years\". Lennon considered it the best song on \"Abbey Road\", and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after \"Yesterday\".\nIn May 1970, Harrison's song \"For You Blue\" was coupled on a US single with McCartney's \"The Long and Winding Road\" and became Harrison's second chart-topper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Hot 100. His increased productivity meant that by the time of their break-up he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions. While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's break-up. Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded overdubs to the song \"Let It Be\" for the soundtrack album of the same name.\nSolo career: 1968\u20131987.\nEarly solo work: 1968\u20131969.\nBefore the Beatles' break-up, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: \"Wonderwall Music\" and \"Electronic Sound\", both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions. \"Wonderwall Music\", a soundtrack to the 1968 film \"Wonderwall\", blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while \"Electronic Sound\" is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer. Released in November 1968, \"Wonderwall Music\" was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records. Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage \"Dream Scene\", recorded several months before Lennon's \"Revolution 9\".\nIn December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends. During the tour, which included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Harrison began to play slide guitar, and also began to write \"My Sweet Lord\", which became his first single as a solo artist.\n\"All Things Must Pass\": 1970.\nFor many years, Harrison was restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles' albums, but he released \"All Things Must Pass\", a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends. The album was regarded by many as his best work, and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. The number-one hit single \"My Sweet Lord\" and the top-ten single \"What Is Life\" were taken from the album, which was co-produced by Phil Spector using his \"Wall of Sound\" approach; the musicians included Starr, Clapton, Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie's Friends band, and the Apple group Badfinger. On its release, \"All Things Must Pass\" was received with critical acclaim; Ben Gerson of \"Rolling Stone\" described it as being \"of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of the album's title track \"a recognition of the impermanence of human existence\u00a0... a simple and poignant conclusion\" to Harrison's former band. In 1971, Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over \"My Sweet Lord\", owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit \"He's So Fine\". When the case was heard in the United States district court in 1976, he denied deliberately plagiarising the song, but lost the case, as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously.\nIn 2000, Apple Records released a thirtieth-anniversary edition of the album, and Harrison actively participated in its promotion. In an interview, he reflected on the work: \"It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion.\" He commented on the production: \"Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it ... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now.\"\nThe Concert for Bangladesh: 1971.\nHarrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. The event drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's Madison Square Garden. The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, Leon Russell, Badfinger, Preston and Starr.\nA triple album, \"The Concert for Bangladesh\", was released by Apple in December, followed by a concert film in 1972. Credited to \"George Harrison and Friends\", the album topped the UK chart and peaked at number 2 in the US, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: \"Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended.\"\n\"Living in the Material World\" to \"George Harrison\": 1973\u20131979.\nHarrison's 1973 album \"Living in the Material World\" held the number one spot on the \"Billboard\" albums chart for five weeks, and the album's single, \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\", also reached number one in the US. In the UK, the LP peaked at number two and the single reached number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs. In Greene's opinion it \"contained many of the strongest compositions of his career\". Stephen Holden, writing in \"Rolling Stone\", felt the album was \"vastly appealing\" and \"profoundly seductive\", and that it stood \"alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance\". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental.\nIn November 1974, Harrison became the first ex-Beatle to tour North America when he began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour. The shows included guest spots by his band members Billy Preston and Tom Scott, and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by \"Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends\". Despite numerous positive reviews, the consensus reaction to the tour was negative. Some fans found Shankar's significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's \"sermonizing\". Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and his laryngitis-affected vocals led to some critics calling the tour \"dark hoarse\". The author Robert Rodriguez commented: \"While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated.\" Simon Leng called the tour \"groundbreaking\" and \"revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music\".\nOn 16 November 1974, Harrison and several others involved in the tour visited the White House. They were invited by President Gerald Ford's son, Jack.\nIn December, Harrison released \"Dark Horse\", which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career. \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks\". The album reached number 4 on the \"Billboard\" chart and the single \"Dark Horse\" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK. The music critic Mikal Gilmore described \"Dark Horse\" as \"one of Harrison's most fascinating works \u2013 a record about change and loss\".\nHarrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the soul music-inspired \"Extra Texture (Read All About It)\" (1975), peaked at number 8 on the \"Billboard\" chart and number 16 in the UK. Harrison considered it the least satisfactory of the three albums he had recorded since \"All Things Must Pass\". Leng identified \"bitterness and dismay\" in many of the tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: \"He wasn't up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture\u00a0... I didn't like his frame of mind\". He released two singles from the LP: \"You\", which reached the \"Billboard\" top 20, and \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\", Apple's final original single release.\n\"Thirty Three &amp; 1/3\" (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles \"This Song\" and \"Crackerbox Palace\", both of which reached the top 25 in the US. The surreal humour of \"Crackerbox Palace\" reflected Harrison's association with Monty Python's Eric Idle, who directed a comical music video for the song. With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, \"Thirty Three &amp; 1/3\" earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since \"All Things Must Pass\". The album peaked just outside the top ten there, but outsold his previous two LPs. As part of his promotion for the release, Harrison performed on \"Saturday Night Live\" with Paul Simon.\nIn 1979, Harrison released \"George Harrison\", which followed his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani. Co-produced by Russ Titelman, the album and the single \"Blow Away\" both made the \"Billboard\" top 20. The album marked the beginning of Harrison's gradual retreat from the music business, with several of the songs having been written in the tranquil setting of Maui in the Hawaiian archipelago. Leng described \"George Harrison\" as \"melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss\".\n\"Somewhere in England\" to \"Cloud Nine\": 1980\u20131987.\nThe murder of John Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concern about stalkers. The tragedy was also a deep personal loss, although Harrison and Lennon had little contact in the years before Lennon was killed. Following the murder, Harrison commented: \"After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon. I am shocked and stunned.\" Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make the song a tribute to Lennon. \"All Those Years Ago\", which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney, as well as Starr's original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts. The single was included on the album \"Somewhere in England\" in 1981.\nHarrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982's \"Gone Troppo\" received little notice from critics or the public. During this period he made several guest appearances, including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled \"\". In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organised to raise money for the Birmingham Children's Hospital. The following year, he appeared at The Prince's Trust concert at London's Wembley Arena, performing \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\". \nPrior, in February 1987, he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: \"Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal\u00a0... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers \u2013 and had a few more\u00a0... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me.\"\nIn November 1987, Harrison released the platinum album \"Cloud Nine\". Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), the album included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's \"Got My Mind Set on You\", which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, \"When We Was Fab\", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner and Jim Horn. \"Cloud Nine\" reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock chart \u2013 \"Devil's Radio\", \"This Is Love\" and \"Cloud 9\".\nLater career: 1988\u20131996.\nThe Traveling Wilburys and return to touring: 1988\u20131992.\nIn 1988, Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. The band had gathered in Dylan's garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release. Harrison's record company decided the track, \"Handle with Care\", was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album. The LP, \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\", was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury Sr. It reached number 16 in the UK and number 3 in the US, where it was certified triple platinum. Harrison's pseudonym on the album was \"Nelson Wilbury\"; he used the name \"Spike Wilbury\" for their second album.\nIn 1989, Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Petty's song \"I Won't Back Down\". In October that year, Harrison assembled and released \"Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989\", a compilation of his later solo work. The album included three new songs, including \"Cheer Down\", which Harrison had recently contributed to the \"Lethal Weapon 2\" film soundtrack.\nFollowing Orbison's death in December 1988, the Wilburys recorded as a four-piece. Their second album, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3\". According to Lynne, \"That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'\" It peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US, where it was certified platinum. The Wilburys never performed live, and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.\nIn December 1991, Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan. It was Harrison's first since 1974 and no others followed. On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall, his first London performance since the Beatles' 1969 rooftop concert. In October 1992, he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City, playing alongside Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn, Petty and Neil Young.\n\"The Beatles Anthology\": 1994\u20131996.\nIn 1994, Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney, Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the \"Beatles Anthology\" project. This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, \"Free as a Bird\" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, \"Real Love\". They also attempted to finish a third single, \"Now and Then\", but did not finish it because the audio quality of the cassette was, according to Harrison, \"fucking rubbish\". The song was later finished by McCartney and Starr and released in 2023. He later commented on the project: \"I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when I'm dead, make them into hit songs.\"\nLater life and death: 1997\u20132001.\nAfter the \"Anthology\" project, Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latter's \"Chants of India\". Harrison's final television appearance was a VH-1 special to promote the album, taped in May 1997. Soon afterwards, Harrison was diagnosed with throat cancer; he was treated with radiotherapy, which was thought at the time to be successful. He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illness.\nIn January 1998, Harrison attended Carl Perkins' funeral in Jackson, Tennessee, where he performed a brief rendition of Perkins' song \"Your True Love\". In May, he represented the Beatles at London's High Court in their successful bid to gain control of unauthorised recordings made of a 1962 performance by the band at the Star-Club in Hamburg. The following year, he was the most active of the former Beatles in promoting the reissue of their 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\".\nAttack at Friar Park: 1999.\nOn 30 December 1999, Harrison and his wife Olivia were attacked at their home, Friar Park. The perpetrator was 34-year-old paranoid schizophrenic man Michael Abram, who broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before he was incapacitated by Harrison's wife, who struck him repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp. Harrison later commented, \"I felt exhausted and could feel the strength draining from me. I vividly remember a deliberate thrust to my chest. I could hear my lung exhaling and had blood in my mouth. I believed I had been fatally stabbed\". Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalised with more than 40 stab wounds, and part of his punctured lung was removed. He released a statement soon afterwards regarding his assailant: \"He wasn't a burglar, and he certainly wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys. Adi Shankara, an Indian historical, spiritual and groovy-type person, once said, 'Life is fragile like a raindrop on a lotus leaf.' And you'd better believe it.\" Upon being released from a psychiatric institution in 2002, Abram said: \"If I could turn back the clock, I would give anything not to have done what I did in attacking George Harrison, but looking back on it now, I have come to understand that I was at the time not in control of my actions. I can only hope the Harrison family might somehow find it in their hearts to accept my apologies.\"\nThe injuries inflicted on Harrison during the home invasion were downplayed by his family in their comments to the press. Having seen Harrison looking so healthy beforehand, those in his social circle believed that the attack brought about a change in him and was the cause for his cancer's return.\nDeath: 2001.\nIn May 2001, it was revealed that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July 2001, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut short his stay to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery. Harrison, who was very weak, quipped: \"Do you want me to come with you?\" In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City for non\u2013small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was made public, Harrison, who would die within the month, bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.\nOn 29 November 2001, Harrison died at a property belonging to McCartney, on Heather Road in Beverly Hills, California. He was 58 years old. He died in the company of Olivia, Dhani, Shankar, and the latter's wife Sukanya and daughter Anoushka, and Hare Krishna devotees Shyamasundar Das and Mukunda Goswami, who chanted verses from the \"Bhagavad Gita\". His final message to the world, as relayed in a statement by Olivia and Dhani, was: \"Everything else can wait, but the search for God cannot wait, and love one another.\" Eric Idle, who was very close to Harrison, was present at his deathbed and said that Harrison was not frightened of death, and thought he would escape rebirth.\nHarrison's body was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, and his funeral was held at the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, California. Eric Idle, considering that \"a lot of being funny is the lack of a censor mechanism\", said at Harrison's funeral: \"I'd like to thank Marlboro, without whom you wouldn't be here this morning\", to a huge laugh. Idle said \"it's really not the right thing to say, but also, let's name the names of people responsible\". Harrison's close family scattered his ashes according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Varanasi, India. He left almost \u00a3100\u00a0million in his will.\nFinal studio album and singles: 2002\u20132004.\nHarrison's final studio album, \"Brainwashed\" (2002), was released posthumously after it was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne. A quotation from the \"Bhagavad Gita\" is included in the album's liner notes: \"There never was a time when you or I did not exist. Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be.\" A media-only single, \"Stuck Inside a Cloud\", which Leng describes as \"a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality\", achieved number 27 on \"Billboard\"'s Adult Contemporary chart. The single \"Any Road\", released in May 2003, peaked at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. \"Marwa Blues\" went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, while \"Any Road\" was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\nMusicianship.\nGuitar work.\nHarrison's guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s. His rhythm guitar playing was innovative, for example when he used a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the \"Rubber Soul\" (1965) album and \"Here Comes the Sun\", to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was \"clearly an innovator\" as he was \"taking certain elements of R&amp;B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique\". \"Rolling Stone\" founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as \"a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song\". The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles' recordings. He identified Chuck Berry as another early influence.\nIn 1961, the Beatles recorded \"Cry for a Shadow\", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows. Harrison's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins. Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on \"I'll Be on My Way\".\nBy 1964, he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on \"A Hard Day's Night\". On this and other songs from the period, he used a Rickenbacker 360/12 \u2013 an electric guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart, with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. His use of the Rickenbacker on \"A Hard Day's Night\" helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that \"Melody Maker\" termed it the Beatles' \"secret weapon\". In 1965, Harrison used an expression pedal to control his guitar's volume on \"I Need You\", creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements. He used the same volume-swell technique on \"Yes It Is\", applying what Everett described as \"ghostly articulation\" to the song's natural harmonics.\nIn 1966, Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to \"Revolver\". He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and a guitar counter-melody on \"And Your Bird Can Sing\" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on \"I Want to Tell You\" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for \"Sgt Pepper\"'s \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.\nEverett described Harrison's guitar solo from \"Old Brown Shoe\" as \"stinging [and] highly Claptonesque\". He identified two of the composition's significant motifs: a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song \"a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo\". In Greene's opinion, Harrison's demo for \"Old Brown Shoe\" contains \"one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song\".\nHarrison's playing on \"Abbey Road\", and in particular on \"Something\", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas. According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: \"'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime\".\nAfter Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the dilruba. Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's \"How Do You Sleep?\" as a departure for \"the sweet soloist of 'Something'\", calling his playing \"rightly famed ... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements\". Lennon commented: \"That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life.\"\nA Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on \"Gone Troppo\" (1982) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard \"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\" on ukulele in 1992. Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Marwa Blues\" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena, calling it \"yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach\". Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of \"Free as a Bird\". He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society. Harrison played bass guitar on a few tracks, including the Beatles songs \"She Said She Said\", \"Golden Slumbers\", \"Birthday\" and \"Honey Pie\". He also played bass on several solo recordings, including \"Faster\", \"Wake Up My Love\" and \"Bye Bye Love\".\nSitar and Indian music.\nDuring the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Harrison described Shankar as \"the first person who ever impressed me in my life\u00a0... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me.\" Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music. According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles' song \"Norwegian Wood\" \"opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar called 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966\u201367\". Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as \"the man most responsible for this phenomenon\".\nIn June 1966, Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted. Before this meeting, Harrison had recorded his \"Revolver\" track \"Love You To\", contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an \"astonishing improvement\" over \"Norwegian Wood\" and \"the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician\". On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram &amp; Sons in New Delhi. In September, following the Beatles' final tour, he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar. He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in Kashmir. During this visit, he also received tutelage from Shambhu Das, Shankar's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nHarrison studied the instrument until 1968, when, following a discussion with Shankar about the need to find his \"roots\", an encounter with Clapton and Jimi Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented: \"I decided\u00a0... I'm not going to be a great sitar player\u00a0... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier.\" Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre. Lavezzoli groups him with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel as the three rock musicians who have given the most \"mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of 'world music'\".\nSongwriting.\nHarrison wrote his first song, \"Don't Bother Me\", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as \"an exercise to see if I \"could\" write a song\", as he remembered. His songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: \"Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours\". Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on \"Revolver\", \"the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter\", according to Inglis.\nHarrison wrote the chord progression of \"Don't Bother Me\" almost exclusively in the Dorian mode, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The latter proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to Mikal Gilmore of \"Rolling Stone\", \"Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on\u00a0... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music \u2013 and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Var\u00e8se and Igor Stravinsky\u00a0...\".\nOf the 1967 Harrison song \"Within You Without You\", author Gerry Farrell said that Harrison had created a \"new form\", calling the composition \"a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music\". Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: \"His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together.\" In his next fully Indian-styled song, \"The Inner Light\", Harrison embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music, rather than the Hindustani style he had used in \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\". Writing in 1997, Farrell commented: \"It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion \u2013 for example, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'The Inner Light'.\"\nBeatles biographer Bob Spitz described \"Something\" as a masterpiece, and \"an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced\". Inglis considered \"Abbey Road\" a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's two contributions to the LP, \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", as \"exquisite\", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.\nCollaborations.\nFrom 1968 onwards, Harrison collaborated with other musicians; he brought in Eric Clapton to play lead guitar on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" for the 1968 Beatles' White Album, and collaborated with John Barham on his 1968 debut solo album, \"Wonderwall Music\", which included contributions from Clapton again, as well as Peter Tork from the Monkees. He played on tracks by Dave Mason, Nicky Hopkins, Alvin Lee, Ronnie Wood, Billy Preston and Tom Scott. Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan, Clapton, Preston, Doris Troy, David Bromberg, Gary Wright, Wood, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, among others. Harrison's music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy, Jackie Lomax and Billy Preston.\nHarrison co-wrote the song \"Badge\" with Clapton, which was included on Cream's 1969 album, \"Goodbye\". Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track, using the pseudonym \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" for contractual reasons. In May 1970, he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylan's album \"New Morning\". Between 1971 and 1973, he co-wrote or produced three top ten hits for Starr: \"It Don't Come Easy\", \"Back Off Boogaloo\" and \"Photograph\". Aside from \"How Do You Sleep?\", his contributions to Lennon's 1971 album \"Imagine\" included a slide guitar solo on \"Gimme Some Truth\" and dobro on \"Crippled Inside\". Also that year, he produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger's top ten hit \"Day After Day\", and a dobro on Preston's \"I Wrote a Simple Song\". He worked with Harry Nilsson on \"You're Breakin' My Heart\" (1972) and with Cheech &amp; Chong on \"Basketball Jones\" (1973).\nIn 1974, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Eric Idle commented: \"He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of.\" The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and the duo Splinter. Harrison produced and made multiple musical contributions to Splinter's debut album, \"The Place I Love\", which provided Dark Horse with its first hit, \"Costafine Town\". He also produced and played guitar and autoharp on Shankar's \"Shankar Family &amp; Friends\", the label's other inaugural release. Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva and Stairsteps.\nHarrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scott's 1975 album \"New York Connection\", and in 1981 he played guitar on \"Walk a Thin Line\", from Mick Fleetwood's \"The Visitor\". His contributions to Starr's solo career continued with \"Wrack My Brain\", a 1981 US top 40 hit written and produced by Harrison, and guitar overdubs to two tracks on \"Vertical Man\" (1998). In 1996, Harrison recorded \"Distance Makes No Difference With Love\" with Carl Perkins for the latter's album \"Go Cat Go!\", and, in 1990, he played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan's \"Under the Red Sky\" album. In 2001, he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra's comeback album \"Zoom\", and on the song \"Love Letters\" for Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, \"Horse to the Water\", which was recorded on 2 October, eight weeks before his death. It appeared on Jools Holland's album \"Small World, Big Band\".\nGuitars.\nWhen Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958, his main guitar was a H\u00f6fner President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a H\u00f6fner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961 and posed with on the album cover for \"Cloud Nine\" (1987). He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on \"She Loves You\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". In 1963, he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the \"Help!\" album that February; he also used it when recording \"Rubber Soul\" later that year, most notably on the song \"Nowhere Man\".\nIn early 1966, Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which they used on \"Revolver\". Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \"Bebopalula\" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, \"Rocky\", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967) film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a Gibson Les Paul that had been stripped of its original finish and stained cherry red, which Harrison nicknamed \"Lucy\". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a \"Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for Harrison.\nFilm production and HandMade films.\nHarrison helped finance Ravi Shankar's documentary \"Raga\" and released it through Apple Films in 1971. He also produced, with Apple manager Allen Klein, the \"Concert for Bangladesh\" film. In 1973, he produced the feature film \"Little Malcolm\", but the project was lost amid the litigation surrounding the former Beatles ending their business ties with Klein.\nIn 1973, Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis O'Brien. Soon after, the two went into business together. In 1978, to produce \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\", they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their chief executive, Bernard Delfont. Harrison financed the production of \"Life of Brian\" in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called \"the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history\". The film grossed $21\u00a0million at the box office in the US. The first film distributed by HandMade Films was \"The Long Good Friday\" (1980), and the first they produced was \"Time Bandits\" (1981), a co-scripted project by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin. The film featured a new song by Harrison, \"Dream Away\", in the closing credits. \"Time Bandits\" became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.\nHarrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade, including \"A Private Function\" (1984), \"Mona Lisa\" (1986), \"Shanghai Surprise\" (1986), \"Withnail and I\" (1987) and \"How to Get Ahead in Advertising\" (1989). He made cameo appearances in several of these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in \"Shanghai Surprise\", for which he recorded five new songs. According to Ian Inglis, \"[Harrison's] executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country's most memorable movies of the 1980s.\" Following a series of box office bombs in the late 1980s, and excessive debt incurred by O'Brien which was guaranteed by Harrison, HandMade's financial situation became precarious. The company ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment, a Canadian corporation. Afterwards, Harrison sued O'Brien for $25 million for fraud and negligence, resulting in an $11.6\u00a0million judgement in 1996.\nHumanitarian work.\nHarrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. In early 1971, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison hastily wrote and recorded the song \"Bangla Desh\", which became pop music's first charity single when issued by Apple Records in late July. He also pushed Apple to release Shankar's \"Joi Bangla\" EP in an effort to raise further awareness for the cause.&lt;ref name=\"Dooley/Gibson\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shankar asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US. Harrison responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000. Around $13.5 million was generated through the album and film releases, although most of the funds were frozen in an Internal Revenue Service audit for ten years, due to Klein's failure to register the event as a UNICEF benefit beforehand. In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison, Shankar, and Klein, with the \"Child Is the Father of Man\" award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.\nFrom 1980, Harrison became a vocal supporter of Greenpeace and CND. He also protested against the use of nuclear energy with Friends of the Earth, and helped finance \"Vole\", a green magazine launched by Monty Python member Terry Jones. In 1990, he helped promote his wife Olivia's Romanian Angel Appeal on behalf of the thousands of Romanian orphans left abandoned by the state following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. Harrison recorded a benefit single, \"Nobody's Child\", with the Traveling Wilburys, and assembled a with contributions from other artists including Clapton, Starr, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Donovan and Van Morrison.\nThe Concert for Bangladesh has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid. The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF, a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF, aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies. In December 2007, they donated $450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh. On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.\nPersonal life.\nHinduism.\nBy the mid-1960s, Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of \"Help!\" in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, \"The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga\" (1960). Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the \"Sgt Pepper\" recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his first wife, Pattie Boyd; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968, he travelled with the other Beatles to Rishikesh in northern India to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\nHarrison's experiences with LSD in the mid-1960s served as a catalyst for his early pursuance of Hinduism. In a 1977 interview, George recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time \u2013 these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\nHowever, Harrison stopped using LSD after a disenchanting experience in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. He recounted in \"The Beatles Anthology\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That was the turning point for me \u2013 that's when I went right off the whole drug cult and stopped taking the dreaded lysergic acid. I had some in a little bottle \u2013 it was liquid. I put it under a microscope, and it looked like bits of old rope. I thought that I couldn't put that into my brain any more.\nAfter being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda \u2013 yogis and authors, respectively, of \"Raja Yoga\" (1896) and \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" (1946). In mid-1969, he produced the single \"Hare Krishna Mantra\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as \"my friend ... my master\" and \"a perfect example of everything he preached\". Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly \"japa-yoga\" chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee. In 1972 he donated his Letchmore Heath mansion north of London to the devotees. It was later converted to a temple and renamed Bhaktivedanta Manor.\nRegarding other faiths, he once remarked: \"All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call.\" He commented on his beliefs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Krishna actually was in a body as a person\u00a0... What makes it complicated is, if he's God, what's he doing fighting on a battlefield? It took me ages to try to figure that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot. So this is the point \u2013 that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body\u00a0... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, \"Please Krishna, you drive the chariot\" because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides\u00a0... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield. That's why we say \"\"Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna\"\", asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.\nInglis comments that, in contrast to Cliff Richard's conversion to Christianity in 1966: \"Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity\u00a0... what he, and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs.\"\nVegetarianism.\nIn line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. He remained a vegetarian on religious grounds from 1968 until his death, and spent the second half of his life as an advocate for the benefits of vegetarian diet.\nFamily and interests.\nHarrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met on set in 1964 during the production of the film \"A Hard Day's Night\", in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. During a lunch break, George 'playfully' proposed to her. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife Maureen, which Boyd called \"the final straw\". She characterised the last year of their marriage as \"fuelled by alcohol and cocaine\", and she stated: \"George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him\u00a0... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart.\" She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.\nOn 2 September 1978, Harrison married Olivia Trinidad Arias, who was a marketing executive for A&amp;M Records, and later Dark Horse Records. As Dark Horse was a subsidiary of A&amp;M, the couple had first met over the phone working on record company business, and then in person at the A&amp;M Records offices in Los Angeles in 1974.&lt;ref name=\"Olivia/DHYears\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had one son, Dhani Harrison, born on 1 August 1978.\nHarrison restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in Henley-on-Thames, where several of his music videos, including \"Crackerbox Palace\", were filmed; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of \"All Things Must Pass\". He employed ten workers to maintain the garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism: \"Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'\" His autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", is dedicated \"to gardeners everywhere\". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: \"George is not disowning the Beatles\u00a0... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life.\"\nHarrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12, he had attended his first race, the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree. He wrote \"Faster\" as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson. Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity, set up after the Swedish driver's death from the disease in 1978. Harrison's first extravagant car, a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London. An anonymous Beatles collector paid \u00a3350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.\nRelationships with the other Beatles.\nFor most of the Beatles' career, the relationships in the group were close. According to Hunter Davies, \"the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends.\" Harrison's ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles \"all belonged to each other\" and admitted, \"George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it.\" Starr said, \"We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other.\" He added, \"there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there \u2013 a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational.\"\nLennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was \"one of young follower and older guy\u00a0... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started.\" The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, with, according to biographer Gary Tillery, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974, Harrison said of his former bandmate: \"John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a \"bastard\" \u2013 but that's the great thing about him, you see?\"\nHarrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together. McCartney said that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring. McCartney has referred to Harrison as his \"baby brother\". In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman, Harrison stated: \"[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player\". In the same interview, however, Harrison stated that \"I just know that whatever we've been through, there's always been something that's tied us together.\" Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves. Rodriguez commented: \"Even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship\". When, in a Yahoo online chat in February 2001, he was asked if Paul \"[pisses] you off\", Harrison replied \"Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass -- You know his faults -- Then let his foibles pass. Old Victorian Proverb. I'm sure there's enough about me that pisses him off, but I think we have now grown old enough to realize that we're both pretty damn cute!\"\nLegacy.\nIn June 1965, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film \"Let It Be\". The minor planet 4149 Harrison, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of Dahlia flower. In December 1992, he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's \"critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of world music\" and for his having \"advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music\". \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is also in number 65 in the list of \"100 greatest songwriters of all time\" by the same magazine.\nIn 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as \"one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced\", was among the performers of Monty Python's \"Lumberjack Song\". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.\nIn 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.\nA documentary film titled \"\", directed by Martin Scorsese, was released in October 2011. The film features interviews with Olivia and Dhani Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Terry Gilliam, Starr, Clapton, McCartney, Keltner and Astrid Kirchherr.\nHarrison was posthumously honoured with The Recording Academy's Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammy Awards in February 2015.\nAn Illinois State Historical Society marker in Benton, Illinois, commemorates Harrison's visit in the town in 1963 to see his sister, making him the first Beatle to visit the United States. In 2017, a mural installation was unveiled in the town of Harrison painted by artist John Cerney. Statues of Harrison can be found around the world, including several across his native Liverpool and a bust in the Shadhinotar Shagram Triangle Sculpture Garden in Dhaka, Bangladesh, commemorating Harrison's contributions to Bangladeshi culture.\nOn 24 May 2024 a Historic England blue plaque was unveiled at Harrison's childhood home at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree by his wife Olivia.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDocumentaries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is sometimes referred to as a jovian planet, with \"Jove\" being another name for the Roman god Jupiter. Giant planets are usually primarily composed of low-boiling point materials (volatiles), rather than rock or other solid matter, but mega-Earths do also exist. There are four such giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified.\nGiant planets are sometimes known as gas giants, but many astronomers now apply the term only to Jupiter and Saturn, classifying Uranus and Neptune, which have different compositions, as ice giants. Both names are potentially misleading; the Solar System's giant planets all consist primarily of fluids above their critical points, where distinct gas and liquid phases do not exist. Jupiter and Saturn are principally made of hydrogen and helium, whilst Uranus and Neptune consist of water, ammonia, and methane.\nThe defining differences between a very low-mass brown dwarf and a massive gas giant (~13\u00a0MJ) are debated. One school of thought is based on planetary formation; the other, on the physics of the interior of planets. Part of the debate concerns whether brown dwarfs must, by definition, have experienced nuclear fusion at some point in their history.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"gas giant\" was coined in 1952 by science fiction writer James Blish and was originally used to refer to all giant planets. Arguably it is something of a misnomer, because throughout most of the volume of these planets the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous form. Other than the upper layers of the atmosphere, all matter is likely beyond the critical point, where there is no distinction between liquids and gases. \"Fluid planet\" would be a more accurate term. Jupiter also has metallic hydrogen near its center, but much of its volume is hydrogen, helium, and traces of other gases above their critical points. The observable atmospheres of all these planets (at less than a unit optical depth) are quite thin compared to their radii, only extending perhaps one percent of the way to the center. Thus, the observable parts are gaseous (in contrast to Mars and Earth, which have gaseous atmospheres through which the crust can be seen).\nThe rather misleading term has caught on because planetary scientists typically use \"rock\", \"gas\", and \"ice\" as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds commonly found as planetary constituents, irrespective of the matter's phase. In the outer Solar System, hydrogen and helium are referred to as \"gas\"; water, methane, and ammonia as \"ice\"; and silicates and metals as \"rock\". When deep planetary interiors are considered, it may not be far off to say that, by \"ice\" astronomers mean oxygen and carbon, by \"rock\" they mean silicon, and by \"gas\" they mean hydrogen and helium. The many ways in which Uranus and Neptune differ from Jupiter and Saturn have led some to use the term only for planets similar to the latter two. With this terminology in mind, some astronomers have started referring to Uranus and Neptune as ice giants to indicate the predominance of the \"ices\" (in fluid form) in their interior composition.\nThe alternative term \"jovian planet\" refers to the Roman god Jupiter\u2014the genitive form of which is \"Jovis\", hence \"Jovian\"\u2014and was intended to indicate that all of these planets were similar to Jupiter.\nObjects large enough to start deuterium fusion (above 13 Jupiter masses for solar composition) are called brown dwarfs, and these occupy the mass range between that of large giant planets and the lowest-mass stars. The 13-Jupiter-mass (MJ) cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13\u00a0MJ value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on the mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present. The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 60\u00a0MJ, and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24\u00a0MJ.\nDescription.\nA giant planet is a massive planet and has a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. They may have a condensed \"core\" of heavier elements, delivered during the formation process. This core may be partially or completely dissolved and dispersed throughout the hydrogen/helium envelope. In \"traditional\" giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants) hydrogen and helium make up most of the mass of the planet, whereas they only make up an outer envelope on Uranus and Neptune, which are instead mostly composed of water, ammonia, and methane and therefore increasingly referred to as \"ice giants\".\nExtrasolar giant planets that orbit very close to their stars are the exoplanets that are easiest to detect. These are called hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes because they have very high surface temperatures. Hot Jupiters were, until the advent of space-borne telescopes, the most common form of exoplanet known, due to the relative ease of detecting them with ground-based instruments.\nGiant planets are commonly said to lack solid surfaces, but it is more accurate to say that they lack surfaces altogether since the gases that form them simply become thinner and thinner with increasing distance from the planets' centers, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the interplanetary medium. Therefore, landing on a giant planet may or may not be possible, depending on the size and composition of its core.\nSubtypes.\nGas giants.\nGas giants consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The Solar System's gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, have heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of their mass. Gas giants are thought to consist of an outer layer of molecular hydrogen, surrounding a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, with a probable molten core with a rocky composition.\nJupiter and Saturn's outermost portion of the hydrogen atmosphere has many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia. The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet, and is referred to as \"metallic\" because the very high pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor. The core is thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures (20,000 K) and pressures that their properties are poorly understood.\nIce giants.\nIce giants have distinctly different interior compositions from gas giants. The Solar System's ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that extends from the cloud tops down to about 80% (Uranus) or 85% (Neptune) of their radius. Below this, they are predominantly \"icy\", i.e. consisting mostly of water, methane, and ammonia. There is also some rock and gas, but various proportions of ice\u2013rock\u2013gas could mimic pure ice, so that the exact proportions are unknown.\nUranus and Neptune have very hazy atmospheric layers with small amounts of methane, giving them light aquamarine colors. Both have magnetic fields that are sharply inclined to their axes of rotation.\nUnlike the other giant planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt that causes its seasons to be severely pronounced. The two planets also have other subtle but important differences. Uranus has more hydrogen and helium than Neptune despite being less massive overall. Neptune is therefore denser and has much more internal heat and a more active atmosphere. The Nice model, in fact, suggests that Neptune formed closer to the Sun than Uranus did, and should therefore have more heavy elements.\nMega-Earths.\nThe term \"mega-Earth\" or \"massive solid planet\" was used to refer to massive terrestrial exoplanets exceeding 10\u00a0ME. With a mainly rocky composition, such a planet would have a density considerably greater than that of Earth and gas giants. Kepler-10c was traditionally classified as a mega-Earth, but was later found to be likely a volatile-rich mini-Neptune. A sub-category known as \"supermassive terrestrial planets\" (SMTP) was used to refer to mega-Earths more than 30\u00a0ME, such as Kepler-145b. Several pulsar planets, such as PSR J1719\u22121438 b, were discovered with masses higher than Jupiter's but with smaller radii when compared to gas giants, and are expected hence to be mostly crystallized diamond and oxygen. As such, they may be carbon-rich planet-sized remnant inner cores of former companion stars shredded during interaction with a pulsar. However, per definitions, they would be instead considered as very low-mass white dwarfs, rather than high-density diamond planets. Chthonian planets such as TOI-849 b, rocky or metallic planetary cores of an evaporated gas giant or brown dwarf, may have masses comparable to mega-Earths, well over 30\u00a0ME.\nThe possibility of massive solid planets up to thousands of\u00a0ME forming around massive stars (B and O-type stars; ) has also been suggested based on mass-radius relationships for rocky planets, proposing that the protoplanetary disk around such stars would contain enough heavy elements, and that high UV radiation and strong winds could photoevaporate the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements. However, a more recent research showed that the ratio of protoplanetary disk mass to stellar mass decreases rapidly for stars exceeding 10\u00a0M\u2609.\nPer a model, one hypothesis suggested so-called blanets, fundamentally similar to other planets, orbiting around a rotating supermassive black hole at least a million solar masses (M\u2609) may harbor masses comparable to that of massive solid planets. Although the runaway accretion of the gas onto blanets to become gas giants is possible, it is likely difficult. Nevertheless, this would also depend on how fast are the orbits of blanets filled with gas.\nSuper-Puffs.\nA super-puff is a type of exoplanet with a mass only a few times larger than Earth's but a radius larger than Neptune, giving it a very low mean density. They are cooler and less massive than the inflated low-density hot-Jupiters. The most extreme examples known are the three planets around Kepler-51 which are all Jupiter-sized but with densities below 0.1 g/cm3.\nExtrasolar giant planets.\nBecause of the limited techniques currently available to detect exoplanets, many of those found to date have been of a size associated, in the Solar System, with giant planets. Because these large planets are inferred to share more in common with Jupiter than with the other giant planets, some have claimed that \"jovian planet\" is a more accurate term for them. Many of the exoplanets are much closer to their parent stars and hence much hotter than the giant planets in the Solar System, making it possible that some of those planets are a type not observed in the Solar System. Considering the relative abundances of the elements in the universe (approximately 98% hydrogen and helium) it would be surprising to find a predominantly rocky planet more massive than Jupiter. On the other hand, models of planetary-system formation have suggested that giant planets would be inhibited from forming as close to their stars as many of the extrasolar giant planets have been observed to orbit.\nAtmospheres.\nThe bands seen in the atmosphere of Jupiter are due to counter-circulating streams of material called zones and belts, encircling the planet parallel to its equator. The zones are the lighter bands, and are at higher altitudes in the atmosphere. They have an internal updraft and are high-pressure regions. The belts are the darker bands, are lower in the atmosphere, and have an internal downdraft. They are low-pressure regions. These structures are somewhat analogous to the high and low-pressure cells in Earth's atmosphere, but they have a very different structure\u2014latitudinal bands that circle the entire planet, as opposed to small confined cells of pressure. This appears to be a result of the rapid rotation and underlying symmetry of the planet. There are no oceans or landmasses to cause local heating and the rotation speed is much higher than that of Earth.\nThere are smaller structures as well: spots of different sizes and colors. On Jupiter, the most noticeable of these features is the Great Red Spot, which has been present for at least 300 years. These structures are huge storms. Some such spots are thunderheads as well."}

In some faiths, a sacred female figure holds a central place in religious prayer and worship. For example, Shaktism (one of the three major Hindu sects), holds that the ultimate deity, the source of all reality, is Supreme Goddess (Mahaiia) and in some forms of Tantric Shaivism, the pair of Shiva and Shakti are the ultimate principle (with the goddess representing the active, creative power of God). Meanwhile, in Vajrayana Buddhism, ultimate reality is often seen as being composed of two principles depicted as two deities in union (yab yum, \"father-mother\") symbolising the non-duality of the two principles of perfect wisdom (female) and skillful compassion (male). A single figure in a monotheistic faith that is female may be identified simply as god because of no need to differentiate by gender or with a diminutive. An experiment to determine the effect of psychedelics on subjects composed of leaders from diverse religious groups revealed a general experience that the divine the subjects encountered was feminine.\nPolytheist religions, including Polytheistic reconstructionists, honour multiple goddesses and gods, and usually view them as discrete, separate beings. These deities may be part of a pantheon, or different regions may have tutelary deities. In many known cultures, goddesses are often linked with literal or metaphorical pregnancy or imagined feminine roles associated with how women and girls are perceived or expected to behave. This includes themes of spinning, weaving, beauty, love, sexuality, motherhood, domesticity, creativity, and fertility (exemplified by the ancient mother goddess cult). Many major goddesses are also associated with magic, war, strategy, hunting, farming, wisdom, fate, earth, sky, power, laws, justice, and more. Some themes, such as discord or disease, which are considered negative within their cultural contexts also are found associated with some goddesses. There are as many differently described and understood goddesses as there are male, shapeshifting, devilish, or neuter gods.\nEtymology.\nThe noun \"goddess\" is a secondary formation, combining the Germanic \"god\" with the Latinate \"-ess\" suffix. It first appeared in Middle English, from about 1350. The English word follows the linguistic precedent of a number of languages\u2014including Egyptian, Classical Greek, and several Semitic languages\u2014that add a feminine ending to the language's word for \"god\". Occasionally, one finds the root term being applied without the secondary ending.\nHistorical polytheism.\nAncient Near East.\nMesopotamia.\nInanna was the most worshipped goddess in ancient Sumer. She was later syncretised with the East Semitic goddess Ishtar. Other Mesopotamian goddesses include Ninhursag, Ninlil, Antu and Gaga.\nCanaan.\nGoddesses of the Canaanite religion: Ba`alat Gebal, Astarte, Anat.\nPre-Islamic Arabia.\nIn pre-Islamic Mecca the goddesses Uzza, Man\u0101t and al-L\u0101t were known as \"the daughters of god\". Uzz\u0101 was worshipped by the Nabataeans, who equated her with the Graeco-Roman goddesses Aphrodite, Urania, Venus and Caelestis. Each of the three goddesses had a separate shrine near Mecca. Uzz\u0101, was called upon for protection by the pre-Islamic Quraysh. In 624 AD, during the Battle of Uhud, the war cry of the Qurayshites was, \"O people of Uzz\u0101, people of Hubal!\" (Tawil 1993).\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq's controversial account of the Satanic Verses (\"q.v.\"), these verses had previously endorsed them as intercessors for Muslims, but were abrogated. Most Muslim scholars have regarded the story as historically implausible, while opinion is divided among western scholars such as Leone Caetani and John Burton, who argue against, and William Muir and William Montgomery Watt, who argue for its plausibility.\nThe Quran () warns of the vanity of trusting to the intercession of female deities, in particular \"the daughters of god\".\nIndo-European traditions.\nPre-Christian and pre-Islamic goddesses in cultures that spoke Indo-European languages.\nCeltic.\nGoddesses and Otherworldly Women in Celtic polytheism include:\nThe Celts honoured goddesses of nature and natural forces, as well as those connected with skills and professions such as healing, warfare and poetry. The Celtic goddesses have diverse qualities such as abundance, creation and beauty, as well as harshness, slaughter and vengeance. They have been depicted as beautiful or hideous, old hags or young women, and at times may transform their appearance from one state to another, or into their associated creatures such as crows, cows, wolves or eels, to name but a few. In Irish mythology in particular, tutelary goddesses are often associated with sovereignty and various features of the land, notably mountains, rivers, forests and holy wells.\nGermanic.\nSurviving accounts of Germanic mythology and Norse mythology contain numerous tales of female goddesses, giantesses, and divine female figures in their scriptures. The Germanic peoples had altars erected to the \"Mothers and Matrons\" and held celebrations specific to these goddesses (such as the Anglo-Saxon \"Mothers-night\"). Various other female deities are attested among the Germanic peoples, such as Nerthus attested in an early account of the Germanic peoples, \u0112ostre attested among the pagan Anglo-Saxons, and Sinthgunt attested among the pagan continental Germanic peoples. Examples of goddesses attested in Norse mythology include Frigg (wife of Odin, and the Anglo-Saxon version of whom is namesake of the modern English weekday Friday), Ska\u00f0i (one time wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r), Njerda (Scandinavian name of Nerthus), that also was married to Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r during Bronze Age, Freyja (wife of \u00d3\u00f0r), Sif (wife of Thor), Ger\u00f0r (wife of Freyr), and personifications such as J\u00f6r\u00f0 (earth), S\u00f3l (the sun), and N\u00f3tt (night). Female deities also play heavily into the Norse concept of death, where half of those slain in battle enter Freyja's field F\u00f3lkvangr, Hel's realm of the same name, and R\u00e1n who receives those who die at sea. Other female deities such as the valkyries, the norns, and the d\u00edsir are associated with a Germanic concept of fate (Old Norse \"\u00d8rl\u00f6g\", Old English \"Wyrd\"), and celebrations were held in their honour, such as the D\u00edsabl\u00f3t and Disting.\nPre-Columbian America.\nNative North America.\nGoddesses of various Native North American peoples include:\nFolk religion and animism.\nAfrican religions.\nIn African and African diasporic religions, goddesses are often syncretised with Marian devotion, as in Ezili Dantor (Black Madonna of Cz\u0119stochowa) and Erzulie Freda (Mater Dolorosa). There is also Buk, a Sudanese and Ethiopian goddess still worshipped in the southern regions. She represents the fertile aspect of women. She is related to the deity of a similar name, Abuk. Another Ethiopian goddess is Atete, the goddess of spring and fertility. Farmers traditionally leave some of their products at the end of each harvesting season as an offering while women sing traditional songs.\nA rare example of henotheism focused on a single Goddess is found among the Southern Nuba of Sudan. The Nuba conceive of the creator Goddess as the \"Great Mother\" who gave birth to earth and to mankind.\nShinto.\nGoddess Amaterasu is the chief among the Shinto gods (\"kami\"), while there are important female deities Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, Inari and Konohanasakuya-hime.\nIndian religions.\nIn the Indian religions (mainly Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism), there are many goddesses that are widely venerated. The earliest source for several of these goddesses is the Vedas. However, goddesses can also be found in the art of the even more ancient Indus Valley civilisation.\nHinduism.\nHinduism is a diverse complex of many belief systems which includes numerous gods and goddesses. The earliest Hindu source, the \"Rigveda\", contains many goddesses such as Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), V\u0101c (sound), Nir\u1e5bti (destruction) and Saraswati. The \"Dev\u012bs\u016bktam\" is an important source for the goddess idea in Vedic religion. Important Hindu goddesses today include Lakshmi, Saraswati, Durga, Kali, Tripurasundari, Parvati, and Radha.\nThere is much diversity in the theology of the various traditions of Hinduism. Some theologies (e.g. Advaita) see all gods and goddesses as emanations of a single formless impersonal source called Brahman. Other theologies are more personal regarding the ultimate deity.\nSome traditions posit a dual deity in the form of Lakshmi-Vishnu, Radha-Krishna, Brahma-Saraswati, or Shiva-Parvati. These are presented as a pair with a male god (Shaktiman, \"possessor of power\") and his consort, a female \"power\" (Shakti), and their relationship is interpreted in different ways depending on the tradition's theology.\nIn Shaktism, the supreme deity is the Great Goddess (Mahadevi), called by different names such as Shakti or Adi Parashakti (Primordial Supreme Power). Shaktas consider the Goddess to be the ultimate source of all things and the mother of all gods and goddesses. She is considered to have ten main avatars called the ten mahavidyas in some traditions. Another important concept is the Shakta trinity, the tridevi, which sees Mahadevi as manifesting in three main goddesses: Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Mahakali.In the great Shakta scripture known as the \"Devi Mahatmya\" (Glory of the Goddess), all the goddesses are aspects of one presiding female force\u2014one in truth and many in expression, which also is the creative power of the cosmos. It expresses through philosophical tracts and metaphor, that the potentiality of masculine being is actuated by the feminine divine.\nLocal deities of different village regions in India were often identified with \"mainstream\" Hindu deities, a process that has been called \"Sanskritisation\". Others attribute it to the influence of monism or \"Advaita\", which discounts polytheist or monotheist categorisation. While the monist forces have led to a fusion between some of the goddesses (108 names are common for many goddesses), centrifugal forces have also resulted in new goddesses and rituals gaining ascendance among the laity in different parts of Hindu world. Thus, the immensely popular goddess Durga was a pre-Vedic goddess who was later fused with Parvati, a process that can be traced through texts such as Kalika Purana (10th century), Durgabhaktitarangini (Vidyapati 15th century), Chandimangal (16th century) etc.\nWidely celebrated Hindu festival Navaratri is in the honour of the divine feminine Devi (Durga) and spans nine nights of prayer in the autumn, also referred as Sharada Navratri.\nBuddhism.\nThere are numerous female deities in the various Buddhist traditions. Buddhist goddesses are widely depicted in Buddhist art. Early Buddhism in India venerated various female goddesses. These were mostly considered to be devas or spirits (such as yakshinis). They include Prthivi (earth goddess), Hariti, Lakshmi and Mayadevi (the mother of the Buddha). Some of these figures remain important in Theravada Buddhism today, including Maya and Prthivi (known as Phra Mae Thorani in Southeast Asia).\nIndian Mahayana Buddhism revered several female deities, including Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Devi, Cunda, Marici, Sit\u0101tapatra, T\u0101r\u0101, U\u1e63\u1e47\u012b\u1e63avijay\u0101 and Vasudh\u0101r\u0101. In the Mahayana, female deities grew in importance, becoming powerful bodhisattva savior figures, liberators associated with powerful mantras (which are also termed \"vidy\u0101s\" when a mantra is seen as a feminine power) and dharanis. In some cases, such as with Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Devi, these goddesses were even called \"mother of Buddhas\" (Sanskrit: buddhamatr) and bhagavati, indicating they were seen as fully awakened Buddhas themselves.\nIn the Mahayana traditions, some are considered to be bodhisattvas (beings advancing on the path to Buddhahood) or full Buddhas, while others are just devas (worldly deities). The most important Buddhist female deities in East Asian Buddhism are the bodhisattva Guanyin and the \"mother of Buddhas\" Cundi. In Tibetan Buddhism, Tara is the most important female deity (often considered to be a full Buddha).\nThe tantric \"dakini\" Vajrayogini is an important tantric meditation deity (yidam) in Tibetan Vajrayana, and is also considered to be a female Buddha in her own right. Tantric Buddhist goddesses were often considered to be fully awakened Buddhas and sometimes are depicted with unique tantric elements, such as skullcups and flaying knives. These tantric deities include Simhamukha, Mahamaya, Vajrayogini, Chinnamunda and Kurukulla.\nMahayana goddesses are often termed \"devis\" (Sanskrit: devi, \"female deity\", \"goddess\", Tibetan: lhamo) or even bhagavani (the female version of bhagavan, indicating Buddhahood).\nAbrahamic religions.\nJudaism.\nAccording to Zohar, Lilith is the name of Adam's first wife, who was created at the same time as Adam. She left Adam and refused to return to the Garden of Eden after she mated with archangel Samael. Her story was greatly developed during the Middle Ages in the tradition of Aggadic midrashim, the Zohar and Jewish mysticism.\nThe Zohar tradition has influenced Jewish folklore, which postulates God created Adam to marry a woman named Lilith. Outside of Jewish tradition, Lilith was associated with the Mother Goddess, Inanna \u2013 later known as both Ishtar and Asherah. In The Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh was said to have destroyed a tree that was in a sacred grove dedicated to the goddess Ishtar/Inanna/Asherah. Lilith ran into the wilderness in despair. She then is depicted in the Talmud and Kabbalah as first wife to God's first creation of man, Adam. In time, as stated in the Old Testament, the Hebrew followers continued to worship \"False Idols\", like Asherah, as being as powerful as God. Jeremiah speaks of his (and God's) displeasure at this behaviour to the Hebrew people about the worship of the goddess in the Old Testament. Lilith is banished from Adam and God's presence when she is discovered to be a \"demon\" and Eve becomes Adam's wife.\nThe following female deities are mentioned in prominent Hebrew texts:\nMore commonly, modern Judaism acknowledges \"Shekhinah\" as the feminine aspect of God. \"Shekhinah\" is considered to be the presence of God on Earth and/or the spirit of the Jewish people, forever trying to reunite with the other elements of God through \"tikkun olam\". She is also associated with the moon, the earth, David, and Rachel.\nChristianity.\nThe veneration of Mary, the mother of Jesus, as an especially privileged saint has continued since the beginning of the Catholic faith. Mary is venerated as the Mother of God, Queen of Heaven, Mother of the Church, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Star of the Sea, and other lofty titles.\nMarian devotion similar to this kind is also found in Eastern Orthodoxy and sometimes in Anglicanism, although not in the majority of denominations of Protestantism.\nIn some Christian traditions (like the Orthodox tradition), Sophia is the personification of either divine wisdom (or of an archangel) that takes female form. She is mentioned in the first chapter of the Book of Proverbs. Sophia is identified by some as the wisdom imparting Holy Spirit of the Christian Trinity, whose names in Hebrew\u2014Ruach and Shekhinah\u2014are both feminine, and whose symbol of the dove was commonly associated in the Ancient Near East with the figure of the Mother Goddess.\nIn mysticism, Gnosticism, as well as some Hellenistic religions, there is a female spirit or goddess named Sophia who is said to embody wisdom and who is sometimes described as a virgin. In Roman Catholic mysticism, Saint Hildegard celebrated Sophia as a cosmic figure both in her writing and art. Within the Protestant tradition in England, the 17th-century mystic universalist and founder of the Philadelphian Society Jane Leade wrote copious descriptions of her visions and dialogues with the \"Virgin Sophia\" who, she said, revealed to her the spiritual workings of the universe. Leade was hugely influenced by the theosophical writings of 16th-century German Christian mystic Jakob B\u00f6hme, who also speaks of Sophia in works such as \"The Way to Christ\". Jakob B\u00f6hme was very influential to a number of Christian mystics and religious leaders, including George Rapp and the Harmony Society.\nLatter Day Saint movement.\nThe members of most denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement believe in, although they do not directly worship, a Heavenly Mother who is the female counterpart of the Heavenly Father. Together they are referred to as Heavenly Parents. Adherents also believe that all humans, both women and men, have the potential to become gods through a process known as exaltation.\nNeopaganism.\nMost Modern Pagan traditions honour one or more goddesses. While some who follow Wicca believe in a duotheistic belief system, consisting of a single goddess and a single god, who in hieros gamos represent a united whole, others recognise only one or more goddesses.\nWicca.\nIn Wicca \"the Goddess\" is the deity of prime importance, along with her consort the Horned God.\nWithin many forms of Wicca the Goddess has come to be considered as a universal deity, more in line with her description in the Charge of the Goddess, a key Wiccan text. In this guise she is the \"Queen of Heaven\", similar to Isis. She also encompasses and conceives (creates) all life, much like Gaia. Similarly to Isis and certain late Classical conceptions of Selene, she is the summation of all other goddesses, who represent her different names and aspects across the different cultures. The Goddess is often portrayed with strong lunar symbolism, drawing on various cultures and deities such as Diana, Hecate, and Isis, and is often depicted as the Maiden, Mother, and Crone triad popularised by Robert Graves (see Triple Goddess below). Many depictions of her also draw strongly on Celtic goddesses. Some Wiccans, or Witches, believe there are many goddesses, and in some forms of Wicca, notably Dianic Wicca, the Goddess alone is worshipped, and the God plays very little (or no) part in their worship and ritual. The first history of Wiccans or Witches (nature based religion) appear on cave paintings that show early humans worshipping a feminine nature deity for luck and harvest (BCE). Later Celtics form a more formal form of Witches (Wiccans) with the triquetra (maiden mother crone), pentagram etc. They have evolved into the strong, nature based, animal rights loving and women rights religion of today.\nGoddesses or demi-goddesses appear in sets of three in a number of ancient European pagan mythologies; these include the Greek \"Erinyes\" (Furies) and \"Moirai\" (Fates); the Norse \"Norns\"; Brighid and her two sisters, also called Brighid, from Irish or Celtic mythology.\nRobert Graves popularised the triad of \"Maiden\" (or \"Virgin\"), \"Mother\" and \"Crone\", and while this idea did not rest on sound scholarship, his poetic inspiration has gained a tenacious hold. Considerable variation in the precise conceptions of these figures exists, as typically occurs in Neopaganism and indeed in pagan religions in general. Some choose to interpret them as three stages in a woman's life, separated by menarche and menopause. Others find this too biologically based and rigid, and prefer a freer interpretation, with the Maiden as birth (independent, self-centred, seeking), the Mother as giving birth (interrelated, compassionate nurturing, creating), and the Crone as death and renewal (holistic, remote, unknowable)\u00a0\u2014 and all three erotic and wise.\nFeminism.\nGoddess movement.\nAt least since first-wave feminism in the United States, there has been interest in analysing religion to see if and how doctrines and practices treat women unfairly, as in Elizabeth Cady Stanton's \"The Woman's Bible\". Again in second-wave feminism in the U.S., as well as in many European and other countries, religion became the focus of some feminist analysis in Judaism, Christianity, and other religions, and some women turned to ancient goddess religions as an alternative to Abrahamic religions (\"Womanspirit Rising\" 1979; \"Weaving the Visions\" 1989). Today both women and men continue to be involved in the Goddess movement (Christ 1997). The popularity of organisations such as the Fellowship of Isis attest to the continuing growth of the religion of the Goddess throughout the world.\nWhile much of the attempt at gender equity in mainstream Christianity (Judaism never recognised any gender for God) is aimed at reinterpreting scripture and degenderising language used to name and describe the divine (Ruether, 1984; Plaskow, 1991), there are a growing number of people who identify as Christians or Jews who are trying to integrate goddess imagery into their religions (Kien, 2000; Kidd 1996,\"Goddess Christians Yahoo Group\").\nSacred feminine.\nThe term \"sacred feminine\" was first coined in the 1970s, in New Age popularisations of the Hindu Shakti. Hinduism also worships multitude of goddesses that have their important role and thus in all came to interest for the New Age, feminist, and lesbian feminist movements.\nMetaphorical use.\nThe term \"goddess\" has also been adapted to poetic and secular use as a complimentary description of a non-mythological woman. The OED notes 1579 as the date of the earliest attestation of such figurative use, in \"Lauretta the diuine Petrarches Goddesse\".\nShakespeare had several of his male characters address female characters as goddesses, including Demetrius to Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (\"O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!\"), Berowne to Rosaline in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" (\"A woman I forswore; but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee\"), and Bertram to Diana in \"All's Well That Ends Well\". Pisanio also compares Imogen to a goddess to describe her composure under duress in \"Cymbeline\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "12737", "revid": "51016072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12737", "title": "Gunpowder", "text": "Type of firearm propellant\nGunpowder, also commonly known as black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. It consists of a mixture of sulfur, charcoal (which is mostly carbon), and potassium nitrate (saltpeter). The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels, while the saltpeter is an oxidizer. Gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, artillery, rocketry, and pyrotechnics, including use as a blasting agent for explosives in quarrying, mining, building pipelines, tunnels, and roads.\nGunpowder is classified as a low explosive because of its relatively slow decomposition rate, low ignition temperature and consequently low brisance (breaking/shattering). Low explosives deflagrate\u2014burning at subsonic speeds\u2014whereas high explosives detonate, producing a supersonic shockwave. Ignition of gunpowder packed behind a projectile generates enough pressure to force the shot from the muzzle at high speed, but usually not enough force to rupture the gun barrel. It thus makes a good propellant but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications with its low-yield explosive power. Nonetheless, it was widely used to fill fused artillery shells (and used in mining and civil engineering projects) until the second half of the 19th century, when the first high explosives were put into use.\nGunpowder is one of the Four Great Inventions of China. Originally developed by Taoists for medicinal purposes, it was first used for warfare around AD 904. Its use in weapons has declined due to smokeless powder replacing it, whilst its relative inefficiency led to newer alternatives such as dynamite and ammonium nitrate/fuel oil replacing it in industrial applications.\nEffect.\nGunpowder is a low explosive: it does not detonate, but rather deflagrates (burns quickly). This is an advantage in a propellant device, where one does not desire a shock that would shatter the gun and potentially harm the operator; however, it is a drawback when an explosion is desired. In that case, the propellant (and most importantly, gases produced by its burning) must be confined. Since it contains its own oxidizer and additionally burns faster under pressure, its combustion is capable of bursting containers such as a shell, grenade, or improvised \"pipe bomb\" or \"pressure cooker\" casings to form shrapnel.\nIn quarrying, high explosives are generally preferred for shattering rock. However, because of its low brisance, gunpowder causes fewer fractures and results in more usable stone compared to other explosives, making it useful for blasting slate, which is fragile, or monumental stone such as granite and marble. Gunpowder is well suited for blank rounds, signal flares, burst charges, and rescue-line launches. It is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain special effects.\nCombustion converts less than half the mass of gunpowder to gas; most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving away a soldier's position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover, this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a corrosive substance. The soot contains potassium oxide or sodium oxide that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Gunpowder arms therefore require thorough and regular cleaning to remove the residue.\nGunpowder loads can be used in modern firearms as long as they are not gas-operated. The most compatible modern guns are smoothbore-barreled shotguns that are long-recoil operated with chrome-plated essential parts such as barrels and bores. Such guns have minimal fouling and corrosion, and are easier to clean.\nHistory.\nChina.\nThe first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in China occurred in the 9th century during the Tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the \"Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue\" () in 808, and then about 50 years later in a Daoist text known as the \"Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce\" (). The \"Taishang Shengzu Jindan Mijue\" mentions a formula composed of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb. According to the \"Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce\", \"Some have heated together sulfur, realgar and saltpeter with honey; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down.\" Based on these Taoist texts, the invention of gunpowder by Chinese alchemists was likely an accidental byproduct from experiments seeking to create the elixir of life. This experimental medicine origin is reflected in its Chinese name \"huoyao\" (), which means \"fire medicine\". Saltpeter was known to the Chinese by the mid-1st century AD and was primarily produced in the provinces of Sichuan, Shanxi, and Shandong. There is strong evidence of the use of saltpeter and sulfur in various medicinal combinations. A Chinese alchemical text dated 492 noted saltpeter burnt with a purple flame, providing a practical and reliable means of distinguishing it from other inorganic salts, thus enabling alchemists to evaluate and compare purification techniques; the earliest Latin accounts of saltpeter purification are dated after 1200.\nThe earliest chemical formula for gunpowder appeared in the 11th-century Song dynasty text \"Wujing Zongyao\" (\"Complete Essentials from the Military Classics\"), written by Zeng Gongliang between 1040 and 1044. The \"Wujing Zongyao\" provides encyclopedia references to a variety of mixtures that included petrochemicals\u2014as well as garlic and honey. A slow match for flame-throwing mechanisms using the siphon principle and for fireworks and rockets is mentioned. The mixture formulas in this book contain at most 50% not enough to create an explosion, they produce an incendiary instead. The \"Essentials\" was written by a Song dynasty court bureaucrat and there is little evidence that it had any immediate impact on warfare; there is no mention of its use in the chronicles of the wars against the Tanguts in the 11th century, and China was otherwise mostly at peace during this century. However, it had already been used for fire arrows since at least the 10th century. Its first recorded military application dates its use to 904 in the form of incendiary projectiles. In the following centuries the Chinese recognised gunpowder for its military applications and gunpowder was weaponised in the form of bombs, fire lances and hand cannons in China. Explosive weapons such as bombs have been discovered in a shipwreck off the shore of Japan dated from 1281, during the Mongol invasions of Japan.\nBy 1083 the Song court was producing hundreds of thousands of fire arrows for their garrisons. Bombs and the first proto-guns, known as \"fire lances\", became prominent during the 12th century and were used by the Song during the Jin-Song Wars. Fire lances were first recorded to have been used at the Siege of De'an in 1132 by Song forces against the Jin. In the early 13th century the Jin used iron-casing bombs. Projectiles were added to fire lances, and re-usable fire lance barrels were developed, first out of hardened paper, and then finally, the barrels were made out of metal to better withstand the explosive pressure of gunpowder. By 1257 some fire lances were firing wads of bullets. In the late 13th century metal fire lances became 'eruptors', proto-cannons firing co-viative projectiles (mixed with the propellant, rather than seated over it with a wad), and by 1287 at the latest, had become true guns, the hand cannon, which included a metal barrel, touch hole and gunpowder chamber.\nMiddle East.\nAccording to Iqtidar Alam Khan, the Mongols introduced gunpowder in their invasion of Persia and Mesopotamia. The Muslims acquired knowledge of gunpowder sometime between 1240 and 1280, by which point the Syrian Hasan al-Rammah had written recipes, instructions for the purification of saltpeter, and descriptions of gunpowder incendiaries. It is implied by al-Rammah's usage of \"terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from Chinese sources\" and his references to saltpeter as \"Chinese snow\" ( '), fireworks as \"Chinese flowers\", and rockets as \"Chinese arrows\", that knowledge of gunpowder arrived from China. However, because al-Rammah attributes his material to \"his father and forefathers\", Ahmad Y. al-Hassan argues that gunpowder became prevalent in Syria and Egypt by \"the end of the twelfth century or the beginning of the thirteenth\". In Persia saltpeter was known as \"Chinese salt\" () or \"salt from Chinese salt marshes\" ( ').\nHasan al-Rammah included 107 gunpowder recipes in \"The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices\" (), 22 of which are for rockets. The median of 17 of these 22 compositions for rockets (75% nitrates, 9.06% sulphur, and 15.94% charcoal) are nearly identical to the modern reported ideal recipe of 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulphur, and 15% charcoal. The text also mentions fuses, incendiary bombs, naphtha pots, fire lances, and an illustration and description of the earliest torpedo. The torpedo was called the \"egg which moves itself and burns\". Two iron sheets were fastened together and tightened using felt. The flattened, pear-shaped vessel was filled with gunpowder, metal filings, \"good mixtures\", two rods, and a large rocket for propulsion. Judging by the illustration, it was supposed to glide across the water. Fire lances were used in battles between the Muslims and Mongols in 1299 and 1303.\nAl-Hassan claims that in the Battle of Ain Jalut of 1260, the Mamluk Sultanate used \"the first cannon in history\" against the Mongols, utilizing a formula with near-identical ideal composition ratios for explosive gunpowder. Other historians urge caution regarding claims of Islamic firearms use in the 1204\u20131324 period, as late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, \"naft\", that they used for an earlier incendiary, naphtha.\nThe earliest surviving documentary evidence for cannons in the Islamic world is from an Arabic manuscript dated to the early 14th century. The author's name is uncertain but may have been Shams al-Din Muhammad, who died in 1350. Dating from around 1320\u20131350, the illustrations show gunpowder weapons such as gunpowder arrows, bombs, fire tubes, and fire lances or proto-guns. The manuscript describes a type of gunpowder weapon called a \"midfa\" which uses gunpowder to shoot projectiles out of a tube at the end of a stock. Some consider this a cannon, while others do not. The problem with identifying cannons in early 14th-century Arabic texts is the term \"midfa\", which appears from 1342 to 1352 but cannot be proven to be true hand-guns or bombards. Contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic world do not occur until 1365. Needham believes that in its original form the term \"midfa\" refers to the tube or cylinder of a naphtha projector (flamethrower). After the invention of gunpowder, it meant the tube of fire lances, and eventually it applied to the cylinder of hand-guns and cannons.\nAccording to Paul E. J. Hammer, the Mamluk Sultanate certainly used cannons by 1342. According to J. Lavin, cannons were used by Moors at the siege of Algeciras in 1343. Shihab al-Din Abu al-Abbas al-Qalqashandi described a metal cannon firing an iron ball between 1365 and 1376.\nThe musket appeared in the Ottoman Empire by 1465. In 1598, Chinese writer Zhao Shizhen described Turkish muskets as being superior to European muskets. The Chinese military work \"Wubei Zhi\" (1621) later described Turkish muskets that used a rack and pinion mechanism, which was not known to have been used in European or Chinese firearms at the time.\nThe state-controlled manufacture of gunpowder by the Ottoman Empire through early supply chains to obtain nitre, sulphur and high-quality charcoal from oaks in Anatolia contributed significantly to its expansion between the 15th and 18th centuries. It was not until later in the 19th century that the systemic production of Turkish gunpowder was reduced considerably, coinciding with the decline of its military might.\nEurope.\nThe earliest Western accounts of gunpowder appear in texts written by English philosopher Roger Bacon in 1267 called and \"Opus Tertium\". The oldest written recipes in continental Europe were recorded under the name Marcus Graecus or Mark the Greek between 1280 and 1300 in the \"Liber Ignium\", or \"Book of Fires\".\nSome sources mention possible gunpowder weapons being deployed by the Mongols against European forces at the Battle of Mohi in 1241. Professor Kenneth Warren Chase credits the Mongols for introducing into Europe gunpowder and its associated weaponry. However, there is no clear route of transmission, and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that \"there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China.\" May also states, \"however [, ...] the Mongols used the gunpowder weapon in their wars against the Jin, the Song and in their invasions of Japan.\"\nRecords show that, in England, gunpowder was being made in 1346 at the Tower of London; a powder house existed at the Tower in 1461, and in 1515 three King's gunpowder makers worked there. Gunpowder was also being made or stored at other royal castles, such as Portchester. The English Civil War (1642\u20131645) led to an expansion of the gunpowder industry, with the repeal of the Royal Patent in August 1641.\nIn late 14th century Europe, gunpowder was improved by \"corning\", the practice of drying it into small clumps to improve combustion and consistency. During this time, European manufacturers also began regularly purifying saltpeter, using wood ashes containing potassium carbonate to precipitate calcium from their dung liquor, and using ox blood, alum, and slices of turnip to clarify the solution.\nDuring the Renaissance, two European schools of pyrotechnic thought emerged, one in Italy and the other at Nuremberg, Germany. In Italy, Vannoccio Biringuccio, born in 1480, was a member of the guild \"Fraternita di Santa Barbara\" but broke with the tradition of secrecy by setting down everything he knew in a book titled \"De la pirotechnia\", written in vernacular. It was published posthumously in 1540, with nine editions over 138 years, and also reprinted by MIT Press in 1966.\nBy the mid-17th century fireworks were used for entertainment on an unprecedented scale in Europe, being popular even at resorts and public gardens. With the publication of \"Deutliche Anweisung zur Feuerwerkerey\" (1748), methods for creating fireworks were sufficiently well-known and well-described that \"Firework making has become an exact science.\" In 1774 Louis XVI ascended to the throne of France at the age of 20. After he discovered that France was not self-sufficient in gunpowder, a Gunpowder Administration was established; to head it, the lawyer Antoine Lavoisier was appointed. Although from a bourgeois family, after his degree in law Lavoisier became wealthy from a company set up to collect taxes for the Crown; this allowed him to pursue experimental natural science as a hobby.\nWithout access to cheap saltpeter (controlled by the British), for hundreds of years France had relied on saltpetremen with royal warrants, the \"droit de fouille\" or \"right to dig\", to seize nitrous-containing soil and demolish walls of barnyards, without compensation to the owners. This caused farmers, the wealthy, or entire villages to bribe the petermen and the associated bureaucracy to leave their buildings alone and the saltpeter uncollected. Lavoisier instituted a crash program to increase saltpeter production, revised (and later eliminated) the \"droit de fouille\", researched best refining and powder manufacturing methods, instituted management and record-keeping, and established pricing that encouraged private investment in works. Although saltpeter from new Prussian-style putrefaction works had not been produced yet (the process taking about 18 months), in only a year France had gunpowder to export. A chief beneficiary of this surplus was the American Revolution. By careful testing and adjusting the proportions and grinding time, powder from mills such as at Essonne outside Paris became the best in the world by 1788, and inexpensive.\nTwo British physicists, Andrew Noble and Frederick Abel, worked to improve the properties of gunpowder during the late 19th century. This formed the basis for the Noble-Abel gas equation for internal ballistics.\nThe introduction of smokeless powder in the late 19th century led to a contraction of the gunpowder industry. After the end of World War I, the majority of the British gunpowder manufacturers merged into a single company, \"Explosives Trades limited\", and a number of sites were closed down, including those in Ireland. This company became Nobel Industries Limited, and in 1926 became a founding member of Imperial Chemical Industries. The Home Office removed gunpowder from its list of \"Permitted Explosives\". Shortly afterwards, on 31 December 1931, the former Curtis &amp; Harvey's Glynneath gunpowder factory at Pontneddfechan in Wales closed down. The factory was demolished by fire in 1932. The last remaining gunpowder mill at the Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey was damaged by a German parachute mine in 1941 and it never reopened. This was followed by the closure and demolition of the gunpowder section at the Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Chorley, at the end of World War II, and of ICI Nobel's Roslin gunpowder factory which closed in 1954. This left ICI Nobel's Ardeer site in Scotland, which included a gunpowder factory, as the only factory in Great Britain producing gunpowder. The gunpowder area of the Ardeer site closed in October 1976.\nIndia.\nGunpowder and gunpowder weapons were transmitted to India through the Mongol invasions of India. The Mongols were defeated by Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, and some of the Mongol soldiers remained in northern India after their conversion to Islam. It was written in the \"Tarikh-i Firishta\" (1606\u20131607) that Nasiruddin Mahmud the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate presented the envoy of the Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan with a dazzling pyrotechnics display upon his arrival in Delhi in 1258. Nasiruddin Mahmud tried to express his strength as a ruler and tried to ward off any Mongol attempt similar to the Siege of Baghdad (1258). Firearms known as \"top-o-tufak\" also existed in many Muslim kingdoms in India by as early as 1366. From then on the employment of gunpowder warfare in India was prevalent, with events such as the \"Siege of Belgaum\" in 1473 by Sultan Muhammad Shah Bahmani.\nThe shipwrecked Ottoman Admiral Seydi Ali Reis is known to have introduced the earliest type of matchlock weapons, which the Ottomans used against the Portuguese during the Siege of Diu (1531). After that, a diverse variety of firearms, large guns in particular, became visible in Tanjore, Dacca, Bijapur, and Murshidabad. Guns made of bronze were recovered from Calicut (1504)- the former capital of the Zamorins\nThe Mughal emperor Akbar mass-produced matchlocks for the Mughal Army. Akbar is personally known to have shot a leading Rajput commander during the Siege of Chittorgarh. The Mughals began to use bamboo rockets (mainly for signalling) and employ sappers: special units that undermined heavy stone fortifications to plant gunpowder charges.\nThe Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan is known to have introduced much more advanced matchlocks, their designs were a combination of Ottoman and Mughal designs. Shah Jahan also countered the British and other Europeans in his province of Gujar\u0101t, which supplied Europe saltpeter for use in gunpowder warfare during the 17th century. Bengal and M\u0101lwa participated in saltpeter production. The Dutch, French, Portuguese, and English used Chhapra as a center of saltpeter refining.\nEver since the founding of the Sultanate of Mysore by Hyder Ali, French military officers were employed to train the Mysore Army. Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan were the first to introduce modern cannons and muskets, their army was also the first in India to have official uniforms. During the Second Anglo-Mysore War Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan unleashed the Mysorean rockets at their British opponents effectively defeating them on various occasions. The Mysorean rockets inspired the development of the Congreve rocket, which the British widely used during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.\nSoutheast Asia.\nCannons were introduced to Majapahit when Kublai Khan's Chinese army under the leadership of Ike Mese sought to invade Java in 1293. History of Yuan mentioned that the Mongol used cannons (Chinese: \u70ae\u2014\"P\u00e0o\") against Daha forces. Cannons were used by the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1352 during its invasion of the Khmer Empire. Within a decade large quantities of gunpowder could be found in the Khmer Empire. By the end of the century firearms were also used by the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty.\nEven though the knowledge of making gunpowder-based weapons was known after the failed Mongol invasion of Java, and the predecessor of firearms, the pole gun (bedil tombak), is recorded as being used by Java in 1413, the knowledge of making \"true\" firearms came much later, after the middle of the 15th century. It was brought by the Islamic nations of West Asia, most probably the Arabs. The precise year of introduction is unknown, but it may be safely concluded to be no earlier than 1460. Before the arrival of the Portuguese in Southeast Asia, the natives already possessed primitive firearms, the Java arquebus. Portuguese influence to local weaponry after the capture of Malacca (1511) resulted in a new type of hybrid tradition matchlock firearm, the istinggar.\nWhen the Portuguese came to the archipelago, they referred to the breech-loading swivel gun as \"ber\u00e7o\", while the Spaniards call it \"verso\". By the early 16th century, the Javanese already locally producing large guns, some of them still survived until the present day and dubbed as \"sacred cannon\" or \"holy cannon\". These cannons varied between 180- and 260-pounders, weighing anywhere between 3 and 8 tons, length of them between 3 and 6\u00a0m.\nSaltpeter harvesting was recorded by Dutch and German travelers as being common in even the smallest villages and was collected from the decomposition process of large dung hills specifically piled for the purpose. The Dutch punishment for possession of non-permitted gunpowder appears to have been amputation. Ownership and manufacture of gunpowder was later prohibited by the colonial Dutch occupiers. According to colonel McKenzie quoted in Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles', \"The History of Java\" (1817), the purest sulfur was supplied from a crater from a mountain near the straits of Bali.\nHistoriography.\nOn the origins of gunpowder technology, historian Tonio Andrade remarked, \"Scholars today overwhelmingly concur that the gun was invented in China.\" Gunpowder and the gun are widely believed by historians to have originated from China due to the large body of evidence that documents the evolution of gunpowder from a medicine to an incendiary and explosive, and the evolution of the gun from the fire lance to a metal gun, whereas similar records do not exist elsewhere. As Andrade explains, the large amount of variation in gunpowder recipes in China relative to Europe is \"evidence of experimentation in China, where gunpowder was at first used as an incendiary and only later became an explosive and a propellant... in contrast, formulas in Europe diverged only very slightly from the ideal proportions for use as an explosive and a propellant, suggesting that gunpowder was introduced as a mature technology.\"\nHowever, the history of gunpowder is not without controversy. A major problem confronting the study of early gunpowder history is ready access to sources close to the events described. Often the first records potentially describing use of gunpowder in warfare were written several centuries after the fact, and may well have been colored by the contemporary experiences of the chronicler. Translation difficulties have led to errors or loose interpretations bordering on artistic licence. Ambiguous language can make it difficult to distinguish gunpowder weapons from similar technologies that do not rely on gunpowder. A commonly cited example is a report of the Battle of Mohi in Eastern Europe that mentions a \"long lance\" sending forth \"evil-smelling vapors and smoke\", which has been variously interpreted by different historians as the \"first-gas attack upon European soil\" using gunpowder, \"the first use of cannon in Europe\", or merely a \"toxic gas\" with no evidence of gunpowder. It is difficult to accurately translate original Chinese alchemical texts, which tend to explain phenomena through metaphor, into modern scientific language with rigidly defined terminology in English. Early texts potentially mentioning gunpowder are sometimes marked by a linguistic process where semantic change occurred. For instance, the Arabic word \"naft\" transitioned from denoting naphtha to denoting gunpowder, and the Chinese word \"p\u00e0o\" changed in meaning from trebuchet to a cannon. This has led to arguments on the exact origins of gunpowder based on etymological foundations. Science and technology historian Bert S. Hall makes the observation that, \"It goes without saying, however, that historians bent on special pleading, or simply with axes of their own to grind, can find rich material in these terminological thickets.\"\nAnother major area of contention in modern studies of the history of gunpowder is regarding the transmission of gunpowder. While the literary and archaeological evidence supports a Chinese origin for gunpowder and guns, the manner in which gunpowder technology was transferred from China to the West is still under debate. It is unknown why the rapid spread of gunpowder technology across Eurasia took place over several decades whereas other technologies such as paper, the compass, and printing did not reach Europe until centuries after they were invented in China.\nComponents.\nGunpowder is a granular mixture of:\nPotassium nitrate is the most important ingredient in terms of both bulk and function because the combustion process releases oxygen from the potassium nitrate, promoting the rapid burning of the other ingredients. To reduce the likelihood of accidental ignition by static electricity, the granules of modern gunpowder are typically coated with graphite, which prevents the build-up of electrostatic charge.\nCharcoal does not consist of pure carbon; rather, it consists of partially pyrolyzed cellulose, in which the wood is not completely decomposed. Carbon differs from ordinary charcoal. Whereas charcoal's autoignition temperature is relatively low, carbon's is much greater. Thus, a gunpowder composition containing pure carbon would burn similarly to a match head, at best.\nThe current standard composition for the gunpowder manufactured by pyrotechnicians was adopted as long ago as 1780. Proportions by weight are 75% potassium nitrate (known as saltpeter or saltpetre), 15% softwood charcoal, and 10% sulfur. These ratios have varied over the centuries and by country, and can be altered somewhat depending on the purpose of the powder. For instance, power grades of black powder, unsuitable for use in firearms but adequate for blasting rock in quarrying operations, are called blasting powder rather than gunpowder with standard proportions of 70% nitrate, 14% charcoal, and 16% sulfur; blasting powder may be made with the cheaper sodium nitrate substituted for potassium nitrate and proportions may be as low as 40% nitrate, 30% charcoal, and 30% sulfur. In 1857, Lammot du Pont solved the main problem of using cheaper sodium nitrate formulations when he patented DuPont \"B\" blasting powder. After manufacturing grains from press-cake in the usual way, his process tumbled the powder with graphite dust for 12 hours. This formed a graphite coating on each grain that reduced its ability to absorb moisture.\nNeither the use of graphite nor sodium nitrate was new. Glossing gunpowder corns with graphite was already an accepted technique in 1839, and sodium nitrate-based blasting powder had been made in Peru for many years using the sodium nitrate mined at Tarapac\u00e1 (now in Chile). Also, in 1846, two plants were built in south-west England to make blasting powder using this sodium nitrate. The idea may well have been brought from Peru by Cornish miners returning home after completing their contracts. Another suggestion is that it was William Lobb, the plant collector, who recognised the possibilities of sodium nitrate during his travels in South America. Lammot du Pont would have known about the use of graphite, and probably also knew about the plants in south-west England. In his patent he was careful to state that his claim was for the combination of graphite with sodium nitrate\u2013based powder, rather than for either of the two individual technologies.\nFrench war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 12.5% charcoal, 12.5% sulfur. English war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur. The British Congreve rockets used 62.4% saltpeter, 23.2% charcoal and 14.4% sulfur, but the British Mark VII gunpowder was changed to 65% saltpeter, 20% charcoal and 15% sulfur. The explanation for the wide variety in formulation relates to usage. Powder used for rocketry can use a slower burn rate since it accelerates the projectile for a much longer time\u2014whereas powders for weapons such as flintlocks, cap-locks, or matchlocks need a higher burn rate to accelerate the projectile in a much shorter distance. Cannons usually used lower burn-rate powders, because most would burst with higher burn-rate powders.\nOther compositions.\nBesides black powder, there are other historically important types of gunpowder. \"Brown gunpowder\" is cited as composed of 79% nitre, 3% sulfur, and 18% charcoal per 100 of dry powder, with about 2% moisture. Prismatic Brown Powder is a large-grained product that the Rottweil Company introduced in 1884 in Germany, which was adopted by the British Royal Navy shortly thereafter. The French navy adopted a fine, 3.1 millimeter, not prismatic grained product called \"Slow Burning Cocoa\" (SBC) or \"cocoa powder\". These brown powders reduced burning rate even further by using as little as 2 percent sulfur and using charcoal made from rye straw that had not been completely charred, hence the brown color.\nLesmok powder was a product developed by DuPont in 1911, one of several semi-smokeless products in the industry containing a mixture of black and nitrocellulose powder. It was sold to Winchester and others primarily for .22 and .32 small calibers. Its advantage was that it was believed at the time to be less corrosive than smokeless powders then in use. It was not understood in the U.S. until the 1920s that the actual source of corrosion was the potassium chloride residue from potassium chlorate sensitized primers. The bulkier black powder fouling better disperses primer residue. Failure to mitigate primer corrosion by dispersion caused the false impression that nitrocellulose-based powder caused corrosion. Lesmok had some of the bulk of black powder for dispersing primer residue, but somewhat less total bulk than straight black powder, thus requiring less frequent bore cleaning. It was last sold by Winchester in 1947.\nSulfur-free powders.\nThe development of smokeless powders, such as cordite, in the late 19th century created the need for a spark-sensitive priming charge, such as gunpowder. However, the sulfur content of traditional gunpowders caused corrosion problems with Cordite Mk I and this led to the introduction of a range of sulfur-free gunpowders, of varying grain sizes. They typically contain 70.5% of saltpeter and 29.5% of charcoal. Like black powder, they were produced in different grain sizes. In the United Kingdom, the finest grain was known as \"sulfur-free mealed powder\" (\"SMP\"). Coarser grains were numbered as sulfur-free gunpowder (SFG n): 'SFG 12', 'SFG 20', 'SFG 40' and 'SFG 90', for example where the number represents the smallest BSS sieve mesh size, which retained no grains.\nSulfur's main role in gunpowder is to decrease the ignition temperature. A sample reaction for sulfur-free gunpowder would be:\n&lt;chem&gt;6 KNO3 + C7H4O -&gt; 3 K2CO3 + 4 CO2 + 2 H2O + 3 N2&lt;/chem&gt;\nSmokeless powders.\nThe term \"black powder\" was coined in the late 19th century, primarily in the United States, to distinguish prior gunpowder formulations from the new smokeless powders and semi-smokeless powders. Semi-smokeless powders featured bulk volume properties that approximated black powder, but had significantly reduced amounts of smoke and combustion products. Smokeless powder has different burning properties (pressure vs. time) and can generate higher pressures and work per gram. This can rupture older weapons designed for black powder. Smokeless powders ranged in color from brownish tan to yellow to white. Most of the bulk semi-smokeless powders ceased to be manufactured in the 1920s.\nGranularity.\nSerpentine.\nThe original dry-compounded powder used in 15th-century Europe was known as \"Serpentine\", either a reference to Satan or to a common artillery piece that used it. The ingredients were ground together with a mortar and pestle, perhaps for 24 hours, resulting in a fine flour. Vibration during transportation could cause the components to separate again, requiring remixing in the field. Also, if the quality of the saltpeter was low (for instance if it was contaminated with highly hygroscopic calcium nitrate), or if the powder was simply old (due to the mildly hygroscopic nature of potassium nitrate), in humid weather it would need to be re-dried. The dust from \"repairing\" powder in the field was a major hazard.\nLoading cannons or bombards before the powder-making advances of the Renaissance was a skilled art. Fine powder loaded haphazardly or too tightly would burn incompletely or too slowly. Typically, the breech-loading powder chamber in the rear of the piece was filled only about half full, the serpentine powder neither too compressed nor too loose, a wooden bung pounded in to seal the chamber from the barrel when assembled, and the projectile placed on. A carefully determined empty space was necessary for the charge to burn effectively. When the cannon was fired through the touchhole, turbulence from the initial surface combustion caused the rest of the powder to be rapidly exposed to the flame.\nThe advent of much more powerful and easy to use \"corned\" powder changed this procedure, but serpentine was used with older guns into the 17th century.\nCorning.\nFor propellants to oxidize and burn rapidly and effectively, the combustible ingredients must be reduced to the smallest possible particle sizes, and be as thoroughly mixed as possible. Once mixed, however, for better results in a gun, makers discovered that the final product should be in the form of individual dense grains that spread the fire quickly from grain to grain, much as straw or twigs catch fire more quickly than a pile of sawdust.\nIn late 14th century Europe and China, gunpowder was improved by wet grinding; liquid such as distilled spirits were added during the grinding-together of the ingredients and the moist paste dried afterwards. The principle of wet mixing to prevent the separation of dry ingredients, invented for gunpowder, is used today in the pharmaceutical industry. It was discovered that if the paste was rolled into balls before drying the resulting gunpowder absorbed less water from the air during storage and traveled better. The balls were then crushed in a mortar by the gunner immediately before use, with the old problem of uneven particle size and packing causing unpredictable results. If the right size particles were chosen, however, the result was a great improvement in power. Forming the damp paste into \"corn\"-sized clumps by hand or with the use of a sieve instead of larger balls produced a product after drying that loaded much better, as each tiny piece provided its own surrounding air space that allowed much more rapid combustion than a fine powder. This \"corned\" gunpowder was from 30% to 300% more powerful. An example is cited where of serpentine was needed to shoot a ball, but only of corned powder.\nBecause the dry powdered ingredients must be mixed and bonded together for extrusion and cut into grains to maintain the blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. After 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp \"mill-cake\" was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming \"press-cake\". The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity. The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small hand guns and priming. Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure. \"Mammoth\" powder with large grains, made for Rodman's 15-inch cannon, reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.\nIn the mid-19th century, measurements were made determining that the burning rate within a grain of black powder (or a tightly packed mass) is about 6\u00a0cm/s (0.20 feet/s), while the rate of ignition propagation from grain to grain is around 9\u00a0m/s (30 feet/s), over two orders of magnitude faster.\nModern types.\nModern corning first compresses the fine black powder meal into blocks with a fixed density (1.7\u00a0g/cm3). In the United States, gunpowder grains were designated F (for fine) or C (for coarse). Grain diameter decreased with a larger number of Fs and increased with a larger number of Cs, ranging from about for 7F to for 7C. Even larger grains were produced for artillery bore diameters greater than about . The standard DuPont \"Mammoth\" powder developed by Thomas Rodman and Lammot du Pont for use during the American Civil War had grains averaging in diameter with edges rounded in a glazing barrel. Other versions had grains the size of golf and tennis balls for use in Rodman guns. In 1875 DuPont introduced \"Hexagonal\" powder for large artillery, which was pressed using shaped plates with a small center core\u2014about diameter, like a wagon wheel nut, the center hole widened as the grain burned. By 1882 German makers also produced hexagonal grained powders of a similar size for artillery.\nBy the late 19th century manufacturing focused on standard grades of black powder from Fg used in large bore rifles and shotguns, through FFg (medium and small-bore arms such as muskets and fusils), FFFg (small-bore rifles and pistols), and FFFFg (extreme small bore, short pistols and most commonly for priming flintlocks). A coarser grade for use in military artillery blanks was designated A-1. These grades were sorted on a system of screens with oversize retained on a mesh of 6 wires per inch, A-1 retained on 10 wires per inch, Fg retained on 14, FFg on 24, FFFg on 46, and FFFFg on 60. Fines designated FFFFFg were usually reprocessed to minimize explosive dust hazards. In the United Kingdom the main service gunpowders were classified RFG (rifle grained fine) with diameter of one or two millimeters and RLG (rifle grained large) for grain diameters between two and six millimeters. Gunpowder grains can alternatively be categorized by mesh size: the BSS sieve mesh size, being the smallest mesh size, which retains no grains. Recognized grain sizes are Gunpowder G 7, G 20, G 40, and G 90.\nOwing to the large market of antique and replica black-powder firearms in the US, modern black powder substitutes like Pyrodex, Triple Seven and Black Mag3 pellets have been developed since the 1970s. These products, which should not be confused with smokeless powders, aim to produce less fouling (solid residue), while maintaining the traditional volumetric measurement system for charges. Claims of less corrosiveness of these products have been controversial however. New cleaning products for black-powder guns have also been developed for this market.\nChemistry.\nA simple, commonly cited, chemical equation for the combustion of gunpowder is:\n 2 KNO3 + S + 3 C \u2192 K2S + N2 + 3 CO2.\nA balanced, but still simplified, equation is:\n 10 KNO3 + 3 S + 8 C \u2192 2 K2CO3 + 3 K2SO4 + 6 CO2 + 5 N2.\nThe exact percentages of ingredients varied greatly through the medieval period as the recipes were developed by trial and error, and needed to be updated for changing military technology.\nGunpowder does not burn as a single reaction, so the byproducts are not easily predicted. One study showed that it produced (in order of descending quantities) 55.91% solid products: potassium carbonate, potassium sulfate, potassium sulfide, sulfur, potassium nitrate, potassium thiocyanate, carbon, ammonium carbonate and 42.98% gaseous products: carbon dioxide, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, methane, 1.11% water.\nGunpowder made with less-expensive and more plentiful sodium nitrate instead of potassium nitrate (in appropriate proportions) works just as well. Gunpowder releases 3 megajoules per kilogram and contains its own oxidant. This is less than TNT (4.7 megajoules per kilogram), or gasoline (47.2 megajoules per kilogram in combustion, but gasoline requires an oxidant; for instance, an optimized gasoline and O2 mixture releases 10.4 megajoules per kilogram, taking into account the mass of the oxygen).\nGunpowder also has a low energy density[] compared to modern \"smokeless\" powders, and thus to achieve high energy loadings, large amounts are needed with heavy projectiles.\nProduction.\nFor the most powerful black powder, meal powder, a wood charcoal is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood was used by the American Confederate States. The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating ball mill principle with non-sparking bronze or lead. Historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. The mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic pores of the very high surface-area charcoal.\nAround the late 14th century, European powdermakers first began adding liquid during grinding to improve mixing, reduce dust, and with it the risk of explosion. The powder-makers would then shape the resulting paste of dampened gunpowder, known as mill cake, into corns, or grains, to dry. Not only did corned powder keep better because of its reduced surface area, gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. Before long, powder-makers standardized the process by forcing mill cake through sieves instead of corning powder by hand.\nThe improvement was based on reducing the surface area of a higher density composition. At the beginning of the 19th century, makers increased density further by static pressing. They shoveled damp mill cake into a two-foot square box, placed this beneath a screw press and reduced it to half its volume. \"Press cake\" had the hardness of slate. They broke the dried slabs with hammers or rollers, and sorted the granules with sieves into different grades. In the United States, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, who had learned the trade from Lavoisier, tumbled the dried grains in rotating barrels to round the edges and increase durability during shipping and handling. (Sharp grains rounded off in transport, producing fine \"meal dust\" that changed the burning properties.)\nAnother advance was the manufacture of kiln charcoal by distilling wood in heated iron retorts instead of burning it in earthen pits. Controlling the temperature influenced the power and consistency of the finished gunpowder. In 1863, in response to high prices for Indian saltpeter, DuPont chemists developed a process using potash or mined potassium chloride to convert plentiful Chilean sodium nitrate to potassium nitrate.\nThe following year (1864) the Gatebeck Low Gunpowder Works in Cumbria (Great Britain) started a plant to manufacture potassium nitrate by essentially the same chemical process. This is nowadays called the 'Wakefield Process', after the owners of the company. It would have used potassium chloride from the Sta\u00dffurt mines, near Magdeburg, Germany, which had recently become available in industrial quantities.\nDuring the 18th century, gunpowder factories became increasingly dependent on mechanical energy. Despite mechanization, production difficulties related to humidity control, especially during the pressing, were still present in the late 19th century. A paper from 1885 laments that \"Gunpowder is such a nervous and sensitive spirit, that in almost every process of manufacture it changes under our hands as the weather changes.\" Pressing times to the desired density could vary by a factor of three depending on the atmospheric humidity.\nLegal status.\nThe United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and national transportation authorities, such as United States Department of Transportation, have classified gunpowder (black powder) as a \"Group A: Primary explosive substance\" for shipment as it ignites easily. Complete manufactured devices containing black powder are usually classified as \"Group D: Secondary detonating substance, or black powder, or article containing secondary detonating substance\", such as firework, class D model rocket engine, etc., for shipment because they are harder to ignite than loose powder. As explosives, they all fall into the category of Class 1.\nOther uses.\nBesides its use as a propellant in firearms and artillery, black powder's other main use has been as a blasting powder in quarrying, mining, and road construction (including railroad construction). During the 19th century, outside of war emergencies such as the Crimean War or the American Civil War, more black powder was used in these industrial uses than in firearms and artillery. Dynamite gradually replaced it for those uses. Today, industrial explosives for such uses are still a huge market, but most of the market is in newer explosives rather than black powder.\nBeginning in the 1930s, gunpowder or smokeless powder was used in rivet guns, stun guns for animals, cable splicers and other industrial construction tools. The \"stud gun\", a powder-actuated tool, drove nails or screws into solid concrete, a function not possible with hydraulic tools, and today is still an important part of various industries, but the cartridges usually use smokeless powders. Industrial shotguns have been used to eliminate persistent material rings in operating rotary kilns (such as those for cement, lime, phosphate, etc.) and clinker in operating furnaces, and commercial tools make the method more reliable.\nGunpowder has occasionally been employed for other purposes besides weapons, mining, fireworks and construction:\nGunpowder had originally been produced for medicinal purposes. It was eaten, in the expectation of curing digestive ailments; inhaled, for respiratory disorders; and, as mentioned, rubbed onto skin level disorders like rashes or burns.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the 1970s, Kildall created the operating system CP/M among other operating systems and programming tools, and subsequently founded Digital Research, Inc. to market and sell his software products. He is considered a pioneer of the personal computer revolution.\nIn 1974 in Pacific Grove, California, Kildall demonstrated the first working prototype of CP/M, which would later become the dominant operating system for microcomputers for a time. Together with his invention of the BIOS (Basic Input Output System), his operating system allowed a microprocessor-based computer to communicate with disk storage. Kildall was among the earliest individuals to recognize microprocessors as fully capable computers. During the 1980s, Kildall also appeared on PBS as co-host of \"Computer Chronicles\", a weekly informational program that discussed the latest developments in personal computing.\nEarly life.\nGary Kildall was born and grew up in Seattle, Washington, where his family operated a seamanship school. His father, Joseph Kildall, was a captain of Norwegian heritage. His mother Emma was of half Swedish ancestry, as Kildall's grandmother was born in L\u00e5ngb\u00e4ck, Sweden, in Skellefte\u00e5 Municipality, but emigrated to Canada at 23 years of age.\nEducation.\nKildall earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1967 and a master's degree in Computer Science in 1968, both from the University of Washington. At one time, he had hoped to become a mathematics teacher. During his studies, Kildall became increasingly interested in computer technology and enrolled to attain a Ph.D. in Computer Science.\nKildall fulfilled his draft obligation by teaching at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.\nKildall briefly returned to UW and finished his doctorate in computer science in 1972.\nIntel lent him systems using the 8008 and 8080 processors, and in 1973, he developed the first high-level programming language for microprocessors, named PL/M. For Intel he also wrote 8008 and 8080 instruction set simulators named INTERP/8 and INTERP/80. He created the operating system CP/M the same year to enable the 8080 to control a floppy disk drive, combining for the first time all the essential components of a computer at the microcomputer scale. He demonstrated CP/M to Intel, but Intel had little interest and chose to market PL/M instead.\nBusiness career.\nCP/M.\nIn 1973 Kildall and Kathryn Strutynski developed the language PL/M to produce CP/M, one of the first operating systems for personal computers.They used as reference their experience with the IBM mainframe computers and the operating system VM.\nKildall and his wife Dorothy established a company, originally named \"Intergalactic Digital Research\" (later renamed as Digital Research, Inc.), to market the operating system CP/M by advertisements in hobbyist magazines. Digital Research licensed CP/M for the IMSAI 8080, a popular clone of the Altair 8800. As more manufacturers licensed CP/M, it became a de facto standard and had to support an increasing number of hardware variations. In response, Kildall pioneered the concept of a BIOS, a set of simple programs stored in computer hardware (ROM or EPROM microprocessor) that enabled CP/M to operate on different systems without modification.\nCP/M's quick success surprised Kildall, and he was slow to update it for high density floppy disks and hard disk drives. After hardware manufacturers discussed creating a rival operating system, Kildall started a rush project to develop CP/M 2. By 1981, at the peak of its popularity, CP/M operated on different computer models and DRI had \u00a0million in yearly revenues.\nBetween 1983 and 1984, Digital Research offered several of their business and educational applications for the IBM PC on bootable floppy diskettes bundled with SpeedStart CP/M, a reduced version of CP/M-86 as a bootable runtime environment.\nIBM dealings.\nIBM approached Digital Research in 1980, at Bill Gates' suggestion, to negotiate the purchase of a forthcoming version of CP/M named CP/M-86 for the IBM PC. Gary had left initial negotiations to his wife, Dorothy, as he usually did, while he and Tom Rolander, a colleague and developer of the operating system MP/M, used Gary's private aeroplane to deliver software to manufacturer Bill Godbout. Before the IBM representatives would explain the purpose of their visit, they insisted that Dorothy sign a non-disclosure agreement. On the advice of DRI attorney Gerry Davis, Dorothy refused to sign the agreement without Gary's approval. Gary returned in the afternoon and tried to resume the discussion with IBM; accounts disagree on whether he signed the non-disclosure agreement, as well as whether he ever met with the IBM representatives.\nVarious reasons have been given for the two companies failing to reach an agreement. DRI, which had only a few products, might have been unwilling to sell its main product to IBM for a one-time payment rather than its usual royalty-based plan. Dorothy might have believed that the company could not deliver CP/M-86 on IBM's proposed schedule, as the company was busy developing an implementation of the PL/I programming language for Data General. Also possible, the IBM representatives might have been annoyed that DRI had spent hours on what they considered a routine formality. According to Kildall, the IBM representatives took the same flight to Florida that night that he and Dorothy took for their vacation, and they negotiated further on the flight, reaching a handshake agreement. IBM main negotiator Jack Sams insisted that he never met Gary, and one IBM colleague has confirmed that Sams said so at the time. He accepted that someone else in his group might have been on the same flight, and noted that he flew back to Seattle to talk with Microsoft again.\nSams related the story to Gates, who had already agreed to provide a BASIC interpreter and several other programs for the PC. Gates' impression of the story was that Gary capriciously \"went flying\", as he would later tell reporters. Sams left Gates with the task of finding a usable operating system, and a few weeks later he proposed using the operating system 86-DOS\u2014 an independently developed operating system that implemented Kildall's CP/M application programming interface\u2014 from Seattle Computer Products (SCP). Paul Allen negotiated a licensing deal with SCP. Allen had 86-DOS adapted for IBM's hardware, and IBM shipped it as IBM PC\u00a0DOS.\nKildall obtained a copy of PC\u00a0DOS, examined it, and concluded that it infringed on CP/M. When he asked Gerry Davis what legal options were available, Davis told him that intellectual property law for software was not clear enough to sue. Instead Kildall only threatened IBM with legal action, and IBM responded with a proposal to offer CP/M-86 as an option for the PC in return for a release of liability. Kildall accepted, believing that IBM's new system (like its previous personal computers) would not be a significant commercial success. When the IBM PC was introduced, IBM sold its operating system as an unbundled option. One of the operating system options was PC\u00a0DOS, priced at . PC\u00a0DOS was seen as a practically necessary option; most software required it and without it the IBM PC was limited to its built-in Cassette BASIC. CP/M-86 shipped a few months later six times more expensive at , and sold poorly against DOS and enjoyed far less software support.\nMulti-Programming Monitor Control Program (MP/M).\nWith the loss of the IBM deal, Gary and Dorothy were pressured to bring in more experienced management, and Gary's influence over the company waned. He worked in various experimental and research projects, such as a version of CP/M with multitasking (MP/M), created by Digital Research developer Tom Rolander in 1979. Kildall also worked on an implementation of the Logo programming language. He hoped that Logo, an educational dialect of LISP, would supplant BASIC in education, but it did not.\nFlexOS.\nIn 1985 Digital Research developed FlexOS, a modular real-time multiuser multitasking operating system (RTOS).\nGraphics Environment Manager (GEM).\nAfter seeing a demonstration of the Apple Lisa, Kildall oversaw the creation of DRI's own graphical user interface, named Graphics Environment Manager (GEM), which was introduced on February 28, 1985. Novell acquired DRI in 1991 in a deal that netted millions for Kildall.\nKildall resigned as CEO of Digital Research on 28 June 1985, but remained chairman of the board.\nComputer Chronicles.\nKildall co-hosted a public television program produced by PBS named \"Computer Chronicles\". It discussed trends in personal computing. Gary co-hosted the program for seven years during the first eight seasons from 1983 to 1990. After this time the program continued through its 19th season, with the last episode broadcast on June 25, 2002.\nActiventure.\nIn 1984 Gary started another company, \"Activenture\", which adapted optical disc technology for computer use, using as reference the Red Book developed by Sony and Phillips in 1980. In 1985 the CD-ROM was presented by Philips and Sony, the same year Activenture was renamed \"KnowledgeSet\".\nThe Electronic Encyclopedia.\nIn June 1985 Digital Research released \"The Electronic Encyclopedia\", a CD-ROM version of Grolier's \"Academic American Encyclopedia\". The first computer encyclopedia, it included pictures in 1990 and added audio and videos in 1992. The encyclopedia was acquired by Banta Corporation; its last CD-ROM version was published in 2003. \nPrometheus Light and Sound (PLS).\nKildall's final business venture, known as \"Prometheus Light and Sound\" (PLS) and based in Austin, Texas, developed a modular PBX communication system that integrated land-line telephones with mobile phones (called \"Intelliphone\") to reduce the then-high online costs and to remotely connect with home appliances.\nPrometheus Light and Sound system included a UUCP-based store and forward system to exchange emails and files between the various nodes and was planned to include TCP/IP support at a later time.\nComputer Animation.\nAccording to Brian Halla, Intel's technical liaison to Digital Research in the 1970s, Gary Kildall showed him a VAX 11/780 running in his house generating a Coke bottle spinning. According to Halla, Kildall sold it a few months later to Pixar.\n\"Computer Connections\".\nIn 1992, Kildall was invited to the University of Washington computer science program's 25th anniversary event. As a distinguished graduate of the program, Kildall was disappointed when asked to attend simply as an audience member. He also took offense at the decision to have the main speech done by Bill Gates, a Harvard University dropout who had donated to UW, but had never attended.\nIn response, Kildall began writing a memoir, entitled \"Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry\". The memoir, which Kildall sought to publish, expressed his frustration that people did not seem to value elegance in computer software. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDon't think for a minute that [Bill] Gates made it 'big time' because of his technical savvy.\nGary Kildall, \"Computer Connections\"\nWriting about Bill Gates, Kildall described him as \"more of an opportunist than a technical type, and severely opinionated, even when the opinion he holds is absurd\".\nIn an appendix, he termed DOS \"plain and simple theft\" because its first 26 system calls worked the same as CP/M's. He accused IBM of contriving the price difference between PC\u00a0DOS and CP/M-86 in order to marginalize CP/M.\nKildall had completed a rough draft of the manuscript by the end of 1993, but the full text remains unpublished. Journalist Harold Evans used the memoir as a primary source for a chapter about Kildall in the 2004 book \"They Made America\", concluding that Microsoft had robbed Kildall of his inventions. IBM veterans from the PC project disputed the book's description of events, and Microsoft described it as \"one-sided and inaccurate\".\nIn August 2016, Kildall's family made the first seven chapters of \"Computer Connections\" available as a free public download.\nPersonal life.\nKildall self-described as a \"greaser\" during high school, and his colleagues recall him as creative, easygoing, and adventurous. In addition to flying, he loved sports cars, auto racing, and boating, and had a lifelong love of the sea.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n I think I\u2019ll make a cassette tape of the \u2018IBM Flying Story.\u2019 I\u2019ll carry a few copies in my jacket to give out on occasion. There\u2019s only one problem. I [will] tell this story [to someone], and after I\u2019m done, the same person [will say], \u2018Yeah, but did you go flying and blow IBM off?\u2019\nGary Kildall, \"Computer Connections\"\nAlthough Kildall preferred to leave the IBM affair in the past and to be known for his work before and afterward, there were continual comparisons between himself and Bill Gates, as well as fading memories of his contributions. A legend grew around the fateful IBM-DRI meeting, encouraged by Gates and various journalists, suggesting that Kildall had irresponsibly taken the day off for a recreational flight.\nIn later years, Kildall privately expressed bitter feelings about being overshadowed by Microsoft, and began suffering from alcoholism.\nSelling DRI to Novell had made Kildall a wealthy man, and he relocated to the West Lake Hills suburb of Austin. His Austin house was a lakeside property, with stalls for several sports cars, and a video studio in the basement. Kildall owned and flew his own Learjet and had at least one boat on the lake. While in Austin he also participated in volunteer efforts to assist children with HIV/AIDS. He also owned a mansion with a panoramic ocean view in Pebble Beach, California, near the headquarters of DRI.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn July 8, 1994, at the age of 52, Kildall sustained a head injury at the Franklin Street Bar &amp; Grill, a biker bar in Monterey, California. The exact circumstances of the injury are unclear. Various sources have claimed he fell from a chair, fell down steps, or was assaulted because he had entered the establishment wearing Harley-Davidson leathers. Harold Evans, in \"They Made America\", states that Kildall \"stumbled and hit his head\" inside the premises, and \"was found on the floor\".\nAfter the injury, Kildall was discharged from a hospital twice. He was pronounced dead at the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, on July 11, 1994. An autopsy, performed on July 12, did not conclusively determine the cause of death. Evans states that Kildall's head injury triggered a cerebral hemorrhage, causing a blood clot to form inside the skull. A CP/M Usenet FAQ states that Kildall was concussed due to his injury, and died of heart failure; the relation between the two is unclear. Medical evidence of chronic alcoholism was found during the autopsy.\nInitial news reports and police investigation considered Kildall's death as a possible homicide. According to the coroner's report, Kildall's fatal injury may have occurred \"as a result of foul play,\" and the case was referred to the Monterey Police Department. \"We're going to investigate it as a possible homicide,\" said police Sgt. Frank Sollecito. \"I'm not going to flat-out say it's a homicide\".\nKildall's body was cremated. His remains were buried in Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park, in north Seattle.\nRecognition.\nAfter the announcement of Kildall's death, Bill Gates commented that he was \"one of the original pioneers of the PC revolution\" and \"a very creative computer scientist who did excellent work. Although we were competitors, I always had tremendous respect for his contributions to the PC industry. His untimely death was very unfortunate and his work will be missed.\"\nStewart Cheifet, his co-host on \"Computer Chronicles\", said that Kildall was his \"favorite guy\" and praised his skills and contributions to the development of personal computing. Cheifet also commented: \"Gary's problem was that he was too much of a gentleman. He wasn't a killer business kind of guy\", adding that he was \"a decent man in a business that was hard to succeed in if you were decent.\"\nIn March 1995, Kildall was honored posthumously by the Software Publishers Association (SPA) for his contributions to the microcomputer industry:\nIn April 2014, the city of Pacific Grove installed a commemorative plaque outside Kildall's former residence, which also served as the early headquarters of Digital Research.\nIn popular culture.\nSteve Hauk wrote a play \"A Mild Concussion\". Later, with Stewart Cheifet, a second version of the play was written under the title \"The Forgotten Computer Genius\". The play looks at the final days of a computer genius.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nVideo"}
{"id": "12741", "revid": "50803158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12741", "title": "Gesta Danorum", "text": "12th-century work of Danish history\n (\"Deeds of the Danes\") is a patriotic work of Danish history, by the 12th-century author Saxo Grammaticus (\"Saxo the Literate\", literally \"the Grammarian\"). It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of medieval Denmark and is an essential source for the nation's early history. It is also one of the oldest known written documents about the history of Estonia and Latvia.\nConsisting of sixteen books written in Latin on the invitation of Archbishop Absalon, describes Danish history and to some degree Scandinavian history in general, from prehistory to the late 12th century. In addition, offers singular reflections on European affairs in the High Middle Ages from a unique Scandinavian perspective, supplementing what has been handed down by historians from Western and Southern Europe.\nBooks.\nThe sixteen books, in prose with an occasional excursion into poetry, can be categorized into two parts: Books 1\u20139, which deal with Norse mythology and semi-legendary Danish history, and Books 10\u201316, which deal with medieval history. Book 9 ends with Gorm the Old. The last three books (14\u201316), which describe Danish conquests on the south shore of the Baltic Sea and wars against Slavic peoples (the Northern Crusades), are very valuable for the history of West Slavic tribes (Polabian Slavs, Pomeranians) and Slavic paganism. Book 14 contains a unique description of the temple on the island of R\u00fcgen.\nOverview.\nBook 1.\nThe first book is mostly Saxo's original work, sharing little with other primary works, but taking some inspiration from Ancient Greek epics. It very briefly covers the rule of the eponymous founder of the Danish nation, Dan, but also his brother Angul, his sons Humble and Lother, and Dan's grandson, Skiold, whose son, Gram is the first Danish king to be given some detail, his reign revolves around conquering Sweden and Finland, only to die in a battle. Most of the book deals with the adventures of Hading, the son of Gram and Finnish princess, Signe. Here the adventure concerns the loss of Denmark to the Swedes as well as Hading's attempts to reclaim it with the help of giants and Odin. The book concludes with Hading's suicide after hearing of his friend's death.\nBook 2.\nBook 2 follows adventures of Hading's descendants, who perform cunning raids across the Baltic Sea and far as England, while encountering many supernatural events and being forced to solve disputes via single combat. This book includes the stories of kings Helge and Rolf Krake, which are also told in \"Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka\".\nBook 3.\nBook 3 begins with the story of a Swedish prince, Hother, in an alternate version of the story of H\u00f6\u00f0r and the death of the god Baldr (here presented as a false god named Balderus). Hother eventually does become King in Denmark after the deaths of Rolf Krake and his usurper Hiartuar.\nThe second half of the book introduces Amleth, as a grandson of the Danish king Rorik. Amleth's father was murdered by his uncle, the governor of Jylland. Amleth pretends to be a fool in fear of his uncle who has married his mother. He is sent to Britain by his uncle to be put to death, but secretly rewrites the death warrant and instead marries the daughter of the king. Then he returns to Denmark and kills his uncle. This story was later told by Shakespeare as \"Hamlet\".\nBook 4.\nAfter killing his uncle and securing the support of his people in doing so, Amleth returns to Britain. His father-in-law sends him to woo (on the King's behalf) the Scottish Queen Hermutrude, who is famous for murdering all her suitors. However, Hermutrude refuses to marry the King and instead marries Amleth, making the King into Amleth's enemy. Amleth is killed by the new King of Denmark, Wiglek, who then marries Hermutrude. Many subsequent kings follow.\nBook 5.\nBook 5 covers the life of just a single king, Frotho III, and focuses on his empire-building and the exploits of his brilliant Norwegian advisor, Erick the Eloquent (later King of Sweden). Ultimately Frotho ends up ruling over Britain, Scandinavia, the Slavs, and the Huns. Other tales from Norse legend are included in this book, within Frotho's lifetime, including the story of Hedin and Hogni and the story of Hialmar and Arrow-Odd. Saxo says that it was during Frotho's reign that Jesus came to Earth, and there was uninterrupted peace around the world. Frotho is eventually killed by a sorceress in the form of a sea-cow.\nBook 6.\nFollows the adventurers of the legendary hero, Starkad who is disappointed in the decadent ways of Frothi III's descendants.\nBook 7.\nIs a collection of short and unrelated love stories, many of these ventures feature shieldmaidens.\nBook 8.\nCovers the famous Battle of Br\u00e1vellir, between Harald Wartooth and Sigurd Ring. Danish involvement in the Saxon wars against Charlemagne, voyages to Biarmia, and the death of Starkad.\nBook 9.\nThe book deals with Ragnar Lothbrok and his rising empire, he appoints many of his sons to govern parts of his empire all the way from Scotland to Scythia.\nHistory.\nChronology.\nWhen exactly was written is the subject of numerous works; however, it is generally agreed that was not finished before 1208. The last event described in the last book (Book 16) is King Canute VI of Denmark subduing Pomerania under Duke Bogislaw I, in 1186. However, the preface of the work, dedicated to Archbishop Anders Sunesen, mentions the Danish conquest of the areas north of the Elbe in 1208.\nBook 14, comprising nearly one-quarter of the text of the entire work, ends with Absalon's appointment to archbishop in 1178. Since this book is so large and \"Absalon\" has greater importance than King Valdemar I, this book may have been written first and comprised a work on its own. It is possible that Saxo then enlarged it with Books 15 and 16, telling the story of King Valdemar I's last years and King Canute VI's first years.\nIt is believed that Saxo then wrote Books 11, 12, and 13. Svend Aagesen's history of Denmark, \"Brevis historia regum Dacie\" (circa 1186), states that Saxo had decided to write about \"The king-father and his sons,\" which would be King Sweyn Estridson, in Books 11, 12, and 13. He would later add the first ten books. This would also explain the 22 years between the last event described in the last book (Book 16) and the 1208 event described in the preface.\nManuscripts.\nThe original manuscripts of the work are lost, except for four fragments: the Angers Fragment, Lassen Fragment, Kall-Rasmussen Fragment and Plesner Fragment. The Angers Fragment is the biggest fragment, and the only one attested to be in Saxo's own handwriting. The other ones are copies from c.\u20091275. All four fragments are in the collection of the Danish Royal Library in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nThe text has, however, survived. In 1510\u20131512, Christiern Pedersen, a Danish translator working in Paris, searched Denmark high and low for an existing copy of Saxo's works, which by that time was nearly all but lost. By that time most knowledge of Saxo's work came from a summary located in \"Chronica Jutensis\", from around 1342, called \"Compendium Saxonis\". It is also in this summary that the name is found. The title Saxo himself used for his work is unknown.\nChristiern Pedersen finally found a copy in the collection of Archbishop Birger Gunnersen of Lund, Sk\u00e5ne (Sk\u00e5ne is now part of Sweden, but at the time was still part of Denmark), which he gladly lent him. With the help of printer Jodocus Badius, was refined and printed.\nPrinting.\nThe first printed press publication and the oldest known complete text of Saxo's works is Christiern Pedersen's Latin edition, printed and published by Jodocus Badius in Paris, France, on 15 March 1514 under the title of \"Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae\" (\"History of the Kings and heroes of the Danes\"). The edition features the following colophon: ...\"impressit in inclyta Parrhisorum academia Iodocus Badius Ascensius Idibus Martiis. MDXIIII. Supputatione Romana.\" (the Ides of March, 1514).\nThe full front page reads (with abbreviations expanded) in Latin:\n\"Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae stilo eleganti a Saxone Grammatico natione Zialandico necnon Roskildensis ecclesiae praeposito, abhinc supra trecentos annos conscriptae et nunc primum literaria serie illustratae tersissimeque impressae.\"\nEnglish language:\n\"Histories of the Kings and heroes of the Danes, composed in elegant style by Saxo Grammaticus, a Zealander and also provost of the church of Roskilde, over three hundred years ago, and now for the first time illustrated and printed correctly in a learned compilation.\"\nLatin versions.\nThe source of all existing translations and new editions is Christiern Pedersen's Latin \"Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae\". There exist a number of different translations today, some complete, some partial.\nOther translations.\n is also translated partially in other English, French and German releases.\nHamlet.\nCertain aspects of formed the basis for William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\", and Saxo's version, told of in Books 3 and 4, is very similar to that of Shakespeare's play. The name \"Hamlet\" itself is an anagram of \"Amleth\", though it is unclear if this was a deliberate creative choice on Shakespeare's part.\nIn Saxo's version, two brothers, Orvendil and Fengi are given the rule over Jutland by King R\u00f8rik Slyngebond of the Danes. Soon after, Orvendil marries King R\u00f8rik's daughter, Geruth (Gertrude in \"Hamlet\"). Amleth is their first and only child. Fengi becomes resentful of his brother's marriage, and also wants sole leadership of Jutland, so therefore murders Orvendil. After a very brief period of mourning, Fengi marries Geruth, and declares himself sole leader of Jutland. Eventually, Amleth avenges his father's murder and plans the murder of his uncle, making him the new and rightful King of Jutland. However, while Hamlet dies in Shakespeare's version just after his uncle's death, in Saxo's version Amleth survives and begins ruling his kingdom, going on to other adventures.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12743", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12743", "title": "Garrison Keillor", "text": "American author, storyteller, humorist, voice actor, and radio personality (born 1942)\nGary Edward \"Garrison\" Keillor (; born August 7, 1942) is an American author, singer, humorist, voice actor, and radio personality. He created the Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) show \"A Prairie Home Companion\" (called \"Garrison Keillor's Radio Show\" in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town Lake Wobegon, the setting of many of his books, including \"Lake Wobegon Days \"and \"\". Other creations include Guy Noir, a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in \"A Prairie Home Companion\" comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program \"The Writer's Almanac\", which pairs poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.\nIn November 2017, MPR cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for \"A Prairie Home Companion\". Internal and external investigations by MPR concluded Keillor had engaged in dozens of sexually inappropriate incidents over a period of years, including unwanted sexual touching. On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"The Writer's Almanac\" to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of \"The Writer's Almanac\" on his website. He also continues to tour a stage version of \"A Prairie Home Companion\"; these shows are not broadcast by National Public Radio or American Public Media.\nEarly life and education.\nKeillor was born in Anoka, Minnesota, the son of Grace Ruth (\"n\u00e9e\" Denham) and John Philip Keillor. His father was a carpenter and postal worker of English ancestry; Keillor's paternal grandfather was from Kingston, Ontario. His maternal grandparents were Scottish emigrants from Glasgow. He was the third of six children, with three brothers and two sisters.\nKeillor's family belonged to the Plymouth Brethren, an Evangelical Christian movement that he has since left. In 2006, he told \"Christianity Today\" that he was attending the St. John the Evangelist Episcopal church in Saint Paul, Minnesota, after previously attending a Lutheran church in New York.\nKeillor graduated from Anoka High School in 1960 and from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in English in 1966. During college, he began his broadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as Radio K.\nIn his 2004 book \"Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America\", Keillor mentions some of his noteworthy ancestors, including John Crandall, who was an associate of Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island and the first American Baptist church; and Prudence Crandall, who founded the first African-American women's school in America.\nCareer.\nRadio.\nGarrison Keillor started his professional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio (MER), later Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), which today distributes programs under the American Public Media (APM) brand. He hosted a weekday drive-time broadcast called \"A Prairie Home Entertainment\", on KSJR FM at St. John's University in Collegeville. The show's eclectic music was a major divergence from the station's usual classical fare. During this time he submitted fiction to \"The New Yorker\" magazine, where his first story for that publication, \"Local Family Keeps Son Happy,\" appeared in September 1970.\nKeillor resigned from \"The Morning Program\" in February 1971 in protest of what he considered interference with his musical programming; as part of his protest, he played nothing but the Beach Boys' \"Help Me, Rhonda\" during one broadcast. When he returned to the station in October, the show was dubbed \"A Prairie Home Companion\".\nKeillor has attributed the idea for the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment to write about the Grand Ole Opry for \"The New Yorker\", but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space. In August 1973, MPR announced plans to broadcast a Saturday night version of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" with live musicians.\n\"A Prairie Home Companion\" (\"PHC\") debuted as an old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974; it featured guest musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with elaborate live sound effects. The show was punctuated by spoof commercial spots for \"PHC\" fictitious sponsors such as Powdermilk Biscuits, the Ketchup Advisory Board, and the Professional Organization of English Majors (POEM); it presented parodic serial melodramas, such as \"The Adventures of Guy Noir, Private Eye\" and \"The Lives of the Cowboys.\" Keillor voiced Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provided lead or backup vocals for some of the show's musical numbers. The show aired from the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul.\nAfter the show's intermission, Keillor read clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivered a monologue called \"The News from Lake Wobegon\", a fictitious town based in part on Keillor's hometown of Anoka, Minnesota, and on Freeport and other small towns in Stearns County, Minnesota, where he lived in the early 1970s. Lake Wobegon is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place \"... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"\nThe original \"PHC\" ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, \"The American Radio Company of the Air\", which had essentially the same format as \"PHC\". In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to \"A Prairie Home Companion\"; it remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting for decades.\nOn a typical broadcast of \"A Prairie Home Companion\", Keillor's name was not mentioned unless a guest addressed him by name, although some sketches featured Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler. In the closing credits, which Keillor read, he gave himself no billing or credit except \"written by Sarah Bellum,\" a joking reference to his own brain.\nKeillor regularly took the radio company on the road to broadcast from popular venues around the United States; the touring production typically featured local celebrities and skits incorporating local color. In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the city's Queen's Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary. (In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the program is known as \"Garrison Keillor's Radio Show\".) Keillor produced broadcast performances similar to \"PHC\" but without the \"Prairie Home Companion\" brand, as in his 2008 appearance at the Oregon Bach Festival. He was also the host of \"The Writer's Almanac,\" from 1993 to 2017, which, like \"PHC\", was produced and distributed by American Public Media.\nIn a March 2011 interview, Keillor announced that he would be retiring from \"A Prairie Home Companion\" in 2013; but in a December 2011 interview with the \"Sioux City Journal\", Keillor said: \"The show is going well. I love doing it. Why quit?\" During an interview on July 20, 2015, Keillor announced his intent to retire from the show after the 2015\u20132016 season, saying, \"I have a lot of other things that I want to do. I mean, nobody retires anymore. Writers never retire. But this is my last season. This tour this summer is the farewell tour.\"\nKeillor's final episode of the show was recorded live for an audience of 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl in California on July 1, 2016, and broadcast the next day, ending 42 seasons of the show. After the performance, President Barack Obama phoned Keillor to congratulate him. The show continued on October 15, 2016, with Chris Thile as its host.\nSeparation from MPR.\nOn November 29, 2017, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that Minnesota Public Radio was terminating all business relationships with Keillor as a result of \"allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.\" In January 2018, MPR CEO Jon McTaggart elaborated that they had received allegations of \"dozens\" of sexually inappropriate incidents from the individual, including requests for sexual contact. Keillor denied any wrongdoing and said his firing stems from an incident when he touched a woman's bare back while trying to console her. He said he had apologized to her soon after, that they had already made up, and that he was surprised to hear the allegations when her lawyer called.\nIn its statement of termination, MPR announced that Keillor would keep his executive credit for the show, but that since he owns the trademark for the phrase \"prairie home companion\", they would cease rebroadcasting episodes of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" featuring Keillor and remove the trademarked phrase from the radio show hosted by Chris Thile. MPR also eliminated its business connections to PrairieHome.org and stopped distributing Keillor's daily program \"The Writer's Almanac\". \"The Washington Post\" also canceled Keillor's weekly column when they learned he had continued writing columns, including a controversial piece criticizing Al Franken's resignation because of sexual misconduct allegations, without revealing that he was under investigation at MPR.\nSeveral fans wrote MPR to protest Keillor's firing, but only 153 members canceled their memberships because of it. In January 2018, Keillor announced he was in mediation with MPR over the firing. On January 23, 2018, MPR News reported further on the investigation after interviewing almost 60 people who had worked with Keillor. The story described other alleged sexual misconduct by Keillor, and a $16,000 severance check for a woman who was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to prevent her from talking about her time at MPR (she refused and never deposited the check).\nSettlement and access to archived shows.\nKeillor received a letter from the MPR CEO, Jon McTaggart, dated April 5, 2018, confirming that both sides wanted archives of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"The Writer's Almanac\" to be publicly available again. In April 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement under which MPR would restore the online archives.\n\"Finding Your Roots\" segment.\nAlso due to the allegations of inappropriate behavior, Keillor's segment in the PBS series \"Finding Your Roots\" episode that aired on December 19, 2017, was replaced by an older segment featuring Maya Rudolph.\nWriting.\nAt age 13, Keillor adopted the pen name \"Garrison\" to distinguish his personal life from his professional writing. He commonly uses \"Garrison\" in public and in other media.\nKeillor has been called \"[o]ne of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life\" by Randall Balmer in \"Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism.\" He has written numerous magazine and newspaper articles and more than a dozen books for adults as well as children. In addition to writing for \"The New Yorker,\" he has written for \"The Atlantic Monthly\" and \"National Geographic.\" He has also written for Salon.com and authored an advice column there under the name \"Mr. Blue.\" Following a heart operation, he resigned on September 4, 2001, his last column being titled \"Every dog has his day\":\nIn 2004, Keillor published a collection of political essays, \"Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America,\" and in June 2005 he began a column called \"The Old Scout\", which ran at Salon.com and in syndicated newspapers. The column went on hiatus in April 2010 so that he could \"finish a screenplay and start writing a novel.\"\nBookselling.\nOn November 1, 2006, Keillor opened an independent bookstore, \"Common Good Books, G. Keillor, Prop.\" in the Blair Arcade Building at the southwest corner of Selby and N. Western Avenues in the Cathedral Hill area in the Summit-University neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota.\nIn April 2012, the store moved to a new location on Snelling Avenue across from Macalester College in the Macalester-Groveland neighborhood. In April 2019, Keillor sold his interest in the bookstore. The store was renamed Next Chapter and is in the same location.\nVoice-over work.\nProbably owing in part to his distinctive North-Central accent, Keillor is often used as a voice-over actor. Some notable appearances include:\nFilm.\nIn 2006, Keillor wrote and portrayed himself in the musical comedy film \"A Prairie Home Companion\", directed by Robert Altman. It is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box-office success on a small budget. It features an ensemble cast including Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, Lindsay Lohan, Virginia Madsen, John C. Reilly, Maya Rudolph, Meryl Streep, and Lily Tomlin.\nReception.\nIn a 2006 essay in \"Slate\", Sam Anderson called Keillor \"very clearly a genius. His range and stamina alone are incredible\u2014after 30 years, he rarely repeats himself\u2014and he has the genuine wisdom of a Cosby or Mark Twain.\" But Keillor's \"willful simplicity,\" Anderson wrote, \"is annoying because, after a while, it starts to feel prescriptive. Being a responsible adult doesn't necessarily mean speaking slowly about tomatoes.\" Anderson also noted that in 1985, when \"Time\" magazine called Keillor the funniest man in America, Bill Cosby said, \"That's true if you're a pilgrim.\"\nIn popular culture.\nKeillor's style, particularly his speaking voice, has often been parodied.\nPersonal life.\nKeillor is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He is tall. He considers himself a loner and prefers not to make eye contact with people. Though not formally diagnosed, he also considers himself to be on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. He spoke about his experiences as an autistic person in his keynote address at the 19th Annual Minnesota Autism Conference in 2014.\nKeillor has been married three times. He was married to Mary Guntzel from 1965 to 1976; they had one son. From 1985 to 1990 he was married to Ulla Skaerved, a former exchange student from Denmark at Keillor's high school whom he re-encountered at a class reunion. In 1995, Keillor married classical string player Jenny Lind Nilsson (born 1957), who is also from Keillor's home town of Anoka, Minnesota. They have one daughter.\nBetween his first and second marriages, Keillor was romantically involved with Margaret Moos, who worked as a producer of \"A Prairie Home Companion\".\nOn September 7, 2009, Keillor was briefly hospitalized after suffering a minor stroke. He returned to work a few days later.\nIn 2006, after a visit to a United Methodist church in Highland Park, Texas, Keillor created a local controversy with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: \"I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes' church and that it would be better if I didn't talk about politics.\" In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two \"burly security men\" were a local policeman and the church's own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillor's publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition, the coordinator said that Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction, and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, so he did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke.\nSupposedly, before Keillor's remarks, participants at the event had considered the visit cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying he had no security guards at other stops on the tour.\nIn 2007, Keillor wrote a column that in part criticized \"stereotypical\" gay parents, who he said were \"sardonic fellows with fussy hair who live in over-decorated apartments with a striped sofa and a small weird dog and who worship campy performers.\" In response to the strong reactions of many readers, Keillor said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I live in a small world \u2013 the world of entertainment, musicians, writers \u2013 in which gayness is as common as having brown eyes ... And in that small world, we talk openly and we kid each other a lot. But in the larger world, gayness is controversial ... and so gay people feel besieged to some degree and rightly so ... My column spoke as we would speak in my small world, and it was read by people in the larger world and thus the misunderstanding. And for that, I am sorry. Gay people who set out to be parents can be just as good parents as anybody else, and they know that, and so do I.\nIn 2008, Keillor created a controversy in St. Paul when he filed a lawsuit against his neighbor's plan to build an addition on her home, citing his need for \"light and air\" and a view of \"open space and beyond\". Keillor's home is significantly larger than others in his neighborhood and it would still be significantly larger than his neighbor's with its planned addition. Keillor came to an undisclosed settlement with his neighbor shortly after the story became public.\nIn 2009, one of Keillor's \"Old Scout\" columns contained a reference to \"lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys\" and a complaint about \"Silent Night\" as rewritten by Unitarians, upsetting some readers. A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, \"Listening to him talk about us over the years, it's becoming more and more evident that he isn't laughing with us\u2014he's laughing at us\", while Jeff Jacoby of \"The Boston Globe\" called Keillor \"cranky and intolerant\".\nBibliography.\nArticles and other contributions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Galatia was named after the Gauls from Thrace (cf. Tylis), who settled here and became a small transient foreign tribe in the 3rd century BC, following the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in 279 BC. It has been called the \"Gallia\" of the East, \"Gallacia\" ultimately deriving from the northwest of ancient Spain.\nGeography.\nGalatia was bounded to the north by Bithynia and Paphlagonia, to the east by Pontus and Cappadocia, to the south by Cilicia and Lycaonia, and to the west by Phrygia. Its capital was Ancyra (i.e. Ankara, today the capital of modern Turkey).\nCeltic Galatia.\nThe terms \"Galatians\" came to be used by the Greeks for the three Celtic peoples of Anatolia: the Tectosages, the Trocmii, and the Tolistobogii. By the 1st century BC, the Celts had become so Hellenized that some Greek writers called them \"Hellenogalatai\" (\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9). The Romans called them \"Gallograeci\". Though the Celts had, to a large extent, integrated into Hellenistic Asia Minor, they preserved their linguistic and ethnic identity.\nBy the 4th century BC, the Celts had penetrated into the Balkans, coming into contact with the Thracians and Greeks. In 380 BC, they fought in the southern regions of Dalmatia (present day Croatia), and rumors circulated around the ancient world that Alexander the Great's father, Philip II of Macedonia had been assassinated by someone using a dagger of Celtic origins. Arrian writes that \"Celts established on the Ionic coast\" were among those who came to meet Alexander the Great during a campaign against the Getae in 335 BC. Several ancient accounts mention that the Celts formed an alliance with Dionysius I of Syracuse who sent them to fight alongside the Macedonians against the Thebans. In 279 BC, two Celtic factions united under the leadership of Brennus and began to push southwards from southern Bulgaria towards the Greek states. According to Livy, a sizable force split off from this main group and headed toward Asia Minor.\nFor several years, a federation of Hellespontine cities, including Byzantion and Chalkedon, prevented the Celts from entering Asia Minor. During the course of the power struggle between Nikomedes I of Bithynia and his brother Zipoetes II, the former hired 20,000 Galatian mercenaries. The Galatians split into two groups headed by Leonnorius and Lutarius, which crossed the Bosporus and the Hellespont, respectively. In 277 BC, when the hostilities had ended the Galatians came out of Nikomedes' control and began raiding Greek cities in Asia Minor while Antiochus was solidifying his rule in Syria. The Galatians looted Cyzikus, Ilion, Didyma, Priene, Thyatira and Laodicea on the Lycus, while the citizens of Erythras paid them ransom. Either in 275 or 269 BC, Antiochus' army faced the Galatians somewhere on the plain of Sardis in the Battle of Elephants. In the aftermath of the battle, the Celts then settled in northern Phrygia, a region that eventually came to be known as Galatia.\nThe territory of Celtic Galatia included the cities of Ancyra (present day Ankara), Pessinus, Tavium, and Gordion.\nRoman Galatia.\nUpon the death of Deiotarus, the Kingdom of Galatia was given to Amyntas, an auxiliary commander in the Roman army of Brutus and Cassius who gained the favor of Mark Antony. After his death in 25 BC, Galatia was incorporated by Augustus into the Roman Empire, becoming a Roman province. Near his capital Ancyra (modern Ankara), Pylamenes, the king's heir, rebuilt a temple of the Phrygian god Men to venerate Augustus (the Monumentum Ancyranum), as a sign of fidelity. It was on the walls of this temple in Galatia that the major source for the \"Res Gestae\" of Augustus were preserved for modernity. Few of the provinces proved more enthusiastically loyal to Rome.\nJosephus related the Biblical figure Gomer to Galatia (or perhaps to Gaul in general): \"For Gomer founded those whom the Greeks now call Galatians, [Galls], but were then called Gomerites.\" Others have related Gomer to Cimmerians.\nPaul the Apostle visited Galatia in his missionary journeys, and wrote to the Christians there in the Epistle to the Galatians.\nAlthough originally possessing a strong cultural identity, by the 2nd century AD, the Galatians had become assimilated (Hellenization) into the Hellenistic civilization of Anatolia. The Galatians were still speaking the Galatian language in the time of St. Jerome (347\u2013420 AD), who wrote that the Galatians of Ancyra and the Treveri of Trier (in what is now the Rhineland) spoke the same language (\"Comentarii in Epistolam ad Galatos\", 2.3, composed c. 387).\nIn an administrative reorganisation (\"c.\" 386\u2013395), two new provinces succeeded it, \"Galatia Prima\" and \"Galatia Secunda\" or \"Salutaris\", which included part of Phrygia. The fate of the Galatian people is a subject of some uncertainty, but they seem ultimately to have been absorbed into the Greek-speaking populations of Anatolia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences (particularly in logic, mathematics and science), where the process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation.\nGeneralization can also be used to refer to the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole. The parts, which might be unrelated when left on their own, may be brought together as a group, hence belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them.\nHowever, the parts cannot be generalized into a whole\u2014until a common relation is established among \"all\" parts. This does not mean that the parts are unrelated, only that no common relation has been established yet for the generalization.\nThe concept of generalization has broad application in many connected disciplines, and might sometimes have a more specific meaning in a specialized context (e.g. generalization in psychology, generalization in learning). \nIn general, given two related concepts \"A\" and \"B,\" \"A\" is a \"generalization\" of \"B\" (equiv., \"B\" is a special case of \"A\") if and only if both of the following hold:\nFor example, the concept \"animal\" is a generalization of the concept \"bird\", since every bird is an animal, but not all animals are birds (dogs, for instance). For more, see Specialisation (biology).\nHypernym and hyponym.\nThe connection of \"generalization\" to \"specialization\" (or \"particularization\") is reflected in the contrasting words hypernym and hyponym. A hypernym as a generic stands for a class or group of equally ranked items, such as the term \"tree\" which stands for equally ranked items such as \"peach\" and \"oak\", and the term \"ship\" which stands for equally ranked items such as \"cruiser\" and \"steamer\". In contrast, a hyponym is one of the items included in the generic, such as \"peach\" and \"oak\" which are included in \"tree\", and \"cruiser\" and \"steamer\" which are included in \"ship\". A hypernym is superordinate to a hyponym, and a hyponym is subordinate to a hypernym.\nExamples.\nBiological generalization.\nAn animal is a generalization of a mammal, a bird, a fish, an amphibian and a reptile.\nCartographic generalization of geo-spatial data.\nGeneralization has a long history in cartography as an art of creating maps for different scale and purpose. Cartographic generalization is the process of selecting and representing information of a map in a way that adapts to the scale of the display medium of the map. In this way, every map has, to some extent, been generalized to match the criteria of display. This includes small cartographic scale maps, which cannot convey every detail of the real world. As a result, cartographers must decide and then adjust the content within their maps, to create a suitable and useful map that conveys the geospatial information within their representation of the world.\nGeneralization is meant to be context-specific. That is to say, correctly generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements, while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way. The level of detail and importance in what is remaining on the map must outweigh the insignificance of items that were generalized\u2014so as to preserve the distinguishing characteristics of what makes the map useful and important.\nMathematical generalizations.\nIn mathematics, one commonly says that a concept or a result B is a \"generalization\" of A if A is defined or proved before B (historically or conceptually) and A is a special case of B."}

In 2023, Harpers Bazaar ranked her 15th among the greatest supermodels in the 1980s. She was featured on the cover of numerous magazines, including multiple editions of \"Vogue\" and \"Cosmopolitan\", and appeared in advertising campaigns for fashion houses including Armani, Dior, Versace and Yves Saint Laurent.\nAfter Carangi became addicted to heroin, her career rapidly declined, which ultimately led her to quit modeling in 1983. In 1986, at age 26, she died of AIDS. Believed to have contracted it from a contaminated needle, she became one of the early notable women to die of the virus. Her life was dramatized in Michael Cristofer's television film \"Gia\" (1998) starring Angelina Jolie as Carangi.\nEarly life.\nCarangi was born on January 29, 1960, in Philadelphia, the third and youngest child of Joseph Carangi, a restaurant owner, and Kathleen Carangi (\"n\u00e9e\" Adams), a homemaker. She had three older brothers, one of them was from her father's previous marriage and one younger half-brother. Her father was Italian, and her mother was of Irish and Welsh ancestry. Joseph and Kathleen had an unstable, violent marriage, ultimately leading Kathleen to abandon the family when Carangi was eleven years old. Gia was described as \"needy and manipulative\" by relatives who recalled her as spoiled and shy as a child and a \"mommy's girl\" who did not receive the motherly attention that she desired. Those who knew Gia blamed her \"fractured childhood\" for the instability and drug dependence that plagued her adult life. Carangi was sexually abused when she was 5 years old, an event which traumatized her.\nIn her adolescent years, Carangi found the attention she sought from other teenage girls, befriending them by sending flowers. While attending Abraham Lincoln High School, Carangi bonded with \"the Bowie kids\", a group of obsessive David Bowie fans who emulated Bowie's \"defiantly weird, high-glam\" style. Carangi was drawn to Bowie for his fashion preferences and his ambiguous gender play and outspoken bisexuality. One of Carangi's friends later spoke of her \"tomboy persona\", describing her relaxed openness about her sexuality as reminiscent of the character Cay in the film \"Desert Hearts\" (1985). Carangi and her \"bi-try Bowie-mad\" friends hung out in Philadelphia's gay clubs and bars. Though she's associated with the lesbian community, she did not want to take up \"the accepted lesbian style.\"\nCareer.\nAfter being featured in Philadelphia newspaper ads and being discovered by Sondra Scerca in Maurice Tannenbaum's hair salon, Carangi moved to New York City at the age of 17, where she signed with Wilhelmina Models. Her first major shoot, published in October 1978, was with top fashion photographer Chris von Wangenheim, who had her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with makeup artist Sandy Linter. Carangi immediately became infatuated with Linter and pursued her, though the relationship never became stable. By the end of 1978, her first year in New York, Carangi was already a well-established model. Of her quick rise to prominence, described by \"Vogue\" as \"meteoric\", Carangi later said, \"I started working with very good people, I mean all the time, very fast. I didn't build into a model, I just sort of became one.\" Carangi was earning half a million dollars in a year at the height of her career.\nCarangi was a favorite model of various fashion photographers, including Von Wangenheim, Francesco Scavullo, Arthur Elgort, Richard Avedon and Denis Piel. Well-integrated within the fashion world, she had the selection of several photographers, most notably Scavullo. Carangi was featured on the cover of many fashion magazines, including the April 1979 issue of \"British Vogue\", the April 1979 and August 1980 issues of \"Vogue Paris\", the August 1980 issue of \"Vogue\", the February 1981 issue of \"Vogue Italia\", and multiple issues of \"Cosmopolitan\" between 1979 and 1982. During these years, she also appeared in various advertising campaigns for high-profile fashion houses, including Armani, Andr\u00e9 Laug, Christian Dior, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent. At the height of her career, Carangi was most known in modeling circles by only her first name. During this time, she also appeared in the Blondie music video for the single \"Atomic\".\nA regular at Studio 54 and the Mudd Club, Carangi usually used cocaine in clubs. After her agent, mentor and friend Wilhelmina Cooper, died of lung cancer in March 1980, a devastated Carangi began using drugs and developed an addiction to heroin. Carangi's addiction soon began to affect her work; she had violent temper tantrums, walked out of photo shoots to buy drugs, and fell asleep in front of the camera. Scavullo recalled a fashion shoot with Carangi in the Caribbean when \"she was crying, she couldn't find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep.\" During one of her final location shoots for American \"Vogue\", Carangi had red bumps in the crooks of her elbows where she had injected heroin. Despite airbrushing, some of the photos, as published in the November 1980 issue, reportedly still showed visible needle marks.\nIn November 1980, Carangi left Wilhelmina Models and signed with Ford Models, but she was dropped within weeks. By then, her career was in a steep decline. Modeling offers soon ceased and her fashion industry friends, including Sandy Linter, refused to speak to her, fearing their association with her would harm their careers. In an attempt to quit using drugs, she moved back to Philadelphia with her mother and stepfather in February 1981. Carangi underwent a 21-day detox program, but her sobriety was short-lived. She was arrested in March 1981 after she drove into a fence in a suburban neighborhood. After a chase with police, she was taken into custody where it was later determined she was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. After her release, Carangi briefly signed with a new agency, Legends, and worked sporadically, mainly in Europe.\nIn late 1981, although still using drugs, Carangi was determined to make a comeback in the fashion industry and signed with Elite Model Management. While some clients refused to work with her, others were willing to hire her because of her past status as a top model. Scavullo photographed her for the April 1982 cover of \"Cosmopolitan\", her last cover appearance for an American magazine. Sean Byrnes, Scavullo's long-time assistant, later said, \"What she was doing to herself finally became apparent in her pictures. ... I could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.\"\nCarangi then mainly worked with photographer Albert Watson and found work modeling for department stores and catalogs. She appeared in an advertising campaign for \"Versace\", shot by Richard Avedon. He hired her for the fashion house's next campaign, but during the photo shoot, in late 1982, Carangi became uncomfortable and left before any usable shots of her were taken. Around this time, Carangi enrolled in an outpatient methadone program but soon began using heroin again. By the end of 1982, she had only a few clients that were willing to hire her. Carangi's final photo shoot was for German mail-order clothing company Otto GmbH in Tunisia; she was sent home during the shoot for using heroin. She left New York for the final time in early 1983.\nDeath.\nCarangi spent most of her modeling earnings on drugs, and spent the final three years of her life with various lovers, friends, and family members in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Atlantic City, New Jersey. She was admitted to an intense drug treatment program at Eagleville Hospital in December 1984. She was in intense therapy and was able to stay sober for 7 months. After treatment, she got a job in a clothing store, which she eventually quit. She later found employment as a checkout clerk and then worked in the cafeteria of a nursing home. By late 1985, she had begun using drugs again and was engaging in prostitution in Atlantic City. She had cancelled the meetings with her therapist, bought as much heroin as she could, and attempted suicide.\nIn December 1985, Carangi was admitted to Warminster General Hospital in Warminster, Pennsylvania with bilateral pneumonia. A few days later, she was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex. Carangi was hospitalized in October 1986, feeling weak. On October 18, she was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. Carangi died at the Hahnemann Hospital of AIDS-related complications one month later, on November 18, 1986, at the age of 26. Her funeral was held on November 23 at a small funeral home in Philadelphia. No one from the fashion world attended. However, weeks later, fashion photographer Francesco Scavullo, Carangi's friend and confidant, sent a Mass card when he learned of her death.\nLegacy.\nCarangi's rise to fame as an androgynous brunette in an industry full of blue-eyed blondes is believed to have started heroin chic. Carangi is often considered to be the first supermodel, although that title has been applied to others, including Margaux Hemingway, Audrey Munson, Lisa Fonssagrives, Dorian Leigh, Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, Cheryl Tiegs and Janice Dickinson. Model Cindy Crawford, who rose to prominence the year Carangi died, was referred to as \"Baby Gia\" because of her resemblance to Carangi. Crawford later recalled, \"My agents took me to all the photographers who liked Gia: Albert Watson, Francesco Scavullo, Bill King. Everyone loved her look so much that they gladly saw me.\" Additionally, Carangi, whose sexual orientation has been reported as either lesbian or bisexual, is considered a lesbian icon and is said to have \"epitomized lesbian chic more than a decade before the term was coined.\" Argentine model Mica Arga\u00f1araz has often been compared to Carangi, whom she considers a beauty icon.\nCarangi's life has been the subject of several works. A biography of Carangi by Stephen Fried titled \"Thing of Beauty\"\u2014taken from the first line of John Keats' famous poem \"Endymion\"\u2014was published in 1993. \"Gia\", a biographical film starring Angelina Jolie, debuted on HBO in 1998. Jolie won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, among other accolades. A documentary titled \"The Self-Destruction of Gia\", released in 2003, showcased footage of Carangi, contemporary interviews with Carangi's family and former colleagues, including Sandy Linter, and footage of actress-screenwriter Zo\u00eb Lund, herself a heroin addict, who had been commissioned to write a screenplay based upon Carangi's life at the time of her own death of drug-related causes in 1999.\nCarangi is commemorated on the AIDS Memorial Quilt on block #5949, block #3505, and block #4113.\nFurther reading.\nBaumann, Sacha Lanvin. \"Born This Way: Friends, Colleagues, and Coworkers Recall Gia Carangi, the Supermodel Who Defined an Era\". 2016.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Regarded as the greatest and most successful proponent of Italian opera after Verdi, he was descended from a long line of composers, stemming from the late Baroque era. Though his early work was firmly rooted in traditional late-nineteenth-century Romantic Italian opera, it later developed in the realistic \"verismo\" style, of which he became one of the leading exponents.\nHis most renowned works are \"La boh\u00e8me\" (1896), \"Tosca\" (1900), \"Madama Butterfly\" (1904), and the unfinished \"Turandot\" (posthumously completed by Franco Alfano), all of which are among the most frequently performed and recorded in the entirety of the operatic repertoire.\nFamily and education.\nBorn in Lucca in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, in 1858; he was the sixth of nine children of Michele Puccini (1813\u20131864) and Albina Magi (1830\u20131884). The Puccini family was established in Lucca as a local musical dynasty by Puccini's great-great-grandfather \u2013 also named Giacomo (1712\u20131781). This first Giacomo Puccini, though often referred to as Jacopo, was \"maestro di cappella\" of the Cattedrale di San Martino in Lucca. He was succeeded in this position by his son, Antonio Puccini, and then by Antonio's son Domenico, and then his son, Michele. Each Puccini studied music at Bologna, and some took additional musical studies elsewhere. Domenico Puccini studied for a time under Giovanni Paisiello. Each composed music for the church. In addition, Domenico composed several operas, and Michele composed one opera. Puccini's father Michele enjoyed a reputation throughout northern Italy, and his funeral was an occasion of public mourning, at which the then-famed composer Giovanni Pacini conducted a Requiem.\nWith the Puccini family having occupied the position of \"maestro di cappella\" for 124 years (1740\u20131864) by the time of Michele's death, it was anticipated that Michele's son Giacomo would occupy that position as well when he was old enough. However, when Michele Puccini died in 1864, Giacomo was only six years old and thus incapable of assuming his father's post. As a child, he nevertheless participated in the musical life of the Cattedrale di San Martino, as a member of the boys' choir, and later as a substitute organist.\nPuccini received a general education at the San Michele seminary in Lucca, and then at the seminary of the cathedral. One of Puccini's uncles, Fortunato Magi, supervised his musical education. In 1880 Puccini achieved a diploma from Lucca's Pacini School of Music, having studied there with Magi, and later with Carlo Angeloni, who had also instructed Alfredo Catalani. A grant from Queen Margherita, and assistance from another uncle, Nicholas Cer\u00f9, provided the funds necessary for Puccini to continue his studies at the Milan Conservatory for a further three years; there, he studied composition with Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti, Amilcare Ponchielli, Amintore Galli, and Antonio Bazzini. He shared his dorm with Pietro Mascagni. Later that year, Puccini composed his \"Mass\", marking the culmination of his family's long association with liturgical music in his native Lucca.\nEarly career and first operas.\nAs a thesis piece for the Milan Conservatory, Puccini composed the orchestral \"Capriccio sinfonico\" (\"Symphonic caprice\"). Puccini's teachers, Ponchielli and Bazzini, were impressed by his work, which was subsequently performed at a student concert at the conservatory on July 14, 1883, conducted by Franco Faccio. The \"Capriccio\" was favourably reviewed in the Milanese publication \"La Perseveranza\", and thus Puccini began to build a reputation as a young composer of promise in Milanese music circles.\n\"Le Villi\".\nFollowing the premi\u00e8re of the \"Capriccio sinfonico\", Ponchielli and Puccini discussed the possibility that Puccini's next work might be an opera. Ponchielli invited Puccini to stay at his villa, where Puccini was introduced to Ferdinando Fontana. They agreed to collaborate on an opera, for which Fontana would provide the libretto. Puccini submitted the work, titled ('The Fairies'), for Casa Musicale Sonzogno's first of four musical competitions, advertised in April 1883, for a new, unperformed opera \"inspired by the best traditions of Italian opera\", which could be \"idyllic, serious, or comic\", to be judged by a panel including Galli and Ponchielli. Puccini's submission was disqualified because its manuscript was illegible; the second competition, in 1889, was notably won by Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\".\nDespite the defeat in the competition, \"Le Villi\" was later staged at the Teatro Dal Verme, premiering on 31 May 1884. Casa Ricordi assisted with the premi\u00e8re by printing the libretto without charge. Fellow students from the Milan Conservatory formed a large part of the orchestra. The performance was enough of a success that Casa Ricordi purchased the opera. Revised into a two-act version with an intermezzo between the acts, \"Le Villi\" was performed at La Scala in Milan, on 24 January 1885. However, Ricordi did not publish the score until 1887, hindering further performance of the work.\n\"Edgar\".\nImpressed with \"Le Villi\" and its composer, music publisher Giulio Ricordi commissioned a second opera from Puccini, which would result in \"Edgar\". Work begun in 1884 when Fontana began working out the scenario for the libretto. Puccini finished primary composition in 1887, and orchestration in 1888. \"Edgar\" premiered at La Scala on 21 April 1889 to a lukewarm response. The work was withdrawn for revisions after its third performance. In a Milanese newspaper, Giulio Ricordi published a defence of Puccini's skill as a composer, while criticizing Fontana's libretto. A revised version met with success at the Teatro del Giglio in Puccini's native Lucca on 5 September 1891. In 1892, further revisions reduced the length of the opera from four acts to three, in a version that was well received in Ferrara and was performed in Turin and in Spain. Puccini made further revisions in 1901 and 1905, but the work never achieved popularity. Without the personal support of Ricordi, \"Edgar\" might have cost Puccini his career. Puccini had eloped with his former piano student, the married Elvira Gemignani (n\u00e9e\u00a0Bonturi), and Ricordi's associates were willing to turn a blind eye to his lifestyle as long as he was successful. When \"Edgar\" failed, they suggested to Ricordi that he should drop Puccini, but Ricordi said that he would stay with him and continued his allowance until his next opera.\n\"Manon Lescaut\".\nOn commencing his next opera, \"Manon Lescaut\", Puccini announced that he would write his own libretto so that \"no fool of a librettist\" could spoil it. Ricordi persuaded him to accept Ruggero Leoncavallo as his librettist, but Puccini soon asked Ricordi to remove him from the project. Four other librettists were then involved with the opera, as Puccini constantly changed his mind about the structure of the piece. It was almost by accident that the final two, Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, came together to complete the opera.\n\"Manon Lescaut\" premiered at the Teatro Regio in Turin on 2 February 1893. By coincidence, Puccini's first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdi's last opera, \"Falstaff\", which was first performed on 9 February 1893. In anticipation of the premiere, wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom \"great hopes\" had a real basis (\"\"). Because of the failure of \"Edgar\", however, a failure of \"Manon Lescaut\" could have jeopardized Puccini's future as a composer. Although Giulio Ricordi, head of Casa Ricordi, was supportive of Puccini while \"Manon Lescaut\" was still in development, the Casa Ricordi board of directors was considering cutting off Puccini's financial support. In any event, \"\"Manon Lescaut\" was Puccini's first and only uncontested triumph, acclaimed by critics and public alike.\" After the London premiere in 1894, George Bernard Shaw pronounced: \"Puccini looks to me more like the heir of Verdi than any of his rivals.\"\n\"Manon Lescaut\" was a great success and established Puccini's reputation as the most promising rising composer of his generation, and the most likely \"successor\" to Verdi as the leading exponent of the Italian operatic tradition. Illica and Giacosa returned as librettists for Puccini for his next three operas, probably his greatest successes: \"La boh\u00e8me\", \"Tosca\" and \"Madama Butterfly\".\nMiddle career.\n\"La boh\u00e8me\".\nPuccini's next work after \"Manon Lescaut\" was \"La boh\u00e8me\" (\"The bohemian lifestyle\")\",\" a four-act opera based on the 1851 book by Henri Murger, \"La Vie de Boh\u00e8me\". \"La boh\u00e8me\" premiered in Turin in 1896, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Within a few years, it had been performed in many of the leading opera houses of Europe, including in Britain, as well as in the United States. It was a popular success and remains one of the most frequently performed operas ever written.\nThe libretto of the opera, freely adapted from Murger's episodic novel, combines comic elements of the impoverished life of the young protagonists with tragic aspects, such as the death of the young seamstress Mim\u00ed. Puccini's own life as a young man in Milan served as a source of inspiration for elements of the libretto. During his years as a conservatory student and in the years before \"Manon Lescaut\", he experienced poverty similar to that of the bohemians in \"La boh\u00e8me\", including a chronic shortage of necessities like food, clothing and money to pay rent. Although Puccini was granted a small monthly stipend by the Congregation of Charity in Rome (), he frequently had to pawn his possessions to cover basic expenses. Early biographers such as Wakeling Dry and Eugenio Checchi, who were Puccini's contemporaries, drew express parallels between these incidents and particular events in the opera. Checchi cited a diary kept by Puccini while he was still a student, which recorded an occasion in which, as in Act 4 of the opera, a single herring served as a dinner for four people. Puccini himself commented: \"I lived that \"Boh\u00e8me\", when there wasn't yet any thought stirring in my brain of seeking the theme of an opera\". (\"\")\nPuccini's composition of \"La boh\u00e8me\" was the subject of a public dispute between Puccini and fellow composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo. In early 1893, the two composers discovered that they were both engaged in writing operas based on Murger's work. Leoncavallo had started his work first, and he and his music publisher claimed to have \"priority\" on the subject (although Murger's work was in the public domain). Puccini responded that he started his own work without having any knowledge of Leoncavallo's project, and wrote: \"Let him compose. I will compose. The audience will decide.\" Puccini's opera premiered a year before that of Leoncavallo, and has been a perennial audience favourite, while Leoncavallo's version quickly faded into obscurity.\n\"Tosca\".\nPuccini's next work after \"La boh\u00e8me\" was \"Tosca\" (1900), arguably Puccini's first foray into \"verismo\", the realistic depiction of many facets of real life including violence. Puccini had been considering an opera on this theme since he saw the play \"Tosca\" by Victorien Sardou in 1889, when he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \"I see in this \"Tosca\" the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\"\nThe music of \"Tosca\" employs musical signatures for particular characters and emotions, which have been compared to Wagnerian leitmotivs, and some contemporaries saw Puccini as thereby adopting a new musical style influenced by Richard Wagner. Others viewed the work differently. Rejecting the allegation that \"Tosca\" displayed Wagnerian influences, a critic reporting on the Torino premiere of 20 February 1900 wrote: \"I don't think you could find a more Puccinian score than this.\"\nAutomobile crash and near-death.\nOn 25 February 1903, Puccini was seriously injured in a car crash during a nighttime journey on the road from Lucca to Torre del Lago. The car was driven by Puccini's chauffeur and was carrying Puccini, his future wife Elvira, and their son Antonio. It went off the road, fell several metres, and flipped over. Elvira and Antonio were flung from the car and escaped with minor injuries. Puccini's chauffeur, also thrown from the car, suffered a serious fracture of his femur. Puccini was pinned under the vehicle, with a severe fracture of his right leg and with a portion of the car pressing down on his chest. A doctor living near the scene of the crash, together with another person who came to investigate, saved Puccini from the wreckage. The injury did not heal well, and Puccini remained under treatment for months. During the medical examinations that he underwent it was also found that he was suffering from a form of diabetes. The accident and its consequences slowed Puccini's completion of his next work.\n\"Madama Butterfly\".\nThe original version of \"Madama Butterfly\" (\"Madam Butterfly\") premiered at La Scala on 17 February 1904 with Rosina Storchio in the title role. It was initially greeted with great hostility (probably largely owing to inadequate rehearsals). When Storchio's kimono accidentally lifted during the performance, some in the audience started shouting: \"The butterfly is pregnant\" and \"There is the little Toscanini\". The latter comment referred to her well-publicised affair with Arturo Toscanini. This version was in two acts; after its disastrous premiere, Puccini withdrew the opera, revising it for what was virtually a second premiere at Brescia in May 1904 and performances in Buenos Aires, London, the US and Paris. In 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version, which has become known as the \"standard version\". Today, the standard version of the opera is the version most often performed around the world. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed as well, and has been recorded.\nLater works.\nAfter 1904, Puccini's compositions were less frequent. In 1906 Giacosa died and, in 1909, there was a scandal after Puccini's wife, Elvira, falsely accused their maid Doria Manfredi of having an affair with Puccini. Finally, in 1912, the death of Giulio Ricordi, Puccini's editor and publisher, ended a productive period of his career.\n\"La fanciulla del West\".\nPuccini completed \"La fanciulla del West\" (\"The Damsel of the West\"), based on a play by David Belasco, in 1910. This was commissioned by, and first performed at, the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 10 December 1910 with Met stars Enrico Caruso and Emmy Destinn, for whom Puccini created the leading roles of Dick Johnson and Minnie. Toscanini, then the musical director of the Met, conducted. This was the first world premiere of an opera at the Met. The premiere was a great success. However, the compositional style employed in the opera, with few stand-alone arias, was criticized at the time. Some contemporaries also criticized the opera for failing to achieve an \"American\" tone. However, the opera has been acclaimed for its incorporation of advanced harmonic language and rhythmic complexity into the Italian operatic form. In addition, one aria from the opera, \"Ch'ella mi creda\", has become a staple of compilation albums by operatic tenors. It is said that during World War I, Italian soldiers sang this aria to maintain their spirits. The 2008 Italian film \"Puccini e la fanciulla\" (\"Puccini and the Girl\"), is based on the period of his life when he was composing the opera.\n\"La rondine\".\nPuccini completed the score of \"La rondine\" (\"The Swallow\") to a libretto by Giuseppe Adami in 1916 after two years of work, and it was premiered at the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte Carlo on 27 March 1917. The opera had been originally commissioned by Vienna's Carltheater; however, the outbreak of World War I prevented the premiere from being given there. Moreover, the firm of Ricordi had declined the score of the opera\u00a0\u2013 Giulio Ricordi's son Tito was then in charge and he described the opera as \"bad Leh\u00e1r\". It was taken up by their rival, Lorenzo Sonzogno, who arranged the first performance in neutral Monaco. The composer continued to work at revising this, the least known of his mature operas, until his death.\n\"La rondine\" was initially conceived as an operetta, but Puccini eliminated spoken dialogue, rendering the work closer in form to an opera. A modern reviewer described \"La rondine\" as \"a continuous fabric of lilting waltz tunes, catchy pop-styled melodies, and nostalgic love music,\" while characterizing the plot as recycling characters and incidents from works like \"La traviata\" and \"Die Fledermaus\".\n\"Il trittico\": \"Il tabarro\", \"Suor Angelica\", and \"Gianni Schicchi\".\nIn 1918, \"Il trittico\" (\"The Triptych\") premiered in New York. This work is composed of three one-act operas, each concerning the concealment of a death: a horrific episode (\"Il tabarro\"; \"The Cloak\") in the style of the Parisian Grand Guignol, a sentimental tragedy (\"Suor Angelica\"; \"Sister Angelica\"), and a comedy (\"Gianni Schicchi\").\n\"Turandot\".\n\"Turandot\", Puccini's final opera, was left unfinished at the composer's death in November 1924, and the last two scenes were completed by Franco Alfano based on the composer's sketches. The libretto for \"Turandot\" was based on a play of the same name by Carlo Gozzi. The music of the opera is heavily inflected with pentatonic motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavour to the music. \"Turandot\" contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them \"Nessun dorma\".\nLibrettists.\nThe libretto of \"Edgar\" was a significant factor in the failure of that opera. Thereafter, especially throughout his middle and late career, Puccini was extremely selective, and at times indecisive, in his choice of subject matter for new works. Puccini was deeply involved in the process of writing the libretto itself, requiring many iterative revisions of his libretti in terms of both structure and text. Puccini's relationships with his librettists were at times very difficult. His publisher, Casa Ricordi, was frequently required to mediate disputes and impasses between them.\nPuccini explored many possible subjects that he ultimately rejected only after a significant amount of effort\u2014such as the creation of a libretto\u2014had been put into them. Among the subjects that Puccini seriously considered, but abandoned, were: \"Cristoforo Sly\", \"Anima Allegra\" (based on the play \"El genio alegre\" by Seraf\u00edn and Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1lvarez Quintero), \"Two Little Wooden Shoes\" (\"I due zoccoletti\") (a short story by Maria Louise Ram\u00e9, a.k.a. Ouida), the life of Marie Antoinette, Margherita da Cortona, and \"Conchita\" (based on the novel \"La Femme et le pantin\" \u2013 \"The Woman and the Puppet\", by Pierre Lo\u00fcys). Some of these abandoned subjects were taken up and turned into operas by other composers. For example, Franco Vittadini made an opera of \"Anima Allegra\", Mascagni's opera \"Lodoletta\" is derived from \"Two Little Wooden Shoes\", and Riccardo Zandonai eventually wrote \"Conchita\".\nTorre del Lago.\nFrom 1891 onwards, Puccini spent most of his time, when not travelling on business, at Torre del Lago, a small community about fifteen miles from Lucca situated between the Ligurian Sea and Lake Massaciuccoli, just south of Viareggio. Torre del Lago was the primary place for Puccini to indulge his love of hunting. \"I love hunting, I love cars: and for these things, in the isolation of Torre del Lago, I keep the faith.\" (\"Amo la caccia, adoro l'automobile: e a questo e a quella nelle solitudini di Torre del Lago serbo intera la mia fede.\")\nBy 1900, he had acquired land and built a villa on the lake, now known as the \"Villa Puccini\". He lived there until 1921, when pollution produced by peat works on the lake forced him to move to Viareggio, a few kilometres north. After his death, a mausoleum was created in the Villa Puccini and the composer is buried there in the chapel, along with his wife and son who died later.\nThe Villa Museo was owned by his granddaughter, Simonetta Puccini, until her death, and is open to the public. An annual Festival Puccini is held at Torre del Lago.\nMarriage and affairs.\nIn the autumn of 1884, in Lucca, Puccini began a relationship with a married woman named Elvira Gemignani (n\u00e9e\u00a0Bonturi; 1860\u20131930), a former piano student of his. Elvira's husband, Narciso Gemignani, was an \"unrepentant womanizer\", and Elvira's marriage was not a happy one. Elvira became pregnant by Puccini, and their son, Antonio (1886\u20131946), was born in Monza. Elvira left Lucca when the pregnancy began to show and gave birth elsewhere to avoid gossip. Elvira, Antonio and Elvira's daughter by Narciso, Fosca (1880\u20131968), began to live with Puccini shortly afterwards. Narciso was killed by the husband of a woman that Narciso had an affair with, dying on 26 February 1903, one day after Puccini's car accident. Only then, in early 1904, were Puccini and Elvira able to marry, and to legitimize Antonio.\nThe marriage between Puccini and Elvira was also troubled by infidelity, as Puccini had frequent affairs himself, including with well-known singers such as Maria Jeritza, Emmy Destinn, Cesira Ferrani, and Hariclea Darcl\u00e9e. In 1906, while attending the opening of \"Madama Butterfly\" in Budapest, Puccini fell in love with Blanke Lendvai, the sister of Hungarian composer Ervin Lendvai (his friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for many years). Blanke and Puccini exchanged love letters until 1911, when he started an affair with German aristocrat Baroness Josephine von Stangel, which lasted for six years.\nIn 1909, Puccini's wife Elvira publicly accused Doria Manfredi, a maid working for the Puccini family, of having an affair with the composer. After the accusation, Manfredi committed suicide. However, an autopsy determined that Manfredi had died a virgin, refuting the allegations made against her. Elvira Puccini was prosecuted for slander and was sentenced to more than five months in prison, although a payment to the Manfredi family by Puccini spared Elvira from having to serve the sentence. Some music critics and interpreters of Puccini's work have speculated that the psychological effects of this incident on Puccini interfered with his ability to complete compositions later in his career, and also influenced the development of his characters such as Li\u00f9 (from \"Turandot\"), a slave girl who dies tragically by suicide.\nIn 2007, documents were found in the possession of Nadia Manfredi, a descendant of the Manfredi family, which indicated that Puccini was actually having an affair with Giulia Manfredi, Doria's cousin. Upon the discovery of these documents, the press began to allege that Puccini had fathered Giulia Manfredi's son Antonio, which would make Nadia a granddaughter of Puccini.\nPolitics.\nUnlike Wagner and Verdi, Puccini was not active in politics. Puccini biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz wrote: \"Throughout this entire period [of World War I and its immediate aftermath], Puccini's interest in politics was close to zero, as it had been all his life, so far as one can judge. He seemed almost indifferent to everything from mayoral elections in Viareggio to cabinet appointments in Rome.\" Another biographer speculates that Puccini may have been\u2014if he had a political philosophy\u2014a monarchist.\nPuccini's indifference to politics caused him problems during World War I. Puccini's long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 (in the opening months of the war) during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization. Puccini was also criticized during the war for his work on \"La rondine\" under a 1913 commission contract with an Austrian theater after Italy and Austria-Hungary became opponents in the war in 1915 (although the contract was ultimately cancelled). Puccini did not participate in the public war effort, but privately rendered assistance to individuals and families affected by the war.\nIn 1919, Puccini was commissioned to write music to an ode by Fausto Salvatori honouring Italy's victories in World War I. The work, \"Inno a Roma\" (Hymn to Rome), was to premiere on 21 April 1919, during a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of Rome. The premiere was delayed to 1 June 1919, when it was played at the opening of a gymnastics competition. Although not written for the fascists, \"Inno a Roma\" was widely played during Fascist street parades and public ceremonies.\nPuccini had some contact with Benito Mussolini and the Italian Fascist Party in the year preceding his death. In 1923 the Fascist Party in Viareggio made Puccini an honorary member and sent him a membership card. However, evidence that Puccini was actually a member of the Fascist Party is ambiguous. The Italian Senate has traditionally included a small number of members appointed in recognition of their cultural contributions to the nation. Puccini hoped to attain this honour, which had been granted to Verdi, and undertook to use his connections to bring about the appointment. While honorary senators could vote, there is no indication that Puccini sought the appointment for this purpose. Puccini also wished to establish a national theatre in Viareggio, a project which would require government support. Puccini met with Mussolini twice, in November and December 1923, seeking support for the theatre project. While the theatre project never came to fruition, Puccini was named Senator (\"senatore a vita\") a few months before his death.\nAt the time Puccini met with Mussolini, Mussolini had been prime minister for approximately a year, but his party had not yet taken full control of the Italian Parliament through the violence and irregularities of the 1924 general election. Puccini was no longer alive when Mussolini announced the end of representative government and the beginning of a fascist dictatorship, in his speech before the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1925.\nDeath.\nA chain smoker of Toscano cigars and cigarettes, Puccini began to complain of a chronic sore throat towards the end of 1923. A diagnosis of throat cancer led his doctors to recommend a new and experimental radiation therapy treatment which was being offered in Brussels. Puccini and his wife never understood how serious the cancer was, as the news was revealed only to his son.\nPuccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, aged 65, from complications after the treatment; uncontrolled bleeding led to a heart attack the day after surgery. Although not a fervent Catholic, Puccini received the last sacraments from Cardinal Clemente Micara, who was also a cello player and fellow musician as well as a personal friend of the composer. News of his death reached Rome during a performance of \"La boh\u00e8me\". The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played Chopin's \"Funeral March\" for the stunned audience. \nHis funeral took place at Saint Mary's Royal Church in Schaerbeek, Brussels.\nHe was buried in Milan, in Toscanini's family tomb, but that was always intended as a temporary measure. In 1926, on the 2nd anniversary of his death, his son arranged to transfer his father's remains to a specially created chapel inside the Puccini villa at Torre del Lago.\nStyle and critical reception.\nMost broadly, Puccini wrote in the style of the late-Romantic period of classical music (see Romantic music). Music historians also refer to Puccini as a component of the \"giovane scuola\" (\"young school\"), a cohort of composers who came onto the Italian operatic scene as Verdi's career came to an end, such as Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and others mentioned below. Puccini is also frequently referred to as a \"verismo\" composer.\nPuccini's career extended from the end of the Romantic period into the modern period. He consciously attempted to 'update' his style to keep pace with new trends but did not attempt to fully adopt a modern style. One critic, Andrew Davis, has stated: \"Loyalty toward nineteenth-century Italian-opera traditions and, more generally, toward the musical language of his Tuscan heritage is one of the clearest features of Puccini's music.\" Davis also identifies, however, a \"stylistic pluralism\" in Puccini's work, including influences from \"the German symphonic tradition, French harmonic and orchestrational traditions, and, to a lesser extent, aspects of Wagnerian chromaticism\". In addition, Puccini frequently sought to introduce music or sounds from outside sources into his operas, such as his use of Chinese folk melodies in \"Turandot\".\nAll of Puccini's operas have at least one set piece for a lead singer that is separate enough from its surroundings that it can be treated as a distinct aria, and most of his works have several of these. At the same time, Puccini's work continued the trend away from operas constructed from a series of set pieces, and instead used a more \"through-composed\" or integrated construction. His works are strongly melodic. In orchestration, Puccini frequently doubled the vocal line in unison or at octaves in order to emphasize and strengthen the melodic line.\n\"Verismo\" is a style of Italian opera that began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s. The style is distinguished by realistic \u2013 sometimes sordid or violent \u2013 depictions of everyday life, especially the life of the contemporary lower classes. Verismo does not usually employ the historical or mythical subjects associated with Romanticism. \"Cavalleria rusticana\", \"Pagliacci\", and \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\" are uniformly considered to be \"verismo\" operas. Puccini's career as a composer is almost entirely coincident in time with the \"verismo\" movement. Only his \"Le Villi\" and \"Edgar\" preceded \"Cavalleria rusticana\". Some view Puccini as essentially a \"verismo\" composer, while others, although acknowledging that he took part in the movement to some degree, do not view him as a \"pure\" \"verismo\" composer. In addition, critics differ as to the degree to which particular operas by Puccini are, or are not, properly described as \"verismo\" operas. Two of Puccini's operas, \"Tosca\" and \"Il Tabarro\", are universally considered to be \"verismo\" operas. Puccini scholar Mosco Carner places only two of Puccini's operas other than \"Tosca\" and \"Il tabarro\" within the \"verismo\" school: \"Madama Butterfly\", and \"La Fanciulla del West\". Because only three \"verismo\" works that were not composed by Puccini continue to appear regularly on stage (the aforementioned \"Cavalleria rusticana\", \"Pagliacci\", and \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\"), Puccini's contribution has had lasting significance to the genre.\nBoth during his lifetime and in posterity, Puccini's success outstripped other Italian opera composers of his time, and he has been matched in this regard by only a handful of composers in the entire history of opera. Between 2004 and 2018, Puccini ranked third (behind Verdi and Mozart) in the number of performances of his operas worldwide, as surveyed by Operabase. Three of his operas (\"La boh\u00e8me\", \"Tosca\", and \"Madama Butterfly\") were amongst the 10 most frequently performed operas worldwide.\nGustav Kobb\u00e9, the original author of \"The Complete Opera Book\", a standard reference work on opera, wrote in the 1919 edition: \"Puccini is considered the most important figure in operatic Italy today, the successor of Verdi, if there is any.\" Other contemporaries shared this view. Italian opera composers of the generation with whom Puccini was compared included Pietro Mascagni (1863\u20131945), Ruggero Leoncavallo (1857\u20131919), Umberto Giordano (1867\u20131948), Francesco Cilea (1866\u20131950), Baron Pierantonio Tasca (1858\u20131934), Gaetano Coronaro (1852\u20131908), and Alberto Franchetti (1860\u20131942). Only three composers, and three works, by Italian contemporaries of Puccini appear on the Operabase list of most-performed works: \"Cavalleria rusticana\" by Mascagni, \"Pagliacci\" by Ruggero Leoncavallo, and \"Andrea Ch\u00e9nier\" by Umberto Giordano. Kobb\u00e9 contrasted Puccini's ability to achieve \"sustained\" success with the failure of Mascagni and Leoncavallo to produce more than merely \"one sensationally successful short opera\". By the time of Puccini's death in 1924, he had earned $4\u00a0million from his works.\nAlthough the popular success of Puccini's work is undeniable, and his mastery of the craft of composition has been consistently recognized, opinion among critics as to the artistic value of his work has always been divided. Grove Music Online described Puccini's strengths as a composer as follows:\nPuccini succeeded in mastering the orchestra as no other Italian had done before him, creating new forms by manipulating structures inherited from the great Italian tradition, loading them with bold harmonic progressions which had little or nothing to do with what was happening then in Italy, though they were in step with the work of French, Austrian and German colleagues.\nIn his work on Puccini, Julian Budden describes Puccini as a gifted and original composer, noting the innovation hidden in the popularity of works such as \"Che gelida manina\". He describes the aria in musical terms (the signature embedded in the harmony for example), and points out that its structure was rather unheard of at the time, having three distinct musical paragraphs that nonetheless form a complete and coherent whole. This gumption in musical experimentation was the essence of Puccini's style, as evidenced in his diverse settings and use of the motif to express ideas beyond those in the story and text.\nPuccini has, however, consistently been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult. Some have explicitly condemned his efforts to please his audience, such as this contemporary Italian critic:\nHe willingly stops himself at minor genius, stroking the taste of the public ... obstinately shunning too-daring innovation ... A little heroism, but not taken to great heights; a little bit of veristic comedy, but brief; a lot of sentiment and romantic idyll: this is the recipe in which he finds happiness. ()\nBudden attempted to explain the paradox of Puccini's immense popular success and technical mastery on the one hand, and the relative disregard in which his work has been held by academics:\nNo composer communicates more directly with an audience than Puccini. Indeed, for many years he has remained a victim of his own popularity; hence the resistance to his music in academic circles. Be it remembered, however, that Verdi's melodies were once dismissed as barrel-organ fodder. The truth is that music that appeals immediately to a public becomes subject to bad imitation, which can cast a murky shadow over the original. So long as counterfeit Puccinian melody dominated the world of sentimental operetta, many found it difficult to come to terms with the genuine article. Now that the current coin of light music has changed, the composer admired by Schoenberg, Ravel, and Stravinsky can be seen to emerge in his full stature.\nPuccini studies.\nFounded in 1996 in Lucca, the Centro di studi Giacomo Puccini embraces a wide range of approaches to the study of Puccini's work. In the US, the American Center for Puccini Studies specializes in the presentation of unusual performing editions of the composer's works and introduces neglected or unknown Puccini pieces. It was founded in 2004 by the singer and director Harry Dunstan.\nWorks.\nPuccini wrote orchestral pieces, sacred music, chamber music, solo music for piano and organ and songs for voice and piano, most notably his 1880 mass \"Messa di gloria\", his \"Preludio Sinfonico\" of 1882, and his 1890 string quartet movement \"Crisantemi\". However, he is primarily known for his operas:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He mainly concentrated on comedies and literary adaptations. His career flourished at RKO when David O. Selznick, the studio's head of production, assigned Cukor to direct several of RKO's major films, including \"What Price Hollywood?\" (1932), \"A Bill of Divorcement\" (1932), \"Our Betters\" (1933), and \"Little Women\" (1933). When Selznick moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1933, Cukor followed and directed \"Dinner at Eight\" (1933) and \"David Copperfield\" (1935) for Selznick, and \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1936) and \"Camille\" (1936) for Irving Thalberg.\nHe was replaced as one of the directors of \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), but he went on to direct \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), \"Gaslight\" (1944), \"Adam's Rib\" (1949), \"Born Yesterday\" (1950), \"A Star Is Born\" (1954), and \"Bhowani Junction\" (1956), and won the Academy Award for Best Director for \"My Fair Lady\" (1964), which was his fifth time nominated. He continued to work into the early 1980s.\nEarly life.\nCukor was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the younger child and only son of Hungarian-Jewish immigrants Viktor, an assistant district attorney, and Hel\u00e9n Ilona Gross. His parents selected his (first and) middle name in honor of Spanish\u2013American War hero George Dewey. The family was not particularly religious (with pork a staple on the dinner table), and when he started attending temple as a boy, Cukor learned Hebrew phonetically, with no real understanding of the meaning of the words or what they represented. As a result, he was ambivalent about his faith and dismissive of old world traditions from childhood, and as an adult he embraced Anglophilia to remove himself even further from his roots.\nAs a child, Cukor appeared in several amateur plays and took dance lessons, and at the age of seven he performed in a recital with David O. Selznick, who in later years became a mentor and friend. As a teenager, Cukor frequently was taken to the New York Hippodrome by his uncle. Infatuated with theatre, he often cut classes at DeWitt Clinton High School to attend afternoon matinees. During his senior year, he worked as a supernumerary with the Metropolitan Opera, earning 50\u00a2 per appearance, and $1 if he was required to perform in blackface.\nFollowing his graduation in 1917, Cukor was expected to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a career in law. He halfheartedly enrolled in the City College of New York, where he entered the Students Army Training Corps in October 1918. His military experience was limited; Germany surrendered in early November, and Cukor's duty ended after only two months. He left school shortly afterwards.\nCareer.\nEarly stage career.\nCukor obtained a job as an assistant stage manager and bit player with a touring production of \"The Better 'Ole\", a popular British musical based on Old Bill, a cartoon character created by Bruce Bairnsfather. In 1920, he became the stage manager for the Knickerbocker Players, a troupe that shuttled between Syracuse, New York and Rochester, New York, and the following year he was hired as general manager of the newly formed Lyceum Players, an upstate summer stock company. In 1925, he formed the C.F. and Z. Production Company with Walter Folmer and John Zwicki, which gave him his first opportunity to direct. Following their first season, he made his Broadway directorial debut with \"Antonia\" by Hungarian playwright Melchior Lengyel, then returned to Rochester, where C.F. and Z. evolved into the Cukor-Kondolf Stock Company, a troupe that included Louis Calhern, Ilka Chase, Phyllis Povah, Frank Morgan, Reginald Owen, Elizabeth Patterson and Douglass Montgomery, all of whom worked with Cukor in later years in Hollywood. Lasting only one season with the company was Bette Davis. Cukor later recalled: \"Her talent was apparent, but she did buck at direction. She had her own ideas, and though she only did bits and ingenue roles, she didn't hesitate to express them.\" For the next several decades, Davis claimed she was fired, and although Cukor never understood why she placed so much importance on an incident he considered so minor, he never worked with her again.\nFor the next few years, Cukor alternated between Rochester in the summer months and Broadway in the winter. His direction of a 1926 stage adaptation of \"The Great Gatsby\" by Owen Davis brought him to the attention of the New York critics. Writing in the \"Brooklyn Eagle\", drama critic Arthur Pollock called it \"an unusual piece of work by a director not nearly so well known as he should be.\" Cukor directed six more Broadway productions, then departed for Hollywood in 1929.\nEarly Hollywood career.\nWhen Hollywood began to recruit New York theater talent for sound films, Cukor immediately answered the call. In December 1928, Paramount Pictures signed him to a contract that reimbursed him for his train fare and initially paid him $600 per week with no screen credit during a six-month apprenticeship. He arrived in Hollywood in February 1929, and his first assignment was to coach the cast of \"River of Romance\" to speak with an acceptable Southern accent. In October, the studio lent him to Universal Pictures to conduct the screen tests and work as a dialogue director for \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", released in 1930. That year, he co-directed three films at Paramount, and his weekly salary was increased to $1,500. He made his solo directorial debut with \"Tarnished Lady\" (1931) starring Tallulah Bankhead.\nCukor was then assigned to \"One Hour with You\" (1932), an operetta with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, when original director Ernst Lubitsch opted to concentrate on producing the film instead. At first the two men worked well together, but two weeks into filming Lubitsch began arriving on the set on a regular basis, and he soon began directing scenes with Cukor's consent. Upon the film's completion, Lubitsch approached Paramount general manager B.P. Schulberg and threatened to leave the studio if Cukor's name wasn't removed from the credits. When Schulberg asked him to cooperate, Cukor filed suit. He eventually settled for being billed as assistant director and then left Paramount to work with David O. Selznick at RKO Studios.\nCukor quickly earned a reputation as a director who could coax great performances from actresses and he became known as a \"woman's director\", a title he resented. Despite this reputation, during his career, he oversaw more performances honored with the Academy Award for Best Actor than any other director: James Stewart in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), Ronald Colman in \"A Double Life\" (1947), and Rex Harrison in \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). One of Cukor's earlier ingenues was actress Katharine Hepburn, who debuted in \"A Bill of Divorcement\" (1932) and whose looks and personality left RKO officials at a loss as to how to use her. Cukor directed her in several films, both successful, such as \"Little Women\" (1933) and \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), and disastrous, such as \"Sylvia Scarlett\" (1935). Cukor and Hepburn became close friends off the set.\nCukor was hired to direct \"Gone with the Wind\" by Selznick in 1936, even before the book was published. He spent the next two years involved with pre-production, including supervision of the numerous screen tests of actresses anxious to portray Scarlett O'Hara. Cukor favored Hepburn for the role, but Selznick, concerned about her reputation as \"box office poison\", would not consider her without a screen test, and the actress refused to film one. Of those who did, Cukor preferred Paulette Goddard, but her supposedly illicit relationship with Charlie Chaplin (they were, in fact, secretly married) concerned Selznick.\nBetween his \"Wind\" chores, the director assisted with other projects. He filmed the cave scene for \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1938), and, following the firing of its original director Richard Thorpe, Cukor spent a week on the set of \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Although he filmed no footage, he made crucial changes to the look of Dorothy by eliminating Judy Garland's blonde wig and adjusting her makeup and costume, encouraging her to act in a more natural manner. Additionally, Cukor softened the Scarecrow's makeup and gave Margaret Hamilton a different hairstyle for the Wicked Witch of the West, as well as altering her makeup and other facial features. Cukor also suggested that the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from 20th Century Fox, as the Tin Man.\nCukor spent many hours coaching Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland before the start of filming \"Wind\", but Clark Gable resisted his efforts to get him to master a Southern accent. However, despite rumors about Gable being uncomfortable with Cukor on the set, nothing in the internal memos of David O. Selznick indicates or suggests that Clark Gable had anything to do with Cukor's dismissal from the film. Rather, they show Selznick's mounting dissatisfaction with Cukor's slow pace and quality of work. From a private letter from journalist Susan Myrick to Margaret Mitchell in February 1939: \"George [Cukor] finally told me all about it. He hated [leaving the production] very much he said but he could not do otherwise. In effect he said he is an honest craftsman and he cannot do a job unless he knows it is a good job and he feels the present job is not right. For days, he told me he has looked at the rushes and felt he was failing...the things did not click as it should. Gradually he became convinced that the script was the trouble...So George just told David he would not work any longer if the script was not better and he wanted the [Sidney] Howard script back...he would not let his name go out over a lousy picture...and bull-headed David said 'OK get out!'\"\nSelznick had already been unhappy with Cukor (\"a very expensive luxury\") for not being more receptive to directing other Selznick assignments, even though Cukor had remained on salary since early 1937; and in a confidential memo written in September 1938, four months before principal photography began, Selznick flirted with the idea of replacing him with Victor Fleming. \"I think the biggest black mark against our management to date is the Cukor situation and we can no longer be sentimental about it...We are a business concern and not patrons of the arts.\" Cukor was relieved of his duties, but he continued to work with Leigh and Olivia de Havilland off the set. Various rumors about the reasons behind his dismissal circulated throughout Hollywood. Selznick's friendship with Cukor had crumbled slightly when the director refused other assignments, including \"A Star Is Born\" (1937) and \"Intermezzo\" (1939). Given that Gable and Cukor had worked together before (on \"Manhattan Melodrama\", 1934) and Gable had no objection to working with him then, and given Selznick's desperation to get Gable for Rhett Butler, if Gable had any objections to Cukor, certainly they would have been expressed before he signed his contract for the film. Yet, writer Gore Vidal, in his autobiography \"Point to Point Navigation\", recounted that Gable demanded that Cukor be fired off \"Wind\" because, according to Vidal, the young Gable had been a male hustler and Cukor had been one of his johns. This has been confirmed by Hollywood biographer E.J. Fleming, who has recounted that, during a particularly difficult scene, Gable erupted publicly, screaming: \"I can't go on with this picture. I won't be directed by a fairy. I have to work with a real man.\"\nCukor's dismissal from \"Wind\" freed him to direct \"The Women\" (1939), which has an all-female cast, followed by \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940). He also directed Greta Garbo, another of his favorite actresses, in \"Two-Faced Woman\" (1941), her last film before she retired from the screen.\nIn 1942, at the age of 43, Cukor enlisted in the Signal Corps. Following basic training at Fort Monmouth, he was assigned to the old Paramount studios in Astoria, Queens (where he had directed three films in the early 1930s), although he was permitted to lodge at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan. Working with Irwin Shaw, John Cheever and William Saroyan, among others, Cukor produced training and instructional films for army personnel. Because he lacked an officer's commission, he found it difficult to give orders and directions to his superiors. Despite his efforts to rise above the rank of private\u2014he even called upon Frank Capra to intercede on his behalf\u2014he never achieved officer's status or any commendations during his six months of service. In later years, Cukor suspected his homosexuality impeded him from receiving any advances or honors, although rumors to that effect could not be confirmed.\nThe remainder of the decade was a series of hits and misses for Cukor. Both \"Two-Faced Woman\" and \"Her Cardboard Lover\" (1942) were commercial failures. More successful were \"A Woman's Face\" (1941) with Joan Crawford and \"Gaslight\" (1944) about a woman suffering from suspicion with Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer. During this era, Cukor forged an alliance with screenwriters Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, who had met in Cukor's home in 1939 and married three years later. Over the course of seven years, the trio collaborated on seven films, including \"A Double Life\" (1947) starring Ronald Colman, \"Adam's Rib\" (1949), \"Born Yesterday\" (1950), \"The Marrying Kind\" (1952), and \"It Should Happen to You\" (1954), all featuring Judy Holliday, another Cukor favorite, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for \"Born Yesterday\".\nLater Hollywood career.\nIn December 1952, Cukor was approached by Sid Luft, who proposed the director helm a musical remake of \"A Star Is Born\" (1937) with his then-wife Judy Garland in the lead role. Cukor had declined to direct the earlier film because it was too similar to his own \"What Price Hollywood?\" (1932), but the opportunity to direct his first Technicolor film and work with screenwriter Moss Hart and especially Garland appealed to him, and he accepted. Getting the updated \"A Star Is Born\" (1954) to the screen proved to be a challenge. Cukor wanted Cary Grant for the male lead and went so far as to read the entire script with him, but Grant, while agreeing it was the role of a lifetime, steadfastly refused to do it, and Cukor never forgave him. The director then suggested either Humphrey Bogart or Frank Sinatra tackle the part, but Jack L. Warner rejected both. Stewart Granger was the front runner for a period of time, but he backed out when he was unable to adjust to Cukor's habit of acting out scenes as a form of direction. James Mason eventually was contracted, and filming began on October 12, 1953. As the months passed, Cukor was forced to deal not only with constant script changes but a very unstable Garland, who was plagued by chemical and alcohol dependencies, extreme weight fluctuations, and real and imagined illnesses. In March 1954, a rough cut still missing several musical numbers was assembled, and Cukor had mixed feelings about it. When the last scene finally was filmed in the early morning hours of July 28, 1954, Cukor already had departed the production and was unwinding in Europe. The first preview the following month ran 210 minutes and, despite ecstatic feedback from the audience, Cukor and editor Folmar Blangsted trimmed it to 182 minutes for its New York premiere in October. The reviews were the best of Cukor's career, but Warner executives, concerned the running time would limit the number of daily showings, made drastic cuts without Cukor, who had departed for Pakistan to scout locations for the epic \"Bhowani Junction\" in 1954\u20131955. At its final running time of 154 minutes, the film had lost musical numbers and crucial dramatic scenes, and Cukor called it \"very painful\". He was not included in the film's six Oscar nominations.\nOver the next 10 years, Cukor directed a handful of films with varying success. \"Les Girls\" (1957) won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Musical or Comedy, and \"Wild Is the Wind\" (also 1957) earned Oscar nominations for Anna Magnani and Anthony Quinn, but neither \"Heller in Pink Tights\" nor \"Let's Make Love\" (both 1960) were box-office hits. Another project during this period was the ill-fated \"Something's Got to Give\", an updated remake of the comedy \"My Favorite Wife\" (1940). Cukor liked leading lady Marilyn Monroe but found it difficult to deal with her erratic work habits, frequent absences from the set, and the constant presence of Monroe's acting coach Paula Strasberg. It was reported at the time that after 32 days of shooting, the director had only 7\u00bd minutes of usable film. Footage would be discovered in the 1990s that showed at least 37 minutes of total footage had survived. Then Monroe travelled to New York to appear at a birthday celebration for President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, where she serenaded Kennedy. Studio documents released after Monroe's death confirmed that her appearance at the political fundraising event was approved by Fox executives. The production came to a halt when Cukor had filmed every scene not involving Monroe and the actress remained unavailable. 20th Century Fox executive Peter Levathes fired her and hired Lee Remick to replace her, prompting co-star Dean Martin to quit because his contract guaranteed he would be playing opposite Monroe. It was also reported at the time that with the production already $2 million over budget and everyone back at the starting gate, the studio pulled the plug on the project. However, Monroe successfully renegotiated her contract from $100,000 to $500,000 with a bonus should the film be completed on time. Cukor was to be replaced by Jean Negulesco. There was limited press at the time about the project restarting and even less on Cukor being replaced. When Monroe was found dead in her home in the beginning of August, Cukor would give a high-profile interview discussing Monroe's many reported problems.\nTwo years later, Cukor achieved one of his greatest successes with \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). Throughout filming, there were mounting tensions between the director and designer Cecil Beaton; Cukor was thrilled with leading lady Audrey Hepburn, but the crew was less enchanted with her diva-like demands. Although several reviews were critical of the film \u2013 Pauline Kael said it \"staggers along\" and Stanley Kauffmann thought Cukor's direction was like \"a rich gravy poured over everything, not remotely as delicately rich as in the Asquith\u2013Howard 1937 [\"sic\"] \"Pygmalion\"\"\u2014 the film was a box-office hit which won him the Academy Award for Best Director, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and the Directors Guild of America Award after having been nominated for each several times.\nFollowing \"My Fair Lady\", Cukor became less active. He directed Maggie Smith in \"Travels with My Aunt\" (1972) and helmed the critical and commercial flop \"The Blue Bird\" (1976), the first joint Soviet-American production. He reunited twice with Katharine Hepburn for the television movies \"Love Among the Ruins\" (1975) and \"The Corn Is Green\" (1979). At the age of 82, Cukor directed his final film, \"Rich and Famous\" for MGM in 1981, starring Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen.\nIn 1970, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\nCukor wanted the Academy to host a film festival in Los Angeles however the plan did not materialize and Cukor ended up being co-founder of the Los Angeles International Film Exposition (Filmex) in 1970.\nIn 1976, Cukor was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.\nPersonal life.\nIt was an open secret in Hollywood that Cukor was gay, at a time when society was against it, although he was discreet about his sexual orientation and \"never carried it as a pin on his lapel\", as producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz put it. He was a celebrated \"bon vivant\" whose luxurious home was the site of weekly Sunday afternoon parties attended by closeted celebrities and the attractive young men they met in bars and gyms and brought with them. At least once, in the midst of his reign at MGM, he was arrested on vice charges, but studio executives managed to get the charges dropped and all records of it expunged, and the incident was never publicized by the press. In the late 1950s, Cukor became involved with a considerably younger man named George Towers. He financed his education at the Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences and the University of Southern California, from which Towers graduated with a law degree in 1967. That fall Towers married a woman, and his relationship with Cukor evolved into one of father and son, and for the remainder of Cukor's life the two remained very close.\nBy the mid-1930s, Cukor was not only established as a prominent director, but also socially as an unofficial head of Hollywood's gay subculture. His home, redecorated in 1935 by gay actor-turned-interior designer William Haines with gardens designed by Florence Yoch and Lucile Council, was the scene of many gatherings for the industry's homosexuals. The close-knit group reputedly included Haines and his partner Jimmie Shields, writer W. Somerset Maugham, director James Vincent, screenwriter Rowland Leigh, costume designers Orry-Kelly and Robert Le Maire, and actors John Darrow, Anderson Lawler, Grady Sutton, Robert Seiter, and Tom Douglas. Frank Horn, secretary to Cary Grant, was also a frequent guest.\nCukor's friends were of paramount importance to him and he kept his home filled with their photographs. Regular attendees at his soir\u00e9es included Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Joan Crawford and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, Claudette Colbert, Marlene Dietrich, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, actor Richard Cromwell, Stanley Holloway, Judy Garland, Gene Tierney, No\u00ebl Coward, Cole Porter, director James Whale, costume designer Edith Head, and Norma Shearer, especially after the death of her first husband Irving Thalberg. He often entertained literary figures like Sinclair Lewis, Theodore Dreiser, Hugh Walpole, Aldous Huxley, and Ferenc Moln\u00e1r.\nFrances Goldwyn, second wife and widow of studio mogul Sam Goldwyn, long considered Cukor to be the love of her life, but their relationship remained platonic. According to biographer A. Scott Berg, Frances even arranged for Cukor's burial to be adjacent to her own plot at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.\nThe PBS series \"American Masters\" produced a comprehensive documentary about his life and work titled \"On Cukor\" directed by Robert Trachtenberg in 2000.\nDeath and legacy.\nCukor died of a heart attack on January 24, 1983, and was interred in Grave D, Little Garden of Constancy, Garden of Memory (private), Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale), California. Records in probate court indicated his net worth at the time of his death was $2,377,720.\nIn 1983, the 1954 version of \"A Star Is Born\", considered by many to be his greatest picture, was restored to its original runtime of 181 minutes. The film was initially released at 181 minutes and received enormous critical and box office success. Finding that the length restricted the number of daily showings, the studio cut the movie to 154 minutes. Cukor believed this re-release \"butchered\" the gradual development of the Garland\u2013Mason relationship.\nIn 2013, The Film Society of Lincoln Center presented a comprehensive weeks-long retrospective of his work titled \"The Discreet Charm of George Cukor\".\nIn 2019, Cukor's film \"Gaslight\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nOscar-Related Performances.\nCukor has directed multiple Oscar nominated and winning performances in his feature films.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The mask forms a sealed cover over the nose and mouth, but may also cover the eyes and other vulnerable soft tissues of the face. Most gas masks are also respirators, though the word \"gas mask\" is often used to refer to military equipment (such as a field protective mask), the scope used in this article. Gas masks only protect the user from ingesting or inhaling chemical agents, as well as preventing contact with the user's eyes (many chemical agents affect through eye contact). Most combined gas mask filters will last around 8 hours in a biological or chemical situation. Filters against specific chemical agents can last up to 20 hours.\nAirborne toxic materials may be gaseous (for example, chlorine or mustard gas), or particulates (such as biological agents). Many filters provide protection from both types.\nModern gas masks developed during World War I featured circular lenses made of glass, mica or cellulose acetate to allow vision. Glass and mica were quite brittle and needed frequent replacement. The later Triplex lens style (a cellulose acetate lens sandwiched between glass ones) became more popular, and alongside plain cellulose acetate they became the standard into the 1930s. Panoramic lenses were not popular until the 1930s, but there are some examples of those being used even during the war (Austro-Hungarian 15M). Later, stronger polycarbonate came into use.\nSome masks have one or two compact air filter containers screwed onto inlets, while others have a large air filtration container connected to the gas mask via a hose that is sometimes confused with an \"air-supplied respirator\" in which an alternate supply of fresh air (oxygen tanks) is delivered.\nHistory and development.\nEarly breathing devices.\nAccording to \"Popular Mechanics\", \"The common sponge was used in ancient Greece as a gas mask...\" In 1785, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier invented a respirator.\nPrimitive respirator examples were used by miners and introduced by Alexander von Humboldt in 1799, when he worked as a mining engineer in Prussia. The forerunner to the modern gas mask was invented in 1847 by Lewis P. Haslett, a device that contained elements that allowed breathing through a nose and mouthpiece, inhalation of air through a bulb-shaped filter, and a vent to exhale air back into the atmosphere. \"First Facts\" states that a \"gas mask resembling the modern type\" was patented by Lewis Phectic Haslett of Louisville, Kentucky, who received a patent on June 12, 1849. U.S. patent #6,529 issued to Haslett, described the first \"Inhaler or Lung Protector\" that filtered dust from the air.\nEarly versions were constructed by the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse in 1854 and the physicist John Tyndall in the 1870s. Another early design was the \"Safety Hood and Smoke Protector\" invented by Garrett Morgan in 1912, and patented in 1914. It was a simple device consisting of a cotton hood with two hoses which hung down to the floor, allowing the wearer to breathe the safer air found there. In addition, moist sponges were inserted at the end of the hoses in order to better filter the air.&lt;ref name=\"pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nWorld War I.\nThe First World War brought about the first need for mass-produced gas masks on both sides because of extensive use of chemical weapons. The German army successfully used poison gas for the first time against Allied troops at the Second Battle of Ypres, Belgium on April 22, 1915. An immediate response was cotton wool wrapped in muslin, issued to the troops by May 1. This was followed by the Black Veil Respirator, invented by John Scott Haldane, which was a cotton pad soaked in an absorbent solution which was secured over the mouth using black cotton veiling.\nSeeking to improve on the Black Veil respirator, Cluny Macpherson created a mask made of chemical-absorbing fabric which fitted over the entire head: a canvas hood treated with chlorine-absorbing chemicals, and fitted with a transparent mica eyepiece. Macpherson presented his idea to the British War Office Anti-Gas Department on May 10, 1915; prototypes were developed soon after. The design was adopted by the British Army and introduced as the British Smoke Hood in June 1915; Macpherson was appointed to the War Office Committee for Protection against Poisonous Gases. More elaborate sorbent compounds were added later to further iterations of his helmet (PH helmet), to defeat other respiratory poison gases used such as phosgene, diphosgene and chloropicrin. In summer and autumn 1915, Edward Harrison, Bertram Lambert and John Sadd developed the Large Box Respirator. This canister gas mask had a tin can containing the absorbent materials by a hose and began to be issued in February 1916. A compact version, the Small Box Respirator, was made a universal issue from August 1916.\nIn the first gas masks of World War I, it was initially found that wood charcoal was a good absorbent of poison gases. Around 1918, it was found that charcoals made from the shells and seeds of various fruits and nuts such as coconuts, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, and peach stones performed much better than wood charcoal. These waste materials were collected from the public in recycling programs to assist the war effort.\nThe first effective filtering activated charcoal gas mask in the world was invented in 1915 by Russian chemist Nikolay Zelinsky.\nAlso in World War I, since dogs were frequently used on the front lines, a special type of gas mask was developed that dogs were trained to wear. Other gas masks were developed during World War I and the time following for horses in the various mounted units that operated near the front lines. In America, thousands of gas masks were produced for American as well as Allied troops. Mine Safety Appliances was a chief producer. This mask was later used widely in industry.\nWorld War II.\nThe British Respirator, Anti-Gas (Light) was developed in 1943 by the British. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk compared to World War I gas masks, and fitted the user's face more snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by an easily replaceable filter canister screwed on the side of the gas mask. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses.\nModern mask.\nGas mask development since has mirrored the development of chemical agents in warfare, filling the need to protect against ever more deadly threats, biological weapons, and radioactive dust in the nuclear era. However, for agents that cause harm through contact or penetration of the skin, such as blister agent or nerve agent, a gas mask alone is not sufficient protection, and full protective clothing must be worn in addition to protect from contact with the atmosphere. For reasons of civil defence and personal protection, individuals often buy gas masks since they believe that they protect against the harmful effects of an attack with nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) agents, which is only partially true, as gas masks protect only against respiratory absorption. Most military gas masks are designed to be capable of protecting against all NBC agents, but they can have filter canisters proof against those agents (heavier) or only against riot control agents and smoke (lighter and often used for training purposes). There are lightweight masks solely for protection against riot-control agents and not for NBC situations.\nAlthough thorough training and the availability of gas masks and other protective equipment can nullify the casualty-causing effects of an attack by chemical agents, troops who are forced to operate in full protective gear are less efficient in completing tasks, tire easily, and may be affected psychologically by the threat of attack by those weapons. During the Cold War, it was seen as inevitable that there would be a constant NBC threat on the battlefield and so troops needed protection in which they could remain fully functional; thus, protective gear and especially gas masks have evolved to incorporate innovations in terms of increasing user comfort and compatibility with other equipment (from drinking devices to artificial respiration tubes, to communications systems etc.).\nDuring the Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u201388), Iraq developed its chemical weapons program with the help of European countries such as Germany and France and used them in a large scale against Iranians and Iraqi Kurds. Iran was unprepared for chemical warfare. In 1984, Iran received gas masks from the Republic of Korea and East Germany, but the Korean masks were not suited for the faces of non-East Asian people, the filter lasted for only 15 minutes, and the 5,000 masks bought from East Germany proved to be not gas masks but spray-painting goggles. As late as 1986, Iranian diplomats still travelled in Europe to buy active charcoal and models of filters to produce defensive gear domestically. In April 1988, Iran started domestic production of gas masks by the Iran Yasa factories.\nPrinciples of construction.\nAbsorption is the process of being drawn into a (usually larger) body or substrate, and adsorption is the process of deposition upon a surface. This can be used to remove both particulate and gaseous hazards. Although some form of reaction may take place, it is not necessary; the method may work by attractive charges. For example, if the target particles are positively charged, a negatively charged substrate may be used. Examples of substrates include activated carbon, and zeolites. This effect can be very simple and highly effective, for example using a damp cloth to cover the mouth and nose while escaping a fire. While this method can be effective at trapping particulates produced by combustion, it does not filter out harmful gases which may be toxic or which displace the oxygen required for survival.\nSafety of old gas masks.\nGas masks have a useful lifespan limited by the absorbent capacity of the filter. Filters cease to provide protection when saturated with hazardous chemicals, and degrade over time even if sealed. Most gas masks have sealing caps over the air intake and are stored in vacuum-sealed bags to prevent the filter from degrading due to exposure to humidity and pollutants in normal air. Unused gas mask filters from World War II may not protect the wearer at all, and could be harmful if worn due to long-term changes in the chemical composition of the filter.\nSome World War II and Soviet Cold War gas mask filters contained chrysotile asbestos or crocidolite asbestos. not known to be harmful at the time. It is not reliably known for how long the materials were used in filters.\nTypically, masks using 40\u00a0mm connections are a more recent design. Rubber degrades with time, so boxed unused \"modern type\" masks can be cracked and leak. The US C2 canister (black) contains hexavalent chromium; studies by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps found that the level in the filter was acceptable, but suggest caution when using, as it is a carcinogen.\nModern filter classification.\nThe filter is selected according to the toxic compound. Each filter type protects against a particular hazard and is color-coded:\nParticle filters are often included, because in many cases the hazardous materials are in the form of mist, which can be captured by the particle filter before entering the chemical adsorber. In Europe and jurisdictions with similar rules such as Russia and Australia, filter types are given suffix numbers to indicate their capacity. For non-particle hazards, the level \"1\" is assumed and a number \"2\" is used to indicate a better level. For particles (P), three levels are always given with the number. In the US, only the particle part is further classified by NIOSH air filtration ratings.\nA filter type that can protect against multiple hazards is notated with the European symbols concatenated with each other. Examples include ABEK, ABEK-P3, and ABEK-HgP3. A2B2E2K2-P3 is the highest rating of filter available. An entirely different \"multi/CBRN\" filter class with an olive color is used in the US.\nFiltration may be aided with an air pump to improve wearer comfort. Filtration of air is only possible if there is sufficient oxygen in the first place. Thus, when handling asphyxiants, or when ventilation is poor or the hazards are unknown, filtration is not possible and air must be supplied (with a SCBA system) from a pressurized bottle as in scuba diving.\nUse.\nA modern mask typically is constructed of an elastic polymer in various sizes. It is fitted with various adjustable straps which may be tightened to secure a good fit. Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. Corrective lens inserts are also available for users who require them.\nMasks are typically tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, it is often tested by various challenge agents. Isoamyl acetate, a synthetic banana flavourant, and camphor are often used as innocuous challenge agents. In the military, teargases such as CN, CS, and stannic chloride in a chamber may be used to give the users confidence in the efficacy of the mask.\nShortcomings.\nThe protection of a gas mask comes with some disadvantages. The wearer of a typical gas mask must exert extra effort to breathe, and some of the exhaled air is re-inhaled due to the dead space between the facepiece and the user's face. The exposure to carbon dioxide may exceed its OELs (0.5% by volume/9\u00a0grammes per cubic metre for an eight-hour shift; 1.4%/27 grammes per m3 for 15 minutes' exposure) by a factor of many times: for gas masks and elastomeric respirators, up to 2.6%); and in case of long-term use, headache, dermatitis and acne may appear. The UK HSE textbook recommends limiting the use of respirators without air supply (that is, not PAPR) to one hour.\nReaction and exchange.\nThis principle relies on substances harmful to humans being usually more reactive than air. This method of separation will use some form of generally reactive substance (for example an acid) coating or supported by some solid material. An example is synthetic resins. These can be created with different groups of atoms (usually called functional groups) that have different properties. Thus a resin can be tailored to a particular toxic group. When the reactive substance comes in contact with the resin, it will bond to it, removing it from the air stream. It may also exchange with a less harmful substance at this site.\nThough it was crude, the hypo helmet was a stopgap measure for British troops in the trenches that offered at least some protection during a gas attack. As the months passed and poison gas was used more often, more sophisticated gas masks were developed and introduced. There are two main difficulties with gas mask design:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "12775", "revid": "10239913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12775", "title": "George Frideric Handel", "text": "German-British Baroque composer (1685\u20131759)\nGeorge Frideric (or Frederick) Handel ( ; baptised , ; 23 February 1685 \u2013 14 April 1759) was a German-British Baroque composer well-known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concerti.\nBorn in Halle, Handel spent his early life in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712, where he spent the bulk of his career and became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and by composers of the Italian Baroque. In turn, Handel's music forms one of the peaks of the \"high baroque\" style, bringing Italian opera to its highest development, creating the genres of English oratorio and organ concerto, and introducing a new style into English church music. He is consistently recognised as one of the greatest composers of his age.\nHandel started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. In 1737 he had a physical breakdown, changed direction creatively, addressed the middle class and made a transition to English choral works. After his success with \"Messiah\" (1742), he never composed an Italian opera again. His orchestral \"Water Music\" and \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\" remain steadfastly popular. One of his four coronation anthems, \"Zadok the Priest\", has been performed at every British coronation since 1727. He died a respected and rich man in 1759, aged 74, and was given a state funeral at Westminster Abbey.\nInterest in Handel's music has grown since the mid-20th century. The musicologist Winton Dean wrote that \"Handel was not only a great composer; he was a dramatic genius of the first order.\" His music was admired by Classical-era composers, especially Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.\nEarly years.\nFamily.\nHandel was born in 1685 (the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and Domenico Scarlatti) in Halle, in the Duchy of Magdeburg, then part of Brandenburg\u2013Prussia. His parents were Georg H\u00e4ndel, aged 63, and Dorothea Taust, daughter of Georg Taust, a priest. His father was an eminent barber-surgeon who served the court of Saxe-Weissenfels and the Margraviate of Brandenburg.\nHalle was a relatively prosperous city, home of a salt-mining industry, a centre of trade, and a member of the Hanseatic League. The Margrave of Brandenburg became the administrator of the archepiscopal territories of Mainz, including Magdeburg when they converted, and by the early 17th century held his court in Halle, which attracted renowned musicians. Even the smaller churches all had \"able organists and fair choirs\", and humanities and the letters thrived (Shakespeare was performed in the theatres early in the 17th century). The Thirty Years' War brought extensive destruction to Halle, and by the 1680s it was impoverished. However, since the middle of the war the city had been under the administration of the Duke of Saxony, and soon after the end of the war he would bring musicians trained in Dresden to his court in Weissenfels.\nThe arts and music, however, flourished only among the higher strata, of which Handel's family was not a part. Georg H\u00e4ndel (senior) was born at the beginning of the war and was apprenticed to a barber in Halle at the age of 14 after his father died. When he was 20, he married the widow of the official barber-surgeon of a suburb of Halle, inheriting his practice. With this, Georg determinedly began the process of becoming self-made; by dint of his \"conservative, steady, thrifty, unadventurous\" lifestyle, he guided the five children he had with Anna who reached adulthood into the medical profession (except his youngest daughter, who married a government official). Anna died in 1682. Within a year Georg married again, this time to the daughter of a Lutheran minister, Pastor Georg Taust of the Church of St Bartholomew in Giebichenstein, who himself came from a long line of Lutheran pastors. George Frideric was the second child of this marriage; the first son was stillborn. Two younger sisters arrived afterwards: Dorthea Sophia, born on 6 October 1687, and Johanna Christiana, born on 10 January 1690.\nEarly education.\nEarly in his life, Handel is reported to have attended the \"Gymnasium\" in Halle, where the headmaster, Johann Praetorius, was reputed to be an ardent musician. Whether Handel remained there, and if he did for how long, is unknown, but many biographers suggest that he was withdrawn from school by his father, based on the characterisation of him by Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring. Mainwaring is the source for almost all information (little as it is) of Handel's childhood, and much of that information came from J. C. Smith Jr., Handel's confidant and copyist. Whether it came from Smith or elsewhere, Mainwaring frequently relates misinformation. It is from Mainwaring that the portrait comes of Handel's father as implacably opposed to any musical education. Mainwaring writes that Georg H\u00e4ndel was \"alarmed\" at Handel's very early propensity for music, \"took every measure to oppose it\", including forbidding any musical instrument in the house and preventing Handel from going to any house where they might be found. This did nothing to dampen young Handel's inclination; in fact, it did the reverse. Mainwaring tells the story of Handel's secret attic spinet: Handel \"found means to get a little clavichord privately convey'd to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep\". Although both John Hawkins and Charles Burney credited this tale, Schoelcher found it nearly \"incredible\" and a feat of \"poetic imagination\" and Lang considers it one of the unproven \"romantic stories\" that surrounded Handel's childhood. But Handel had to have had some experience with the keyboard to have made the impression in Weissenfels that resulted in his receiving formal musical training.\nMusical education.\nSometime between the ages of seven and nine, Handel accompanied his father to Weissenfels, where he came under the notice of one whom Handel thereafter always regarded throughout life as his benefactor, Duke Johann Adolf I. Somehow Handel made his way to the court organ in the palace chapel of the Holy Trinity, where he surprised everyone with his playing. Overhearing this performance and noting the youth of the performer caused the Duke, whose suggestions were not to be disregarded, to recommend to Georg H\u00e4ndel that Handel be given musical instruction. Handel's father engaged the organist at the Halle parish church, the young Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow, to instruct Handel. Zachow would be the only teacher that Handel ever had. Because of his church employment, Zachow was an organist \"of the old school\", revelling in fugues, canons, and counterpoint. But he was also familiar with developments in music across Europe and his own compositions \"embraced the new concerted, dramatic style\".\nWhen Zachow discovered the talent of Handel, he introduced him \"to a vast collection of German and Italian music, which he possessed, sacred and profane, vocal and instrumental compositions of different schools, different styles, and of every master\". Many traits considered \"Handelian\" can be traced back to Zachow's music. At the same time Handel continued practice on the harpsichord, and learnt violin and organ, but according to Burney his special affection was for the \"hautbois\" (oboe). Schoelcher speculates that his youthful devotion to the instrument explains the large number of pieces he composed for the oboe.\nWith respect to instruction in composition, in addition to having Handel apply himself to traditional fugue and cantus firmus work, Zachow, recognising Handel's precocious talents, systematically introduced Handel to the variety of styles and masterworks contained in his extensive library. He did this by requiring Handel to copy selected scores. \"I used to write like the devil in those days\", Handel recalled much later.\nMuch of this copying was entered into a notebook that Handel maintained for the rest of his life. Although it has since disappeared, the notebook has been sufficiently described to understand what pieces Zachow wished Handel to study. Among the chief composers represented in this exercise book were Johann Krieger, an \"old master\" in the fugue and prominent organ composer, Johann Caspar Kerll, a representative of the \"southern style\" after his teacher Girolamo Frescobaldi and imitated later by Handel, Johann Jakob Froberger, an \"internationalist\" also closely studied by Dieterich Buxtehude and Johann Sebastian Bach, and Georg Muffat, whose amalgam of French and Italian styles and synthesis of musical forms influenced Handel.\nMainwaring writes that during this time Zachow had begun to have Handel assume some of his church duties. Zachow, Mainwaring asserts, was \"often\" absent, \"from his love of company, and a cheerful glass\", and Handel, therefore, performed on organ frequently. What is more, according to Mainwaring, Handel began composing, at the age of nine, church services for voice and instruments \"and from that time actually did compose a service every week for three years successively\". Mainwaring ends this chapter of Handel's life by concluding that three or four years had been enough to allow Handel to surpass Zachow, and Handel had become \"impatient for another situation\"; \"Berlin was the place agreed upon.\" Carelessness with dates or sequences (and possibly imaginative interpretation by Mainwaring) makes this period confused.\nAfter the death of Handel's father.\nHandel's father died on 11 February 1697. It was German custom for friends and family to compose funeral odes for a substantial burgher like Georg, and young Handel discharged his duty with a poem dated 18 February and signed with his name and (in deference to his father's wishes) \"dedicated to the liberal arts.\" At the time Handel was studying either at Halle's Lutheran Gymnasium or the Latin School.\nMainwaring has Handel travelling to Berlin the next year, 1698. The problem with Mainwaring as an authority for this date, however, is that he tells of how Handel's father communicated with the \"king\" during Handel's stay, declining the Court's offer to send Handel to Italy on a stipend and that his father died \"after his return from Berlin.\" But since Georg H\u00e4ndel died in 1697, either the date of the trip or Mainwaring's statements about Handel's father must be in error. Early biographers solved the problem by making the year of the trip 1696, then noting that at the age of 11, Handel would need a guardian, so they have Handel's father or a friend of the family accompany him, all the while puzzling over why the elder Handel, who wanted Handel to become a lawyer, would spend the sum to lead his son further into the temptation of music as a career. Schoelcher for example has Handel travelling to Berlin at 11, meeting both Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti in Berlin and then returning at the direction of his father. But Ariosti was not in Berlin before the death of Handel's father, and Handel could not have met Bononcini in Berlin before 1702. Modern biographers either accept the year as 1698, since most reliable older authorities agree with it, and discount what Mainwaring says about what took place during the trip or assume that Mainwaring conflated two or more visits to Berlin, as he did with Handel's later trips to Venice.\nUniversity.\nPerhaps to fulfil a promise to his father or simply because he saw himself as \"dedicated to the liberal arts\", on 10 February 1702 Handel matriculated at the University of Halle. That university had only recently been founded. In 1694 the Elector of Brandenburg Frederick III (later Prussian King Frederick I) created the school, largely to provide a lecture forum for the jurist Christian Thomasius who had been expelled from Leipzig for his liberal views. Handel did not enrol in the faculty of law, although he almost certainly attended lectures. Thomasius was an intellectual and academic crusader, who was the first academic to lecture in German and also denounced witch trials. Lang believes that Thomasius instilled in Handel a \"respect for the dignity and freedom of man's mind and the solemn majesty of the law\", principles that would have drawn him to and kept him in England for half a century. Handel also there encountered the theologian and professor of Oriental languages August Hermann Francke, who was particularly solicitous of children, especially orphans. The orphanage he founded became a model and undoubtedly influenced Handel's own charitable impulse when he assigned the rights of \"Messiah\" to London's Foundling Hospital.\nShortly after commencing his university education, Handel (though Lutheran) on 13 March 1702 accepted the position of organist at the Calvinist Cathedral in Halle, the Domkirche, replacing J. C. Leporin, for whom he had acted as assistant. The position, which was a one-year probationary appointment, showed the foundation he had received from Zachow, for a church organist and cantor was a highly prestigious office. From it, he received 5 thalers a year and lodgings in the run-down castle of Moritzburg.\nAround this same time, Handel made the acquaintance of Telemann. Four years Handel's senior, Telemann was studying law at Leipzig and was assisting cantor Johann Kuhnau (Bach's predecessor at the Thomaskirche there). Telemann recalled forty years later in an autobiography for Mattheson's \"Grundlage\": \"The writing of the excellent Johann Kuhnau served as a model for me in fugue and counterpoint; but in fashioning melodic movements and examining them Handel and I were constantly occupied, frequently visiting each other as well as writing letters.\"\nHalle compositions.\nAlthough Mainwaring records that Handel wrote weekly when assistant to Zachow and as probationary organist at Domkirche part of his duty was to provide suitable music, no sacred compositions from his Halle period can now be identified. Mattheson, however, summarised his opinion of Handel's church cantatas written in Halle: \"Handel in those days set very, very long arias and sheerly unending cantatas which, while not possessing the proper knack or correct taste, were perfect so far as harmony is concerned.\"\nEarly chamber works do exist, but it is difficult to date any of them to Handel's time in Halle. Many historians until recently followed Chrysander and designated the six trio sonatas for two oboes and basso continuo as his first known composition, supposedly written in 1696 (when Handel was 11). Lang doubts the dating based on a handwritten date of a copy (1700) and stylistic considerations. Lang writes that the works \"show thorough acquaintance with the distilled sonata style of the Corelli school\" and are notable for \"the formal security and the cleanness of the texture.\" Hogwood considers all of the oboe trio sonatas spurious and even suggests that some parts cannot be performed on the oboe. That authentic manuscript sources do not exist and that Handel never recycled any material from these works makes their authenticity doubtful. Other early chamber works were printed in Amsterdam in 1724 as opus 1, but it is impossible to tell which are early works in their original form, rather than later re-workings by Handel, a frequent practice of his.\nFrom Hamburg to Italy.\nHandel's probationary appointment to Domkirche expired in March 1703. By July Handel was in Hamburg. Since he left no explanation for the move biographers have offered their own speculation.\nDonald Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring's confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father's death) and concludes that since Handel (through a \"friend and relation\" at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick's offer to subsidise his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was no longer able to expect preferment (whether as a musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg\u2013Prussia. Since he was attracted to secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice.\nThe question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King's offer, given that Italy was the centre of opera. Lang suggests that influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel's character was such that he was unable to make himself subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. \"What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture.\" Burrows notes that, like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favours without considering himself a court servant; and so, given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother, Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.\nIn 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt. There he met the composers Johann Mattheson, Christoph Graupner and Reinhard Keiser. Handel's first two operas, \"Almira\" and \"Nero\", were produced in 1705. He produced two other operas, \"Daphne\" and \"Florindo\", performed in 1708.\nMattheson was a close friend of Handel but nearly killed him in a sudden quarrel during a performance of Mattheson's opera \"Die ungl\u00fcckselige Kleopatra, K\u00f6nigin von \u00c4gypten\" in 1704. Handel was saved only by a large button which turned aside Mattheson's sword. The two were afterwards reconciled and remained in correspondence for life. Shortly after his friend's death, Mattheson translated John Mainwaring's biography of Handel into German and had it published in Hamburg at his own expense (\"auf Kosten des \u00dcbersetzers\") in 1761.\nAccording to Mainwaring, in 1706 Handel travelled to Italy at the invitation of Ferdinando de' Medici. (Other sources say Handel was invited by Gian Gastone de' Medici, whom Handel had met in 1703\u201304 in Hamburg.) Ferdinando, who had a keen interest in opera, was trying to make Florence Italy's musical capital by attracting the leading talents of his day. In Italy, Handel met librettist Antonio Salvi, with whom he later collaborated. Handel left for Rome and since opera was (temporarily) banned in the Papal States, composed sacred music for the Roman clergy. His famous \"Dixit Dominus\" (1707) is from this era. He also composed cantatas in pastoral style for musical gatherings in the palaces of duchess Aurora Sanseverino (whom Mainwaring called \"Donna Laura\") one of the most influential patrons from the Kingdom of Naples, and cardinals Pietro Ottoboni, Benedetto Pamphili and Carlo Colonna. Two oratorios, \"La resurrezione\" and \"Il trionfo del tempo\", were produced in a private setting for Ruspoli and Ottoboni in 1709 and 1710, respectively. \"Rodrigo\", his first all-Italian opera, was produced in the Cocomero theatre in Florence in 1707. \"Agrippina\" was first produced in 1709 at Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo in Venice, owned by the Grimanis. The opera, with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani, ran for 27 nights successively. The audience, thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his style, applauded for \"Il caro Sassone\" (\"the dear Saxon\" \u2013 referring to Handel's origins).\nIn London.\nArrival.\nIn June 1710 Handel became \"Kapellmeister\" to George, the Elector of Hanover, but left at the end of the year. It is likely he was also invited by Charles Montagu the former ambassador in Venice to visit England. He visited Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici and her husband in D\u00fcsseldorf on his way to London. With his opera \"Rinaldo\", based on \"La Gerusalemme Liberata\" by the Italian poet Torquato Tasso, Handel enjoyed great success, although it was composed quickly, with many borrowings from his older Italian works. This work contains one of Handel's favourite arias, \"Cara sposa, amante cara\", and the famous Lascia ch'io pianga.\nHandel went back to Halle twice, to attend the wedding of his sister and the baptism of her daughter, but decided to settle permanently in England in 1712. In the summer of 1713, he lived at Mr. Mathew Andrews' estate in Barn Elms, Surrey. He received a yearly income of \u00a3200 from Queen Anne after composing for her the \"Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate\", first performed in 1713.\nOne of his most important patrons was the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork, a young and extremely wealthy member of an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family. While living in the mansion of Lord Burlington, Handel wrote \"Amadigi di Gaula\", a \"magic\" opera, about a damsel in distress, based on the tragedy by Antoine Houdar de la Motte.\nThe conception of an opera as a coherent structure was slow to capture Handel's imagination and he composed no operas for five years. In July 1717 Handel's \"Water Music\" was performed more than three times on the River Thames for King George I and his guests. It is said the compositions spurred reconciliation between Handel and the king, supposedly annoyed by the composer's abandonment of his Hanover post.\nAt Cannons (1717\u201319).\nIn 1717 Handel became house composer at Cannons in Middlesex, where he laid the cornerstone for his future choral compositions in the \"Chandos Anthems\". Romain Rolland wrote that these anthems (or Psalms) stood in relation to Handel's oratorios, much the same way that the Italian cantatas stood to his operas: \"splendid sketches of the more monumental works.\" Another work, which he wrote for the 1st Duke of Chandos, the owner of Cannons, was \"Acis and Galatea\": during Handel's lifetime, it was his most performed work. The musicologist Winton Dean wrote that \"the music catches breath and disturbs the memory\".\nIn 1719 the Duke of Chandos became one of the composer's important patrons and a primary subscriber to his new opera company, the Royal Academy of Music, though his patronage declined after Chandos lost large sums of money in the South Sea Bubble, which burst in 1720 in one of history's greatest financial cataclysms. Handel himself invested in the South Sea Company in 1716 when its share prices were low and sold them before the \"bubble\" burst in 1720. In 1720 Handel invested in the slave-trading Royal African Company (RAC), following in the steps of his patron (the Duke of Chandos was one of the leading investors in the RAC). As noted by the music historian David Hunter, 32 per cent of the subscribers and investors in the Royal Academy of Music, or their close family members, held investments in the RAC as well.\nRoyal Academy of Music (1719\u201334).\nIn May 1719 the 1st Duke of Newcastle, the Lord Chamberlain, ordered Handel to look for new singers. Handel travelled to Dresden to attend the newly built opera. He saw \"Teofane\" by Antonio Lotti, and engaged members of the cast for the Royal Academy of Music, founded by a group of aristocrats to assure themselves a constant supply of baroque opera or opera seria. Handel may have invited John Smith, his fellow student in Halle, and his son Johann Christoph Schmidt, to become his secretary and amanuensis. By 1723 he had moved into a Georgian house at 25 Brook Street, which he rented for the rest of his life. This house, where he rehearsed, copied music, and sold tickets, is now the Handel House Museum. During twelve months between 1724 and 1725, Handel wrote three successful operas, \"Giulio Cesare\", \"Tamerlano\" and \"Rodelinda\". Handel's operas are filled with da capo arias, such as \"Svegliatevi nel core\". After composing \"Silete venti\", he concentrated on opera and stopped writing cantatas. \"Scipio\", from which the regimental slow march of the British Grenadier Guards is derived, was performed as a stopgap, waiting for the arrival of Faustina Bordoni.\nIn 1727 Handel was commissioned to write four anthems for the Coronation ceremony of King George II. One of these, \"Zadok the Priest\", has been played at every British coronation ceremony since. The words to \"Zadok the Priest\" are taken from the King James Bible. In 1728 John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\", which made fun of the type of Italian opera Handel had popularised in London, premiered at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and ran for 62 consecutive performances, the longest run in theatre history up to that time. After nine years the Royal Academy of Music ceased to function but Handel soon started a new company.\nThe Queen's Theatre at the Haymarket (now His Majesty's Theatre), established in 1705 by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh, quickly became an opera house. Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 of Handel's operas premi\u00e8red there. In 1729, Handel became joint manager of the theatre with John James Heidegger.\nHandel travelled to Italy to engage new singers and also composed seven more operas, among them the comic masterpiece \"Partenope\" and the \"magic\" opera \"Orlando\". After two commercially successful English oratorios \"Esther\" and \"Deborah\", he was able to invest again in the South Sea Company. Handel reworked his \"Acis and Galatea\" which then became his most successful work ever. Handel failed to compete with the Opera of the Nobility, who engaged musicians such as Johann Adolph Hasse, Nicolo Porpora and the famous castrato Farinelli. The strong support by Frederick, Prince of Wales caused conflicts in the royal family. In March 1734 Handel composed a wedding anthem \"This is the day which the Lord hath made\", and a serenata \"Parnasso in Festa\" for Anne, Princess Royal.\nDespite the problems the Opera of the Nobility was causing him at the time, Handel's neighbour in Brook Street, Mary Delany, reported on a party she invited Handel to at her house on 12 April 1734 where he was in good spirits:I had Lady Rich and her daughter, Lady Cath. Hanmer and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Percival, Sir John Stanley and my brother, Mrs. Donellan, Strada [star soprano of Handel's operas] and Mr. Coot. Lord Shaftesbury begged of Mr. Percival to bring him, and being a profess'd friend of Mr. Handel (who was here also) was admitted; I never was so well entertained at an opera! Mr. Handel was in the best humour in the world, and played lessons and accompanied Strada and all the ladies that sang from seven o'clock till eleven. I gave them tea and coffee, and about half an hour after nine had a salver brought in of chocolate, mulled white wine, and biscuits. Everybody was easy and seemed pleased.\nOpera at Covent Garden (1734\u201341).\nIn 1733 the Earl of Essex received a letter with the following sentence: \"Handel became so arbitrary a prince, that the Town murmurs.\" The board of chief investors expected Handel to retire when his contract ended, but Handel immediately looked for another theatre. In co-operation with John Rich, he started his third company at Covent Garden Theatre. Rich was renowned for his spectacular productions. He suggested Handel use his small chorus and introduce the dancing of Marie Sall\u00e9, for whom Handel composed \"Terpsicore\". In 1735 he introduced organ concertos between the acts. For the first time, Handel allowed Gioacchino Conti, who had no time to learn his part, to substitute arias. Financially, \"Ariodante\" was a failure, although he introduced ballet suites at the end of each act. \"Alcina\", his last opera with a magic content, and \"Alexander's Feast or the Power of Music\" based on John Dryden's \"Alexander's Feast\" starred Anna Maria Strada del P\u00f2 and John Beard.\nIn early 1737 he produced \"Arminio\" and \"Giustino\", completed \"Berenice\", revived \"Partenope\", and continued with \"Il Parnasso in Festa\", \"Alexander's Feast\", and the revised \"The Triumph of Time and Truth\" which premiered on 23 March. In April Handel suffered a mild stroke, or \"rheumatic palsy\", resulting in temporary paralysis in his right hand and arm. After brief signs of a recovery, he had a relapse in May, with an accompanying deterioration in his mental capacities. He had strong competition from John Frederick Lampe; \"The Dragon of Wantley\" was first performed at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket in London on 16 May 1737. It was a parody of the Italian opera seria.\nIn Autumn 1737 the fatigued Handel reluctantly followed the advice of his physicians and went to take the cure in the spa towns of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Aix-la-Chapelle (Burtscheid) in September. All the symptoms of his \"disorder\" vanished by November. On Christmas Eve Handel finished the score of Faramondo, but its composition was interrupted by that of the Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline. On Boxing Day he began the composition of \"Serse\", the only comic opera that Handel ever wrote and worked with Elisabeth Duparc.\nA harp and organ concerto (HWV 294) and \"Alexander's Feast\" were published in 1738 by John Walsh. He composed music for a musical clock with a pipe organ built by Charles Clay; it was bought by Gerrit Braamcamp and was in 2016 acquired by the Museum Speelklok in Utrecht. \"Deidamia\", his last opera, a co-production with the Earl of Holderness, was performed three times in 1741. Handel gave up the opera business, while he enjoyed more success with his English oratorios.\nOratorio.\n\"Il trionfo del tempo e del disinganno\", an allegory, Handel's first oratorio was composed in Italy in 1707, followed by \"La resurrezione\" in 1708 which uses material from the Bible. The circumstances of \"Esther\" and its first performance, possibly in 1718, are obscure. Another 12 years had passed when an act of piracy caused him to take up \"Esther\" once again. Three earlier performances aroused such interest that they naturally prompted the idea of introducing it to a larger public. Next came \"Deborah\", strongly coloured by the coronation anthems and \"Athaliah\", his third English Oratorio. In these three oratorios Handel laid the foundation for the traditional use of the chorus which marks his later oratorios. Handel became sure of himself, broader in his presentation, and more diverse in his composition.\nIt is evident how much he learnt from Arcangelo Corelli about writing for instruments, and from Alessandro Scarlatti about writing for the solo voice, but there is no single composer who taught him how to write for the chorus. Handel tended more and more to replace Italian soloists with English ones. The most significant reason for this change was the dwindling financial returns from his operas. Thus a tradition was created for oratorios which was to govern their future performance. The performances were given without costumes and action; the singers appeared in their own clothes.\nIn 1736 Handel produced \"Alexander's Feast\". John Beard appeared for the first time as one of Handel's principal singers and became his permanent tenor soloist for the rest of Handel's life. The piece was a great success and it encouraged Handel to make the transition from writing Italian operas to English choral works. In \"Saul\", Handel was collaborating with Charles Jennens and experimenting with three trombones, a carillon and extra-large military kettledrums (from the Tower of London), to be sure \"...it will be most excessive noisy\". \"Saul\" and \"Israel in Egypt\", both from 1739, head the list of great, mature oratorios, in which the da capo aria became the exception and not the rule. \"Israel in Egypt\" consists of little else but choruses, borrowing from the \"Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline\". In his next works, Handel changed his course. In these works he laid greater stress on the effects of orchestra and soloists; the chorus retired into the background. \"L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato\" has a rather diverting character; the work is light and fresh.\nDuring the summer of 1741 the 3rd Duke of Devonshire invited Handel to Dublin, capital of the Kingdom of Ireland, to give concerts for the benefit of local hospitals. Composed in London between 22 August and 14 September 1741, Handel's \"Messiah\" was first performed at the New Music Hall in Fishamble Street, Dublin on 13 April 1742, with 26 boys and five men from the combined choirs of St Patrick's and Christ Church cathedrals participating. Handel secured a balance between soloists and chorus which he never surpassed. In 1746 and 1747 Handel wrote a series of military oratorios \u2013 \"Judas Maccabaeus\", \"Joshua\" and \"Alexander Balus\" \u2013 which celebrate the British monarchy's victories over the Jacobites. In 1747 Handel wrote his oratorio \"Alexander Balus\". This work was produced at Covent Garden Theatre in London, on 23 March 1748, and to the aria \"Hark! hark! He strikes the golden lyre\", Handel wrote the accompaniment for mandolin, harp, violin, viola, and violoncello. Another of his English oratorios, \"Solomon\", was first performed on 17 March 1749 at the Covent Garden Theatre. The text for \"Solomon\" is thought to have been penned by the English Jewish poet and playwright Moses Mendes, based on the biblical stories of the wise King Solomon. \"Solomon\" contains a short and lively instrumental passage for two oboes and strings in act 3, known as \"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\".\nThe use of English soloists reached its height at the first performance of \"Samson\". The work is highly theatrical. The role of the chorus became increasingly important in his later oratorios. \"Jephtha\" was first performed on 26 February 1752; even though it was his last oratorio, it was no less a masterpiece than his earlier works.\nLater years.\nIn 1749 Handel composed \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\"; 12,000 people attended the first performance. In 1750 he arranged a performance of \"Messiah\" to benefit the Foundling Hospital, a children's home in London. The performance was considered a great success and was followed by annual concerts that continued throughout his life. In recognition of his patronage, Handel was made a governor of the Hospital the day after his initial concert. He bequeathed a copy of \"Messiah\" to the institution upon his death. His involvement with the Foundling Hospital is today commemorated with a permanent exhibition in London's Foundling Museum, which also holds the \"Gerald Coke Handel Collection\". In addition to the Foundling Hospital, Handel also gave to a charity that assisted impoverished musicians and their families.\nIn August 1750, on a journey back from Germany to London, Handel was seriously injured in a carriage accident between The Hague and Haarlem in the Netherlands. In 1751 one of his eyes started to fail; the cause was a cataract which was operated on by the medical charlatan Chevalier Taylor. This did not improve his eyesight and possibly made it worse. He was completely blind by 1752. He died in 1759 at home in Brook Street, at the age of 74. The last performance he attended was of \"Messiah\". Handel was buried in Westminster Abbey. More than three thousand mourners attended his funeral, which was given full state honours.\nHandel never married and kept his personal life private. His initial will bequeathed the bulk of his estate to his niece Johanna, but four codicils distributed much of his estate to other relations, servants, friends and charities.\nHandel owned an art collection that was auctioned posthumously in 1760. The auction catalogue listed approximately seventy paintings and ten prints, his other paintings having been bequeathed.\nWorks.\nOverview.\nHandel's compositions include 42 operas, 24 oratorios, more than 120 cantatas, trios and duets, numerous arias, odes and serenatas, solo and trio sonatas, 18 concerti grossi, and 12 organ concertos. His most famous work, the oratorio \"Messiah\" with its \"Hallelujah\" chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music. The Lobkowicz Palace in Prague holds Mozart's copy of \"Messiah\", complete with handwritten annotations. Among the works with opus numbers published and popularised in his lifetime are the Organ concertos Op. 4 and Op. 7, together with the Opus 3 and Opus 6 Concerti grossi; the latter incorporates an earlier organ concerto, \"The Cuckoo and the Nightingale\", in which birdsong is imitated in the upper registers of the organ. Also notable are his 16 keyboard suites, especially \"The Harmonious Blacksmith\".\nCatalogues.\nThe first published catalogue of Handel's works appeared as an appendix to Mainwaring's \"Memoirs\". Between 1787 and 1797 Samuel Arnold compiled a 180-volume collection of Handel's works\u2014however, it was far from complete. Also incomplete was the collection produced between 1843 and 1858 by the English Handel Society (founded by Sir George Macfarren).\nThe 105-volume \"H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft\" (\"Handel Society\") edition was published between 1858 and 1902 \u2013 mainly due to the efforts of Friedrich Chrysander. For modern performance, the realisation of the basso continuo reflects 19th-century practice. Vocal scores drawn from the edition were published by Novello in London, but some scores, such as the vocal score to \"Samson\", are incomplete.\nThe continuing \"Hallische H\u00e4ndel-Ausgabe\" edition was first inaugurated in 1955 in the Halle region in Saxony-Anhalt in East Germany. It did not start as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera \"Serse\" was published with the title character recast as a tenor, reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints were found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985, a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The reunification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.\nBetween 1978 and 1986 the German academic Bernd Baselt catalogued Handel's works in his \"H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis\" publication. The catalogue has achieved wide acceptance and is used as the modern numbering system, with each of Handel's works designated an \"HWV\" number \u2013 for example, \"Messiah\" is catalogued as \"HWV 56\".\nLegacy.\nHandel's works were collected and preserved by two men: Sir Samuel Hellier, a country squire whose musical acquisitions form the nucleus of the Shaw\u2013Hellier Collection, and the abolitionist Granville Sharp. The catalogue accompanying the National Portrait Gallery exhibition marking the tercentenary of the composer's birth calls them two men of the late eighteenth century \"who have left us solid evidence of the means by which they indulged their enthusiasm\". With his English oratorios, such as \"Messiah\" and \"Solomon\", the coronation anthems, and other works including \"Water Music\" and \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\", Handel became a national icon in Britain, and featured in the BBC series \"The Birth of British Music: Handel \u2013 The Conquering Hero\".\nAfter his death, Handel's Italian operas fell into obscurity, except for selections such as the aria from \"Serse\", \"Ombra mai fu\". The oratorios continued to be performed but not long after Handel's death they were thought to need some modernisation, and Mozart orchestrated German versions of \"Messiah\" and other works. Throughout the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, particularly in the Anglophone countries, his reputation rested primarily on his English oratorios, which were customarily performed by choruses of amateur singers on solemn occasions. The centenary of his death, in 1859, was celebrated by a performance of \"Messiah\" at The Crystal Palace, involving 2,765 singers and 460 instrumentalists, who played for an audience of about 10,000 people.\nRecent decades have revived his secular cantatas and what one might call 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, \"Ode for St. Cecilia's Day\" (1739) (set to texts by John Dryden) and \"Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne\" (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as \"Acis and Galatea\" (1719), \"Hercules\" (1745) and \"Semele\" (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes fully staged as operas. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, in addition to his renown as an instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.\nReception.\nHandel has generally been accorded high esteem by fellow composers, both in his own time and since. Johann Sebastian Bach attempted, unsuccessfully, to meet Handel while he was visiting Halle. (Handel was born in the same year as Bach and Domenico Scarlatti.) Mozart is reputed to have said of him, \"Handel understands affect better than any of us. When he chooses, he strikes like a thunderbolt.\" To Beethoven he was \"the master of us all... the greatest composer that ever lived. I would uncover my head and kneel before his tomb.\" Beethoven emphasised above all the simplicity and popular appeal of Handel's music when he said, \"Go to him to learn how to achieve great effects, by such simple means\".\nBorrowings.\nSince 1831, when William Crotch raised the issue in his \"Substance of Several Lectures on Music\", scholars have extensively studied Handel's \"borrowing\" of music from other composers. Summarising the field in 2005, the musicologist Richard Taruskin wrote that Handel \"seems to have been the champion of all parodists, adapting both his own works and those of other composers in unparalleled numbers and with unparalleled exactitude.\" Among the composers whose music Handel apparently reused are Alessandro Stradella, Gottlieb Muffat, Alessandro Scarlatti, Domenico Scarlatti Giacomo Carissimi, Georg Philipp Telemann, Carl Heinrich Graun, Leonardo Vinci, Jacobus Gallus, Francesco Antonio Urio, Reinhard Keiser, Francesco Gasparini, Giovanni Bononcini, William Boyce, Henry Lawes, Michael Wise, Agostino Steffani, Franz Johann Habermann, and numerous others.\nIn an essay published in 1985, John H. Roberts demonstrated that Handel's borrowings were unusually frequent even for his own era, enough to have been criticised by contemporaries (notably Johann Mattheson); Roberts suggested several reasons for Handel's practice, including Handel's attempts to make certain works sound more up-to-date and, more radically, his \"basic lack of facility in inventing original ideas\" \u2013 though Roberts took care to argue that this does not \"diminish Handel's stature\", which should be \"judged not by his methods, still less by his motives in employing them, but solely by the effects he achieves.\"\nHomages.\nAfter Handel's death, many composers wrote works based on or inspired by his music. The first movement from Louis Spohr's Symphony No. 6, Op.\u00a0116, \"The Age of Bach and Handel\", resembles two melodies from Handel's \"Messiah\". In 1797 Beethoven published the \"12 Variations in G major on \"See the conqu'ring hero comes\" from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel\", for cello and piano. In 1822 Beethoven composed the overture \"The Consecration of the House\", which also bears the influence of Handel. The guitar virtuoso Mauro Giuliani composed his \"Variations on a Theme by Handel\", Op. 107 for guitar, based on Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord.\nIn 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel's harpsichord suites, Johannes Brahms wrote the \"Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel\", Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by Richard Wagner). Several works by the French composer F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Guilmant use Handel's themes; for example, his \"March on a Theme by Handel\" uses a theme from \"Messiah\". French composer and flautist Philippe Gaubert wrote his \"Petite marche\" for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel's Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. The Argentine composer Luis Gianneo composed his \"Variations on a Theme by Handel\" for piano. In 1911 the Australian-born composer and pianist Percy Grainger based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled \"Variations on Handel's 'The Harmonious Blacksmith' \". Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create \"Handel in the Strand\", one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). Arnold Schoenberg's Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B-flat major (1933) was composed after Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.\nVeneration.\nIn the Lutheran Calendar of Saints Handel and Bach share the date 28 July with Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, and Handel and Bach are commemorated in the calendar of saints prepared by the Order of Saint Luke for the use of the United Methodist Church. The Book of Common Worship of the Presbyterian Church (USA) (Westminster John Knox Press, 2018) commemorates him on 20 April.\nFictional depictions.\nIn 1942 Handel was the subject of the British biographical film \"The Great Mr. Handel\" directed by Norman Walker and starring Wilfrid Lawson. It was made at Denham Studios by the Rank Organisation, and shot in Technicolor. He is also the central character in the television films \"God Rot Tunbridge Wells!\" (1985) and \"Handel's Last Chance\" (1996) and the stage play \"All the Angels\" (2015). Handel was portrayed by Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 as the antagonist in the film \"Farinelli\" (1994).\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "12776", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12776", "title": "Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina", "text": "Italian Renaissance composer (c. 1525 \u2013 1594)\nGiovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (between 3 February 1525 and 2 February 1526 \u2013 2 February 1594) was an Italian composer of late Renaissance music. The central representative of the Roman School, with Orlande de Lassus and Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria, Palestrina is considered the leading composer of late 16th-century Europe. Palestrina was one of the few Renaissance composers never entirely forgotten, but it was the so-called \"Palestrinian style\" of counterpoint\u2014especially as codified by Johann Joseph Fux\u2014rather than his individual compositions that exerted the greatest influence.\nBorn in the town of Palestrina in the Papal States, Palestrina moved to Rome as a child and underwent musical studies there. In 1551, Pope Julius III appointed him \"maestro di cappella\" of the Cappella Giulia at St. Peter's Basilica. He left the post four years later, unable to continue as a layman under the papacy of Paul IV, and held similar positions at St. John Lateran and Santa Maria Maggiore in the following decade. Palestrina returned to the Cappella Giulia in 1571 and remained at St Peter's until his death in 1594.\nPrimarily known for his masses and motets, which number over 105 and 250 respectively, Palestrina had a long-lasting influence on the development of church and secular music in Europe, especially on the development of counterpoint. According to \"Grove Music Online\", Palestrina's \"success in reconciling the functional and aesthetic aims of Catholic church music in the post-Tridentine period earned him an enduring reputation as the ideal Catholic composer, as well as giving his style (or, more precisely, later generations' selective view of it) an iconic stature as a model of perfect achievement.\"\nBiography.\nPalestrina was born in the town of Palestrina, near Rome, then part of the Papal States, to Neapolitan parents, Santo and Palma Pierluigi, in 1525, possibly on 3 February. His mother died on 16 January 1536, when Palestrina was 10. Documents suggest that he first visited Rome in 1537, when he was listed as a chorister at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the papal basilicas of the Diocese of Rome, which allowed him to learn literature and music. In 1540, he moved to Rome, where he studied in the school of the Huguenot Claude Goudimel. He also studied with Robin Mallapert and Firmin Lebel. He spent most of his career in the city.\nPalestrina came of age as a musician under the influence of the northern European style of polyphony, which owed its dominance in Italy primarily to two influential Netherlandish composers, Guillaume Du Fay and Josquin des Prez, who had spent significant portions of their careers there. Italy itself had yet to produce anyone of comparable fame or skill in polyphony. Orlando di Lasso, who accompanied Palestrina in his early years, also played an important role in the formation of his style as an adviser.\nFrom 1544 to 1551, Palestrina was the organist of the Cathedral of St. Agapito, the principal church of his native city. In 1551 Pope Julius III (previously the Bishop of Palestrina) appointed Palestrina \"maestro di cappella\" or musical director of the Cappella Giulia, (Julian Chapel, in the sense of choir), the choir of the chapter of canons at St. Peter's Basilica. Palestrina dedicated to Julius III his first published compositions (1554), a book of Masses. It was the first book of Masses by a native composer, since in the Italian states of Palestrina's day, most composers of sacred music were from the Low Countries, France, or Spain. In fact the book was modelled on one by Crist\u00f3bal de Morales: the woodcut in the front is almost an exact copy of the one from the book by the Spanish composer.\nIn 1555, Pope Paul IV ordered that all papal choristers should be clerical. As Palestrina married early in life and had four children, he was unable to continue in the chapel as a layman.\nDuring the next decade, Palestrina held positions similar to his Julian Chapel appointment at other chapels and churches in Rome, notably the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran (1555\u20131560, a post previously held by Lassus), and Santa Maria Maggiore (1561\u20131566). In 1571 he returned to the Julian Chapel and remained at St Peter's for the rest of his life. The decade of the 1570s was difficult for him personally: he lost his brother, two of his sons, and his wife, Lucrezia Gori, in three separate outbreaks of the plague (1572, 1575, and 1580, respectively). He seems to have considered becoming a priest at this time, but instead he remarried, this time to a wealthy widow, Virginia Dormoli. This finally gave him financial independence (he was not paid well as choirmaster) and he was able to compose prolifically until his death.\nHe died in Rome of pleurisy on 2 February 1594. As was usual, Palestrina was buried on the same day he died, in a plain coffin with a lead plate on which was inscribed \"Ioannes Petrus Aloysius Praenestinus Music\u00e6 Princeps\". A five-part \"Libera me Domine\" psalm for three choirs was sung at the funeral. Palestrina's funeral was held at St. Peter's, and he was buried beneath the floor of the basilica. His tomb was later covered by new construction and attempts to locate his grave have been unsuccessful.\nItalian composers Giovanni Maria Nanino and Gregorio Allegri, both of them disciples of his school, continued his works.\nMusic.\nOverview.\nPalestrina left hundreds of compositions, including 105 masses, 68 offertories, at least 140 madrigals and more than 300 motets. In addition, there are at least 72 hymns, 35 magnificats, 11 litanies, and four or five sets of lamentations. The \"Gloria\" melody from Palestrina's \"Magnificat Tertii Toni\" (1591) is widely used today in the resurrection hymn tune, \"Victory\" (The Strife Is O'er).\nHis attitude toward madrigals was somewhat enigmatic: whereas in the preface to his collection of \"Canticum canticorum\" (Song of Songs) motets (1584) he renounced the setting of profane texts, only two years later he was back in print with Book II of his secular madrigals (some of these being among the finest compositions in the medium). He published just two collections of madrigals with profane texts, one in 1555 and another in 1586. The other two collections were spiritual madrigals, a genre beloved by the proponents of the Counter-Reformation.\nPalestrina's masses show how his compositional style developed over time. His \"Missa sine nomine\" seems to have been particularly attractive to Johann Sebastian Bach, who studied and performed it while writing the Mass in B minor. Most of Palestrina's masses appeared in thirteen volumes printed between 1554 and 1601, the last seven published after his death.\nOne of his most important works, the \"Missa Papae Marcelli\" (Pope Marcellus Mass) has been historically associated with erroneous information involving the Council of Trent. According to this tale (which forms the basis of Hans Pfitzner's opera \"Palestrina\"), it was composed in order to persuade the Council of Trent that a draconian ban on the polyphonic treatment of text in sacred music (as opposed, that is, to a more directly intelligible homophonic treatment) was unnecessary. However, more recent scholarship shows that this mass was in fact composed before the cardinals convened to discuss the ban (possibly as much as 10 years before). Historical data indicates that the Council of Trent, as an official body, never actually banned any church music and failed to make any ruling or official statement on the subject. These stories originated from the unofficial points-of-view of some Council attendees who discussed their ideas with those not privy to the council's deliberations. Those opinions and rumors have, over centuries, been transmuted into fictional accounts, put into print, and often incorrectly taught as historical fact. While Palestrina's compositional motivations are not known, he may have been quite conscious of the need for intelligible text; however, this was not to conform with any doctrine of the Counter-Reformation, because no such doctrine exists. His characteristic style remained consistent from the 1560s until the end of his life. Roche's hypothesis that Palestrina's seemingly dispassionate approach to expressive or emotive texts could have resulted from his having to produce many to order, or from a deliberate decision that any intensity of expression was unbecoming in church music, reflects modern expectations about expressive freedom and underestimates the extent to which the mood of Palestrina's settings is adapted to the liturgical occasions for which the texts were set, rather than the line-by-line meaning of the text, and depends on the distinctive characters of the church modes and variations in vocal grouping for expressive effect. Performing editions and recordings of Palestrina have tended to favour his works in the more familiar modes and standard (SATB) voicings, under-representing the expressive variety of his settings.\nThere are two comprehensive editions of Palestrina's works: a 33-volume edition published by Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, in Leipzig Germany between 1862 and 1894 edited by Franz Xaver Haberl, and a 34-volume edition published in the mid twentieth century, by Fratelli Scalera, in Rome, Italy edited by R. Casimiri and others.\nThe \"Palestrina Style\".\nOne of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the \"weak\" beats in a measure. This produced a smoother and more consonant type of polyphony which is now considered to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer in the wake of Josquin des Prez (d. 1521).\nThe \"Palestrina style\" taught in college courses covering Renaissance counterpoint is often based on the codification by the 18th-century composer and theorist Johann Joseph Fux, published as \"Gradus ad Parnassum\" (Steps to Parnassus, 1725). Citing Palestrina as his model, Fux divided counterpoint into five \"species\" (hence the term \"species counterpoint\"), designed as exercises for the student, which deployed progressively more elaborate rhythmic combinations of voices while adhering to strict harmonic and melodic requirements. The method was widely adopted and was the main basis of contrapuntal training in the 19th century, but Fux had introduced a number of simplifications to the Palestrina style, notably the obligatory use of a \"cantus firmus\" in semibreves, which were corrected by later authors such as Knud Jeppesen and R. O. Morris. Palestrina's music conforms in many ways to Fux's rules, particularly in the fifth species but does not fit his pedagogical format.\nThe main insight, that the \"pure\" style of polyphony achieved by Palestrina followed an invariable set of stylistic and combinational requirements, was justified. Fux's manual was endorsed by his contemporary J.S. Bach, who himself arranged two of Palestrina's masses for performance.\nAccording to Fux, Palestrina had established and followed these basic guidelines:\nFux omits to mention the manner in which the musical phrasing of Palestrina followed the syntax of the sentences he was setting to music, something not always observed by earlier composers. Also to be noticed in Palestrina is a great deal of tone painting. Elementary examples of this are descending musical motion with Latin words like \"descendit\" (descends) or of a static musical or cadential moment with the words \"de coelis\" (from heaven).\nReputation.\nPalestrina was extremely famous in his day, and if anything, his reputation and influence increased after his death. J.S. Bach studied and hand-copied Palestrina's first book of \"Masses\", and in 1742 wrote his own adaptation of the Kyrie and Gloria of the \"Missa sine nomine\". Felix Mendelssohn placed him in the pantheon of the greatest musicians, writing, \"I always get upset when some praise only Beethoven, others only Palestrina and still others only Mozart or Bach. All four of them, I say, or none at all.\"\nConservative music of the Roman school continued to be written in Palestrina's style (which in the 17th century came to be known as the \"prima prattica\") by such students of his as Giovanni Maria Nanino, Ruggiero Giovanelli, Arcangelo Crivelli, Teofilo Gargari, Francesco Soriano, and Gregorio Allegri. As late as the 1750s, Palestrina's style was still the reference for composers working in the motet form, as can be seen by Francesco Barsanti's \"Sei Antifones\" 'in the style of Palestrina' (c. 1750; published by [Peter] Welcker, c. 1762).\nMuch research on Palestrina was done in the 19th century by Giuseppe Baini, who published a monograph in 1828 which made Palestrina famous again and reinforced the already existing legend that he was the \"Saviour of Church Music\" during the reforms of the Council of Trent.\n20th and 21st century scholarship by and large retains the view that Palestrina was a strong and refined composer whose music represents a summit of technical perfection. Contemporary analysis highlighted the modern qualities in the compositions of Palestrina such as research of color and sonority, use of sonic grouping in large-scale setting, interest in vertical as well as horizontal organization, studied attention to text setting. These unique characteristics, together with effortless delivery and an indefinable \"otherness\", constitute to this day the attraction of Palestrina's work.\nThe opera \"Palestrina\" by Hans Pfitzner depicts Palestrina working to preserve polyphony during the Council of Trent.\nThe Cagliari music conservatory in Cagliari, Italy is named in his honor.\nIn 2009 a film about the composer was produced by German television ZDF/Arte.

The expanding ring of waves is the wave group or wave packet, within which one can discern individual waves that travel faster than the group as a whole. The amplitudes of the individual waves grow as they emerge from the trailing edge of the group and diminish as they approach the leading edge of the group.\nHistory.\nThe idea of a group velocity distinct from a wave's phase velocity was first proposed by W.R. Hamilton in 1839, and the first full treatment was by Rayleigh in his \"Theory of Sound\" in 1877.\nDefinition and interpretation.\nConsider a linear evolution model of waves that admits as fundamental solutions the oscillators formula_1, where formula_2 and formula_3 are bound to satisfy a certain constraint. For instance, the free linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation in one dimension:\nformula_4\nsatisfies the above description with formula_5. The group velocity formula_6 is defined by the equation:\nformula_7.\nHere, \"\u03c9\" is the wave's angular frequency (usually expressed in radians per second), and \"k\" is the angular wavenumber (usually expressed in radians per meter). The phase velocity is: \"v\"p \n \"\u03c9\"/\"k\".\nThe function \"\u03c9\"(\"k\"), which gives \"\u03c9\" as a function of \"k\", is known as the dispersion relation.\n \"ak\" + \"b\", \"b\" \u2260 0), then the group velocity and phase velocity are different. The envelope of a wave packet (see figure on right) will travel at the group velocity, while the individual peaks and troughs within the envelope will move at the phase velocity.\n \"v\"p /2. This underlies the \"Kelvin wake pattern\" for the bow wave of all ships and swimming objects. Regardless of how fast they are moving, as long as their velocity is constant, on each side the wake forms an angle of 19.47\u00b0 = arcsin(1/3) with the line of travel. \nDerivation.\nOne derivation of the formula for group velocity is as follows.\nConsider a wave packet as a function of position \"x\" and time \"t\": \"\u03b1\"(\"x\",\"t\").\nLet \"A\"(\"k\") be its Fourier transform at time ,\nformula_9\nBy the superposition principle, the wavepacket at any time \"t\" is\nformula_10\nwhere \"\u03c9\" is implicitly a function of \"k\".\nAssume that the wave packet \"\u03b1\" is almost monochromatic, so that \"A\"(\"k\") is sharply peaked around a central wavenumber \"k\"0.\nThen, linearization gives\nformula_11\nwhere \nformula_12 and formula_13 \n(see next section for discussion of this step). Then, after some algebra,\nformula_14\nThere are two factors in this expression. The first factor, formula_15, describes a perfect monochromatic wave with wavevector \"k\"0, with peaks and troughs moving at the phase velocity formula_16 within the envelope of the wavepacket.\nThe other factor, \nformula_17, \ngives the envelope of the wavepacket. This envelope function depends on position and time \"only\" through the combination formula_18.\nTherefore, the envelope of the wavepacket travels at velocity \nformula_19 \nwhich explains the group velocity formula.\nOther expressions.\nFor light, the refractive index \"n\", vacuum wavelength \"\u03bb0\", and wavelength in the medium \"\u03bb\", are related by\nformula_20\nwith \"v\"p\u00a0\n\u00a0\"\u03c9\"/\"k\" the phase velocity.\nThe group velocity, therefore, can be calculated by any of the following formulas,\nformula_21\nDispersion.\nPart of the previous derivation is the Taylor series approximation that:\nformula_22\nIf the wavepacket has a relatively large frequency spread, or if the dispersion \"\u03c9(k)\" has sharp variations (such as due to a resonance), or if the packet travels over very long distances, this assumption is not valid, and higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion become important.\nAs a result, the envelope of the wave packet not only moves, but also \"distorts,\" in a manner that can be described by the material's group velocity dispersion. Loosely speaking, different frequency-components of the wavepacket travel at different speeds, with the faster components moving towards the front of the wavepacket and the slower moving towards the back. Eventually, the wave packet gets stretched out. This is an important effect in the propagation of signals through optical fibers and in the design of high-power, short-pulse lasers.\nIn three dimensions.\nFor waves traveling through three dimensions, such as light waves, sound waves, and matter waves, the formulas for phase and group velocity are generalized in a straightforward way:\nwhere formula_25 means the gradient of the angular frequency \u03c9 as a function of the wave vector formula_26, and formula_27 is the unit vector in direction k.\nIf the waves are propagating through an anisotropic (i.e., not rotationally symmetric) medium, for example a crystal, then the phase velocity vector and group velocity vector may point in different directions.\nIn lossy or gainful media.\nThe group velocity is often thought of as the velocity at which energy or information is conveyed along a wave. In most cases this is accurate, and the group velocity can be thought of as the signal velocity of the waveform. However, if the wave is travelling through an absorptive or gainful medium, this does not always hold. In these cases the group velocity may not be a well-defined quantity, or may not be a meaningful quantity.\nIn his text \"Wave Propagation in Periodic Structures\", Brillouin argued that in a lossy medium the group velocity ceases to have a clear physical meaning. An example concerning the transmission of electromagnetic waves through an atomic gas is given by Loudon. Another example is mechanical waves in the solar photosphere: The waves are damped (by radiative heat flow from the peaks to the troughs), and related to that, the energy velocity is often substantially lower than the waves' group velocity.\nDespite this ambiguity, a common way to extend the concept of group velocity to complex media is to consider spatially damped plane wave solutions inside the medium, which are characterized by a \"complex-valued\" wavevector. Then, the imaginary part of the wavevector is arbitrarily discarded and the usual formula for group velocity is applied to the real part of wavevector, i.e.,\nformula_28\nOr, equivalently, in terms of the real part of complex refractive index, \"n\" = \"n\" + \"i\u03ba\", one has\nformula_29\nIt can be shown that this generalization of group velocity continues to be related to the apparent speed of the peak of a wavepacket. The above definition is not universal, however: alternatively one may consider the time damping of standing waves (real k, complex \u03c9), or, allow group velocity to be a complex-valued quantity. Different considerations yield distinct velocities, yet all definitions agree for the case of a lossless, gainless medium.\nThe above generalization of group velocity for complex media can behave strangely, and the example of anomalous dispersion serves as a good illustration.\nAt the edges of a region of anomalous dispersion, formula_30 becomes infinite (surpassing even the speed of light in vacuum), and formula_30 may easily become negative \n(its sign opposes Rek) inside the band of anomalous dispersion.\nSuperluminal group velocities.\nSince the 1980s, various experiments have verified that it is possible for the group velocity (as defined above) of laser light pulses sent through lossy materials, or gainful materials, to significantly exceed the speed of light in vacuum c. The peaks of wavepackets were also seen to move faster than c.\nIn all these cases, however, there is no possibility that signals could be carried faster than the speed of light in vacuum, since the high value of vg does not help to speed up the true motion of the sharp wavefront that would occur at the start of any real signal. Essentially the seemingly superluminal transmission is an artifact of the narrow band approximation used above to define group velocity and happens because of resonance phenomena in the intervening medium. In a wide band analysis it is seen that the apparently paradoxical speed of propagation of the signal envelope is actually the result of local interference of a wider band of frequencies over many cycles, all of which propagate perfectly causally and at phase velocity. The result is akin to the fact that shadows can travel faster than light, even if the light causing them always propagates at light speed; since the phenomenon being measured is only loosely connected with causality, it does not necessarily respect the rules of causal propagation, even if it under normal circumstances does so and leads to a common intuition.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "12781", "revid": "28916033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12781", "title": "Group action", "text": "Transformations induced by a mathematical group\nIn mathematics, a group action of a group formula_1 on a set formula_2 is a group homomorphism from formula_1 to some group (under function composition) of functions from formula_2 to itself. It is said that formula_1 acts on formula_2.\nMany sets of transformations form a group under function composition; for example, the rotations around a point in the plane. It is often useful to consider the group as an abstract group, and to say that one has a group action of the abstract group that consists of performing the transformations of the group of transformations. The reason for distinguishing the group from the transformations is that, generally, a group of transformations of a structure acts also on various related structures; for example, the above rotation group also acts on triangles by transforming triangles into triangles.\nIf a group acts on a structure, it will usually also act on objects built from that structure. For example, the group of Euclidean isometries acts on Euclidean space and also on the figures drawn in it; in particular, it acts on the set of all triangles. Similarly, the group of symmetries of a polyhedron acts on the vertices, the edges, and the faces of the polyhedron.\nA group action on a vector space is called a representation of the group. In the case of a finite-dimensional vector space, it allows one to identify many groups with subgroups of the general linear group formula_7, the group of the invertible matrices of dimension formula_8 over a field formula_9.\nThe symmetric group formula_10 acts on any set with formula_8 elements by permuting the elements of the set. Although the group of all permutations of a set depends formally on the set, the concept of group action allows one to consider a single group for studying the permutations of all sets with the same cardinality.\nDefinition.\nLeft group action.\nIf formula_1 is a group with identity element formula_13, and formula_14 is a set, then a (\"left\") \"group action\" formula_15 of formula_1 on X is a function\n formula_17\nthat satisfies the following two axioms:\nfor all g and h in G and all x in formula_14.\nThe group formula_1 is then said to act on formula_14 (from the left). A set formula_14 together with an action of formula_1 is called a (\"left\") formula_1-\"set\".\nIt can be notationally convenient to curry the action formula_15, so that, instead, one has a collection of transformations \"\u03b1\"\"g\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"X\", with one transformation \"\u03b1\"\"g\" for each group element \"g\" \u2208 \"G\". The identity and compatibility relations then read\n formula_25\nand\n formula_26\nThe second axiom states that the function composition is compatible with the group multiplication; they form a commutative diagram. This axiom can be shortened even further, and written as formula_27.\nWith the above understanding, it is very common to avoid writing formula_15 entirely, and to replace it with either a dot, or with nothing at all. Thus, \"\u03b1\"(\"g\", \"x\") can be shortened to \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" or \"gx\", especially when the action is clear from context. The axioms are then\n formula_29\n formula_30\nFrom these two axioms, it follows that for any fixed g in formula_1, the function from X to itself which maps x to \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" is a bijection, with inverse bijection the corresponding map for \"g\"\u22121. Therefore, one may equivalently define a group action of G on X as a group homomorphism from G into the symmetric group Sym(\"X\") of all bijections from X to itself.\nRight group action.\nLikewise, a \"right group action\" of formula_1 on formula_14 is a function\n formula_34\nthat satisfies the analogous axioms:\nfor all g and h in G and all x in X.\nThe difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product \"gh\" acts on x. For a left action, h acts first, followed by g second. For a right action, g acts first, followed by h second. Because of the formula (\"gh\")\u22121 = \"h\"\u22121\"g\"\u22121, a left action can be constructed from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group G on X can be considered as a left action of its opposite group \"G\"op on X.\nThus, for establishing general properties of group actions, it suffices to consider only left actions. However, there are cases where this is not possible. For example, the multiplication of a group induces both a left action and a right action on the group itself\u2014multiplication on the left and on the right, respectively.\nNotable properties of actions.\nLet \"G\" be a group acting on a set \"X\". The action is called \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;faithful\" or \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;effective\" if \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"x\" for all \"x\" \u2208 \"X\" implies that \"g\" = \"e\"\"G\". Equivalently, the homomorphism from \"G\" to the group of bijections of \"X\" corresponding to the action is injective.\nThe action is called \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;free\" (or \"semiregular\" or \"fixed-point free\") if the statement that \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"x\" for some \"x\" \u2208 \"X\" already implies that \"g\" = \"e\"\"G\". In other words, no non-trivial element of \"G\" fixes a point of \"X\". This is a much stronger property than faithfulness.\nFor example, the action of any group on itself by left multiplication is free. This observation implies Cayley's theorem that any group can be embedded in a symmetric group (which is infinite when the group is). A finite group may act faithfully on a set of size much smaller than its cardinality (however such an action cannot be free). For instance the abelian 2-group (Z / 2Z)\"n\" (of cardinality 2\"n\") acts faithfully on a set of size 2\"n\". This is not always the case, for example the cyclic group Z / 2\"n\"Z cannot act faithfully on a set of size less than 2\"n\".\nIn general the smallest set on which a faithful action can be defined can vary greatly for groups of the same size. For example, three groups of size 120 are the symmetric group S5, the icosahedral group A5 \u00d7 Z / 2Z and the cyclic group Z / 120Z. The smallest sets on which faithful actions can be defined for these groups are of size 5, 7, and 16 respectively.\nTransitivity properties.\nThe action of \"G\" on \"X\" is called \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;transitive\" if for any two points \"x\", \"y\" \u2208 \"X\" there exists a \"g\" \u2208 \"G\" so that \"g\" \u22c5 \"x\" = \"y\".\nThe action is \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;simply transitive\" (or \"sharply transitive\", or \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;regular\") if it is both transitive and free. This means that given \"x\", \"y\" \u2208 \"X\" there is exactly one \"g\" \u2208 \"G\" such that \"g\" \u22c5 \"x\" = \"y\". If \"X\" is acted upon simply transitively by a group \"G\" then it is called a principal homogeneous space for \"G\" or a \"G\"-torsor.\nFor an integer \"n\" \u2265 1, the action is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;\"n-transitive\" if \"X\" has at least \"n\" elements, and for any pair of \"n\"-tuples (\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\"), (\"y\"1, ..., \"y\"\"n\") \u2208 \"X\"\"n\" with pairwise distinct entries (that is \"x\"\"i\" \u2260 \"x\"\"j\", \"y\"\"i\" \u2260 \"y\"\"j\" when \"i\" \u2260 \"j\") there exists a \"g\" \u2208 \"G\" such that \"g\"\u22c5\"x\"\"i\" = \"y\"\"i\" for \"i\" = 1, ..., \"n\". In other words, the action on the subset of \"X\"\"n\" of tuples without repeated entries is transitive. For \"n\" = 2, 3 this is often called double, respectively triple, transitivity. The class of 2-transitive groups (that is, subgroups of a finite symmetric group whose action is 2-transitive) and more generally multiply transitive groups is well-studied in finite group theory.\nAn action is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;\"sharply n-transitive\" when the action on tuples without repeated entries in \"X\"\"n\" is sharply transitive.\nExamples.\nThe action of the symmetric group of \"X\" is transitive, in fact \"n\"-transitive for any \"n\" up to the cardinality of \"X\". If \"X\" has cardinality \"n\", the action of the alternating group is (\"n\" \u2212 2)-transitive but not (\"n\" \u2212 1)-transitive.\nThe action of the general linear group of a vector space \"V\" on the set \"V\" &amp;setminus; {0} of non-zero vectors is transitive, but not 2-transitive (similarly for the action of the special linear group if the dimension of \"v\" is at least 2). The action of the orthogonal group of a Euclidean space is not transitive on nonzero vectors but it is on the unit sphere.\nPrimitive actions.\nThe action of \"G\" on \"X\" is called \"primitive\" if there is no partition of \"X\" preserved by all elements of \"G\" apart from the trivial partitions (the partition in a single piece and its dual, the partition into singletons).\nTopological properties.\nAssume that formula_14 is a topological space and the action of formula_1 is by homeomorphisms.\nThe action is \"wandering\" if every formula_37 has a neighbourhood formula_38 such that there are only finitely many formula_39 with formula_40.\nMore generally, a point formula_37 is called a point of discontinuity for the action of formula_1 if there is an open subset formula_43 such that there are only finitely many formula_39 with formula_40. The \"domain of discontinuity\" of the action is the set of all points of discontinuity. Equivalently it is the largest formula_1-stable open subset formula_47 such that the action of formula_1 on formula_49 is wandering. In a dynamical context this is also called a \"wandering set\".\nThe action is \"properly discontinuous\" if for every compact subset formula_50 there are only finitely many formula_39 such that formula_52. This is strictly stronger than wandering; for instance the action of formula_53 on formula_54 given by formula_55 is wandering and free but not properly discontinuous.\nThe action by deck transformations of the fundamental group of a locally simply connected space on a universal cover is wandering and free. Such actions can be characterized by the following property: every formula_37 has a neighbourhood formula_38 such that formula_58 for every formula_59. Actions with this property are sometimes called \"freely discontinuous\", and the largest subset on which the action is freely discontinuous is then called the \"free regular set\".\nAn action of a group formula_1 on a locally compact space formula_14 is called \"cocompact\" if there exists a compact subset formula_62 such that formula_63. For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space formula_64.\nActions of topological groups.\nNow assume \"G\" is a topological group and \"X\" a topological space on which it acts by homeomorphisms. The action is said to be \"continuous\" if the map \"G\" \u00d7 \"X\" \u2192 \"X\" is continuous for the product topology.\nThe action is said to be \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;proper\" if the map \"G\" \u00d7 \"X\" \u2192 \"X\" \u00d7 \"X\" defined by (\"g\", \"x\") \u21a6 (\"x\", \"g\"\u22c5\"x\") is proper. This means that given compact sets \"K\", \"K\"\u2032 the set of \"g\" \u2208 \"G\" such that \"g\"\u22c5\"K\" \u2229 \"K\"\u2032 \u2260 \u2205 is compact. In particular, this is equivalent to proper discontinuity if \"G\" is a discrete group.\nIt is said to be \"locally free\" if there exists a neighbourhood \"U\" of \"e\"\"G\" such that \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" \u2260 \"x\" for all \"x\" \u2208 \"X\" and \"g\" \u2208 \"U\" &amp;setminus; {\"e\"\"G\"}.\nThe action is said to be \"strongly continuous\" if the orbital map \"g\" \u21a6 \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" is continuous for every \"x\" \u2208 \"X\". Contrary to what the name suggests, this is a weaker property than continuity of the action.\nIf \"G\" is a Lie group and \"X\" a differentiable manifold, then the subspace of \"smooth points\" for the action is the set of points \"x\" \u2208 \"X\" such that the map \"g\" \u21a6 \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" is smooth. There is a well-developed theory of Lie group actions, i.e. action which are smooth on the whole space.\nLinear actions.\nIf \"g\" acts by linear transformations on a module over a commutative ring, the action is said to be irreducible if there are no proper nonzero \"g\"-invariant submodules. It is said to be \"semisimple\" if it decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible actions.\nOrbits and stabilizers.\nConsider a group \"G\" acting on a set \"X\". The \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;orbit\" of an element \"x\" in \"X\" is the set of elements in \"X\" to which \"x\" can be moved by the elements of \"G\". The orbit of \"x\" is denoted by \"G\"\u22c5\"x\":\nformula_65\nThe defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points \"x\" in) \"X\" under the action of \"G\" form a partition of \"X\". The associated equivalence relation is defined by saying \"x\" ~ \"y\" if and only if there exists a \"g\" in \"G\" with \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"y\". The orbits are then the equivalence classes under this relation; two elements \"x\" and \"y\" are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same, that is, \"G\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"G\"\u22c5\"y\".\nThe group action is transitive if and only if it has exactly one orbit, that is, if there exists \"x\" in \"X\" with \"G\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"X\". This is the case if and only if \"G\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"X\" for all \"x\" in \"X\" (given that \"X\" is non-empty).\nThe set of all orbits of \"X\" under the action of \"G\" is written as \"X\" / \"G\" (or, less frequently, as \"G\" \\ \"X\"), and is called the \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;quotient\" of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;orbit space\", while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;coinvariants\", and written \"X\"\"G\", by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted \"X\"\"G\": the coinvariants are a quotient while the invariants are a subset. The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in group cohomology and group homology, which use the same superscript/subscript convention.\nInvariant subsets.\nIf \"Y\" is a subset of \"X\", then \"G\"\u22c5\"Y\" denotes the set {\"g\"\u22c5\"y\" : \"g\" \u2208 \"G\" and \"y\" \u2208 \"Y\"}. The subset \"Y\" is said to be \"invariant under \"\"G\" if \"G\"\u22c5\"Y\" = \"Y\" (which is equivalent \"G\"\u22c5\"Y\" \u2286 \"Y\"). In that case, \"G\" also operates on \"Y\" by restricting the action to \"Y\". The subset \"Y\" is called \"fixed under \"\"G\" if \"g\"\u22c5\"y\" = \"y\" for all \"g\" in \"G\" and all \"y\" in \"Y\". Every subset that is fixed under \"G\" is also invariant under \"G\", but not conversely.\nEvery orbit is an invariant subset of \"X\" on which \"G\" acts transitively. Conversely, any invariant subset of \"X\" is a union of orbits. The action of \"G\" on \"X\" is \"transitive\" if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.\nA \"G\"\"-invariant\" element of \"X\" is \"x\" \u2208 \"X\" such that \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"x\" for all \"g\" \u2208 \"G\". The set of all such \"x\" is denoted \"X\"\"G\" and called the \"G\"\"-invariants\" of \"X\". When \"X\" is a \"G\"-module, \"X\"\"G\" is the zeroth cohomology group of \"G\" with coefficients in \"X\", and the higher cohomology groups are the derived functors of the functor of \"G\"-invariants.\nFixed points and stabilizer subgroups.\nGiven \"g\" in \"G\" and \"x\" in \"X\" with \"g\"\u22c5\"x\" = \"x\", it is said that \"\"x\" is a fixed point of \"g\"\" or that \"\"g\" fixes \"x\"\". For every \"x\" in \"X\", the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;stabilizer subgroup of \"G\" with respect to \"x\" (also called the isotropy group or little group) is the set of all elements in \"G\" that fix \"x\":\nformula_66\nThis is a subgroup of \"G\", though typically not a normal one. The action of \"G\" on \"X\" is free if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel \"N\" of the homomorphism with the symmetric group, \"G\" \u2192 Sym(\"X\"), is given by the intersection of the stabilizers \"G\"\"x\" for all \"x\" in \"X\". If \"N\" is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).\nLet \"x\" and \"y\" be two elements in \"X\", and let \"g\" be a group element such that \"y\" = \"g\"\u22c5\"x\". Then the two stabilizer groups \"G\"\"x\" and \"G\"\"y\" are related by \"G\"\"y\" = \"gG\"\"x\"\"g\"\u22121. \nProof: by definition, \"h\" \u2208 \"G\"\"y\" if and only if \"h\"\u22c5(\"g\"\u22c5\"x\") = \"g\"\u22c5\"x\". Applying \"g\"\u22121 to both sides of this equality yields (\"g\"\u22121\"hg\")\u22c5\"x\" = \"x\"; that is, \"g\"\u22121\"hg\" \u2208 \"G\"\"x\". \nAn opposite inclusion follows similarly by taking \"h\" \u2208 \"G\"\"x\" and \"x\" = \"g\"\u22121\u22c5\"y\".\nThe above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate to each other. Thus, to each orbit, we can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of \"G\" (that is, the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let (\"H\") denote the conjugacy class of \"H\". Then the orbit \"O\" has type (\"H\") if the stabilizer \"G\"\"x\" of some/any \"x\" in \"O\" belongs to (\"H\"). A maximal orbit type is often called a principal orbit type.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Orbit\u2013stabilizer theorem.\nOrbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed \"x\" in \"X\", consider the map \"f\" : \"G\" \u2192 \"X\" given by \"g\" \u21a6 \"g\"\u22c5\"x\". By definition the image \"f\"(\"G\") of this map is the orbit \"G\"\u22c5\"x\". The condition for two elements to have the same image is\nformula_67\nIn other words, \"f\"(\"g\") = \"f\"(\"h\") \"if and only if\" \"g\" and \"h\" lie in the same coset for the stabilizer subgroup \"G\"\"x\". Thus, the fiber \"f\"\u22121({\"y\"}) of \"f\" over any \"y\" in \"G\"\u22c5\"x\" is contained in such a coset, and every such coset also occurs as a fiber. Therefore \"f\" induces a bijection between the set \"G\" / \"G\"\"x\" of cosets for the stabilizer subgroup and the orbit \"G\"\u22c5\"x\", which sends \"gG\"\"x\" \u21a6 \"g\"\u22c5\"x\". This result is known as the \"orbit\u2013stabilizer theorem\".\nIf \"G\" is finite then the orbit\u2013stabilizer theorem, together with Lagrange's theorem, gives\nformula_68\nIn other words, the length of the orbit of \"x\" times the order of its stabilizer is the order of the group. In particular that implies that the orbit length is a divisor of the group order.\n Example: Let \"G\" be a group of prime order \"p\" acting on a set \"X\" with \"k\" elements. Since each orbit has either 1 or \"p\" elements, there are at least \"k\" mod \"p\" orbits of length 1 which are \"G\"-invariant elements. More specifically, \"k\" and the number of \"G\"-invariant elements are congruent modulo \"p\".\nThis result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments (typically in situations where \"X\" is finite as well).\n Example: We can use the orbit\u2013stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a graph. Consider the cubical graph as pictured, and let \"G\" denote its automorphism group. Then \"G\" acts on the set of vertices {1, 2, ..., 8}, and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit\u2013stabilizer theorem, |\"G\"| = |\"G\" \u22c5 1| |\"G\"1| = 8 |\"G\"1|. Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer \"G\"1, we can obtain |\"G\"1| = |(\"G\"1) \u22c5 2| |(\"G\"1)2|. Any element of \"G\" that fixes 1 must send 2 to either 2, 4, or 5. As an example of such automorphisms consider the rotation around the diagonal axis through 1 and 7 by 2\"\u03c0\"/3, which permutes 2, 4, 5 and 3, 6, 8, and fixes 1 and 7. Thus, |(\"G\"1) \u22c5 2| = 3. Applying the theorem a third time gives |(\"G\"1)2| = |((\"G\"1)2) \u22c5 3| |((\"G\"1)2)3|. Any element of \"G\" that fixes 1 and 2 must send 3 to either 3 or 6. Reflecting the cube at the plane through 1, 2, 7 and 8 is such an automorphism sending 3 to 6, thus |((\"G\"1)2) \u22c5 3| = 2. One also sees that ((\"G\"1)2)3 consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of \"G\" fixing 1, 2 and 3 must also fix all other vertices, since they are determined by their adjacency to 1, 2 and 3. Combining the preceding calculations, we can now obtain |G| = 8 \u22c5 3 \u22c5 2 \u22c5 1 = 48.\nBurnside's lemma.\nA result closely related to the orbit\u2013stabilizer theorem is Burnside's lemma:\nformula_69\nwhere \"X\"\"g\" is the set of points fixed by \"g\". This result is mainly of use when \"G\" and \"X\" are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.\nFixing a group \"G\", the set of formal differences of finite \"G\"-sets forms a ring called the Burnside ring of \"G\", where addition corresponds to disjoint union, and multiplication to Cartesian product.\nGroup actions and groupoids.\nThe notion of group action can be encoded by the \"action groupoid\" \"G\"\u2032 = \"G\" \u22c9 \"X\" associated to the group action. The stabilizers of the action are the vertex groups of the groupoid and the orbits of the action are its components.\nMorphisms and isomorphisms between \"G\"-sets.\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are two \"G\"-sets, a \"morphism\" from \"X\" to \"Y\" is a function \"f\" : \"X\" \u2192 \"Y\" such that \"f\"(\"g\"\u22c5\"x\") = \"g\"\u22c5\"f\"(\"x\") for all \"g\" in \"G\" and all \"x\" in \"X\". Morphisms of \"G\"-sets are also called \"equivariant maps\" or \"G\"-\"maps\".\nThe composition of two morphisms is again a morphism. If a morphism \"f\" is bijective, then its inverse is also a morphism. In this case \"f\" is called an \"isomorphism\", and the two \"G\"-sets \"X\" and \"Y\" are called \"isomorphic\"; for all practical purposes, isomorphic \"G\"-sets are indistinguishable.\nSome example isomorphisms:\nWith this notion of morphism, the collection of all \"G\"-sets forms a category; this category is a Grothendieck topos (in fact, assuming a classical metalogic, this topos will even be Boolean).\nVariants and generalizations.\nWe can also consider actions of monoids on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See semigroup action.\nInstead of actions on sets, we can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary category: start with an object \"X\" of some category, and then define an action on \"X\" as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of \"X\". If \"X\" has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of vector spaces, we obtain group representations in this fashion.\nWe can view a group \"G\" as a category with a single object in which every morphism is invertible. A (left) group action is then nothing but a (covariant) functor from \"G\" to the category of sets, and a group representation is a functor from \"G\" to the category of vector spaces. A morphism between \"G\"-sets is then a natural transformation between the group action functors. In analogy, an action of a groupoid is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.\nIn addition to continuous actions of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers smooth actions of Lie groups on smooth manifolds, regular actions of algebraic groups on algebraic varieties, and actions of group schemes on schemes. All of these are examples of group objects acting on objects of their respective category.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The program was created by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler as a free software replacement for the compress program used in early Unix systems, and intended for use by GNU (from which the \"g\" of gzip is derived). Version 0.1 was first publicly released on 31 October 1992, and version 1.0 followed in February 1993.\nAs the file format can be decompressed via a streaming algorithm, it is commonly used in stream-based technology such as Web protocols, data interchange and ETL (in standard pipes).\nFile format.\nA gzip file (described in the table below) contains a 10-byte header, optional extra header fields, a DEFLATE-compressed payload and an 8-byte trailer.\ngzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of the compress utility and other popular archivers.\nAlthough multiple streams may be concatenated (gzipped files are simply decompressed concatenated as if they were originally one file), normally only a single file is compressed. Compressed archives are typically created by assembling collections of files into a single tar archive (also called tarball), and then compressing that archive with gzip. The final compressed file usually has the extension codice_1 or codice_2.\ngzip is not to be confused with the ZIP archive format, which also uses DEFLATE. The ZIP format can hold collections of files without an external archiver, but is less compact than compressed tarballs holding the same data, because it compresses files individually and cannot take advantage of redundancy between files (solid compression).\nThe gzip file format is also not to be confused with that of the compress utility, based on LZW, with extension codice_3; however, the gunzip utility is able to decompress codice_3 files.\nFile structure.\nAll multi-byte values are encoded in little-endian.\nImplementations.\nVarious implementations of the program have been written. The most commonly known is the GNU Project's implementation using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). OpenBSD's version of gzip is actually the compress program, to which support for the gzip format was added in OpenBSD 3.4. The \"g\" in this specific version stands for \"gratis\". FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD and NetBSD use a BSD-licensed implementation instead of the GNU version; it is actually a command-line interface for zlib intended to be compatible with the GNU implementations' options. These implementations originally come from NetBSD, and support decompression of bzip2 and the Unix pack format.\nAn alternative compression program achieving 3-8% better compression is Zopfli. It achieves gzip-compatible compression using more exhaustive algorithms, at the expense of compression time required. It does not affect decompression time.\ncodice_5, written by Mark Adler, is compatible with gzip and speeds up compression by using all available CPU cores and threads.\nDamage recovery.\nData in blocks prior to the first damaged part of the archive is usually fully readable. Data from blocks not demolished by damage that are located afterward \"may\" be recoverable through difficult workarounds.\nDerivatives and other uses.\nThe tar utility included in most Linux distributions can extract .tar.gz files by passing the z option, e.g., tar -zxf file.tar.gz, where codice_6 instructs decompression, codice_7 means extraction, and codice_8 specifies the name of the compressed archive file to extract from. Optionally, codice_9 (\"verbose\") lists files as they are being extracted.\nThe zlib library implements the DEFLATE algorithm, and supports both the gzip file format and a lightweight data stream format. The zlib stream format, DEFLATE, and the gzip file format were standardized respectively as RFC 1950, RFC 1951, and RFC 1952.\nThe gzip format is used in HTTP compression, a technique used to speed up the sending of HTML and other content on the World Wide Web. It is one of the three standard formats for HTTP compression as specified in RFC 2616. This RFC also specifies a zlib format (called \"DEFLATE\"), which is equal to the gzip format except that gzip adds eleven bytes of overhead in the form of headers and trailers. Still, the gzip format is sometimes recommended over zlib because Internet Explorer does not implement the standard correctly and cannot handle the zlib format as specified in RFC 1950.\nzlib DEFLATE is used internally by the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format.\nSince the late 1990s, bzip2, a file compression utility based on a block-sorting algorithm, has gained some popularity as a gzip replacement. It produces considerably smaller files (especially for source code and other structured text), but at the cost of memory and processing time (up to a factor of 4).\nAdvanceCOMP, Zopfli, libdeflate and 7-Zip can produce gzip-compatible files, using an internal DEFLATE implementation with better compression ratios than gzip itself\u2014at the cost of more processor time compared to the reference implementation.\nResearch published in 2023 showed that simple lossless compression techniques such as gzip could be combined with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier to create an attractive alternative to deep neural networks for text classification in natural language processing. This approach has been shown to equal and in some cases outperform conventional approaches such as BERT due to low resource requirements, e.g. no requirement for GPU hardware.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Clinical definitions are also extended to include an induced coma that causes lack of awareness to painful stimuli, sufficient to facilitate surgical applications in clinical and veterinary practice. General anaesthetics do not act as analgesics and should also not be confused with sedatives. General anaesthetics are a structurally diverse group of compounds whose mechanisms encompass multiple biological targets involved in the control of neuronal pathways. The precise workings are the subject of some debate and ongoing research.\nGeneral anesthetics elicit a state of general anesthesia. It remains somewhat controversial regarding how this state should be defined. General anesthetics, however, typically elicit several key reversible effects: immobility, analgesia, amnesia, unconsciousness, and reduced autonomic responsiveness to noxious stimuli.\nMode of administration.\nGeneral anaesthetics can be administered either as gases or vapours (inhalational anaesthetics), or as injections (intravenous or even intramuscular). All of these agents share the property of being quite hydrophobic (i.e., as liquids, they are not freely miscible\u2014or mixable\u2014in water, and as gases they dissolve in oils better than in water). It is possible to deliver anaesthesia solely by inhalation or injection, but most commonly the two forms are combined, with an injection given to induce anaesthesia and a gas used to maintain it.\nInhalation.\nInhalational anaesthetic substances are either volatile liquids or gases, and are usually delivered using an anaesthesia machine. An anaesthesia machine allows composing a mixture of oxygen, anaesthetics and ambient air, delivering it to the patient and monitoring patient and machine parameters. Liquid anaesthetics are vapourised in the machine.\nMany compounds have been used for inhalation anaesthesia, but only a few are still in widespread use. Desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most widely used volatile anaesthetics today. They are often combined with nitrous oxide. Older, less popular volatile anaesthetics include halothane, enflurane, and methoxyflurane. Researchers are also actively exploring the use of xenon as an anaesthetic.\nInjection.\nInjectable anaesthetics are used for the induction and maintenance of a state of unconsciousness. Anaesthetists prefer to use intravenous injections, as they are faster, generally less painful and more reliable than intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. Among the most widely used drugs are:\nBenzodiazepines are sedatives and are used in combinations with other general anaesthetics.\nMechanism of action.\nInduction and maintenance of general anesthesia, and the control of the various physiological side effects is typically achieved through a combinatorial drug approach. Individual general anesthetics vary with respect to their specific physiological and cognitive effects. While general anesthesia induction may be facilitated by one general anesthetic, others may be used in parallel or subsequently to achieve and maintain the desired anesthetic state. The drug approach utilized is dependent upon the procedure and the needs of the healthcare providers.\nIt is postulated that general anaesthetics exert their action by the activation of inhibitory central nervous system (CNS) receptors, and the inactivation of CNS excitatory receptors. The relative roles of different receptors is still under debate, but evidence exists for particular targets being involved with certain anaesthetics and drug effects.\nBelow are several key targets of general anesthetics that likely mediate their effects:\nStages of anesthesia.\nDuring administration of an anesthetic, the receiver goes through different stages of behavior ultimately leading to unconsciousness. This process is accelerated with intravenous anesthetics, so much so that it is negligible to consider during their use. The four stages of anesthesia are described using Guedel's signs, signifying the depth of anesthesia. These stages describe effects of anesthesia mainly on cognition, muscular activity, and respiration.\nStage I: Analgesia.\nThe receiver of the anesthesia primarily feels analgesia followed by amnesia and a sense of confusion moving into the next stage.\nStage II: Excitement.\nStage II is often characterized by the receiver being delirious and confused, with severe amnesia. Irregularities in the patterns of respiration are common at this stage of anesthesia. Nausea and vomiting are also indicators of Stage II anesthesia. Struggling and panic can sometimes occur as a result of delirium.\nStage III: Surgical Anesthesia.\nNormal breathing resumes at the beginnings of Stage III. Nearing the end of the stage, breathing ceases completely. Indicators for stage III anesthesia include loss of the eyelash reflex as well as regular breathing. Depth of stage III anesthesia can often be gauged by eye movement and pupil size.\nStage IV: Medullary Depression.\nNo respiration occurs in stage IV. This is shortly followed by circulatory failure and depression of the vasomotor centers. Death is common at this stage of anesthesia if no breathing and circulatory support is available.\nPhysiological side effects.\nAside from the clinically advantageous effects of general anesthetics, there are a number of other physiological consequences mediated by this class of drug. Notably, a reduction in blood pressure can be facilitated by a variety of mechanisms, including reduced cardiac contractility and dilation of the vasculature. This drop in blood pressure may activate a reflexive increases in heart rate, due to a baroreceptor-mediated feedback mechanism. Some anesthetics, however, disrupt this reflex.\nPatients under general anesthesia are at greater risk of developing hypothermia, as the aforementioned vasodilation increases the heat lost via peripheral blood flow. By and large, these drugs reduce the internal body temperature threshold at which autonomic thermoregulatory mechanisms are triggered in response to cold. (On the other hand, the threshold at which thermoregulatory mechanisms are triggered in response to heat is typically increased.)\nAnesthetics typically affect respiration. Inhalational anesthetics elicit bronchodilation, an increase in respiratory rate, and reduced tidal volume. The net effect is decreased respiration, which must be managed by healthcare providers, while the patient is under general anesthesia. The reflexes that function to alleviate airway obstructions are also dampened (e.g. gag and cough). Compounded with a reduction in lower esophageal sphincter tone, which increases the frequency of regurgitation, patients are especially prone to asphyxiation while under general anesthesia. Healthcare providers closely monitor individuals under general anesthesia and utilize a number of devices, such as an endotracheal tube, to ensure patient safety.\nGeneral anesthetics also affect the chemoreceptor trigger zone and brainstem vomiting center, eliciting nausea and vomiting following treatment.\nPharmacokinetics.\nIntravenous general anesthetics.\nInduction.\nIntravenously delivered general anesthetics are typically small and highly lipophilic molecules. These characteristics facilitate their rapid preferential distribution into the brain and spinal cord, which are both highly vascularized and lipophilic. It is here where the actions of these drugs lead to general anesthesia induction.\nElimination.\nFollowing distribution into the central nervous system (CNS), the anesthetic drug then diffuses out of the CNS into the muscles and viscera, followed by adipose tissues. In patients given a single injection of drug, this redistribution results in termination of general anesthesia. Therefore, following administration of a single anesthetic bolus, duration of drug effect is dependent solely upon the redistribution kinetics.\nThe half-life of an anesthetic drug following a prolonged infusion, however, depends upon both drug redistribution kinetics, drug metabolism in the liver, and existing drug concentration in fat. When large quantities of an anesthetic drug have already been dissolved in the body's fat stores, this can slow its redistribution out of the brain and spinal cord, prolonging its CNS effects. For this reason, the half-lives of these infused drugs are said to be context-dependent. Generally, prolonged anesthetic drug infusions result in longer drug half-lives, slowed elimination from the brain and spinal cord, and delayed termination of general anesthesia.\nInhalational general anesthetics.\nMinimal alveolar concentration (MAC) is the concentration of an inhalational anesthetic in the lungs that prevents 50% of patients from responding to surgical incision. This value is used to compare the potencies of various inhalational general anesthetics and impacts the partial-pressure of the drug utilized by healthcare providers during general anesthesia induction and/or maintenance.\nInduction.\nInduction of anesthesia is facilitated by diffusion of an inhaled anesthetic drug into the brain and spinal cord. Diffusion throughout the body proceeds until the drug's partial pressure within the various tissues is equivalent to the partial pressure of the drug within the lungs. Healthcare providers can control the rate of anesthesia induction and final tissue concentrations of the anesthetic by varying the partial pressure of the inspired anesthetic. A higher drug partial pressure in the lungs will drive diffusion more rapidly throughout the body and yield a higher maximum tissue concentration. Respiratory rate and inspiratory volume will also affect the promptness of anesthesia onset, as will the extent of pulmonary blood flow.\nThe partition coefficient of a gaseous drug is indicative of its relative solubility in various tissues. This metric is the relative drug concentration between two tissues, when their partial pressures are equal (gas:blood, fat:blood, etc.). Inhalational anesthetics vary widely with respect to their tissue solubilities and partition coefficients. Anesthetics that are highly soluble require many molecules of drug to raise the partial pressure within a given tissue, as opposed to minimally soluble anesthetics which require relatively few. Generally, inhalational anesthetics that are minimally soluble reach equilibrium more quickly. Inhalational anesthetics that have a high fat:blood partition coefficient, however, reach equilibrium more slowly, due to the minimal vascularization of fat tissue, which serves as a large, slowly-filling reservoir for the drug.\nElimination.\nInhaled anesthetics are eliminated via expiration, following diffusion into the lungs. This process is dependent largely upon the anesthetic blood:gas partition coefficient, tissue solubility, blood flow to the lungs, and patient respiratory rate and inspiratory volume. For gases that have minimal tissue solubility, termination of anesthesia generally occurs as rapidly as the onset of anesthesia. For gases that have high tissue solubility, however, termination of anesthesia is generally context-dependent. As with intravenous anesthetic infusions, prolonged delivery of highly soluble anesthetic gases generally results in longer drug half-lives, slowed elimination from the brain and spinal cord, and delayed termination of anesthesia.\nMetabolism of inhaled anesthetics is generally not a major route of drug elimination.\nHistory.\nEthanol.\nWhile most research focuses on the intoxicating effects of ethanol, it can also produce a general anesthesia. Since antiquity, prior to the development of modern agents, alcohol was used as a general anaesthetic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has been called the 'father of English literature', or alternatively, the 'father of English poetry'. He was the first writer to be buried in what has since become Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. \nChaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and astronomer, composing the scientific \"A Treatise on the Astrolabe\" for his ten-year-old son, Lewis. He maintained a career in public service as a bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat and member of the Parliament of England, having been elected as shire knight for Kent.\nAmongst his other works are \"The Book of the Duchess\", \"The House of Fame\", \"The Legend of Good Women\", \"Troilus and Criseyde\", and \"Parlement of Foules\". A prolific writer, Chaucer has been seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of Middle English at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were still Anglo-Norman French and Latin. His contemporary Thomas Hoccleve hailed him as \"\" (i.e., the first one capable of finding poetic matter in English). Almost two thousand English words are first attested in Chaucerian manuscripts.\nLife.\nOrigin.\nGeoffrey Chaucer was born in London, most likely in the early 1340s (by some accounts, including his monument, he was born in 1343), though the precise date and location remain unknown. The Chaucer family offers an extraordinary example of upward mobility. His great-grandfather Andrew de Chaucer was a tavern keeper, his grandfather Robert Malyn le Chaucer worked as a purveyor of wines, and his father, John Chaucer, rose to become an important wine merchant with a royal appointment. Several previous generations of Geoffrey Chaucer's family had been vintners and merchants in Ipswich. His surname is derived from the French \"chaucier\", once thought to mean 'shoemaker', but now known to refer to a maker of chausses (leggings).\nIn 1324 his father, John Chaucer, was kidnapped by an aunt in the hope of marrying the twelve-year-old to her daughter in an attempt to keep the Ipswich property in the family. The aunt was imprisoned and fined \u00a3250, now equivalent to about \u00a3, suggesting the family was financially secure.\nJohn Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who inherited properties in 1349, including 24 shops in London, from her uncle Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3\u00a0April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as 'moneyer', apparently employed at the Tower of London. In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as \"me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie\", Latin for: \"I, Geoffrey Chaucer, son of the vintner John Chaucer, London\".\nCareer.\nAlthough records of the lives of Chaucer's contemporaries William Langland and the Gawain Poet are practically non-existent, Chaucer was a public servant whose official life was very well documented. Nearly 500 written items testify to his career. The first of the 'Chaucer Life Records' appears in 1357 in the household accounts of Elizabeth de Burgh, the Countess of Ulster, when he became the noblewoman's page through his father's connections, a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. De Burgh was married to Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, the second surviving son of Edward III; this position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He was also employed as a courtier, a diplomat and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King's Works.\nIn 1359, in the early stages of the Hundred Years' War, Edward invaded France. Chaucer travelled with Lionel of Antwerp, Elizabeth's husband, as part of the English army. In 1360 he was captured during the siege of Reims. The king paid \u00a316 for his ransom, , and Chaucer was released.\nChaucer's life is uncertain following this period. However he seems to have travelled in France, Spain and Flanders, possibly as a messenger and perhaps undertaking the Way of Saint James pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. \nAround 1366 Chaucer married Philippa (de) Roet. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, Philippa of Hainault, and a sister of Katherine Swynford, who later (c.\u20091396) became the third wife of John of Gaunt. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, Thomas Chaucer, had an illustrious career as chief butler to four kings, envoy to France, and Speaker of the House of Commons. Thomas's daughter Alice married the Duke of Suffolk. Thomas's great-grandson (Geoffrey's great-great-grandson), John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, was heir to the throne as designated by Richard III before his deposition. Geoffrey's other children probably included Elizabeth Chaucy, a nun at Barking Abbey, Agnes, an attendant at Henry IV's coronation; and another son, Lewis Chaucer. Chaucer's \"Treatise on the Astrolabe\" was written for the latter.\nAccording to tradition, Chaucer studied law in the Inner Temple (an Inn of Court) at this time. He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a \"valet de chambre\", yeoman, or esquire on 20\u00a0June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti, daughter of Galeazzo II Visconti, in Milan. Jean Froissart and Petrarch, also notable literary figures, were also in attendance. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written \"The Book of the Duchess\", his first major work, in honour of Blanche of Lancaster, the late wife of John of Gaunt who died from the plague in 1369.\nThe next year, Chaucer travelled to Picardy as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited Genoa and Florence. Scholars such as Walter William Skeat, Piero Boitani and Beryl Rowland have suggested that it was during the latter excursions that he came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio. They acquainted him with medi\u00e6val Italian poetry, whose forms and stories he would later employ. The purposes of a trip in 1377 are unclear, as it was known as a time of conflict. Later documents suggest it was a mission (alongside Jean Froissart) to arrange marriage between the future King Richard II and a French princess, thereby ending the Hundred Years' War. Were this the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.\nIn 1378 Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and Sir John Hawkwood, English condottiere (mercenary leader) in Milan. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character, the Knight, in the \"Canterbury Tales\", for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.\nA possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when Edward III granted Chaucer \"a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life\" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, Saint George's Day, 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been for another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as a poet to a king places him as a precursor to later poets laureate. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18\u00a0April 1378.\nOn 8\u00a0June 1374 Chaucer obtained the pivotal appointment as Comptroller of the Customs for the port of London. He was presumably well-received in the occupation: he held the position for twelve years, a lengthy titularship by then. The medievalist David Carlson has described Chaucer's job as \"policing the collector... The operating presumption was that the collector would try to cheat, and the comptroller would try to catch him at it; but at the same time, while the comptroller watched the collector, the Exchequer was watching the comptroller, who was evidently expected to try to cheat too\". Chaucer appears to have been close to the Court party in politics; of the 11 men prosecuted for treason by the Lords Appellant in 1388, he was an associate of eight. \nHis life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period.\nOn 16 October 1379 Thomas Staundon filed legal action against his former servant Cecily Chaumpaigne and Chaucer, accusing the latter of unlawfully employing Chaumpaigne before her term of service was completed, in violation of the Statute of Labourers. Though eight court documents dated between October 1379 and July 1380 survive the action, the case was never prosecuted. No details survive about Chaumpaigne's service or how she came to leave Staundon's employ for Chaucer's.\nWhile still working as comptroller, Chaucer appears to have moved to Kent, being appointed as one of the commissioners of peace for Kent at a time when French invasion was a possibility. He is thought to have started work on \"The Canterbury Tales\" in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament (a knight of the shire) for Kent in 1386 and attended the 'Wonderful Parliament' that year. He appears to have been present at most of the 71 days it sat, for which he was paid 24 pounds and nine shillings. On 15\u00a0October that year he gave a deposition in the case of \"Scrope v. Grosvenor\". There is no further reference after this date to Philippa, Chaucer's wife. She is presumed to have died in 1387. He survived the political upheavals caused by the Lords Appellants, despite the fact that Chaucer knew some of the men executed over the affair quite well.\nOn 12 July 1389 Chaucer was appointed the clerk of the king's works, a sort of foreman organising most of the king's building projects. No major works were begun during his tenure, but he did conduct repairs on Westminster Palace, St George's Chapel, Windsor, continued building the wharf at the Tower of London and built the stands for a tournament held in 1390. It may have been a difficult job, but it paid two shillings a day, more than three times his salary as a comptroller. Chaucer was also appointed keeper of the lodge at the King's Park in Feckenham Forest in Worcestershire, which was a largely honorary appointment.\nLater life.\nIn September 1390, records say that Chaucer was robbed and possibly injured while conducting the business, and he stopped working in this capacity on 17\u00a0June 1391. He began as Deputy Forester in the royal forest of Petherton Park in North Petherton, Somerset on 22\u00a0June. It involved administering an area which included moorland, cultivated fields, villages and a forest.\nRichard II granted him an annual pension of 20 pounds in 1394 (), and Chaucer's name fades from the historical record not long after Richard's overthrow in 1399. The last few records of his life show his pension renewed by the new king and his taking a lease on a residence within the close of Westminster Abbey on 24\u00a0December 1399. Henry IV renewed the grants assigned by Richard, but \"The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse\" hints that the grants might not have been paid. The last mention of Chaucer is on 5\u00a0June 1400, when some debts owed to him were repaid.\nChaucer died of unknown causes on 25\u00a0October 1400, although the only evidence for this date comes from the engraving on his tomb, which was erected more than 100 years after his death. There is some speculation that he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV, but the case is entirely circumstantial. Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbey's close. In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making him the first writer interred in the area now known as Poets' Corner.\nRelationship to John of Gaunt.\nChaucer was a close friend of John of Gaunt, the wealthy Duke of Lancaster and father of Henry IV, and he served under Lancaster's patronage. Near the end of their lives, Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law when Lancaster married Katherine Swynford (de Roet) in 1396; she was the sister of Philippa (de) Roet, whom Chaucer had married in 1366.\nChaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\" (also known as the \"Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse\") was written to commemorate Blanche of Lancaster, John of Gaunt's first wife. The poem refers to John and Blanche in allegory as the narrator relates the tale of \"A long castel with walles white/Be Seynt Johan, on a ryche hil\" (1318\u20131319) who is mourning grievously after the death of his love, \"And goode faire White she het/That was my lady name ryght\" (948\u2013949). The phrase \"long castel\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \"Loncastel\" and \"Longcastell\"), \"walles white\" is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche, \"Seynt Johan\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \"ryche hil\" is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \"White\" is the English translation of the French word \"blanche\", implying that the white lady was Blanche of Lancaster.\nPoem \"Fortune\".\nChaucer's short poem \"Fortune\", believed to have been written in the 1390s, is also thought to refer to Lancaster. \"Chaucer as narrator\" openly defies \"Fortune\", proclaiming that he has learned who his enemies are through her tyranny and deceit, and declares \"my suffisaunce\" (15) and that \"over himself hath the maystrye\" (14).\n\"Fortune\", in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts, \"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends.\n\"Fortune\" turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\" (78\u201379). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, and a portion of line 76 (\"as three of you or tweyne\") is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.\nMost conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \"beste frend\". \"Fortune\" states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \"And also, you still have your best friend alive\" (32, 40, 48); she also refers to his \"beste frend\" in the envoy when appealing to his \"noblesse\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at \"Fortune\" that she shall not take his friend from him.\nReligious beliefs.\nChaucer's works engage heavily with the theme of Christian faith. The figure of the Parson portrays Christianity positively. However, Chaucer also ruthlessly satirises religious professionals whom he dislikes, depicting friars and summoners squabbling and telling scandalous tales about each other, and a shameless conman in the form of the Pardoner.\n\"The Canterbury Tales\" ends with a section that has come to be known as Chaucer's \"Retraction\". In full and in translation: \nNow pray I to them all that listen to this little treatise or read it, that if there be any thing in it that pleases them, that thereof they thank our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom proceeds all wit and all goodness. And if there be any thing that displeases them, I pray them also that they blame it on the fault of my lack of wit and not to my will, that would much prefer to have said better if I had had cunning. For our book says, \"All that is written is written for our doctrine,\" and that is my intent. Wherefore I beseech you meekly, for the mercy of God, that you pray for me that Christ have mercy on me and forgive me my sins; and namely of my translations and compositions of worldly vanities, as is the book of Troilus; the book also of Fame; the book of the XXV. Ladies; the book of the Duchesse; the book of Saint Valentines day of the Parliament of Birds; the tales of Canterbury, those that tend toward sin; the book of the Lion; and many another book, if they were in my remembrance, and many a song and many a lecherous lyric, that Christ for his great mercy forgive me the sin. But of the translation of Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, and other books of legends of saints, and homilies, and morality, and devotion, that thank I our Lord Jesus Christ and his blissful Mother, and all the saints of heaven, beseeching them that they from henceforth unto my life's end send me grace to bewail my sins and to study to the salvation of my soul, and grant me grace of true penitence, confession and satisfaction to do in this present life, through the benign grace of him that is king of kings and priest over all priests, that bought us with the precious blood of his heart, so that I may be one of them at the day of doom that shall be saved. \"Qui cum Patre et Spiritu Sancto vivit et regnat Deus per omnia secula.\" [He who lives and reigns with the Father and Holy Spirit, God, world without end.] Amen.\nBoth the sincerity and the authenticity of the \"Retraction\"\nhave been questioned. One recent edition concludes that \"the Retraction ends the Canterbury Tales with a final complexity; repentant or not, Chaucer, as usual, slyly leaves the resolution to the reader\".\nLiterary works.\nChaucer's first major work was \"The Book of the Duchess\", an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster, who died in 1368. Two other early poems were \"Anelida and Arcite\" and \"The House of Fame\". He wrote many of his major works in a prolific period when he worked as customs comptroller for London (1374 to 1386). His \"Parlement of Foules\", \"The Legend of Good Women\", and \"Troilus and Criseyde\" all date from this time. It is believed that he began \"The Canterbury Tales\" in the 1380s.\nChaucer also translated Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\" and \"The Romance of the Rose\" by Guillaume de Lorris (extended by Jean de Meun). Eustache Deschamps called himself a \"nettle in Chaucer's garden of poetry\". In 1385 Thomas Usk made glowing mention of Chaucer, and John Gower also lauded him.\nHis \"Treatise on the Astrolabe\", dedicated to his ten-year-old son Lewis Chaucer, describes the form and use of the astrolabe in detail and is sometimes cited as the first example of technical writing in the English language. It indicates that Chaucer was versed in science in addition to his literary talents. \"The equatorie of the planetis\" is a scientific work similar to the \"Treatise\" and sometimes ascribed to Chaucer because of its language and handwriting, an identification which scholars no longer deem tenable.\nInfluence.\nLinguistic.\nChaucer wrote in continental accentual-syllabic metre, a style which had developed in English literature since around the twelfth century as an alternative to the alliterative Anglo-Saxon metre. Chaucer is known for metrical innovation: he invented the rhyme royal, and was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line\u2014a decasyllabic cousin to iambic pentametre\u2014in his work. Only a few anonymous short works employ it before he did. The arrangements of these five-stress lines into rhyming couplets, as first observed in \"The Legend of Good Women\", were much used in his later work, from thereon becoming one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early pioneering in satire is also of importance: the common humorous mechanism, the quaint accent of regional dialect, appears in \"The Reeve's Tale\". Regarded by historians as the first use of dialect as comedic device in English literature, J. R. R. Tolkien regarded it as \"dramatic realism\".\nAlong with those of other contemporaneous writers, Chaucer's body of poetry is credited with helping to standardise the London dialect of Middle English from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects. This is probable overstatement; the influence of the court, chancery and bureaucracy \u2013 of which Chaucer was a part \u2013 remains more salient to the development of Standard English.\nModern English is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems, owing to the effect of the Great Vowel Shift sometime after his death. This change in the pronunciation of English, still not fully understood, often encumbers modern audiences reading his work.\nThe status of the final \"-e\" in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing, the final \"-e\" was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. This may have been a vestige of the Old English dative singular suffix \"-e\" attached to most nouns. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final \"-e\" is sometimes to be vocalised and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. Most scholars pronounce it as a schwa when it is vocalised.\nBesides the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time, but Chaucer was the earliest extant manuscript source with his ear for common speech. \"Acceptable\", \"alkali\", \"altercation\", \"amble\", \"angrily\", \"annex\", \"annoyance\", \"approaching\", \"arbitration\", \"armless\", \"army\", \"arrogant\", \"arsenic\", \"arc\", \"artillery\" and \"aspect\" are just some of almost two thousand English words first attested by Chaucer.\nLiterary.\nWidespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. John Lydgate was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished \"Tales\". At the same time Robert Henryson's \"The Testament of Cresseid\" completes the story of Cressida left unfinished in his \"Troilus and Criseyde\". Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets, and later appreciations by the Romantic era poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later \"additions\" from the original Chaucer.\nWriters of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as John Dryden, admired Chaucer for his stories but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess. It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of Walter William Skeat's work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, \"The Canterbury Tales\" was selected by William Caxton as one of the first books to be printed in England.\nEnglish.\nChaucer is often considered the source of the English vernacular tradition; he championed the English language over the then-dominant use of Latin or French in England in art and the judiciary. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of vernacular literature, after the example of Dante Alighieri, in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's lifetime was underway in Lowland Scotland through the work of his contemporary John Barbour.\nAlthough Chaucer's language is much closer to the modern vernacular than the text of \"Beowulf\", such that (unlike that of \"Beowulf\") a Modern English speaker well-versed in archaisms may generally understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom.\nThe following excerpt from the prologue of \"The Summoner's Tale\" compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:\nValentine's Day and romance.\nThe first recorded association of Valentine's Day with romantic love is believed to be in Chaucer's \"Parlement of Foules\" (1382), a dream vision portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates. This verse honours the first anniversary of the engagement of the fifteen-year-old Richard II of England to fifteen-year-old Anne of Bohemia:\nFor this was on seynt Volantynys dayWhan euery bryd comyth there to chese his makeOf euery kynde that men thinke mayAnd that so heuge a noyse gan they makeThat erthe &amp; eyr &amp; tre &amp; euery lakeSo ful was that onethe was there spaceFor me to stonde, so ful was al the place.\nCritical reception.\nEarly criticism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The language of England, upon which Chaucer was the first to confer celebrity, has amply justified the foresight which led him to disdain all others for its sake, and, in turn, has conferred an enduring celebrity upon him who trusted his reputation to it without reserve.\"\n \u2014Thomas Lounsbury\nThomas Hoccleve, a poet who may have met Chaucer, hailed him as \"the firste fyndere of our fair langage\" and considered him his role model. John Lydgate referred to Chaucer within his own text \"The Fall of Princes\" as the \"lodesterre (guiding principle) \u2026 off our language\". Around two centuries later Sir Philip Sidney greatly praised \"Troilus and Criseyde\" in his own \"Defence of Poesie\". During the nineteenth and early twentieth century, Chaucer came to be viewed as a symbol of the nation's poetic heritage.\nCharles Dickens echoed Chaucer's use of from \"Troilus and Criseyde\" (Dickens held a copy in his library among other works of Chaucer) in his 1850 novel \"David Copperfield\". G. K. Chesterton wrote: \"among the great English authors, Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common\".\nManuscripts and audience.\nThe large number of surviving manuscripts of Chaucer's works is testimony to the enduring interest in his poetry prior to the arrival of the printing press. There survive 83 manuscripts of \"The Canterbury Tales\" (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of \"Troilus and Criseyde\", including the personal copy of Henry IV. Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost.\nChaucer's original audience was a courtly one; they would have included women, as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet, even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes. This included many Lollard sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own.\nLollards were particularly attracted to Chaucer's satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham (Amersham in Buckinghamshire), was brought before John Chadworth, the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a \"boke of the Tales of Caunterburie\" among other suspect volumes.\nPrinted editions.\nThe first English printer, William Caxton, was responsible for the first two folio editions of \"The Canterbury Tales\" published in 1478 and 1483. Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, Wynkyn de Worde, but this edition has no independent authority.\nRichard Pynson, the King's Printer under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.)\nThere is a likely connection between Pynson's product and William Thynne's a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546 as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII, one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucer's works and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material, there is no doubt that this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucer's work. \"The Workes of Geffray Chaucer,\" published in 1532, was the first edition of Chaucer's collected works. Thynne's editions of \"Chaucer's Works\" in 1532 and 1542 were the first significant contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian canon. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king, who is praised in the preface by Sir Brian Tuke. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention. As with Pynson, once included in the \"Works\", pseudepigraphic texts stayed with those works, regardless of their first editor's intentions.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer canon began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's \"Works\" set the precedent for all other English authors regarding presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.\nProbably the most significant aspect of the growing apocrypha is that beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a proto-Protestant Lollard, primarily the \"Testament of Love\" and \"The Plowman's Tale\". As \"Chaucerian\" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic\u2014or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic\u2014to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his \"Works\" was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done concurrently with William Langland and \"Piers Plowman\".\nThe famous \"Plowman's Tale\" did not enter Thynne's \"Works\" until the second 1542 edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of Thomas Usk's \"Testament of Love\" in the first edition. The \"Testament of Love\" imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (\"Testament of Love\" also appears to borrow from \"Piers Plowman\".)\nSince the \"Testament of Love\" mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollardism) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) John Foxe took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a \"right Wiclevian\" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of John Wycliffe at Merton College, Oxford. (Thomas Speght is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his \"Life of Chaucer\".) No other sources for the \"Testament of Love\" exist\u2014there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.\nJohn Stow (1525\u20131605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer's \"Works\" in 1561 brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after Thomas Tyrwhitt pared the canon down in his 1775 edition. The compilation and printing of Chaucer's works was, from its beginning, a political enterprise, since it was intended to establish an English national identity and history that grounded and authorised the Tudor monarchy and church. What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.\nIn his 1598 edition of the \"Works\", Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the \"Testament of Love\" to assemble a largely fictional \"Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer\". Speght's \"Life\" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the king's views on religion. Speght states, \"In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.\" Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:\nYet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.\nLater, in \"The Argument\" to the \"Testament of Love\", Speght adds:\nChaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.\nSpeght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet Street, as well as a fictitious coat of arms and family tree. Ironically \u2013 and perhaps consciously so \u2013 an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from Francis Beaumont defends the unseemly, \"low\", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position.\nFrancis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his \"Animadversions\", insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include \"The Plowman's Tale\" and \"The Pilgrim's Tale\" in the 1532 and 1542 \"Works\".\nThe myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucer scholarship. Although it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.\nAlongside Chaucer's \"Works\", the most impressive literary monument of the period is Foxe's \"Acts and Monuments...\". As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's \"Works\", particularly the pseudepigrapha. \"Jack Upland\" was first printed in Foxe's \"Acts and Monuments\", and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's \"Works\".\nSpeght's \"Life of Chaucer\" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the \"Testament of Love\" and \"The Plowman's Tale\" to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe \"thought it not out of season \u2026 to couple \u2026 some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer\" with a discussion of John Colet, a possible source for John Skelton's character Colin Clout.\nProbably referring to the 1542 Act for the Advancement of True Religion, Foxe said that he marvel[s] to consider \u2026 how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love \u2026 Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.\nIt is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of \"The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther\" when \"Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.\nFoxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Troubling material is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.\nJohn Urry produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. According to the editors, several tales were printed, and for the first time, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G. Edwards, This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in Roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend John Dart, corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer in nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts. Additionally, it is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.\nModern scholarship.\nAlthough Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when Thomas Tyrwhitt edited \"The Canterbury Tales\", and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.\nScholars such as Frederick James Furnivall, who founded the Chaucer Society in 1868, pioneered the establishment of diplomatic editions of Chaucer's primary texts, along with careful accounts of Chaucer's language and prosody. Walter William Skeat, who, like Furnivall, was closely associated with the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press in 1912. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.\nWith the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience. The Chaucer Research Project at the University of Chicago began in 1924. The \"Chaucer Review\" was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies. In 1994 the literary critic Harold Bloom placed Chaucer among the , and in 1997 expounded on William Shakespeare's debt to the author.\nList of works.\nThe following major works are in roughly chronological order, but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer's output. Works made up of a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.\nIn popular culture.\nChaucer is one of the main characters in the 2001 film \"A Knight's Tale\", and is portrayed by Paul Bettany.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was instrumental in bringing the modern pagan religion of Wicca to public attention, writing some of its definitive religious texts and founding the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family in Blundellsands, Lancashire, Gardner spent much of his childhood abroad in Madeira. In 1900, he moved to colonial Ceylon. In 1911, he relocated to Malaya, where he worked as a civil servant. Independently, he developed an interest in the native peoples, writing papers, and even a book about their magical practices.\nAfter his retirement in 1936, he travelled to Cyprus and penned the novel \"A Goddess Arrives\" before returning to England. Settling down near the New Forest, he joined an occult group, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship. Through this group, he encountered the New Forest coven into which he was initiated in 1939. Gardner portrayed the coven as a survival of the theoretical \"witch-cult\" discussed in the works of Margaret Murray\u2014a theory that is now discredited. He supplemented the coven's rituals with ideas borrowed from Freemasonry, ceremonial magic, and the writings of Aleister Crowley to form the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca.\nMoving to London in 1945, he became intent on propagating this religion, attracting media attention and writing about it in \"High Magic's Aid\" (1949), \"Witchcraft Today\" (1954), and \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\" (1959). Founding a Wiccan group known as the Bricket Wood coven, he introduced a string of High Priestesses into the religion, including Doreen Valiente, Lois Bourne, Patricia Crowther and Eleanor Bone, through which the Gardnerian community spread throughout Britain and subsequently into Australia and the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Involved for a time with Cecil Williamson, Gardner also became director of the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man, which he ran until his death. Gardner's role in the development of neo-pagan and occult communities was such that a plaque on his gravestone describes him \"The Father of Wicca\".\nEarly life.\nChildhood: 1884\u20131899.\nGardner's family was wealthy and upper middle class, running a family firm, Joseph Gardner and Sons, which described itself as \"the oldest private company in the timber trade within the British Empire.\" Specialising in the import of hardwood, the company had been founded in the mid-18th century by Edmund Gardner (b. 1721), an entrepreneur who would subsequently become a Freeman of Liverpool.\nGerald's father, William Robert Gardner (1844\u20131935) had been the youngest son of Joseph Gardner (b. 1791), after whom the firm had been renamed, and who with his wife Maria had had five sons and three daughters. In 1867, William had been sent to New York City to further the interests of the family firm. Here, he had met an American, Louise Burguelew Ennis, the daughter of a wholesale stationer; entering a relationship, they were married in Manhattan on 25 November 1868.\nAfter a visit to England, the couple returned to the US, where they settled in Mott Haven, Morrisania in New York State. It was here that their first child, Harold Ennis Gardner, was born in 1870. At some point in the next two years they moved back to England, by 1873 settling into The Glen, a large Victorian house in Blundellsands in Lancashire, north-west England, which was developing into a wealthy suburb of Liverpool. It was here that their second child, Robert \"Bob\" Marshall Gardner, was born in 1874.\nIn 1876 the family moved into one of the neighbouring houses, Ingle Lodge, and it was here that the couple's third son, Gerald Brosseau Gardner, was born on Friday 13 June 1884. A fourth child, Francis Douglas Gardner, was then born in 1886. Gerald would rarely see Harold, who went on to study law at the University of Oxford, but saw more of Bob, who drew pictures for him, and Douglas, with whom he shared his nursery.\nThe Gardners employed an Irish nursemaid named Josephine \"Com\" McCombie, who was entrusted with taking care of the young Gerald; she would subsequently become the dominant figure of his childhood, spending far more time with him than his parents. Gardner suffered with asthma from a young age, having particular difficulty in the cold Lancashire winters. His nursemaid offered to take him to warmer climates abroad at his father's expense in the hope that this condition would not be so badly affected.\nSubsequently, in summer 1888, Gerald and Com travelled via London to Nice in the south of France. After several more years spent in the Mediterranean, in 1891 they went to the Canary Islands, and it was here that Gardner first developed his lifelong interest in weaponry. From there, they then went on to Accra in the Gold Coast (modern Ghana). Accra was followed by a visit to Funchal on the Portuguese island of Madeira; they would spend most of the next nine years on the island, only returning to England for three or four months in the summer.\nAccording to Gardner's first biographer, Jack Bracelin, Com was very flirtatious and \"clearly looked on these trips as mainly manhunts\", viewing Gardner as a nuisance. As a result, he was largely left to his own devices, which he spent going out, meeting new people and learning about foreign cultures. In Madeira, he also began collecting weapons, many of which were remnants from the Napoleonic Wars, displaying them on the wall of his hotel room.\nAs a result of his illness and these foreign trips, Gardner ultimately never attended school, or gained any formal education. He taught himself to read by looking at copies of \"The Strand Magazine\" but his writing betrayed his lack of formal schooling with eccentric spelling and grammar. A voracious reader, one of the books that most influenced him at the time was Florence Marryat's \"There Is No Death\" (1891), a discussion of spiritualism, and from which he gained a firm belief in the existence of an afterlife.\nCeylon and Borneo: 1900\u20131911.\nIn 1900, Com married David Elkington, one of her many suitors who owned a tea plantation in the British colony of Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka). It was agreed with the Gardners that Gerald would live with her on a tea plantation named Ladbroke Estate in the town of Maskeliya, where he could learn the tea trade. In 1901 Gardner and the Elkingtons lived briefly in a bungalow in Kandy, where a neighbouring bungalow had just been vacated by the occultists Aleister Crowley and Charles Henry Allan Bennett.\nAt his father's expense, Gardner trained as a \"creeper\", or trainee planter, learning all about the growing of tea; although he disliked the \"dreary endlessness\" of the work, he enjoyed being outdoors and near to the forests. He lived with the Elkingtons until 1904, when he moved into his own bungalow and began earning a living working on the Non Pareil tea estate below the Horton Plains. He spent much of his spare time hunting deer and trekking through the local forests, becoming acquainted with the Singhalese natives and taking a great interest in their Buddhist beliefs.\nIn December 1904, his parents and younger brother visited, with his father asking him to invest in a pioneering rubber plantation which Gardner was to manage; located near the village of Belihuloya, it was known as the Atlanta Estate, but allowed him a great deal of leisure time. Exploring his interest in weaponry, in 1907 Gardner joined the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps, a local volunteer force composed of European tea and rubber planters intent on protecting their interests from foreign aggression or domestic insurrection.\nIn 1907 Gardner returned to Britain for several months' leave, spending time with his family and joining the Legion of Frontiersmen, a militia founded to repel the threat of German invasion. During his visit, Gardner spent time with family relations, the Sergenesons; Gardner became friendly with this side of his family, whom his Anglican parents avoided because they were Methodists.\nAccording to Gardner, the Surgenesons talked about the paranormal with him; the patriarch of the family, Ted Surgeneson, believed that fairies were living in his garden and would say \"I can often feel they're there, and sometimes I've seen them\", though he readily admitted the possibility that it was all in his imagination. It was from the Sergenesons that Gardner discovered a family rumour that his grandfather, Joseph, had been a practising witch, after being converted to the practice by his mistress. Another unconfirmed family belief repeated by Gardner was that a Scottish ancestor, Grissell Gairdner, had been burned as a witch in Newburgh in 1610.\nGardner returned to Ceylon in late 1907 and settled down to the routine of managing the rubber plantation. In 1910 he was initiated as an Apprentice Freemason into the Sphinx Lodge No. 107 in Colombo, affiliated with the Irish Grand Lodge. Gardner placed great importance on this new activity; In order to attend masonic meetings, he had to arrange a weekend's leave, walk 15 miles to the nearest railway station in Haputale, and then catch a train to the city.\nHe entered into the second and third degrees of Freemasonry within the next month, but this enthusiasm seems also to have waned, and he resigned the next year, probably because he intended to leave Ceylon. The experiment with rubber growing at the Atlanta Estate had proved relatively unsuccessful, and Gardner's father decided to sell the property in 1911, leaving Gerald unemployed.\nThat year, Gardner moved to British North Borneo, gaining employment as a rubber planter at the Mawo Estate at Membuket. However, he did not get on well with the plantation's manager, a racist named R. J. Graham who had wanted to deforest the entire local area. Instead, Gardner became friendly with many of the locals, including the Dayak and Dusun people.\nAn amateur anthropologist, Gardner was fascinated by the indigenous way of life, particularly the local forms of weaponry such as the \"sumpitan\". He was intrigued by the tattoos of the Dayaks and pictures of him in later life show large snake or dragon tattoos on his forearms, presumably obtained at this time. Taking a great interest in indigenous religious beliefs, Gardner told his first biographer that he had attended Dusun s\u00e9ances or healing rituals.\nHe was unhappy with the working conditions and the racist attitudes of his colleagues, and when he developed malaria he felt that this was the last straw; he left Borneo and moved to Singapore, in what was then known as the Straits Settlements, part of British Malaya.\nMalaya and World War I: 1911\u20131926.\nArriving in Singapore, he initially planned to return to Ceylon, but was offered a job working as an assistant on a rubber plantation in Perak, northern Malaya, and decided to take it, working for the Borneo Company. Arriving in the area, he decided to supplement this income by purchasing his own estate, Bukit Katho, on which he could grow rubber; initially sized at 450 acres, Gardner purchased various pieces of adjacent land until it covered 600 acres.\nHere, Gardner made friends with an American man known as Cornwall, who had converted to Islam and married a local Malay woman. Through Cornwall, Gardner was introduced to many locals, whom he soon befriended, including members of the Senoi and Malay peoples. Cornwall invited Gardner to make the \"Shahada\", the Muslim confession of faith, which he did; it allowed him to gain the trust of locals, although he would never become a practising Muslim. Cornwall was however an unorthodox Muslim, and his interest in local peoples included their magical and spiritual beliefs, to which he also introduced Gardner, who took a particular interest in the \"kris\", a ritual knife with magical uses.\nIn 1915, Gardner again joined a local volunteer militia, the Malay States Volunteer Rifles. Although between 1914 and 1918 World War I was raging in Europe, its effects were little felt in Malaya, apart from the 1915 Singapore Mutiny. Gardner was keen to do more towards the war effort and in 1916 once again returned to Britain. He attempted to join the Royal Navy but was turned down due to ill health. Unable to fight on the front lines, he began working as an orderly in the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) in the First Western General Hospital, Fazakerley, located on the outskirts of Liverpool.\nHe was working in the VAD when casualties came back from the Battle of the Somme and he was engaged in looking after patients and assisting in changing wound dressings. He soon had to give this up when his malaria returned, and so decided to return to Malaya in October 1916 because of the warmer climate.\nHe continued to manage the rubber plantation but after the end of the war, commodity prices dropped and by 1921 it was difficult to make a profit. He returned again to Britain, in what later biographer Philip Heselton speculated might have been an unsuccessful attempt to ask his father for money. Returning to Malaya, Gardner found that the Borneo Company had sacked him, and he was forced to find work with the Public Works Department. In September 1923 he successfully applied to the Office of Customs to become a government-inspector of rubber plantations, a job that involved a great amount of travelling around the country, something he enjoyed.\nAfter a brief but serious illness, the Johore government reassigned Gardner to an office in the Lands Office while he recovered, eventually being promoted to Principal Officer of Customs. In this capacity, he was made an Inspector of Rubber Shops, overseeing the regulation and sale of rubber in the country. In 1926 he was placed in charge of monitoring shops selling opium, noting regular irregularities and a thriving illegal trade in the controlled substance; believing opium to be essentially harmless, there is evidence indicating that Gardner probably took many bribes in this position, earning himself a small fortune.\nMarriage and archaeology: 1927\u20131936.\nGardner's mother had died in 1920, but he had not returned to Britain on that occasion. However, in 1927 his father became very ill with dementia, and Gardner decided to visit him. On his return to Britain, Gardner began to investigate spiritualism and mediumship. He soon had several encounters which he attributed to spirits of deceased family members.\nContinuing to visit Spiritualist churches and s\u00e9ances, he was highly critical of much of what he saw, although he encountered several mediums he considered genuine. One medium apparently made contact with a deceased cousin of Gardner's, an event which impressed him greatly. His first biographer Jack Bracelin reports that this was a watershed in Gardner's life, and that a previous academic interest in spiritualism and life after death thereafter became a matter of firm personal belief for him.\nThe very same evening (28 July 1927) after Gardner had met this medium, he met the woman he was to marry; Dorothea Frances Rosedale, known as Donna, a relation of his sister-in-law Edith. He asked her to marry him the next day and she agreed. Because his leave was coming to an end very soon, they married quickly on 16 August at St Jude's Church, Kensington, and then honeymooned in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, before heading via France to Malaya.\nArriving in the country, the couple settled into a bungalow at Bukit Japon in Johor Bahru. Here, he once more became involved in Freemasonry, joining the Johore Royal Lodge No. 3946, but had retired from it by April 1931. Gardner also returned to his old interests in the anthropology of Malaya, witnessing the magical practices performed by the locals, and he readily accepted a belief in magic. During his time in Malaya, Gardner became increasingly interested in local customs, particularly those involved in folk magic and weapons.\nGardner was not only interested in the anthropology of Malaya, but also in its archaeology. He began excavations at the city of Johore Lama, alone and in secret, as the local Sultan considered archaeologists little better than grave-robbers. Prior to Gardner's investigations, no serious archaeological excavation had occurred at the city, though he himself soon unearthed four miles of earthworks, and uncovered finds that included tombs, pottery, and porcelain dating from Ming China.\nHe went on to begin further excavations at the royal cemetery of Kota Tinggi, and the jungle city of Syong Penang. His finds were displayed as an exhibit on the \"Early History of Johore\" at the National Museum of Singapore, and several beads that he had discovered suggested that trade went on between the Roman Empire and the Malays, presumably, Gardner thought, via India. He also found gold coins originating from Johore and he published academic papers on both the beads and the coins.\nBy the early 1930s Gardner's activities had moved from those exclusively of a civil servant, and he began to think of himself more as a folklorist, archaeologist and anthropologist. He was encouraged in this by the director of the Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) and by his election to Fellowship of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1936.\nEn route back to London in 1932 Gardner stopped off in Egypt and, armed with a letter of introduction, joined Sir Flinders Petrie who was excavating the site of Tall al-Ajjul in Palestine. Arriving in London in August 1932 he attended a conference on prehistory and protohistory at King's College London, attending at least two lectures which described the cult of the Mother Goddess. He also befriended the archaeologist and practising Pagan Alexander Keiller, known for his excavations at Avebury, who would encourage Gardner to join in with the excavations at Hembury Hill in Devon, also attended by Aileen Fox and Mary Leakey.\nReturning to East Asia, he took a ship from Singapore to Saigon in French Indo-China, from where he travelled to Phnom Penh, visiting the Silver Pagoda. He then took a train to Hangzhou in China, before continuing onto Shanghai; because of the ongoing Chinese Civil War, the train did not stop throughout the entire journey, something that annoyed the passengers. In 1935, Gardner attended the Second Congress for Prehistoric Research in the Far East in Manila, Philippines, acquainting himself with several experts in the field.\nHis main research interest lay in the Malay \"kris\" blade, which he unusually chose to spell \"keris\"; he eventually collected 400 examples and talked to natives about their magico-religious uses. Deciding to author a book on the subject, he wrote \"Keris and Other Malay Weapons\", being encouraged to do so by anthropologist friends; it would subsequently be edited into a readable form by Betty Lumsden Milne and published by the Singapore-based Progressive Publishing Company in 1936. It was well received by literary and academic circles in Malaya.\nIn 1935, Gardner heard that his father had died, leaving him a bequest of \u00a33,000. This assurance of financial independence may have led him to consider retirement, and as he was due for a long leave in 1936 the Johore Civil Service allowed him to retire slightly early, in January 1936. Gardner wanted to stay in Malaya, but he conceded to his wife Donna, who insisted that they return to England.\nReturn to Europe: 1936\u20131938.\nIn 1936, Gardner and Donna left Malaya and headed for Europe. She proceeded straight to London, renting them a flat at 26 Charing Cross Road. Gardner visited Palestine, becoming involved in the archaeological excavations run by J.L. Starkey at Lachish. Here he grew particularly interested in a temple containing statues to both the male deity of Judeo-Christian theology and the pagan goddess Ashtoreth.\nFrom Palestine, Gardner went to Turkey, Greece, Hungary, and Germany. He eventually reached England, but soon went on a visit to Denmark to attend a conference on weaponry at the Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen, during which he gave a talk on the \"kris\".\nReturning to Britain, he found that the climate made him sick, leading him to register with a doctor, Edward A. Gregg, who recommended that he try nudism. Hesitant at first, Gardner first attended an indoor nudist club, the Lotus League in Finchley, North London, where he made several new friends and felt that the nudity cured his ailment. When summer came, he decided to visit an outdoor nudist club, that of Fouracres near the town of Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, which he soon began to frequent.\nThrough nudism, Gardner made a number of notable friends, including James Laver (1899\u20131975), who became the Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Cottie Arthur Burland (1905\u20131983), who was the Curator of the Department of Ethnography at the British Museum. Biographer Philip Heselton suggested that through the nudist scene Gardner may have also met Dion Byngham (1896\u20131990), a senior member of the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry who propounded a Contemporary Pagan religion known as Dionysianism. By the end of 1936, Gardner was finding his Charing Cross Road flat to be cramped and moved into the block of flats at 32a Buckingham Palace Mansions.\nFearing the cold of the English winter, Gardner decided to sail to Cyprus in late 1936, remaining there into the following year. Visiting the Museum in Nicosia, he studied the Bronze Age swords of the island, successfully hafting one of them, on the basis of which he wrote a paper entitled \"The Problem of the Cypriot Bronze Dagger Hilt\", which would subsequently be translated into both French and Danish, being published in the journals of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pr\u00e9historique Fran\u00e7aise and the Vaabenhistorisk Selskab respectively.\nBack in London, in September 1937, Gardner applied for and received a Doctorate of Philosophy from the Meta Collegiate Extension of the National Electronic Institute, an organisation based in Nevada that was widely recognised by academic institutions as offering invalid academic degrees via post for a fee. He would subsequently style himself as \"Dr. Gardner\", despite the fact that academic institutions would not recognise his qualifications.\nPlanning to return to the Palestinian excavations the following winter, he was prevented from doing so when Starkey was murdered. Instead, he decided to return to Cyprus. A believer in reincarnation, Gardner came to believe that he had lived on the island once before, in a previous life, subsequently buying a plot of land in Famagusta, planning to build a house on it, although this never came about.\nInfluenced by his dreams, he wrote his first novel, \"A Goddess Arrives\", over the next few years. Revolving around an Englishman living in 1930s London named Robert Denvers who has recollections of a previous life as a Bronze Age Cypriot \u2013 an allusion to Gardner himself \u2013 the primary plot of \"A Goddess Arrives\" is set in ancient Cyprus and featured a queen, Dayonis, who practices sorcery in an attempt to help her people defend themselves from invading Egyptians. Published in late 1939, biographer Philip Heselton noted that the book was \"a very competent first work of fiction\", with strong allusions to the build-up which proceeded World War II.\nReturning to London, he helped to dig shelter trenches in Hyde Park as a part of the build-up to the war, also volunteering for the Air Raid Wardens' Service. Fearing the bombing of the city, Gardner and his wife soon moved to Highcliffe, just south of the New Forest in Hampshire. Here, they purchased a house built in 1923 named Southridge, situated on the corner of Highland Avenue and Elphinstone Road.\nInvolvement in Wicca.\nThe Rosicrucian Order: 1938\u20131939.\nIn Highcliffe, Gardner came across a building describing itself as the \"First Rosicrucian Theatre in England\". Having an interest in Rosicrucianism, a prominent magico-religious tradition within Western esotericism, Gardner decided to attend one of the plays performed by the group; in August 1939, Gardner took his wife to a theatrical performance based on the life of Pythagoras. An amateur thespian, she hated the performance, thinking the quality of both actors and script terrible, and she refused to go again.\nUnperturbed and hoping to learn more of Rosicrucianism, Gardner joined the group in charge of running the theatre, the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, and began attending meetings held in their local \"ashram\". Founded in 1920 by George Alexander Sullivan, the Fellowship had been based upon a blend of Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, Freemasonry and his own personal innovation, and had moved to Christchurch in 1930.\nAs time went by, Gardner became critical of many of the Rosicrucian Order's practices; Sullivan's followers claimed that he was immortal, having formerly been the famous historical figures Pythagoras, Cornelius Agrippa and Francis Bacon. Gardner facetiously asked if he was also the Wandering Jew, much to the annoyance of Sullivan himself. Another belief held by the group that Gardner found amusing was that a lamp hanging from one of the ceilings was the disguised Holy Grail of Arthurian legend.\nGardner's dissatisfaction with the group grew, particularly when in 1939, one of the group's leaders sent a letter out to all members in which she stated that war would not come. The very next day, Britain declared war on Germany, greatly unimpressing the increasingly cynical Gardner.\nAlongside Rosicrucianism, Gardner had also been pursuing other interests. In 1939, Gardner joined the Folk-Lore Society; his first contribution to its journal \"Folk-Lore\", appeared in the June 1939 issue and described a box of witchcraft relics that he believed had belonged to the 17th century \"Witch-Finder General\", Matthew Hopkins. Subsequently, in 1946 he would go on to become a member of the society's governing council, although most other members of the society were wary of him and his academic credentials.\nGardner would also join the Historical Association, being elected co-president of its Bournemouth and Christchurch branch in June 1944, following which he became a vocal supporter for the construction of a local museum for the Christchurch borough. He also involved himself in preparations for the impending war, joining the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) as a warden, where he soon rose to a position of local seniority, with his own house being assigned as the ARP post. In 1940, following the outbreak of conflict, he also tried to sign up for the Local Defence Volunteers, or \"Home Guard\", but was turned away because he was already an ARP warden.\nHe managed to circumvent this restriction by joining his local Home Guard in the capacity as armourer, which was officially classified as technical staff. Gardner took a strong interest in the Home Guard, helping to arm his fellows from his own personal weaponry collection and personally manufacturing molotov cocktails.\nThe New Forest coven: 1939\u20131944.\nAlthough sceptical of the Rosicrucian Order, Gardner got on well with a group of individuals inside the group who were \"rather brow-beaten by the others, kept themselves to themselves.\" Gardner's biographer Philip Heselton theorised that this group consisted of Edith Woodford-Grimes (1887\u20131975), Susie Mason, her brother Ernie Mason, and their sister Rosetta Fudge, all of whom had originally come from Southampton before moving to the area around Highcliffe, where they joined the Order.\nAccording to Gardner, \"unlike many of the others [in the Order], [they] had to earn their livings, were cheerful and optimistic and had a real interest in the occult\". Gardner became \"really very fond of them\", remarking that he \"would have gone through hell and high water even then for any of them.\" In particular he grew close to Woodford-Grimes, being invited over to her home to meet her daughter, and the two helped each other with their writing, Woodford-Grimes probably assisting Gardner edit \"A Goddess Arrives\" prior to publication. Gardner would subsequently give her the nickname \"Dafo\", for which she would become better known.\nAccording to Gardner's later account, one night in September 1939, they took him to a large house owned by \"Old Dorothy\" Clutterbuck, a wealthy local woman, where he was made to strip naked and taken through an initiation ceremony. Halfway through the ceremony, he heard the word \"Wicca (Male)\" and \"Wicce (Female)\", and he recognised it as an Old English word for \"witch\".\nHe was already acquainted with Margaret Murray's theory of the Witch-cult, and that \"I then knew then that which I had thought burnt out hundreds of years ago still survived.\" This group were the New Forest coven, and he portrayed them as one of the few surviving covens of an ancient, pre-Christian Witch-Cult religion. Murray's theory of a pagan 'witch-cult' has been discredited. Later research by the likes of Hutton and Heselton has shown that the New Forest coven was probably only formed in the mid-1930s, based upon Murray's discredited theories and works on folk magic.\nGardner only ever described one of their rituals in depth, and this was an event that he termed \"Operation Cone of Power\". According to his own account, it took place in 1940 in a part of the New Forest and was designed to ward off the Nazis from invading Britain by magical means. Gardner wrote that a \"Great Circle\" was erected at night, with a \"great cone of power\" \u2013 a form of magical energy \u2013 being raised and sent to Berlin with the command of \"you cannot cross the sea, you cannot cross the sea, you cannot come, you cannot come\".\nBricket Wood and the Origins of Gardnerianism: 1945\u20131950.\nThroughout his time in the New Forest, Gardner had regularly travelled to London, keeping his flat at Buckingham Palace Mansions until mid-1939 and regularly visiting the Spielplatz nudist club there. At Spielplatz he befriended Ross Nichols, whom he would later introduce to the Pagan religion of Druidry; Nichols would become enamoured with this faith, eventually founding the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. However, following the war, Gardner decided to return to London, moving into 47 Ridgemount Gardens, Bloomsbury in late 1944 or early 1945.\nContinuing his interest in nudism, in 1945 he purchased a plot of land in Fouracres, a nudist colony near to the village of Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire that would soon be renamed Five Acres. As a result, he would become one of the major shareholders at the club, exercising a significant level of power over any administrative decisions and was involved in a recruitment drive to obtain more members.\nBetween 1936 and 1939, Gardner befriended the Christian mystic J.S.M. Ward, proprietor of the Abbey Folk Park, Britain's oldest open-air museum. One of the exhibits was a 16th-century cottage that Ward had found near to Ledbury, Herefordshire and had transported to his park, where he exhibited it as a \"witch's cottage\". Gardner made a deal with Ward exchanging the cottage for Gardner's piece of land near to Famagusta in Cyprus.\nThe cottage was dismantled, and the parts transported to Bricket Wood, where they were reassembled on Gardner's land at Five Acres. In Midsummer 1947 he held a ceremony in the cottage as a form of housewarming, which Heselton speculated was probably based upon the ceremonial magic rites featured in \"The Key of Solomon\" grimoire.\nFurthering his interest in esoteric Christianity, in August 1946 Gardner was ordained as a priest in the Ancient British Church, a fellowship open to anyone who considered themselves a monotheist. Gardner also took an interest in Druidry, joining the Ancient Druid Order (ADO) and attending its annual Midsummer rituals at Stonehenge.\nHe also joined the Folk-Lore Society, being elected to their council in 1946, and that same year giving a talk on \"Art Magic and Talismans\". Nevertheless, many fellows \u2013 including Katherine Briggs \u2013 were dismissive of Gardner's ideas and his fraudulent academic credentials. In 1946 he also joined the Society for Psychical Research.\nOn May Day 1947, Gardner's friend Arnold Crowther introduced him to Aleister Crowley, the ceremonial magician who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904. Shortly before his death, Crowley elevated Gardner to the IV\u00b0 of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) and issued a charter decreeing that Gardner could admit people into its Minerval degree. The charter itself was written in Gardner's handwriting and only signed by Crowley.\nFrom November 1947 to March 1948, Gardner and his wife toured the United States visiting relatives in Memphis, also visiting New Orleans, where Gardner hoped to learn about Voodoo. During his voyage, Crowley had died, and as a result Gardner considered himself the head of the O.T.O. in Europe, (a position accepted by Lady Frieda Harris). He met Crowley's successor, Karl Germer, in New York though Gardner would soon lose interest in leading the O.T.O., and in 1951 he was replaced by Frederic Mellinger as the O.T.O.'s European representative.\nGardner hoped to spread Wicca and described some of its practices in a fictional form as \"High Magic's Aid\". Set in the twelfth-century, Gardner included scenes of ceremonial magic based on \"The Key of Solomon\". Published by the Atlantis Bookshop in July 1949, Gardner's manuscript had been edited into a publishable form by astrologer Madeline Montalban.\nPrivately, he had also begun work on a scrapbook known as \"Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical\", in which he wrote down a number of Wiccan rituals and spells. This would prove to be the prototype for what he later termed a Book of Shadows. He also gained some of his first initiates, Barbara and Gilbert Vickers, who were initiated at some point between autumn 1949 and autumn 1950.\nDoreen Valiente and the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft: 1950\u20131957.\nGardner also came into contact with Cecil Williamson, who was intent on opening his own museum devoted to witchcraft; the result would be the Folk-lore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft, opened in Castletown on the Isle of Man in 1951. Gardner and his wife moved to the island, where he took up the position of \"resident witch\". On 29 July, the \"Sunday Pictorial\" published an article about the museum in which Gardner declared \"Of course I'm a witch. And I get great fun out of it.\"\nThe museum was not a financial success, and the relationship between Gardner and Williamson deteriorated. In 1954, Gardner bought the museum from Williamson, who returned to England to form the rival Museum of Witchcraft, eventually settling it in Boscastle, Cornwall. Gardner renamed his exhibition the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft and continued running it up until his death.\nHe also acquired a flat at 145 Holland Road, near Shepherd's Bush in West London, but nevertheless fled to warmer climates during the winter, where his asthma would not be so badly affected, for instance spending time in France, Italy, and the Gold Coast. From his base in London, he would frequent Atlantis bookshop, thereby encountering a number of other occultists, including Austin Osman Spare and Kenneth Grant, and he also continued his communication with Karl Germer until 1956.\nIn 1952, Gardner had begun to correspond with a young woman named Doreen Valiente. She eventually requested initiation into the Craft, and though Gardner was hesitant at first, he agreed that they could meet during the winter at the home of Edith Woodford-Grimes. Valiente got on well with both Gardner and Woodford-Grimes and having no objections to either ritual nudity or scourging (which she had read about in a copy of Gardner's novel \"High Magic's Aid\" that he had given to her), she was initiated by Gardner into Wicca on Midsummer 1953.\nValiente went on to join the Bricket Wood Coven. She soon rose to become the High Priestess of the coven and helped Gardner to revise his Book of Shadows, and attempting to cut out most of Crowley's influence.\nIn 1954, Gardner published a non-fiction book, \"Witchcraft Today\", containing a preface by Margaret Murray, who had published her discredited theory of 'witchcraft' being a surviving pagan religion in her 1921 book, \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\". In his book, Gardner not only espoused Murray's theory, but also his theory that a belief in faeries in Europe was due to a secretive pygmy race that lived alongside other communities, and that the Knights Templar had been initiates of the Craft.\nAlongside this book, Gardner began to increasingly court publicity, going so far as to invite the press to write articles about the religion. Many of these turned out very negatively for the cult; one declared \"Witches Devil-Worship in London!\", and another accused him of whitewashing witchcraft in his luring of people into covens. Gardner continued courting publicity, despite the negative articles that many tabloids were producing, and believed that only through publicity could more people become interested in witchcraft, so preventing the \"Old Religion\", as he called it, from dying out.\nLater life and death.\nIn 1960, Gardner's official biography, entitled \"Gerald Gardner: Witch\", was published. It was written by a friend of his, the Sufi mystic Idries Shah, but used the name of one of Gardner's High Priests, Jack L. Bracelin, because Shah was wary about being associated with Witchcraft. In May of that year, Gardner travelled to Buckingham Palace, where he enjoyed a garden party in recognition of his years of service to the Empire in the Far East. Soon after his trip, Gardner's wife Donna died, and Gardner himself once again began to suffer badly from asthma.\nThe following year he, along with Shah and Lois Bourne, travelled to the island of Mallorca to holiday with the poet Robert Graves, whose \"The White Goddess\" would play a significant part in the burgeoning Wiccan religion. In 1963, Gardner decided to go to Lebanon over the winter. Whilst returning home on the \"Scottish Prince\" on 12 February 1964, he suffered a fatal heart attack at the breakfast table. He was buried in Tunisia, the ship's next port of call, and his funeral was attended only by the ship's captain. He was 79 years old.\nThough having bequeathed the museum, all his artifacts, and the copyright to his books in his will to one of his High Priestesses, Monique Wilson, she and her husband sold off the artefact collection to the American Ripley's Believe It or Not! organisation several years later. Ripley's took the collection to America, where it was displayed in two museums before being sold off during the 1980s. Gardner had also left parts of his inheritance to Patricia Crowther, Doreen Valiente, Lois Bourne and Jack Bracelin, the latter inheriting the Fiveacres Nudist Club and taking over as full-time High Priest of the Bricket Wood coven.\nSeveral years after Gardner's death, the Wiccan High Priestess Eleanor Bone visited North Africa and went looking for Gardner's grave. She discovered that the cemetery he was interred in was to be redeveloped, and so she raised enough money for his body to be moved to another cemetery in Tunis, where it currently remains. In 2007, a new plaque was attached to his grave, describing him as being \"Father of Modern Wicca. Beloved of the Great Goddess\".\nPersonal life.\nGardner only married once, to Donna, and several who knew him have said that he was devoted to her. Indeed, after her death in 1960, he began to again suffer serious asthma attacks. Despite this, as many coven members slept over at his cottage due to living too far away to travel home safely, he was known to cuddle up to his young High Priestess, Dayonis, after rituals. The author Philip Heselton, who largely researched Wicca's origins, came to the conclusion that Gardner had held a long-term affair with Dafo, a theory expanded upon by Adrian Bott.\nThose who knew him within the Wiccan movement recalled how he was a firm believer in the therapeutic benefits of sunbathing. He also had several tattoos on his body, depicting magical symbols such as a snake, dragon, anchor and dagger. In his later life he wore a \"heavy bronze bracelet... denoting the three degrees... of witchcraft\" as well as a \"large silver ring with... signs on it, which... represented his witch-name 'Scire', in the letters of the magical Theban alphabet.\"\nAccording to Bricket Wood coven member Frederic Lamond, Gardner also used to comb his beard into a narrow barbiche and his hair into two horn like peaks, giving him \"a somewhat demonic appearance\". Lamond thought that Gardner was \"surprisingly lacking in charisma\" for someone at the forefront of a religious movement.\nGardner was a supporter of the centre-right Conservative Party, and for several years had been a member of the Highcliffe Conservative Association, as well as being an avid reader of the pro-Conservative newspaper, \"The Daily Telegraph\".\nCriticisms.\nVirulent homophobia.\nLois Bourne, one of the High Priestesses of the Bricket Wood Coven, accused Gardner of homophobia:\nGerald was homophobic. He had a deep hatred and detestation of homosexuality, which he regarded as a disgusting perversion and a flagrant transgression of natural law\u00a0... \"There are no homosexual witches, and it is not possible to be a homosexual and a witch\" Gerald almost shouted. No one argued with him.\nMisogyny.\nGardner has weathered many accusations of misogyny as a result of his choice of rituals. Women are heavily sexualized, often naked, and their genitals included heavily within his worship. His work, The Gardnerian Book of Shadows, includes the following controversial lines:\"As a man loveth a woman, by mastering her, so the Wicca should love the Gods, by being mastered by them.\"\n\"A woman may impersonate either the God or the Goddess, but a man may only impersonate the God.\"\n\"And the greatest virtue of a High Priestess is that she recognizes that youth is necessary to the representative of the Goddess, so that she will retire gracefully in favour of a younger woman, Should the Coven so decide in Council, For the true [30] High Priestess realizes that gracefully surrendering pride of place is one of the greatest of virtues, and that thereby she will return to that pride of place in another life, with greater power and beauty.\"In Witchcraft Today, published in 1954, he states, \"The witches tell me: 'The law always has been that power must be passed from man to woman or from woman to man, the only exception being when a mother initiates her daughter or a father his son, because they are part of themselves.' (The reason is that great love is apt to occur between people who go through the rites together.) They go on to say: The Templars broke this age-old rule and passed the power from man to man: this led to sin and in so doing it brought about their downfall.'\" While Gardner theorizes this may be a cover for the true reason behind the fall of the Order, he mirrors these ideas further in his writings.\nFalse educational claims.\nIn a 1951 interview with a journalist from the \"Sunday Pictorial\" newspaper, Gardner said he was a Doctor of Philosophy from Singapore and also had a doctorate in literature from Toulouse. Later investigation by Doreen Valiente suggested that these claims were false. The University of Singapore did not exist at that time and the University of Toulouse had no record of his receiving a doctorate. Valiente suggests that these claims may have been a form of compensation for his lack of formal education.\nMedia engagement.\nValiente further criticises Gardner for his publicity-seeking, or at least his indiscretion. After a series of tabloid expos\u00e9s, some members of his coven proposed some rules limiting what members of the Craft should say to non-members. Valiente reports that Gardner responded with a set of Wiccan laws of his own, which he claimed were original, but others suspected he had made up on the spot. This led to a split in the coven, with Valiente and others leaving.\nLegacy.\nCommenting on Gardner, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White commented that \"There are few figures in esoteric history who can rival him for his dominating place in the pantheon of Pagan pioneers.\"\nIn 2012, Philip Heselton published a two-volume biography of Gardner, titled \"Witchfather\". The biography was reviewed by Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White in \"The Pomegranate\" journal, where he commented that it was \"more exhaustive with greater detail\" than Heselton's prior tomes and was \"excellent in most respects\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After growing up Catholic, MacLeod became an evangelical Christian in 1984. His career, which spanned six decades, included work as a Christian television host, author, and guest on several talk, variety, and religious programs.\nMacLeod's career began in films in 1957. In 1960 he was on an episode of \"Death Valley Days\" named \"Yankee Confederate\". In 1965, he starred in \"The Sword of Ali Baba\". In 1967 he played a British Cpl. Tommy Behran in an episode of Combat. He went on to appear in \"A Man Called Gannon\" (1968), in \"The Thousand Plane Raid (1969)\", and in \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970).\nMacLeod also achieved continuing television success co-starring alongside Ernest Borgnine on \"McHale's Navy\" (1962\u20131964) as Joseph \"Happy\" Haines.\nEarly life.\nGavin MacLeod was born Allen George See on February 28, 1931, in Mount Kisco, New York. His mother, Margaret (n\u00e9e Shea) See (1906\u20132004), a middle school dropout, worked for \"Reader's Digest\". His father, George See (1906\u20131945), an electrician, was part Chippewa (Ojibwe). His brother Ronald was three years his junior. He grew up in Pleasantville, New York, and studied acting at Ithaca College, from which he graduated in 1952 with a bachelor's degree in fine arts.\nAfter serving in the United States Air Force, he moved to New York City and worked at Radio City Music Hall while looking for acting work. At about this time he changed his name, drawing \"Gavin\" from a physically disabled victim in a television drama, and \"MacLeod\" from his Ithaca drama coach, Beatrice MacLeod. MacLeod said in a 2013 interview with \"Parade\" about his stage name, he \"felt as if my name was getting in the way of my success.\" \"Allan,\" he wrote, \"just wasn't strong enough,\" and \"See\" was \"too confusing.\"\nCareer.\nMacLeod made his television debut in 1957 on \"The Walter Winchell File\" at the age of 26. His first movie appearance was a small, uncredited role in \"The True Story of Lynn Stuart\" in 1958. Soon thereafter, he landed a credited role in \"I Want to Live!\", a 1958 prison drama starring Susan Hayward. He was soon noticed by Blake Edwards, who in 1958 cast him in the pilot episode of his NBC series \"Peter Gunn\", two guest roles on the Edwards CBS series \"Mr. Lucky\" in 1959, and as a nervous and harried Navy yeoman in \"Operation Petticoat\", with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. \"Operation Petticoat\" proved to be a breakout role for MacLeod, and he was soon cast in two other Edwards' comedies, \"High Time\" with Bing Crosby and \"The Party\" with Peter Sellers.\nIn December 1961, he landed a guest role on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", which was his first time working with Mary Tyler Moore. MacLeod also had guest appearances on \"Perry Mason\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Ben Casey\", \"The Big Valley\", \"Hogan's Heroes\", \"Ironside\", and \"My Favorite Martian\". He played the role of a drug pusher, \"Big Chicken\", in two episodes of the first season of \"Hawaii Five-O\".\nHis first regular television role began in 1962 as Joseph \"Happy\" Haines on \"McHale's Navy\", but he was frustrated with the role's limitations. He later described Haines as \"not much of a character\" who had \"two lines a week\", and was sometimes simply used as a prop: \"Sometimes they'd have me stand there. They'd shoot on a back lot, and they'd use me to cover something they didn't want anybody to see on the back lot.\" McLeod left the show after two seasons to appear as Signalman 2nd Class Crosley in the film \"The Sand Pebbles\" with Steve McQueen.\nMacLeod's second breakout role, as Murray Slaughter on CBS's \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" won him lasting fame and two Golden Globe Award nominations. His starring role as Captain Stubing on \"The Love Boat\", his next television series, was broadcast in 90 countries worldwide, between 1977 and 1986, spanning nine seasons. His work on that show earned him three Golden Globe nominations. Co-starring with him was a familiar actor and best friend Bernie Kopell as Dr. Adam Bricker and Ted Lange as bartender Isaac Washington. Lange said in a 2017 interview with \"The Wiseguyz Show\" of MacLeod that \"Oh yeah, sure, Gavin was wonderful. Gavin lives down here in Palm Springs and we're still tight, all of us, Gavin and Bernie and Jill; we still see each other. Fred (Grandy) lives in a different state, we're still close, we're still good friends.\"\nMacLeod became the global ambassador for Princess Cruises in 1986. He played a role in ceremonies launching many of the line's new ships. In 1997, MacLeod joined the \"Love Boat\" cast on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\nAfter \"The Love Boat\", MacLeod toured with Michael Learned (of \"The Waltons\") in \"Love Letters\". He made several appearances in musicals such as \"Gigi\" and \"Copacabana\" between 1997 and 2003. In December 2008, he appeared with the Colorado Symphony in Denver.\nMacLeod and his wife were hosts on the Trinity Broadcasting Network for 17 years, primarily hosting a show about marriage called \"Back on Course\". MacLeod appeared in Rich Christiano's \"Time Changer,\" a movie about time travel and how the morals of society have moved away from the Bible. He also plays the lead role in Christiano's 2009 film \"The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry\".\nLater activity.\nIn April 2010, the entire cast of \"The Love Boat\" attended the TV Land Awards with the exception of MacLeod, due to a back operation to repair a couple of injured discs. Former co-star and long-term friend Ted Lange contacted him and received word that MacLeod was doing well. In December, MacLeod appeared as a guest narrator with the Florida Orchestra and Master Chorale of Tampa Bay.\nMacLeod served as the honorary Mayor of Pacific Palisades for five years, until Sugar Ray Leonard succeeded him in 2011. On February 28, 2011, MacLeod celebrated his 80th birthday aboard the \"Golden Princess\" on Princess Cruises in Los Angeles, California. His friends and family wished him a happy birthday and presented him with a 3-D cake replica of the \"Pacific Princess\", the original \"Love Boat\".\nMacLeod appeared on the special for Betty White's 90th birthday on January 17, 2012. He reunited with White to film \"Safety Old School Style\", an in-flight safety video for Air New Zealand in 2013. By January 2013, the video had been viewed two million times on YouTube. In October 2013, MacLeod appeared on \"Today\" to begin the promotional tour for his new book \"This Is Your Captain Speaking: My Fantastic Voyage Through Hollywood, Faith &amp; Life\". This appearance included a special set change to honor MacLeod's appearance on the show. In addition to television appearances, he continued his national book tour.\nOn November 5, 2013, MacLeod joined his \"Love Boat\" cast mates live on the CBS daytime show \"The Talk\". A full one-hour episode was dedicated to the cast reunion. The \"Talk\" co-hosts dressed in costumes to commemorate their special guests' arrivals. Spanish-American actress Charo also appeared on the reunion show. Charo guest-starred in eight episodes of \"The Love Boat\". Jack Jones performed the \"Love Boat\" theme song, which he introduced in 1977.\nIn December 2013, MacLeod appeared on \"The 700 Club\" to discuss his life and career. The following year, on February 1, MacLeod was honored with a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in downtown Palm Springs, California. In January 2015, MacLeod appeared in the Rose Parade along with several other members of the original cast of \"The Love Boat\". Later that same year MacLeod starred in the play \"Happy Hour\" at the Coachella Valley Repertory Theatre (CVRep) in Rancho Mirage, California, a role which earned him critical praise.\nWriting.\nIn 1987, following MacLeod's conversion to evangelical Christianity and remarriage, he and his wife, Patti, wrote about his struggles with alcoholism and their divorce in \"Back On Course: The Remarkable Story of a Divorce That Ended in Remarriage\".\nIn the 1980s Gavin and his wife Patti started a seminar called Born Again Marriages. The main purpose was to share their journey with others that were going through separation or divorce. They really wanted to see marriages salvaged much like theirs.\nIn 2013, MacLeod released a memoir, \"This Is Your Captain Speaking: My Fantastic Voyage Through Hollywood, Faith &amp; Life\". He said, \"...all my living has been based on what other people have written... I hope it can help others, how I overcame and never gave up. There are so many lessons in life.\" In the book, MacLeod recounted his stories as a young actor trying to make a name for himself in Hollywood, the lifelong friends he made, struggles with alcoholism, divorce, and faith.\nPersonal life.\nWhile working as an usher and elevator operator at Radio City Music Hall, MacLeod met dancer Joan F. Rootvik, who was a Rockette. They married in 1955 and had two sons and two daughters before divorcing in 1972.\nIn 1974, he married Patti Kendig. The couple divorced in 1982 and remarried in 1985. During the mid-1980s, they became evangelical Christians and credited their faith for bringing them back together.\nOn September 20, 2009, MacLeod discussed his conversion to evangelicalism at The Rock Church in Anaheim, California, and was a guest speaker there in 2012.\nDeath.\nMacLeod died at his home in Palm Desert, California, on May 29, 2021, aged 90. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Cathedral City.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12794", "revid": "1152308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12794", "title": "Gopher (protocol)", "text": "TCP/IP application layer protocol\nThe Gopher protocol () is a communication protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents in Internet Protocol networks. The design of the Gopher protocol and user interface is menu-driven, and presented an alternative to the World Wide Web in its early stages, but ultimately fell into disfavor, yielding to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The Gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web.\nUsage.\nThe Gopher protocol was invented by a team led by Mark P. McCahill at the University of Minnesota. It offers some features not natively supported by the Web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on the documents it stores. Its text menu interface is well-suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote text-oriented computer terminals, which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991, and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations.\nGopher's hierarchical structure provided a platform for the first large-scale electronic library connections. The Gopher protocol is still in use by enthusiasts, and although it has been almost entirely supplanted by the Web, a small population of actively maintained servers remains.\nOrigins.\nThe Gopher system was released in mid-1991 by Mark P. McCahill, Farhad Anklesaria, Paul Lindner, Daniel Torrey, and Bob Alberti of the University of Minnesota in the United States. Its central goals were, as stated in :\nGopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services, including WAIS, the Archie and Veronica search engines, and gateways to other information systems such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Usenet.\nThe general interest in campus-wide information systems (CWISs) in higher education at the time, and the ease of setup of Gopher servers to create an instant CWIS with links to other sites' online directories and resources, were the factors contributing to Gopher's rapid adoption.\nThe name was coined by Anklesaria as a play on several meanings of the word \"gopher\". The University of Minnesota mascot is the gopher, a is an assistant who \"goes for\" things, and a gopher burrows through the ground to reach a desired location.\nDecline.\nThe World Wide Web was in its infancy in 1991, and Gopher services quickly became established. By the late 1990s, Gopher had ceased expanding. Several factors contributed to Gopher's stagnation:\nGopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts, and there have been attempts to revive Gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices. One attempt is The Overbite Project, which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients.\nTechnical details.\nThe conceptualization of knowledge in \"Gopher space\" or a \"cloud\" as specific information in a particular file, and the prominence of the FTP, influenced the technology and the resulting functionality of Gopher.\nGopher characteristics.\nGopher is designed to function and to appear much like a mountable read-only global network file system (and software, such as gopher://, is available that can actually mount a Gopher server as a FUSE resource). At a minimum, whatever can be done with data files on a CD-ROM, can be done on Gopher.\nA Gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server.\nSimilar to a file on a Web server, a file on a Gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other Gopher server. Many servers take advantage of this inter-server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access.\nProtocol.\nThe Gopher protocol was first described in . Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 70 to the Gopher protocol. The protocol is simple to negotiate, making it possible to browse without using a client.\nUser request.\nFirst, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a line feed (a \"CR + LF\" sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the item selector were an empty line, the default directory would be selected.\nServer response.\nThe server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection closes, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close a connection without returning a final full-stop. The main type of reply from the server is a text or binary resource. Alternatively, the resource can be a menu: a form of structured text resource providing references to other resources.\nBecause of the simplicity of the Gopher protocol, tools such as netcat make it possible to download Gopher content easily from a command line:\n$ echo jacks/jack.exe | nc gopher.example.org 70 &gt; jack.exe\nThe protocol is also supported by cURL since 7.21.2-DEV, which was released in 2010.\nSearch request.\nThe selector string in the request can optionally be followed by a tab character and a search string. This is used by item type 7.\nSource code of a menu.\nGopher menu items are defined by lines of tab-separated values in a text file. This file is sometimes called a \"gophermap\". As the source code to a gopher menu, a gophermap is roughly analogous to an HTML file for a web page. Each tab-separated line (called a \"selector line\") gives the client software a description of the menu item: what it is, what it is called, and where it leads to. The client displays the menu items in the order that they appear in the gophermap.\nThe first character in a selector line indicates the \"item type\", which tells the client what kind of file or protocol the menu item points to. This helps the client decide what to do with it. Gopher's item types are a more basic precursor to the media type system used by the Web and email attachments.\nThe item type is followed by the \"user display string\" (a description or label that represents the item in the menu); the selector (a path or other string for the resource on the server); the \"hostname\" (the domain name or IP address of the server), and the network port.\nAll lines in a gopher menu are terminated by \"CR + LF\".\nExample of a selector line in a menu source: The following selector line generates a link to the \"/home\" directory at the subdomain gopher.floodgap.com, on port 70. The item type of 1 indicates that the linked resource is a Gopher menu itself. The string \"Floodgap Home\" is what the client will show to the user when visiting the example menu.\n 1Floodgap Home /home gopher.floodgap.com 70\nItem types.\nIn a Gopher menu's source code, a one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. This code may either be a digit or a letter of the alphabet; letters are case-sensitive.\nThe technical specification for Gopher, , defines 14 item types. The later gopher+ specification defined an additional 3 types. A one-character code indicates what kind of content the client should expect. Item type is an error code for exception handling. Gopher client authors improvised item types (HTML), (informational message), and (sound file) after the publication of RFC 1436. Browsers like Netscape Navigator and early versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer would prepend the item type code to the selector as described in , so that the type of the gopher item could be determined by the url itself. Most gopher browsers still available, use these prefixes in their urls.\nHere is an example gopher session where the user requires a gopher menu ( on the first line):\nThe gopher menu sent back from the server, is a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved. Most clients will display these as hypertext links, and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links.\nThis menu includes a text resource (itemtype on the third line), multiple links to submenus (itemtype , on the second line as well as lines 4\u20136) and a non-standard information message (from line 7 on), broken down to multiple lines by providing dummy values for selector, host and port.\nExternal links.\nHistorically, to create a link to a Web server, \"GET /\" was used as a pseudo-selector to emulate an HTTP GET request. John Goerzen created an addition to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as \"URL links\", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, to create a link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is , the display string is the title of the link, the item selector is \"URL:http://gopher.quux.org/\", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).\nGopher+.\nGopher+ is a forward compatible enhancement to the Gopher protocol. Gopher+ works by sending metadata between the client and the server. The enhancement was never widely adopted by Gopher servers.\nThe client sends a tab followed by a +. A Gopher+ server will respond with a status line followed by the content the client requested. An item is marked as supporting Gopher+ in the Gopher directory listing by a tab + after the port (this is the case of some of the items in the example above).\nOther features of Gopher+ include:\nClient software.\nGopher clients.\nThese are clients, libraries, and utilities primarily designed to access gopher resources.\nOther clients.\nClients like web browsers, libraries, and utilities primarily designed to access World Wide Web resources, but which maintain(ed) gopher support.\nBrowsers with no Gopher native support can still access servers using one of the available Gopher to HTTP gateways or proxy server that converts Gopher menus into HTML; known proxies are the Floodgap Public Gopher proxy and Gopher Proxy. Similarly, certain server packages such as GN and PyGopherd have built-in Gopher to HTTP interfaces. Squid Proxy software gateways any codice_1 URL to HTTP content, enabling any browser or web agent to access gopher content easily.\nFor Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey, Overbite extensions extend Gopher browsing and support the current versions of the browsers (Firefox Quantum v \u226557 and equivalent versions of SeaMonkey):\nOverbiteWX includes support for accessing Gopher servers not on port 70 using a whitelist and for CSO/ph queries. OverbiteFF always uses port 70.\nFor Chromium and Google Chrome, Burrow is available. It redirects codice_1 URLs to a proxy. In the past an Overbite proxy-based extension for these browsers was available but is no longer maintained and does not work with the current (&gt;23) releases.\nFor Konqueror, Kio gopher is available.\nAs the bandwidth-sparing simple interface of Gopher can be a good match for mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs), the early 2010s saw a renewed interest in native Gopher clients for popular smartphones.\nGopher popularity was at its height at a time when there were still many equally competing computer architectures and operating systems. As a result, there are several Gopher clients available for Acorn RISC OS, AmigaOS, Atari MiNT, Conversational Monitor System (CMS), DOS, classic Mac OS, MVS, NeXT, OS/2 Warp, most Unix-like operating systems, VMS, Windows 3.x, and Windows 9x. GopherVR was a client designed for 3D visualization, and there is even a Gopher client in MOO. Most such clients are hard-coded to work on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 70.\nServer software.\nBecause the protocol is trivial to implement in a basic fashion, there are many server packages still available, and some are still maintained.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are distinct from by-elections, which fill individual seats that have become vacant between general elections. General elections typically occur at regular intervals as mandated by a country's constitution or electoral laws, and may include elections for a legislature and sometimes other positions such as a directly elected president. In many jurisdictions, general elections can coincide with other electoral events such as local, regional, or supranational elections. For example, on 25 May 2014, Belgian voters simultaneously elected their national parliament, 21 members of the European Parliament, and regional parliaments.\nIn the United States, \"general election\" has a slightly different, but related meaning: the ordinary electoral competition following the selection of candidates in the primary election.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe term \"general election\" in the United Kingdom often refers to the elections held on the same day in all constituencies of their members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons.\nHistorically, English and later British general elections took place over a period of several weeks, with individual constituencies holding polling on different days. However, from the 1918 election onwards, the elections in all constituencies have been held on the same day. There has been a convention since the 1930s that general elections in Britain should take place on a Thursday; the last general election to take place on any other weekday was that of 1931.\nUnder the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, in force until March 2022, the period between one general election and the next was fixed at five years, unless the House of Commons passed one of the following:\nAlthough not provided for in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, an early election could also be brought about by an act of parliament specifically calling for a general election, which (unlike the second option above) only required a simple majority. This was the mechanism used to precipitate the December 2019 election, when the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 was enacted.\nThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022.\nThe term \"general election\" is also used in the United Kingdom to refer to elections to any democratically elected body in which all members are up for election. Section 2 of the Scotland Act 1998, for example, specifically refers to ordinary elections to the Scottish Parliament as general elections.\nUnited States.\nIn U.S. politics, general elections are elections held at any level (e.g. city, county, congressional district, state) that typically involve competition between at least two parties. General elections occur every two to six years (depending on the positions being filled, with most positions good for four years) and include the presidential election. \"General election\" does not refer to special elections, which fill out positions prematurely vacated by the previous office holder.\nMajor general elections are as follows: \nThe term \"general election\" is distinguished from primaries or caucuses, which are intra-party elections meant to select a party's official candidate for a particular race. Thus, if a primary is meant to elect a party's candidate for the position-in-question, a general election is meant to elect who occupies the position itself. Presidential primaries happen several months before the general election, though not all states hold primaries.\nIn the Louisiana the expression \"general election\" means the runoff election which occurs between the two highest candidates as determined by the jungle primary.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Genotype can also be used to refer to the alleles or variants an individual carries in a particular gene or genetic location. The number of alleles an individual can have in a specific gene depends on the number of copies of each chromosome found in that species, also referred to as ploidy. In diploid species like humans, two full sets of chromosomes are present, meaning each individual has two alleles for any given gene. If both alleles are the same, the genotype is referred to as homozygous. If the alleles are different, the genotype is referred to as heterozygous.\nGenotype contributes to phenotype, the observable traits and characteristics in an individual or organism. The degree to which genotype affects phenotype depends on the trait. For example, the petal color in a pea plant is exclusively determined by genotype. The petals can be purple or white depending on the alleles present in the pea plant. However, other traits are only partially influenced by genotype. These traits are often called complex traits because they are influenced by additional factors, such as environmental and epigenetic factors. Not all individuals with the same genotype look or act the same way because appearance and behavior are modified by environmental and growing conditions. Likewise, not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the same genotype.\nThe term \"genotype\" was coined by the Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1903.\nPhenotype.\nAny given gene will usually cause an observable change in an organism, known as the phenotype. The terms genotype and phenotype are distinct for at least two reasons:\nA simple example to illustrate genotype as distinct from phenotype is the flower colour in pea plants (see Gregor Mendel). There are three available genotypes, PP (homozygous dominant), Pp (heterozygous), and pp (homozygous recessive). All three have different genotypes but the first two have the same phenotype (purple) as distinct from the third (white).\nA more technical example to illustrate genotype is the single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP. A SNP occurs when corresponding sequences of DNA from different individuals differ at one DNA base, for example where the sequence AAGCCTA changes to AAGCTTA. This contains two alleles : C and T. SNPs typically have three genotypes, denoted generically AA Aa and aa. In the example above, the three genotypes would be CC, CT and TT. Other types of genetic marker, such as microsatellites, can have more than two alleles, and thus many different genotypes.\nPenetrance is the proportion of individuals showing a specified genotype in their phenotype under a given set of environmental conditions.\nMendelian inheritance.\nTraits that are determined exclusively by genotype are typically inherited in a Mendelian pattern. These laws of inheritance were described extensively by Gregor Mendel, who performed experiments with pea plants to determine how traits were passed on from generation to generation. He studied phenotypes that were easily observed, such as plant height, petal color, or seed shape. He was able to observe that if he crossed two true-breeding plants with distinct phenotypes, all the offspring would have the same phenotype. For example, when he crossed a tall plant with a short plant, all the resulting plants would be tall. However, when he self-fertilized the plants that resulted, about 1/4 of the second generation would be short. He concluded that some traits were dominant, such as tall height, and others were recessive, like short height. Though Mendel was not aware at the time, each phenotype he studied was controlled by a single gene with two alleles. In the case of plant height, one allele caused the plants to be tall, and the other caused plants to be short. When the tall allele was present, the plant would be tall, even if the plant was heterozygous. In order for the plant to be short, it had to be homozygous for the recessive allele.\nOne way this can be illustrated is using a Punnett square. In a Punnett square, the genotypes of the parents are placed on the outside. An uppercase letter is typically used to represent the dominant allele, and a lowercase letter is used to represent the recessive allele. The possible genotypes of the offspring can then be determined by combining the parent genotypes. In the example on the right, both parents are heterozygous, with a genotype of Bb. The offspring can inherit a dominant allele from each parent, making them homozygous with a genotype of BB. The offspring can inherit a dominant allele from one parent and a recessive allele from the other parent, making them heterozygous with a genotype of Bb. Finally, the offspring could inherit a recessive allele from each parent, making them homozygous with a genotype of bb. Plants with the BB and Bb genotypes will look the same, since the B allele is dominant. The plant with the bb genotype will have the recessive trait.\nThese inheritance patterns can also be applied to hereditary diseases or conditions in humans or animals. Some conditions are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning individuals with the condition typically have an affected parent as well. A classic pedigree for an autosomal dominant condition shows affected individuals in every generation. Other conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, where affected individuals do not typically have an affected parent. Since each parent must have a copy of the recessive allele in order to have an affected offspring, the parents are referred to as carriers of the condition.\nIn autosomal conditions, the sex of the offspring does not play a role in their risk of being affected. In sex-linked conditions, the sex of the offspring affects their chances of having the condition. In humans, females inherit two X chromosomes, one from each parent, while males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. X-linked dominant conditions can be distinguished from autosomal dominant conditions in pedigrees by the lack of transmission from fathers to sons, since affected fathers only pass their X chromosome to their daughters. In X-linked recessive conditions, males are typically affected more commonly because they are hemizygous, with only one X chromosome. In females, the presence of a second X chromosome will prevent the condition from appearing. Females are therefore carriers of the condition and can pass the trait on to their sons.\nMendelian patterns of inheritance can be complicated by additional factors. Some diseases show incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals with the disease-causing allele develop signs or symptoms of the disease. Penetrance can also be age-dependent, meaning signs or symptoms of disease are not visible until later in life. For example, Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant condition, but up to 25% of individuals with the affected genotype will not develop symptoms until after age 50. Another factor that can complicate Mendelian inheritance patterns is variable expressivity, in which individuals with the same genotype show different signs or symptoms of disease. For example, individuals with polydactyly can have a variable number of extra digits.\nNon-Mendelian inheritance.\nMany traits are not inherited in a Mendelian fashion, but have more complex patterns of inheritance.\nIncomplete dominance.\nFor some traits, neither allele is completely dominant. Heterozygotes often have an appearance somewhere in between those of homozygotes. For example, a cross between true-breeding red and white \"Mirabilis jalapa\" results in pink flowers.\nCodominance.\nCodominance refers to traits in which both alleles are expressed in the offspring in approximately equal amounts. A classic example is the ABO blood group system in humans, where both the A and B alleles are expressed when they are present. Individuals with the AB genotype have both A and B proteins expressed on their red blood cells.\nEpistasis.\nEpistasis is when the phenotype of one gene is affected by one or more other genes. This is often through some sort of masking effect of one gene on the other. For example, the \"A\" gene codes for hair color, a dominant \"A\" allele codes for brown hair, and a recessive \"a\" allele codes for blonde hair, but a separate \"B\" gene controls hair growth, and a recessive \"b\" allele causes baldness. If the individual has the BB or Bb genotype, then they produce hair and the hair color phenotype can be observed, but if the individual has a bb genotype, then the person is bald which masks the A gene entirely.\nPolygenic traits.\nA polygenic trait is one whose phenotype is dependent on the additive effects of multiple genes. The contributions of each of these genes are typically small and add up to a final phenotype with a large amount of variation. A well studied example of this is the number of sensory bristles on a fly. These types of additive effects is also the explanation for the amount of variation in human eye color.\nGenotyping.\nGenotyping refers to the method used to determine an individual's genotype. There are a variety of techniques that can be used to assess genotype. The genotyping method typically depends on what information is being sought. Many techniques initially require amplification of the DNA sample, which is commonly done using PCR.\nSome techniques are designed to investigate specific SNPs or alleles in a particular gene or set of genes, such as whether an individual is a carrier for a particular condition. This can be done via a variety of techniques, including allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes or DNA sequencing. Tools such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification can also be used to look for duplications or deletions of genes or gene sections. Other techniques are meant to assess a large number of SNPs across the genome, such as SNP arrays. This type of technology is commonly used for genome-wide association studies.\nLarge-scale techniques to assess the entire genome are also available. This includes karyotyping to determine the number of chromosomes an individual has and chromosomal microarrays to assess for large duplications or deletions in the chromosome. More detailed information can be determined using exome sequencing, which provides the specific sequence of all DNA in the coding region of the genome, or whole genome sequencing, which sequences the entire genome including non-coding regions.\nGenotype encoding.\nIn linear models, the genotypes can be encoded in different manners. Let us consider a biallelic locus with two possible alleles, encoded by formula_1 and formula_2. We consider formula_3 to correspond to the dominant allele to the reference allele formula_4. The following table details the different encoding.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His reign was marked by ineffective governance during the Thirty Years' War. He was the father of Frederick William, the \"Great Elector\".\nBiography.\nBorn in C\u00f6lln on the Spree (today part of Berlin), George William was the son of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg and Anna of Prussia. His maternal grandfather was Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia. In 1616, he married Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. Their only son Frederick William would later be known as the \"Great Elector\". Of his two daughters, the eldest, Louise Charlotte, married Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland, and the younger, Hedwig Sophie, married William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel.\nIn 1619, George William inherited the Margravate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia, then a vassal of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, although his ownership was not confirmed by Sigismund III Vasa until September 1621. He proved a weak and ineffective ruler in a very difficult period of history; possession of Prussia involved him in the 1621 to 1625 Polish\u2013Swedish War, since Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was married to his sister Maria Eleonora.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the Calvinist George William tried to remain neutral in the contest between the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II, and his mostly Lutheran opponents. When the war shifted to northern Germany in 1625, this did not protect his lands from being looted by Imperial troops, and he was forced to take sides when Gustavus intervened in the Empire in 1630. However, this simply replaced one set of plunderers with another; Gustavus could not support so large an army, and his unpaid and unfed troops became increasingly mutinous and ill-disciplined.\nAfter Gustavus was killed at L\u00fctzen in November 1632, George William joined the Swedish-backed Heilbronn League, until defeat at N\u00f6rdlingen on 6 September 1634. Following the 1635 Peace of Prague, the League was dissolved, although by now Brandenburg's population had been decimated by the war.\nLeaving his Catholic and pro-Imperial chief minister Schwarzenberg to run the government, George William withdrew in 1637 to the relatively untouched region of Prussia, where he lived in retirement until his death at K\u00f6nigsberg in 1640. He was succeeded by his far more accomplished son Frederick William.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12799", "revid": "6046731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12799", "title": "Graphic design", "text": "Interdisciplinary branch of design and fine arts\nGraphic design is a profession, academic discipline and applied art that involves creating visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives. Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design and of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.\nThe role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of the encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. In its nature, design pieces can be philosophical, aesthetic, emotional and political. Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.\nGraphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation world or space exploration. In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.\nWith origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of the rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"graphic design\" makes an early appearance in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of \"Organized Labor\", a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:\nAn Enterprising Trades Union\n\u2026 The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. \u2026\nA decade later, the 1917\u20131918 course catalog of the California School of Arts &amp; Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering. Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.\nHistory.\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience.\"\nThe definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives. Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic design emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. Others understand that it began to be identified as such by the late 19th century.\nIt can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of written language in the third millennium BCE. However, the differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required training are such that it is not possible to clearly identify the current graphic designer with prehistoric man, the 15th-century xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.\nThe diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an industrial production model\u2014visual manifestations that have been \"projected\" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, ergonomic, contextual, among others.\nBy the late 19th century, graphic design emerged as a distinct profession in the West, partly due to the process of labor specialization that occurred there and partly due to the new technologies and business possibilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution. New production methods led to the separation of the design of a communication medium (such as a poster) from its actual production. Increasingly, throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, advertising agencies, book publishers, and magazines hired art directors who organized all visual elements of communication and integrated them into a harmonious whole, creating an expression appropriate to the content.\nThroughout the 20th century, the technology available to designers continued to advance rapidly, as did the artistic and commercial possibilities of design. The profession expanded greatly, and graphic designers created, among other things, magazine pages, book covers, posters, CD covers, postage stamps, packaging, brands, signs, advertisements, kinetic titles for TV programs and movies, and websites. By the early 21st century, graphic design had become a global profession as advanced technology and industry spread worldwide.\nHistorical background.\nIn China, during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century in China, longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing, making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).\nIn Mesopotamia, writing (as an extension of graphic design) began with commerce. The earliest writing system, cuneiform, started out with basic pictograms, which were representations of houses, lambs, or grain.\nIn the mid-15th century in Mainz, Germany, Johannes Gutenberg developed a way to reproduce printed pages at a faster pace using movable type made with a new metal alloy that created a revolution in the dissemination of information.\nNineteenth century.\nIn 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his \"Journal of Design and Manufactures\". He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\nFrom 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press was a leader in graphic design associated with the Arts and Crafts movement, creating hand-made books in medieval and Renaissance era style, in addition to wallpaper and textile designs. Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.\nWill H. Bradley became one of the notable graphic designers in the late nineteenth-century due to creating art pieces in various Art Nouveau styles. Bradley created a number of designs as promotions for a literary magazine titled \"The Chap-Book\".\nTwentieth century.\nIn 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled \"Graphic Design and Lettering\". Raffe's \"Graphic Design\", published in 1927, was the first book to use \"Graphic Design\" in its title. In 1936, author and graphic designer Leon Friend published his book titled \"Graphic Design\" and it is known to be the first piece of literature to cover the topic extensively.\nThe signage in the London Underground is a classic design example of the modern era. Although he lacked artistic training, Frank Pick led the Underground Group design and publicity movement. The first Underground station signs were introduced in 1908 with a design of a solid red disk with a blue bar in the center and the name of the station. The station name was in white sans-serif letters. It was in 1916 when Pick used the expertise of Edward Johnston to design a new typeface for the Underground. Johnston redesigned the Underground sign and logo to include his typeface on the blue bar in the center of a red circle.\nIn the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, film and theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.\nJan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book, \"New Typography\". He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential. Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production techniques and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the First Things First manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine \"Emigre\" 51 stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication \u2013 a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.\"\nApplications.\nGraphic design can have many applications, from road signs to technical schematics and reference manuals. It is often used in branding products and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, packaging, labelling and text.\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinions and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information \u2013 known as information design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include Data and information visualization, which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.\nSkills.\nA graphic design project may involve the creative presentation of existing text, ornament, and images.\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\nTypography.\nTypography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, the 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.\nPage layout.\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of type (text), images (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.\nGrids.\nA grid serves as a method of arranging both space and information, allowing the reader to easily comprehend the overall project. Furthermore, a grid functions as a container for information and a means of establishing and maintaining order. Despite grids being utilized for centuries, many graphic designers associate them with Swiss design. The desire for order in the 1940s resulted in a highly systematic approach to visualizing information. However, grids were later regarded as tedious and uninteresting, earning the label of \"designersaur.\" Today, grids are once again considered crucial tools for professionals, whether they are novices or veterans.\nTools.\nIn the mid-1980s, desktop publishing and graphic art software introduced digital tools for image manipulation and creation, replacing many processes that were previously done by hand. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process. Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.\nComputers and software.\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process. Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or paste-up. While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered layouts are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of Adobe Inc. Adobe Photoshop (a raster-based program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. CorelDraw, a vector graphics editing software developed and marketed by Corel Corporation, is also used worldwide. Designers often use pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, vector logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign, Serif PagePlus and QuarkXPress.\nMany free and open-source programs are also used by both professionals and casual graphic designers. Inkscape uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) as its primary file format and allows importing and exporting other formats. Other open-source programs used include GIMP for photo-editing and image manipulation, Krita for digital painting, and Scribus for page layout.\nRelated design fields.\nPrint design.\nA specialized branch of graphic design and historically its earliest form, print design involves creating visual content intended for reproduction on physical substrates such as silk, paper, and later, plastic, for mass communication and persuasion (e.g., marketing, governmental publishing, propaganda). Print design techniques have evolved over centuries, beginning with the invention of movable type by the Chinese alchemist Pi Sheng, later refined by the German inventor Johannes Gutenberg. Over time, methods such as lithography, screen printing, and offset printing have been developed, culminating in the contemporary use of digital presses that integrate traditional print techniques with modern digital technology.\nInterface design.\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in interface design, in an environment commonly referred to as a Graphical user interface (GUI). This has included web design and software design when end user-interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application. An important aspect of interface design is icon design.\nUser experience design.\nUser experience design (UX) is the study, analysis, and development of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the creation of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability, and function. UX design involves creating the interface and interactions for a website or application, and is considered both an act and an art. This profession requires a combination of skills, including visual design, social psychology, development, project management, and most importantly, empathy towards the end-users.\nExperiential (environmental) graphic design.\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. It\u2019s also known as environmental graphic design (EGD) or environmental graphics. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space (also called environmental graphic design). Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding, placemaking, branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\nOccupations.\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2023, median pay was $58,910 per year. The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include graphic designer, art director, creative director, animator and entry level production artist. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"DTP associate\" or \"Graphic Artist\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration, photography, animation, visual effects or interactive design.\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations. Graphic designers may also work freelance, working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\nA graphic designer typically reports to the art director, creative director or senior media creative. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as brand development and corporate identity development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\nCrowdsourcing.\nJeff Howe of \"Wired Magazine\" first used the term \"crowdsourcing\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\" It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration, and others. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, startups, small businesses and entrepreneurs have all benefitted from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies that operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\nRole.\nGraphic design influences consumer behavior through the use of visual elements such as color, typography, and imagery. Studies have shown that certain colors can evoke specific emotions and behaviors in consumers, and that typography can influence how information is perceived and remembered. For example, serif fonts are often associated with tradition and elegance, while sans-serif fonts are seen as modern and minimalistic. These factors can affect consumers' perceptions of brands and their messaging. Graphic design also affects consumer behavior by communicating complex information in clear, accessible ways. For example, infographics and data visualizations can help distill complex information into understandable and engaging formats for consumers.\nEthical consideration.\nEthics are an important consideration in graphic design, particularly when it comes to accurately representing information and avoiding harmful stereotypes. Graphic designers have a responsibility to ensure that their work is truthful, accurate, and free from any misleading or deceptive elements. This requires a commitment to honesty, integrity, and transparency in all aspects of the design process.\nOne of the key ethical considerations in graphic design is the responsibility to accurately represent information. This means ensuring that any claims or statements made in advertising or marketing materials are true and supported by evidence. For example, a company should not use misleading statistics to promote their product or service, or make false claims about its benefits. Graphic designers must take care to accurately represent information in all visual elements, such as graphs, charts, and images, and avoid distorting or misrepresenting data.\nAnother important ethical consideration in graphic design is the need to avoid harmful stereotypes. This means avoiding any images or messaging that perpetuate negative or harmful stereotypes based on race, gender, religion, or other characteristics. Graphic designers should strive to create designs that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals and communities, and avoid reinforcing negative attitudes or biases.\nFuture.\nAI and automation.\nAdvancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and automation are likely to transform the way that graphic designers work and create designs. Social trends, such as a greater focus on sustainability and inclusivity, are likely to impact the future of graphic design.\nEasily-accessible computer software using AI algorithms will complete many practical tasks performed by graphic designers, allowing clients to bypass human designers altogether. For example, machine learning algorithms can analyze large datasets and create designs based on patterns and trends, freeing up designers to focus on more complex and creative tasks. Virtual and augmented reality technologies may allow designers to create immersive and interactive experiences for users. Artificial intelligence has led to many challenges, including the maintenance of brand authenticity, quality assurance, issues of bias, and the preservation of creative control.\nVisual communication design education is ill-prepared for automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nAs consumers become more conscious of environmental issues, there may be a greater demand for designs that prioritize sustainability and minimize waste. Similarly, there is likely to be a growing focus on inclusivity and diversity in design, with designers seeking to create designs that are accessible and representative of broader varieties of individuals and communities.\nSee also.\nRelated areas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Concept art\nRelated topics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Aesthetics\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12800", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12800", "title": "Great Rift Valley", "text": "Continuous geographic trench from Asia to Southeast Africa\nThe Great Rift Valley () is a series of contiguous geographic depressions, approximately 6,000 or in total length, the definition varying between sources, that runs from the southern Turkish Hatay Province in Asia, through the Red Sea, to Mozambique in Southeast Africa. While the name remains in some usages, it is rarely used in geology where the term \"Afro-Arabian Rift System\" is preferred.\nThis valley extends southward from Western Asia into the eastern part of Africa, where several deep, elongated lakes, called ribbon lakes, exist on the rift valley floor, Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika being two such examples. The region has a unique ecosystem and contains a number of Africa's wildlife parks.\nThe term Great Rift Valley is most often used to refer to the valley of the East African Rift, the divergent plate boundary which extends from the Afar triple junction southward through eastern Africa, and is in the process of splitting the African plate into two new and separate plates. Geologists generally refer to these evolving plates as the Nubian plate and the Somali plate.\nTheoretical extent.\nToday these rifts and faults are seen as distinct, although connected. Originally, the Great Rift Valley was thought to be a single feature that extended from Lebanon in the north to Mozambique in the south, where it constitutes one of two distinct physiographic provinces of the East African mountains. It included what today is called the Lebanese section of the Dead Sea Transform (Turkey to Straits of Tiran), the Jordan Rift Valley (geographic term for section including entire course of the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, and the Arabah Valley), Red Sea Rift, and the East African Rift. These rifts and faults are considered to having been formed 35 million years ago.\nAsia.\nThe northernmost part of the Rift corresponds to the central section of what is today called the Dead Sea Transform (DST) or Rift. This midsection of the DST forms the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon, separating the Mount Lebanon range from the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. Further south it is known as the Hula Valley separating the Galilee mountains and the Golan Heights.\nThe Jordan River begins here and flows southward through Lake Hula into the Sea of Galilee in Israel. The Rift then continues south through the Jordan Rift Valley into the Dead Sea, on the Israeli-Jordanian border. From the Dead Sea southwards, the Rift is occupied by the Wadi Arabah, then the Gulf of Aqaba, and then the Red Sea.\nOff the southern tip of Sinai in the Red Sea, the Dead Sea Transform meets the Red Sea Rift which runs the length of the Red Sea. The Red Sea Rift comes ashore to meet the East African Rift and the Aden Ridge, in the Afar Depression of East Africa. The junction of these three rifts is called the Afar triple junction.\nAfrica.\n \nThe East African Rift follows the Red Sea to the end before turning inland into the Ethiopian highlands, dividing the country into two large and adjacent but separate mountainous regions. In Kenya, Uganda, and the fringes of South Sudan, the Great Rift runs along two separate branches that are joined to each other only at their southern end, in Southern Tanzania along its border with Zambia. The two branches are called the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley.\nThe Western Rift, also called the Albertine Rift, is bordered by some of the highest mountains in Africa, including the Virunga Mountains, Mitumba Mountains, and Ruwenzori Range. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to deep at Lake Tanganyika).\nMuch of this area lies within the boundaries of national parks, such as Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwenzori National Park and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, and Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda. Lake Victoria is considered to be part of the rift valley system although it actually lies between the two branches. All of the African Great Lakes were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie in territories within the rift.\nIn Kenya, the valley is deepest to the north of Nairobi. As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no output to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. For example, Lake Magadi has high concentrations of soda (sodium carbonate) and Lake Elmenteita, Lake Bogoria, and Lake Nakuru are all strongly alkaline, while the freshwater springs supplying Lake Naivasha are essential to support its current biological variety.\nThe southern section of the Rift Valley includes Lake Malawi, the third-deepest freshwater body in the world, which reaches in depth and separates the Nyassa plateau of Northern Mozambique from Malawi. The rift extends southwards from Lake Malawi as the valley of the Shire River, which flows from the lake into the Zambezi River. The rift continues south of the Zambezi as the Urema Valley of central Mozambique.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for having befriended the imperial family of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, through whom he gained considerable influence in the final years of the Russian Empire.\nRasputin was born to a family of peasants in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, located within Tyumensky Uyezd in Tobolsk Governorate (present-day Yarkovsky District in Tyumen Oblast). He had a religious conversion experience after embarking on a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897 and has been described as a monk or as a \"strannik\" (wanderer or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1903 or in the winter of 1904\u20131905, he travelled to Saint Petersburg and captivated several religious and social leaders, eventually becoming a prominent figure in Russian society. In November 1905, Rasputin met Nicholas II and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna.\nIn late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a faith healer for Nicholas' and Alexandra's only son, Alexei Nikolaevich, who suffered from Haemophilia. He was a divisive figure at court, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, and by others as a religious charlatan. The extent of Rasputin's power reached an all-time high in 1915, when Nicholas left Saint Petersburg to oversee the Imperial Russian Army as it was engaged in the First World War. In his absence, Rasputin and Alexandra consolidated their influence across the Russian Empire. However, as Russian military defeats mounted on the Eastern Front, both figures became increasingly unpopular. In the early morning of 30 December\u00a0[O.S. 17 December]\u00a01916, Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative Russian noblemen who opposed his influence over the imperial family.\nHistorians often suggest that Rasputin's scandalous and sinister reputation helped discredit the Tsarist government, thus precipitating the overthrow of the House of Romanov shortly after his assassination. Accounts of his life and influence were often based on common rumors; he remains a mysterious and captivating figure in popular culture.\nEarly life.\nGrigori Yefimovich Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk Governorate (now Tyumen Oblast) in the Russian Empire. According to official records, he was born on 21 January\u00a0[O.S. 9 January]\u00a01869 and christened the following day. He was named for St. Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on 10 January.\nThere are few records of Rasputin's parents. His father, Yefim (1842\u20131916), was a peasant farmer and church elder who had been born in Pokrovskoye and married Rasputin's mother, Anna Parshukova (c. 1840 \u2013 1906), in 1863. Yefim also worked as a government courier, ferrying people and goods between Tobolsk and Tyumen. The couple had seven other children, all of whom died in infancy and early childhood; there may have been a ninth child, Feodosiya. According to historian Joseph T. Fuhrmann, Rasputin was certainly close to Feodosiya and was godfather to her children, but \"the records that have survived do not permit us to say more than that\".\nAccording to historian Douglas Smith, Rasputin's youth and early adulthood are \"a black hole about which we know almost nothing\", though the lack of reliable sources and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about Rasputin's parents and his youth after his rise to prominence. Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was not formally educated and remained illiterate well into his early adulthood. Local archival records suggest that he had a somewhat unruly youth\u2014possibly involving drinking, small thefts and disrespect for local authorities\u2014but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy or bearing false witness, all major crimes later imputed to him as a young man.\nIn 1886, Rasputin traveled to Abalak, some 250\u00a0km east-northeast of Tyumen and 2,800\u00a0km east of Moscow, where he met a peasant girl named Praskovya Dubrovina. After a courtship of several months, they married in February 1887. Praskovya remained in Pokrovskoye throughout Rasputin's later travels and rise to prominence, and remained devoted to him until his death. The couple had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood: Dmitry (b. 1895), Maria (b. 1898), and Varvara (b. 1900).\nReligious conversion.\nIn 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons are unclear; according to some sources, he left the village to escape punishment for his role in horse theft. Other sources suggest Rasputin had a vision of the Virgin Mary or of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye, while still others suggest that a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky, inspired his pilgrimage. Whatever his reasons, Rasputin cast off his old life: he was 28 years old, married ten years, with an infant son and another child on the way. According to Smith, his decision \"could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis\".\nRasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk's cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 transformed him. There, he met and was \"profoundly humbled\" by a \"starets\" (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write. However, he later claimed that some of the monks at Verkhotuyre engaged in homosexuality and criticized monastic life as too coercive. He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently. He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past.\nRasputin spent the years that followed as a \"strannik\" (a holy wanderer or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of holy sites. It is possible he wandered as far as Mount Athos\u2014the center of Eastern Orthodox monastic life\u2014in 1900.\nBy the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of followers, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Yefim's root cellar\u2014Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time\u2014the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing Rasputin before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs, and even that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to include self-flagellation and sexual orgies. According to Fuhrmann, however, \"repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect\", and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded.\nRise to prominence.\nWord of Rasputin's activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s. At some point during 1904 or 1905, he traveled to the city of Kazan, where he acquired a reputation as a wise \"starets\" who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties. Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with female followers, he made a favorable impression on several local religious leaders. Among these were Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave Rasputin a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the theological seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to Saint Petersburg.\nUpon arriving at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, Rasputin was introduced to church leaders, including Archimandrite Theofan, inspector of the theological seminary, who was well-connected in Saint Petersburg society and later served as confessor to the imperial family. Theofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home; he went on to become one of Rasputin's most essential friends in Saint Petersburg, gaining him entry to many of the influential \"salons\" where the local aristocracy gathered for religious discussions. It was through these meetings that Rasputin attracted some of his early and influential followers\u2014many of whom would later turn against him.\nAlternative religious movements such as spiritualism and theosophy had become popular among Saint Petersburg's aristocracy before Rasputin's arrival, and many of the aristocracy were intensely curious about the occult and the supernatural. Rasputin's ideas and \"strange manners\" made him the subject of intense curiosity among the city's elite, who, according to Fuhrmann, were \"bored, cynical, and seeking new experiences\" during this period. Rasputin's appeal may have been enhanced by the fact that he was also a native Russian, unlike other self-described \"holy men\" such as Nizier Anthelme Philippe and G\u00e9rard Encausse, who had previously been popular in Saint Petersburg.\nAccording to Fuhrmann, Rasputin stayed in Saint Petersburg for only a few months on his first visit and returned to Pokrovskoye in the fall of 1903. Smith, however, argues that it is impossible to know whether Rasputin stayed in Saint Petersburg or returned to Pokrovskoye at some point between his first arrival and 1905. Regardless, by 1905 Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the \"Black Princesses\", Militsa and Anastasia of Montenegro, who had married cousins of Tsar Nicholas II (Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich and Prince George Maximilianovich Romanowsky) and were instrumental in introducing Rasputin to the tsar and his family.\nRasputin first met Nicholas on 1 November 1905, at the Peterhof Palace. The tsar recorded the event in his diary, writing that he and his empress consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, had \"made the acquaintance of a man of God\u00a0\u2013 Grigory, from Tobolsk province\". Rasputin returned to Pokrovskoye shortly after their first meeting and did not return to Saint Petersburg until July 1906. On his return, he sent Nicholas a telegram asking to present the tsar with an icon of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye. He met with Nicholas and Alexandra on 18 July and again in October, when he first met their children.\nAt some point, Nicholas and Alexandra became convinced that Rasputin possessed the miraculous power to heal their only son, Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, who suffered from haemophilia. Historians disagree over when this happened: according to Orlando Figes, Rasputin was first introduced to the tsar and tsarina as a healer who could help their son in November 1905, while Joseph T. Fuhrmann has speculated that it was in October 1906 that Rasputin was first asked to pray for the health of Alexei.\nHealer to Alexei Nikolaevich.\nMuch of Rasputin's influence with the imperial family stemmed from the belief by Alexandra and others that he had, on several occasions, eased Alexei's pain and stopped his bleeding. According to historian Marc Ferro, the tsarina had a \"passionate attachment\" to Rasputin, believing he could heal her son's affliction. Harold Shukman wrote that Rasputin became \"an indispensable member of the royal entourage\". It is unclear when Rasputin first learned of Alexei's haemophilia, or when he first acted as a healer. He may have been aware of Alexei's condition as early as October 1906, and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for the tsarevich when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning. Alexandra's friend Anna Vyrubova became convinced that Rasputin had miraculous powers shortly thereafter and became one of his most influential advocates.\nDuring the summer of 1912, Alexei developed a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the imperial hunting grounds at Spa\u0142a, which caused a large hematoma. In severe pain and delirious with fever, the tsarevich appeared close to death. In desperation, Alexandra asked Vyrubova to send Rasputin (who was in Siberia) a telegram, asking him to pray for Alexei. Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the tsarina that \"God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.\" The next morning, Alexei's condition was unchanged, but Alexandra was encouraged by the message and regained some hope that he would survive. His bleeding stopped the following day. Dr. S. P. Fedorov, one of the physicians who attended Alexei, admitted that \"the recovery was wholly inexplicable from a medical point of view.\" Later, Dr. Fedorov admitted that Alexandra could not be blamed for seeing Rasputin as a miracle man: \"Rasputin would come in, walk up to the patient, look at him, and spit. The bleeding would stop in no time.\u00a0... How could the empress not trust Rasputin after that?\"\nHistorian Robert K. Massie has called Alexei's recovery \"one of the most mysterious episodes of the whole Rasputin legend\". The cause of his recovery is unclear: Massie speculated that Rasputin's suggestion not to let doctors disturb Alexei had aided his recovery by allowing him to rest and heal, or that his message may have aided Alexei's recovery by calming his mother and reducing the tsarevich's emotional stress. Alexandra believed that Rasputin had performed a miracle, and concluded that he was essential to Alexei's survival. Some writers and historians, such as Ferro, claim that Rasputin stopped Alexei's bleeding on other occasions through hypnosis. Still other historians\u2013including memoirist Pierre Gilliard, Alexei's French-language tutor\u2013have speculated that Rasputin controlled Alexei's bleeding by disallowing the administration of aspirin, then widely used to relieve pain, but unknown as an anti-clotting agent until the 1950s.\nRelationship with the Imperial Children.\nAlexei and his siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as \"our friend\" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, their aunt, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, was escorted to the nursery by Nicholas to meet Rasputin. Maria, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. \"All the children seemed to like him,\" Olga Alexandrovna recalled. \"They were completely at ease with him.\"\nRasputin's friendship with the tsar's children was evident in the messages he sent to them. \"My Dear Pearl M!\" Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. \"Tell me how you talked with the sea, with nature! I miss your simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss.\" In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, \"My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it's already evening. So it is with the cares of the world.\" In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the children a telegram, advising them to, \"Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.\"\nOne of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 when Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns. Tyutcheva wanted Rasputin barred from the nurseries. In response to her complaints, Nicholas asked Rasputin to end his nursery visits. \"I am so afr(aid) that S.I. [Tyutcheva] can speak ... about our friend something bad,\" Maria's twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to her mother on 8 March 1910, after begging Alexandra to forgive her for doing something she did not like. \"I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.\" Alexandra eventually had Tyutcheva fired.\nTyutcheva took her story to other members of the imperial family, who were scandalized by the reports. However, Rasputin's contacts with the children were by all accounts completely innocent. Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna, was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. Xenia wrote on 15 March 1910 that she could not understand \"...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a \"khlyst\"!) He's always there, goes into the nursery, visits Olga and Tatiana while they are getting ready for bed, sits there talking to them and \"caressing\" them. They are careful to hide him from Sofia Ivanovna, and the children don't dare talk to her about him. It's all quite unbelievable and beyond understanding.\"\nAnother of the nursery governesses claimed in the spring of 1910 that she was raped by Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova had at first been a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. Alexandra refused to believe Vishnyakova \"and said that everything Rasputin does is holy\". Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but \"they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.\" Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.\nIt was whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only Alexandra but also the four grand duchesses. Rasputin had released ardent letters written to him by the tsarina and the grand duchesses, which circulated throughout society and fueled the rumors. Pornographic cartoons also circulated that depicted Rasputin having sexual relations with the tsarina, with her four daughters, and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave Saint Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.\nDespite the scandal, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until his murder on 17 December 1916. \"Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed,\" Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916. In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared \"cold and visibly terribly upset\" by Rasputin's death and sat \"huddled up closely together\" on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse side by the grand duchesses and their mother.\nControversies.\nThe imperial family's belief in Rasputin's healing powers brought him considerable status and power at court. Nicholas appointed Rasputin his \"lampadnik\" (lamplighter), charged with keeping the lamps lit before religious icons in the palace, which gained him regular access to the palace and imperial family. By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to ask a special favor of the tsar: that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Noviy (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request, and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that Rasputin already had the tsar's favor at that early date. Rasputin used his position to full effect, accepting bribes and sexual favors from admirers and working diligently to expand his influence.\nRasputin soon became a controversial figure; he was accused by his enemies of religious heresy and rape, was suspected of exerting undue political influence over the tsar, and was even rumored to be having an affair with the tsarina. Opposition to Rasputin's influence grew within the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1907, the local clergy in Pokrovskoye denounced Rasputin as a heretic, and the Bishop of Tobolsk launched an inquest into his activities, accusing him of \"spreading false, \"Khlyst-like\" doctrines\". In Saint Petersburg, Rasputin faced opposition from even more prominent critics, including Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin and the \"Okhrana\", the tsar's secret police. Having ordered an investigation into Rasputin's activities, Stolypin confronted Nicholas but did not succeed in reining in Rasputin's influence or exiling him from Saint Petersburg.\nOutside of the royal court, Rasputin preached that physical contact between him and others purified them; he engaged in drunken revels and extramarital affairs with a wide range of women from prostitutes to high-society ladies. In 1909, Khioniya Berlatskaya, one of Rasputin's early supporters, accused him of rape. Betlatskaya sought aid from Theofan, who became convinced that Rasputin was a danger to the monarchy. Rumors multiplied that Rasputin had assaulted female followers and behaved inappropriately on visits with the imperial family\u2014and particularly with Nicholas's teenage daughters Olga and Tatiana.\nDuring this period, the First World War, the dissolution of feudalism, and a meddling government bureaucracy all contributed to Russia's rapid economic decline. Many laid the blame on Alexandra and Rasputin. One outspoken member of the Duma, far-right politician Vladimir Purishkevich, stated in November 1916 that he held the tsar's ministers had \"been turned into marionettes, marionettes whose threads have been taken firmly in hand by Rasputin and the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna\u2014the evil genius of Russia and the Tsarina... who has remained a German on the Russian throne and alien to the country and its people\". (The tsarina had been born a German princess.)\nFailed assassination attempt.\nOn 12 July\u00a0[O.S. 29 June]\u00a01914, a 33-year-old peasant woman named Khioniya Guseva attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye. Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear if he would survive. After surgery and some time in a hospital in Tyumen, he recovered.\nGuseva was a follower of Iliodor, a former priest who had supported Rasputin before denouncing his sexual escapades and self-aggrandizement in December 1911. A radical conservative and anti-semite, Iliodor had been part of a group of establishment figures who had attempted to drive a wedge between Rasputin and the imperial family in 1911. When this effort failed, Iliodor was banished from Saint Petersburg and was ultimately defrocked. Guseva claimed to have acted alone, having read about Rasputin in the newspapers and believing him to be a \"false prophet and even an Antichrist\". Both the police and Rasputin, however, believed that Iliodor had instigated the assassination attempt. Iliodor fled the country before he could be questioned, and Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions by reason of insanity.\nDeath.\nA group of nobles led by Purishkevich, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yusupov decided that Rasputin's influence over Alexandra threatened the Russian Empire. They concocted a plan in December 1916 to kill Rasputin, apparently by luring him to the Yusupovs' Moika Palace.\nRasputin was murdered during the early morning on 30 December\u00a0[O.S. 17 December]\u00a01916 at the home of Prince Yusupov. He died of three gunshot wounds, one of which was a close-range shot to his forehead. Little is certain about his death beyond this, and the circumstances of his death have been the subject of considerable speculation. According to Smith, \"what really happened at the Yusupov home on 17 December will never be known\". The story that Yusupov recounted in his memoirs, however, has become the most frequently told version of events.\nAccording to Yusupov's account, Rasputin was invited to his palace shortly after midnight and ushered into the basement. Yusupov offered tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. After initially refusing the cakes, Rasputin began to eat them and, to Yusupov's surprise, appeared unaffected by the poison. Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. He took a revolver from Pavlovich, then returned to the basement and told Rasputin that he had \"better look at the crucifix and say a prayer\", referring to a crucifix in the room, then shot him once in the chest. The conspirators then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night. Upon returning to his palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead. Suddenly, Rasputin leaped up and attacked Yusupov, who freed himself with some effort and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed Yusupov into the palace's courtyard, where Purishkevich shot him. He collapsed into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped his body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge and dropped it into the Little Nevka river.\nIn an unsubstantiated claim, Grand Duchess Tatiana, who was earlier alleged to have been raped by Rasputin, was present at the site of Rasputin's murder, \"disguised as a lieutenant of the Chevaliers-Gardes, so that she could revenge herself on Rasputin who had tried to violate her\". Maurice Pal\u00e9ologue, the French ambassador to Russia, wrote that Tatiana had supposedly witnessed Rasputin's castration, but he doubted the credibility of the rumor.\nIn a modern analysis of Rasputin's death, published on the 100th anniversary of the event, Dr Carolyn Harris of the University of Toronto notes that the actual circumstances were less dramatic than Yusupov's account. Rasputin's daughter recorded that her father abstained from sweet food and would not have eaten the supposedly poisoned cakes. An autopsy account by the official surgeon involved has no record of poisoning or drowning, but records death by a single bullet fired into the head at close range.\nAftermath.\nNews of Rasputin's murder spread quickly, even before his body was found. According to Smith, Purishkevich spoke openly about the murder to two soldiers and to a policeman who was investigating reports of shots shortly after the event, but urged them not to tell anyone else. An investigation was launched the next morning. The \"Stock Exchange Gazette\" ran a report of Rasputin's death \"after a party in one of the most aristocratic homes in the center of the city\" on the afternoon of 30 December\u00a0[O.S. 17 December]\u00a01916.\nAfter two workmen discovered blood on the railing of the Petrovsky Bridge and a boot on the ice below, police began searching the area. Rasputin's body was found under the river ice on 1 January (O.S. 19 December), approximately 200 meters downstream from the bridge. Dmitry Kosorotov, the city's senior autopsy surgeon, examined the body. Kosorotov's report was lost, but he later stated that Rasputin's body had shown signs of severe trauma, including three gunshot wounds (one at close range to the forehead), a slice wound to his left side, and other injuries, many of which Kosorotov felt had been sustained post-mortem. Kosorotov found a single bullet in Rasputin's body but stated that it was too badly deformed and of a type too widely used to trace. He found no evidence that Rasputin had been poisoned. According to both Smith and Fuhrmann, Kosorotov found no water in Rasputin's lungs and reports that Rasputin had been thrown into the water alive were incorrect. Some later accounts claimed that Rasputin's penis had been severed, but Kosorotov found his genitals intact.\nRasputin was buried on 2 January (O.S. 21 December) at a small church that Vyrubova had been building at Tsarskoye Selo. The funeral was attended only by the imperial family and a few of their intimates. Rasputin's wife, mistress, and children were not invited, although his daughters met with the imperial family at Vyrubova's home later that day. The imperial family planned to build a church over Rasputin's grave site. However, his body was exhumed and burned by a detachment of soldiers on the orders of Alexander Kerensky shortly after Nicholas abdicated the throne in March 1917, so that his grave would not become a rallying point for supporters of the old regime.\nProminent children.\nMaria Rasputin.\nRasputin's daughter, Maria Rasputin (born Matryona Rasputina; 1898\u20131977), emigrated to France after the October Revolution and then to the United States. There, she worked as a dancer and then a lion tamer in a circus.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "12806", "revid": "3632083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12806", "title": "Gemstone", "text": "Piece of mineral crystal used to make jewelry\nA gemstone (also called a fine gem, jewel, precious stone, semiprecious stone, or simply gem) is a piece of mineral crystal which, when cut or polished, is used to make jewelry or other adornments. Certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli, opal, and obsidian) and occasionally organic materials that are not minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) may also be used for jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as well. Most gemstones are hard, but some softer minerals such as brazilianite may be used in jewelry because of their color or luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value. However, generally speaking, soft minerals are not typically used as gemstones by virtue of their brittleness and lack of durability.\nFound all over the world, the industry of coloured gemstones (i.e. anything other than diamonds) is currently estimated at US$1.55billion as of 2023[ [update]] and is projected to steadily increase to a value of $4.46billion by 2033.\nA gem expert is a gemologist, a gem maker is called a lapidarist or gemcutter; a diamond cutter is called a diamantaire.\nCharacteristics and classification.\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the ancient Greeks, begins with a distinction between \"precious\" and \"semi-precious\"; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use, the precious stones are emerald, ruby, sapphire and diamond, with all other gemstones being semi-precious. This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are translucent, with fine color in their purest forms (except for the colorless diamond), and very hard with a hardness score of 8 to 10 on the Mohs scale. Other stones are classified by their color, translucency, and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values; for example, while most garnets are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called tsavorite can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald. Another traditional term for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and archaeology is hardstone. The use of the terms \"precious\" and \"semi-precious\" in a commercial context is arguably misleading, as it suggests that certain stones are more valuable than others, which is not always reflected in their actual market value\u2014although the terms may generally be accurate when referring to desirability.\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by gemologists, who describe gems and their characteristics using technical terminology specific to the field of gemology. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its chemical composition. For example, diamonds are made of carbon (C), while sapphires and rubies are made of aluminium oxide (Al2O3). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their crystal system such as cubic or trigonal or monoclinic. Another term used is habit, the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as octahedrons.\nGemstones are classified into different \"groups\", \"species\", and \"varieties\". For example, ruby is the red variety of the species corundum, while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples of beryl varieties include emerald (green), aquamarine (blue), red beryl (red), goshenite (colorless), heliodor (yellow), and morganite (pink).\nGems are characterized in terms of their color (hue, tone and saturation), optical phenomena, luster, refractive index, birefringence, dispersion, specific gravity, hardness, cleavage, and fracture. They may exhibit pleochroism or double refraction. They may have luminescence and a distinctive absorption spectrum. Gemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\". Very transparent gems are considered \"first water\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency. Additionally, material or flaws within a stone may be present as inclusions.\nValue.\nGemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded using a system developed by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).\nA mnemonic device, the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced to help describe the factors used to grade a diamond. With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weights depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, the cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. An ideally cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity, and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality.\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual optical phenomena within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and asteria (star effects).\nApart from the more generic and commonly used gemstones such as from diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, pearls and opal have also been defined as precious in the jewellery trade. Up to the discoveries of bulk amethyst in Brazil in the 19th century, amethyst was considered a \"precious stone\" as well, going back to ancient Greece. Even in the last century certain stones such as aquamarine, peridot and cat's eye (cymophane) have been popular and hence been regarded as precious, thus reinforcing the notion that a mineral's rarity may have been implicated in its classification as a precious stone and thus contribute to its value.\nToday the gemstone trade no longer makes such a distinction. Many gemstones are used in even the most expensive jewelry, depending on the brand-name of the designer, fashion trends, market supply, treatments, etc. Nevertheless, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds still have a reputation that exceeds those of other gemstones.\nRare or unusual gemstones, generally understood to include those gemstones which occur so infrequently in gem quality that they are scarcely known except to connoisseurs, include andalusite, axinite, cassiterite, clinohumite, painite and red beryl.\nGemstone pricing and value are governed by factors and characteristics in the quality of the stone. These characteristics include clarity, rarity, freedom from defects, the beauty of the stone, as well as the demand for such stones. There are different pricing influencers for both colored gemstones, and for diamonds. The pricing on colored stones is determined by market supply-and-demand, but diamonds are more intricate.\nIn the addition to the aesthetic and adorning/ornamental purpose of gemstones, there are proponents of energy medicine who also value gemstones on the basis of their alleged healing powers.\nGrading.\nThere are a number of laboratories which grade and provide reports on gemstones.\nEach laboratory has its own methodology to evaluate gemstones. A stone can be called \"pink\" by one lab while another lab calls it \"padparadscha\". One lab can conclude a stone is untreated, while another lab might conclude that it is heat-treated. To minimize such differences, seven of the most respected labs, AGTA-GTL (New York), CISGEM (Milano), GAAJ-ZENHOKYO (Tokyo), GIA (Carlsbad), GIT (Bangkok), G\u00fcbelin (Lucerne) and SSEF (Basel), have established the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC), for the standardization of wording reports, promotion of certain analytical methods and interpretation of results. Country of origin has sometimes been difficult to determine, due to the constant discovery of new source locations. Determining a \"country of origin\" is thus much more difficult than determining other aspects of a gem (such as cut, clarity, etc.).\nGem dealers are aware of the differences between gem laboratories and will make use of the discrepancies to obtain the best possible certificate.\nCutting and polishing.\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other forms in which they are found. Most, however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The two main classifications are as follows:\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as opal, turquoise, variscite, etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color, luster and other surface properties as opposed to internal reflection properties like brilliance. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape, and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.\nGems that are transparent are normally faceted, a method that shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for faceted stones. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the optical properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets. Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\nColors.\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all other colors of white light while reflecting red.\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are corundum) but exhibit different colors because of impurities which absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light depending on their individual compositions. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"padparadscha sapphire\".\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called impurities are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected. For example, beryl, which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If manganese is added instead of chromium, beryl becomes pink morganite. With iron, it becomes aquamarine. Some gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.\nTreatment.\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. In some cases, the treatment applied to the gemstone can also increase its durability. Even though natural gemstones can be transformed using the traditional method of cutting and polishing, other treatment options allow the stone's appearance to be enhanced. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.\nEarly history.\nBefore modern-day tools, thousands of years ago, a variety of techniques were used to treat and enhance gemstones. Some of the earliest methods of gemstone treatment date back to the Minoan Age, for example foiling, in which metal foil is used to enhance a gemstone's colour. Other methods recorded 2000 years ago in the book \"Natural History\" by Pliny the Elder include oiling and dyeing/staining.\nHeat.\nHeat can either improve or spoil gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most citrine is made by heating amethyst, and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \"ametrine\" \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. Aquamarine is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a deeper blue.\nNearly all tanzanite is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color. A considerable portion of all sapphire and ruby is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated for repairs, the diamond should be protected with boric acid; otherwise, the diamond, which is pure carbon, could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing sapphires or rubies is heated, those stones should not be coated with boric acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones do need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in the water when metal parts are heated).\nRadiation.\nThe irradiation process is widely practiced in jewelry industry and enabled the creation of gemstone colors that do not exist or are extremely rare in nature. However, particularly when done in a nuclear reactor, the processes can make gemstones radioactive. Health risks related to the residual radioactivity of the treated gemstones have led to government regulations in many countries.\nVirtually all blue topaz, both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been irradiated to change the color from white to blue. Most green quartz (Oro Verde) are also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are mainly irradiated to become blue-green or green, although other colors are possible. When light-to-medium-yellow diamonds are treated with gamma rays they may become green; with a high-energy electron beam, blue.\nWaxing/oiling.\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\nFracture filling.\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass-filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2\u00a0g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\nBleaching.\nAnother treatment method that is commonly used to treat gemstones is bleaching. This method uses a chemical in order to reduce the colour of the gem. After bleaching, a combination treatment can be done by dying the gemstone once the unwanted colours are removed. Hydrogen peroxide is the most commonly used product used to alter gemstones and have notably been used to treat jade and pearls. The treatment of bleaching can also be followed by impregnation, which allows the gemstone's durability to be increased.\nSocioeconomic issues in the gemstone industry.\nThe socio-economic dynamics of the gemstone industry are shaped by market forces and consumer preferences and typically go undiscussed. Changes in demand and prices can significantly affect the livelihoods of those involved in gemstone mining and trade, particularly in developing countries where the industry serves as a crucial source of income.\nA situation that arises as a result of this is the exploitation of natural resources and labor within gemstone mining operations. Many mines, particularly in developing countries, face challenges such as inadequate safety measures, low wages, and poor working conditions. Miners, often from disadvantaged backgrounds, endure hazardous working conditions and receive meager wages, contributing to cycles of poverty and exploitation. Gemstone mining operations are frequently conducted in remote or underdeveloped areas, lacking proper infrastructure and access to essential services such as healthcare and education. This further contributes to the pre-existing socio-economic disparities and obstructs community development such that the benefits of gemstone extraction may not adequately reach those directly involved in the process.\nAnother such issue revolves around environmental degradation resulting from mining activities. Environmental degradation can pose long-term threats to ecosystems and biodiversity, further worsening the socio-economic state in affected regions. Unregulated mining practices often result in deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination thus threatening ecosystems and biodiversity. Unregulated mining activity can also cause depletion of natural resources, thus diminishing the prospects for sustainable development. The environmental impact of gemstone mining not only poses a threat to ecosystems but also undermines the long-term viability of the industry by diminishing the quality and quantity of available resources.\nFurthermore, the gemstone industry is also susceptible to issues related to transparency and ethics, which impact both producers and consumers. The lack of standardized certification processes and the prevalence of illicit practices undermine market integrity and trust. The lack of transparency and accountability in the supply chain aggravates pre-existing inequalities, as middlemen and corporations often capture a disproportionate share of the profits. As a result, the unequal distribution of profits along the supply chain does little to improve socio-economic inequalities, particularly in regions where gemstones are mined.\nAddressing these socio-economic challenges requires intensive effort from various stakeholders, including governments, industry executives, and society, to promote sustainable practices and ensure equitable outcomes for all involved parties. Implementing and enforcing regulations to ensure fair labor practices, environmental sustainability, and ethical sourcing is essential. Additionally, investing in community development projects, such as education and healthcare initiatives, can help alleviate poverty and empower marginalized communities dependent on the gemstone industry. Collaboration across sectors is crucial for fostering a more equitable and sustainable gemstone trade that benefits both producers and consumers while respecting human rights and environmental integrity.\nSynthetic and artificial gemstones.\nSynthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically, and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in a laboratory. Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone, but may appear quite similar to it; they can be more easily manufactured synthetic gemstones of a different mineral (spinel), glass, plastic, resins, or other compounds.\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include cubic zirconia, composed of zirconium oxide, synthetic moissanite, and uncolored, synthetic corundum or spinels; all of which are diamond simulants. The simulants imitate the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. In general, all are less hard than diamond. Moissanite actually has a \"higher\" refractive index than diamond, and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will show more \"fire\".\nCultured, synthetic, or \"lab-created\" gemstones are not imitations: The bulk mineral and trace coloring elements are the same in both. For example, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds have been manufactured in labs that possess chemical and physical characteristics identical to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) corundum, including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Small synthetic diamonds have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial abrasives, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or synthetic, the chemical, physical, and optical characteristics are the same: They are composed of the same mineral and are colored by the same trace materials, have the same hardness and density and strength, and show the same color spectrum, refractive index, and birefringence (if any). Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color since impurities common in natural stones are not present in the synthetic stone. Synthetics are made free of common naturally occurring impurities that reduce gem clarity or color unless intentionally added in order to provide a more drab, natural appearance, or to deceive an assayer. On the other hand, synthetics often show flaws not seen in natural stones, such as minute particles of corroded metal from lab trays used during synthesis.\nTypes.\nSome gemstones are more difficult to synthesize than others and not all stones are commercially viable to attempt to synthesize. These are the most common on the market currently.\nSynthetic corundum.\nSynthetic corundum includes ruby (red variation) and sapphire (other color variations), both of which are considered highly desired and valued. Ruby was the first gemstone to be synthesized by Auguste Verneuil with his development of the flame-fusion process in 1902. Synthetic corundum continues to be made typically by flame-fusion as it is most cost-effective, but can also be produced through flux growth and hydrothermal growth.\nSynthetic beryls.\nThe most common synthesized beryl is emerald (green). Yellow, red and blue beryls are possible but much more rare. Synthetic emerald became possible with the development of the flux growth process and is produced in this way and well as hydrothermal growth.\nSynthetic quartz.\nTypes of synthetic quartz include citrine, rose quartz, and amethyst. Natural occurring quartz is not rare, but is nevertheless synthetically produced as it has practical application outside of aesthetic purposes. Quartz generates an electric current when under pressure and is used in watches, clocks, and oscillators.\nSynthetic spinel.\nSynthetic spinel was first produced by accident. It can be created in any color making it popular to simulate various natural gemstones. It is created through flux growth and hydrothermal growth.\nCreation process.\nThere are two main categories for creation of these minerals: melt or solution processes.\nVerneuil flame fusion process (melt process).\nThe flame fusion process was the first process used which successfully created large quantities of synthetic gemstones to be sold on the market. This remains the most cost effective and common method of creating corundums today.\nThe flame fusion process is completed in a Verneuil furnace. The furnace consists of an inverted blowpipe burner which produces an extremely hot oxyhydrogen flame, a powder dispenser, and a ceramic pedestal. A chemical powder which corresponds to the desired gemstone is passed through this flame. This melts the ingredients which drop on to a plate and solidify into a crystal called a \"boule\". For corundum the flame must be 2000\u00a0\u00b0C. This process takes hours and yields a crystal with the same properties as its natural counterpart.\nTo produce corundum, a pure aluminium powder is used with different additives to achieve different colors.\nCzochralski process (melt process).\nIn 1918 this process was developed by J. Czocharalski and is also referred to as the \"crystal pulling\" method. In this process, the required gemstone materials are added to a crucible. A seed stone is placed into the melt in the crucible. As the gem begins to crystallize on the seed, the seed is pulled away and the gem continues to grow. This is used for corundum but is currently the least popular method.\nFlux growth (solution process).\nThe flux growth process was the first process able to synthesize emerald. Flux growth begins with a crucible which can withstand high heat; either graphite or platinum which is filled with a molten liquid referred to as flux. The specific gem ingredients are added and dissolved in this fluid and recrystallize to form the desired gemstone.This is a longer process compared to the flame fusion process and can take two months up to a year depending on the desired final size.\nHydrothermal growth (solution process).\nThe hydrothermal growth process attempts to imitate the natural growth process of minerals. The required gem materials are sealed in a container of water and placed under extreme pressure. The water is heated beyond its boiling point which allows normally insoluble materials to dissolve. As more material cannot be added once the container is sealed, in order to create a larger gem the process would begin with a \"seed\" stone from a previous batch which the new material will crystallize on. This process takes a few weeks to complete.\nCharacteristics.\nSynthetic gemstones share chemical and physical properties with natural gemstones, but there are some slight differences that can be used to discern synthetic from natural. These differences are slight and often require microscopy as a tool to distinguish differences. Undetectable synthetics pose a threat to the market if they are able to be sold as rare natural gemstones. Because of this there are certain characteristic gemologists look for. Each crystal is characteristic to the environment and growth process under which it was created.\nGemstones created from the flame-fusion process may have\nGemstones created from flux melt process may have\nGemstones created from hydrothermal growth may have\nHistory.\nPrior to development of synthesising processes the alternatives on the market to natural gemstones were imitations or fake. In 1837, the first successful synthesis of ruby occurred. French chemist Marc Gaudin managed to produce small crystals of ruby from melting together potassium aluminium sulphate and potassium chromate through what would later be known as the flux melt process. Following this, another French chemist Fremy was able to grow large quantities of small ruby crystals using a lead flux.\nA few years later an alternative to flux melt was developed which led to the introduction of what was labeled \"reconstructed ruby\" to the market. Reconstructed ruby was sold as a process which produced larger rubies from melting together bits of natural ruby. In later attempts to recreate this process it was found to not be possible and is believed reconstructed rubies were most likely created using a multi-step method of melting of ruby powder.\nAuguste Verneuil, a student of Fremy, went on to develop flame-fusion as an alternative to the flux-melt method. He developed large furnaces which were able to produce large quantities of corundums more efficiently and shifted the gemstone market dramatically. This process is still used today and the furnaces have not changed much from the original design. World production of corundum using this method reaches 1000 million carats a year.\nIn popular culture.\nFrench singer-songwriter Nolwenn Leroy was inspired by the gemstones for her 2017 album \"Gemme\" (meaning gemstone in French) and the single of the same name.\nLand of the Lustrous is a Japanese manga and anime series whose main characters are depicted as humanoid jewels.\nSteven Universe is an American animated television series whose main characters are magical gemstones who project themselves as feminine humanoids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Only a bare outline of his life survives, although some facts are known. He may have been the Meester gheraet van brugghe who became a master of the Antwerp guild in 1515. He was very successful in his lifetime and probably ran two workshops, in Antwerp and Bruges. Like many painters of his period, his reputation diminished in the 17th century until he was rediscovered in the 19th century.\nLife.\nHe was born in Oudewater, now located in the province of Utrecht. His year of birth is approximated as c. 1450\u20131460 on the basis that he looks to be around 50 years in the 1509 self-portrait found in his \"Virgin among the Virgins\". He is believed to have spent time in Italy from 1470 to 1480, where he was influenced by the Italian Renaissance. He formed his early style under Albert van Oudewater in Haarlem, and moved to Bruges in 1483, where he joined the Guild of Saint Luke in 1484.\nErwin Panofsky identifies David as a student of Geertgen tot Sint Jans. Upon the death of Hans Memling in 1494, David became Bruges' leading painter. He became dean of the guild in 1501, and in 1496 married Cornelia Cnoop, daughter of the dean of the goldsmiths' guild. David was one of the town's leading citizens.\nAmbrosius Benson served his apprenticeship with David. Around 1519 they had a dispute over a number of paintings and drawings which Benson had collected from other artists. David refused to return the materials because Benson owed him a large debt. Benson sought legal recourse in court and after he won, David was condemned to a prison term.\nHe died on 13 August 1523 and was buried in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges.\nStyle.\nDavid's surviving work mainly consists of religious scenes. They are characterised by an atmospheric, timeless, and almost dream like serenity, achieved through soft, warm and subtle colourisation, and masterful handling of light and shadow. He is innovative in his recasting of traditional themes and in his approach to landscape, which was then only an emerging genre in northern European painting. His ability with landscape can be seen in the detailed foliage of his \"Triptych of the Baptism\" and the forest scene in the New York \"Nativity\".\nMany of the art historians of the early 20th century, including Erwin Panofsky and Max Jakob Friedl\u00e4nder saw him as a painter who did little but distill the style of others and painted in an archaic and unimaginative style. However today most view him as a master colourist, and a painter who according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, worked in a \"progressive, even enterprising, mode, casting off his late medieval heritage and proceeding with a certain purity of vision in an age of transition.\"\nIn his early work David followed Haarlem artists such as Dirk Bouts, Albert van Oudewater, and Geertgen tot Sint Jans, though he had already given evidence of superior power as a colourist. To this early period belong the \"St John\" of the collection in Berlin and the Salting's \"St Jerome\". In Bruges he came directly under the influence of Memling, the master whom he followed most closely. It was from him that David acquired a solemnity of treatment, greater realism in the rendering of human form, and an orderly arrangement of figures.\nHe visited Antwerp in 1515 and was impressed with the work of Quentin Matsys, who had introduced a greater vitality and intimacy in the conception of sacred themes. Together they worked to preserve the traditions of the Bruges school against influences of the Italian Renaissance.\nWorks.\nThe works for which David is best known are the altarpieces painted before his visit to Antwerp: the \"Marriage of St Catherine\" at the National Gallery, London; the triptych of the \"Madonna Enthroned and Saints\" of the Brignole-Sale collection in Genoa; the \"Annunciation\" of the Sigmaringen collection; and above all, the \"Madonna with Angels and Saints\" (usually titled \"The Virgin among the Virgins\"), which he donated to the Carmelite Nuns of Sion at Bruges, and which is now in the Rouen museum.\nOnly a few of his works have remained in Bruges: \"The Judgment of Cambyses\", \"The Flaying of Sisamnes\" and the \"Baptism of Christ\" in the Groeningemuseum, and the \"Transfiguration\" in the Church of Our Lady.\nThe rest were scattered around the world, and to this may be due the oblivion into which his very name had fallen; this, and the fact that, some believed that for all the beauty and the soulfulness of his work, he had nothing innovative to add to the history of art.\nEven in his best work he had only given newer variations of the art of his predecessors and contemporaries. His rank among the masters was renewed, however, when a number of his paintings were assembled at the seminal 1902 Gruuthusemuseum, Bruges exhibition of early Flemish painters.\nHe also worked closely with the leading manuscript illuminators of the day, and seems to have been brought in to paint specific important miniatures himself, among them a \"Virgin among the Virgins\" in the Morgan Library, a \"Virgin and Child on a Crescent Moon\" in the \"Rothschild Prayerbook\", and a portrait of the Emperor Maximilian in Vienna. Several of his drawings also survive, and elements from these appear in the works of other painters and illuminators for several decades after his death.\nLess known but also of high quality are the works of David found in Spanish public collections. The Prado Museum in Madrid owns a table \"Rest on the flight into Egypt\" resembling the one in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. The Prado also holds another two Works by the painter, one of them only attributed. Another one of the Spanish capital's Museums, The Thyssen-Bornemisza holds a \"Crucifixi\u00f3n\" from 1475.\nLegacy.\nAt the time of David's death, the glory of Bruges and its painters was on the wane: Antwerp had become the leader in art as well as in political and commercial importance. Of David's pupils in Bruges, only Adriaen Isenbrandt, Albert Cornelis, and Ambrosius Benson achieved importance. Among other Flemish painters, Joachim Patinir, Jan Mabuse and the Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas were to some degree influenced by him.\nDavid's name had been completely forgotten when in 1866 William Henry James Weale discovered documents about him in the archives of Bruges; these brought to light the main facts of the painter's life and led to the reconstruction of David's artistic personality, beginning with the recognition of David's only documented work, the \"Virgin Among Virgins\" at Rouen.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "12808", "revid": "237572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12808", "title": "GSM", "text": "Cellular telephone network standard since 1991\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a family of standards to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks, as used by mobile devices such as mobile phones and mobile broadband modems. GSM is also a trade mark owned by the GSM Association. \"GSM\" may also refer to the voice codec initially used in GSM.\n2G networks developed as a replacement for first generation (1G) analog cellular networks. The original GSM standard, which was developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), originally described a digital, circuit-switched network optimized for full duplex voice telephony, employing time division multiple access (TDMA) between stations. This expanded over time to include data communications, first by circuit-switched transport, then by packet data transport via its upgraded standards, GPRS and then EDGE. GSM exists in various versions based on the frequency bands used.\nGSM was first implemented in Finland in December 1991. It became the global standard for mobile cellular communications, with over 2 billion GSM subscribers globally in 2006, far above its competing standard, CDMA. Its share reached over 90% market share by the mid-2010s, and operating in over 219 countries and territories. The specifications and maintenance of GSM passed over to the 3GPP body in 2000, which at the time developed third-generation (3G) UMTS standards, followed by the fourth-generation (4G) LTE Advanced and the fifth-generation 5G standards, which do not form part of the GSM standard. Beginning in the late 2010s, various carriers worldwide started to shut down their GSM networks; nevertheless, as a result of the network's widespread use, the acronym \"GSM\" is still used as a generic term for the plethora of \"G\" mobile phone technologies evolved from it or mobile phones itself.\nHistory.\nInitial European development.\nIn 1983, work began to develop a European standard for digital cellular voice telecommunications when the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) set up the \"Groupe Sp\u00e9cial Mobile\" (GSM) committee and later provided a permanent technical-support group based in Paris. Five years later, in 1987, 15 representatives from 13 European countries signed a memorandum of understanding in Copenhagen to develop and deploy a common cellular telephone system across Europe, and EU rules were passed to make GSM a mandatory standard. The decision to develop a continental standard eventually resulted in a unified, open, standard-based network which was larger than that in the United States.\nIn February 1987 Europe produced the first agreed GSM Technical Specification. Ministers from the EU Big Four (France, West Germany, United Kingdom and Italy) cemented their political support for GSM with the Bonn Declaration on Global Information Networks in May and the GSM MoU was tabled for signature in September. The MoU drew in mobile operators from across Europe to pledge to invest in new GSM networks to an ambitious common date.\nIn this short 38-week period the whole of Europe (countries and industries) had been brought behind GSM in a rare unity and speed guided by four public officials: Armin Silberhorn (Germany), Stephen Temple (UK), Philippe Dupuis (France), and Renzo Failli (Italy). In 1989 the Groupe Sp\u00e9cial Mobile committee was transferred from CEPT to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).\nThe IEEE/RSE awarded to Thomas Haug and Philippe Dupuis the 2018 James Clerk Maxwell medal for their \"leadership in the development of the first international mobile communications standard with subsequent evolution into worldwide smartphone data communication\". The GSM (2G) has evolved into 3G, 4G and 5G.\nFirst networks.\nIn parallel France and Germany signed a joint development agreement in 1984 and were joined by Italy and the UK in 1986. In 1986, the European Commission proposed reserving the 900\u00a0MHz spectrum band for GSM. It was long believed that the former Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri made the world's first GSM call on 1 July 1991, calling Kaarina Suonio (deputy mayor of the city of Tampere) using a network built by Nokia and Siemens and operated by Radiolinja. In 2021 a former Nokia engineer Pekka Lonka revealed to making a test call just a couple of hours earlier. \"World's first GSM call was actually made by me. I called Marjo Jousinen, in Salo.\", Lonka informed. The following year saw the sending of the first short messaging service (SMS or \"text message\") message, and Vodafone UK and Telecom Finland signed the first international roaming agreement.\nEnhancements.\nWork began in 1991 to expand the GSM standard to the 1800\u00a0MHz frequency band and the first 1800\u00a0MHz network became operational in the UK by 1993, called the DCS 1800. Also that year, Telstra became the first network operator to deploy a GSM network outside Europe and the first practical hand-held GSM mobile phone became available.\nIn 1995 fax, data and SMS messaging services were launched commercially, the first 1900\u00a0MHz GSM network became operational in the United States and GSM subscribers worldwide exceeded 10 million. In the same year, the GSM Association formed. Pre-paid GSM SIM cards were launched in 1996 and worldwide GSM subscribers passed 100 million in 1998.\nIn 2000 the first commercial General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) services were launched and the first GPRS-compatible handsets became available for sale. In 2001, the first UMTS (W-CDMA) network was launched, a 3G technology that is not part of GSM. Worldwide GSM subscribers exceeded 500 million. In 2002, the first Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) was introduced and the first GSM network in the 800\u00a0MHz frequency band became operational. Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) services first became operational in a network in 2003, and the number of worldwide GSM subscribers exceeded 1 billion in 2004.\nBy 2005 GSM networks accounted for more than 75% of the worldwide cellular network market, serving 1.5 billion subscribers. In 2005, the first HSDPA-capable network also became operational. The first HSUPA network launched in 2007. (High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and its uplink and downlink versions are 3G technologies, not part of GSM.) Worldwide GSM subscribers exceeded three billion in 2008.\nAdoption.\nThe GSM Association estimated in 2011 that technologies defined in the GSM standard served 80% of the mobile market, encompassing more than 5 billion people across more than 212 countries and territories, making GSM the most ubiquitous of the many standards for cellular networks.\nGSM is a second-generation (2G) standard employing time-division multiple-access (TDMA) spectrum-sharing, issued by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The GSM standard does not include the 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology, nor the 4G LTE orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) technology standards issued by the 3GPP.\nGSM, for the first time, set a common standard for Europe for wireless networks. It was also adopted by many countries outside Europe. This allowed subscribers to use other GSM networks that have roaming agreements with each other. The common standard reduced research and development costs, since hardware and software could be sold with only minor adaptations for the local market.\nDiscontinuation.\nTelstra in Australia shut down its 2G GSM network on 1 December 2016, the first mobile network operator to decommission a GSM network. The second mobile provider to shut down its GSM network (on 1 January 2017) was AT&amp;T Mobility from the United States. \nOptus in Australia completed the shut down of its 2G GSM network on 1 August 2017, part of the Optus GSM network covering Western Australia and the Northern Territory had earlier in the year been shut down in April 2017.\nSingapore shut down 2G services entirely in April 2017.\nTechnical details.\nNetwork structure.\nThe network is structured into several discrete sections:\nBase-station subsystem.\nGSM utilizes a cellular network, meaning that cell phones connect to it by searching for cells in the immediate vicinity. There are five different cell sizes in a GSM network:\nThe coverage area of each cell varies according to the implementation environment. Macro cells can be regarded as cells where the base-station antenna is installed on a mast or a building above average rooftop level. Micro cells are cells whose antenna height is under average rooftop level; they are typically deployed in urban areas. Picocells are small cells whose coverage diameter is a few dozen meters; they are mainly used indoors. Femtocells are cells designed for use in residential or small-business environments and connect to a telecommunications service provider's network via a broadband-internet connection. Umbrella cells are used to cover shadowed regions of smaller cells and to fill in gaps in coverage between those cells.\nCell horizontal radius varies \u2013 depending on antenna height, antenna gain, and propagation conditions \u2013 from a couple of hundred meters to several tens of kilometers. The longest distance the GSM specification supports in practical use is . There are also several implementations of the concept of an extended cell, where the cell radius could be double or even more, depending on the antenna system, the type of terrain, and the timing advance.\nGSM supports indoor coverage \u2013 achievable by using an indoor picocell base station, or an indoor repeater with distributed indoor antennas fed through power splitters \u2013 to deliver the radio signals from an antenna outdoors to the separate indoor distributed antenna system. Picocells are typically deployed when significant call capacity is needed indoors, as in shopping centers or airports. However, this is not a prerequisite, since indoor coverage is also provided by in-building penetration of radio signals from any nearby cell.\nGSM carrier frequencies.\nGSM networks operate in a number of different carrier frequency ranges (separated into GSM frequency ranges for 2G and UMTS frequency bands for 3G), with most 2G GSM networks operating in the 900\u00a0MHz or 1800\u00a0MHz bands. Where these bands were already allocated, the 850\u00a0MHz and 1900\u00a0MHz bands were used instead (for example in Canada and the United States). In rare cases the 400 and 450\u00a0MHz frequency bands are assigned in some countries because they were previously used for first-generation systems.\nFor comparison, most 3G networks in Europe operate in the 2100\u00a0MHz frequency band. For more information on worldwide GSM frequency usage, see GSM frequency bands.\nRegardless of the frequency selected by an operator, it is divided into timeslots for individual phones. This allows eight full-rate or sixteen half-rate speech channels per radio frequency. These eight radio timeslots (or burst periods) are grouped into a TDMA frame. Half-rate channels use alternate frames in the same timeslot. The channel data rate for all 8 channels is 270.833\u00a0kbit/s, and the frame duration is 4.615 ms. TDMA noise is interference that can be heard on speakers near a GSM phone using TDMA, audible as a buzzing sound.\nThe transmission power in the handset is limited to a maximum of 2 watts in GSM 850/900 and 1 watt in GSM 1800/1900.\nVoice codecs.\nGSM has used a variety of voice codecs to squeeze 3.1\u00a0kHz audio into between 7 and 13\u00a0kbit/s. Originally, two codecs, named after the types of data channel they were allocated, were used, called Half Rate (6.5\u00a0kbit/s) and Full Rate (13\u00a0kbit/s). These used a system based on linear predictive coding (LPC). In addition to being efficient with bitrates, these codecs also made it easier to identify more important parts of the audio, allowing the air interface layer to prioritize and better protect these parts of the signal. GSM was further enhanced in 1997\nwith the enhanced full rate (EFR) codec, a 12.2\u00a0kbit/s codec that uses a full-rate channel. Finally, with the development of UMTS, EFR was refactored into a variable-rate codec called AMR-Narrowband, which is high quality and robust against interference when used on full-rate channels, or less robust but still relatively high quality when used in good radio conditions on half-rate channel.\nSubscriber Identity Module (SIM).\nOne of the key features of GSM is the Subscriber Identity Module, commonly known as a SIM card. The SIM is a detachable smart card containing a user's subscription information and phone book. This allows users to retain their information after switching handsets. Alternatively, users can change networks or network identities without switching handsets - simply by changing the SIM.\nPhone locking.\nSometimes mobile network operators restrict handsets that they sell for exclusive use in their own network. This is called SIM locking and is implemented by a software feature of the phone. A subscriber may usually contact the provider to remove the lock for a fee, utilize private services to remove the lock, or use software and websites to unlock the handset themselves. It is possible to hack past a phone locked by a network operator.\nIn some countries and regions (e.g. Brazil and Germany) all phones are sold unlocked due to the abundance of dual-SIM handsets and operators.\nGSM security.\nGSM was intended to be a secure wireless system. It has considered the user authentication using a pre-shared key and challenge\u2013response, and over-the-air encryption. However, GSM is vulnerable to different types of attack, each of them aimed at a different part of the network.\nResearch findings indicate that GSM faces susceptibility to hacking by script kiddies, a term referring to inexperienced individuals utilizing readily available hardware and software. The vulnerability arises from the accessibility of tools such as a DVB-T TV tuner, posing a threat to both mobile and network users. Despite the term \"script kiddies\" implying a lack of sophisticated skills, the consequences of their attacks on GSM can be severe, impacting the functionality of cellular networks. Given that GSM continues to be the main source of cellular technology in numerous countries, its susceptibility to potential threats from malicious attacks is one that needs to be addressed.\nThe development of UMTS introduced an optional Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) that uses a longer authentication key to give greater security, as well as mutually authenticating the network and the user, whereas GSM only authenticates the user to the network (and not vice versa). The security model therefore offers confidentiality and authentication, but limited authorization capabilities, and no non-repudiation.\nGSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security. The A5/1, A5/2, and A5/3 stream ciphers are used for ensuring over-the-air voice privacy. A5/1 was developed first and is a stronger algorithm used within Europe and the United States; A5/2 is weaker and used in other countries. Serious weaknesses have been found in both algorithms: it is possible to break A5/2 in real-time with a ciphertext-only attack, and in January 2007, The Hacker's Choice started the A5/1 cracking project with plans to use FPGAs that allow A5/1 to be broken with a rainbow table attack. The system supports multiple algorithms so operators may replace that cipher with a stronger one.\nSince 2000, different efforts have been made in order to crack the A5 encryption algorithms. Both A5/1 and A5/2 algorithms have been broken, and their cryptanalysis has been revealed in the literature. As an example, Karsten Nohl developed a number of rainbow tables (static values which reduce the time needed to carry out an attack) and have found new sources for known plaintext attacks. He said that it is possible to build \"a full GSM interceptor... from open-source components\" but that they had not done so because of legal concerns. Nohl claimed that he was able to intercept voice and text conversations by impersonating another user to listen to voicemail, make calls, or send text messages using a seven-year-old Motorola cellphone and decryption software available for free online.\nGSM uses General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for data transmissions like browsing the web. The most commonly deployed GPRS ciphers were publicly broken in 2011.\nThe researchers revealed flaws in the commonly used GEA/1 and GEA/2 (standing for GPRS Encryption Algorithms 1 and 2) ciphers and published the open-source \"gprsdecode\" software for sniffing GPRS networks. They also noted that some carriers do not encrypt the data (i.e., using GEA/0) in order to detect the use of traffic or protocols they do not like (e.g., Skype), leaving customers unprotected. GEA/3 seems to remain relatively hard to break and is said to be in use on some more modern networks. If used with USIM to prevent connections to fake base stations and downgrade attacks, users will be protected in the medium term, though migration to 128-bit GEA/4 is still recommended.\nThe first public cryptanalysis of GEA/1 and GEA/2 (also written GEA-1 and GEA-2) was done in 2021. It concluded that although using a 64-bit key, the GEA-1 algorithm actually provides only 40 bits of security, due to a relationship between two parts of the algorithm. The researchers found that this relationship was very unlikely to have happened if it was not intentional. This may have been done in order to satisfy European controls on export of cryptographic programs.\nStandards information.\nThe GSM systems and services are described in a set of standards governed by ETSI, where a full list is maintained.\nPatents and open source implementations.\nSeveral open-source software projects exist that provide certain GSM features, such as a base transceiver station by OpenBTS and the Osmocom stack providing various parts.\nPatents remain a problem for any open-source GSM implementation, because it is not possible for GNU or any other free software distributor to guarantee immunity from all lawsuits by the patent holders against the users. Furthermore, new features are being added to the standard all the time which means they have patent protection for a number of years.\nThe original GSM implementations from 1991 may now be entirely free of patent encumbrances, however patent freedom is not certain due to the United States' \"first to invent\" system that was in place until 2012. The \"first to invent\" system, coupled with \"patent term adjustment\" can extend the life of a U.S. patent far beyond 20 years from its priority date. It is unclear at this time whether OpenBTS will be able to implement features of that initial specification without limit. As patents subsequently expire, however, those features can be added into the open-source version. As of 2011[ [update]], there have been no lawsuits against users of OpenBTS over GSM use.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
