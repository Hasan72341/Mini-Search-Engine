The country's leading export is coffee (US$340\u00a0million), which accounted for 22% of the total Honduran export revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. Cultivated shrimp is another important export sector. Since the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through maquiladoras, especially in San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cort\u00e9s.\nHonduras has extensive forests, marine, and mineral resources, although widespread slash and burn agricultural methods continue to destroy Honduran forests. The Honduran economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-induced recession (\u22121.9%) of 1999. The Honduran maquiladora sector, the third-largest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing employment to over 120,000 and generating more than $528\u00a0 million in foreign exchange for the country. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The country's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at slightly over US$1 billion. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly in the United States) rose 28% to $410 million in 2000. The Lempira (currency) was devaluing for many years, but stabilized at L19 to the United States dollar in 2005. The Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America; gross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western Hemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer. Using alternative statistical measurements in addition to the gross domestic product can provide greater context for the nation's poverty.\nThe country signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) \u2013 later converted to a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) with the International Monetary Fund in March 1999. Honduras (as of the about year 2000) continues to maintain stable macroeconomic policies. It has not been swift in implementing structural changes, such as privatization of the publicly owned telephone and energy distribution companies\u2014changes which are desired by the IMF and other international lenders. Honduras received significant debt relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, including the suspension of bilateral debt service payments and bilateral debt reduction by the Paris Club\u2014including the United States \u2013 worth over $400\u00a0 million. In July 2000, Honduras reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), qualifying the country for interim multilateral debt relief.\nLand appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the presence of apparently extensive land is misleading because the nation's rugged, mountainous terrain restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow strips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE), 73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty. The country is among the most unequal in the world.\nEconomic history.\nThe colonial economy in Honduras was primarily oriented around mining.\nAfter Honduras achieved independence from Spain in the early 19th century, its economic growth became closely related to its ability to develop attractive export products. During much of the 19th century, the Honduran economy languished; traditional cattle raising and subsistence agriculture produced no suitable major export. In the latter part of the century, economic activity quickened with the development of large-scale, precious metal mining. The most important mines were in the mountains near the capital of Tegucigalpa and were owned by the New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company (NYHRMC).\nSilver was the principal metal extracted, accounting for about 55% of exports in the 1880s. Mining income stimulated commercial and ancillary enterprises, built infrastructure, and reduced monetary restraints on trade. There were few other beneficial economic effects, however, because the mining industry was never well integrated into the rest of the Honduran economy. The foreign mining companies employed a small workforce, provided little or no government revenue, and relied mostly on imported mining equipment.\n20th century.\nHonduras's international economic activity surged in the early 20th century. Between 1913 and 1929, its agricultural exports rose from $3\u00a0million ($2\u00a0million from bananas) to $25\u00a0million ($21\u00a0million from bananas). These \"golden\" exports were supported by more than $40\u00a0million of specialized banana company investment in the Honduran infrastructure and were safeguarded by US pressure on the national government when the companies felt threatened.\nThe overall performance of the Honduran economy remained closely tied to banana prices and production from the 1920s until after the mid-century because other forms of commercial export agriculture were slow to emerge. In addition, until drastically reduced in the mid-1950s, the workforce associated with banana cultivation represented a significant proportion of the wage earners in the country. Just before the banana industry's largest strike in 1954, approximately 35,000 workers held jobs on the banana plantations of the United Fruit Company (later United Brands Company, then Chiquita Brands International) or the Standard Fruit Company (later brought by Castle and Cook, then Dole Food Company).\nAfter 1950 Honduran governments encouraged agricultural modernization and export diversification by spending heavily on transportation and communications infrastructure, agricultural credit, and technical assistance. During the 1950s\u2014as a result of these improvements and the strong international export prices\u2014beef, cotton, and coffee became significant export products for the first time. Honduran sugar, timber, and tobacco also were exported, and by 1960 bananas had declined to a more modest share (45 percent) of total exports. During the 1960s, industrial growth was stimulated by the establishment of the Central American Common Market (CACM\u2014see Appendix B).\nAs a result of the reduction of regional trade barriers and the construction of a high common external tariff, some Honduran manufactured products, such as soaps, sold successfully in other Central American countries. Because of the greater size and relative efficiency of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan industrial sectors, however, Honduras bought far more manufactured products from its neighbors than it sold to them. After the 1969 Soccer War with El Salvador, Honduras effectively withdrew from the CACM. Favorable bilateral trade arrangements between Honduras and the other former CACM partners were subsequently negotiated, however.\nA political shift in the 1980s had strong and unexpected repercussions on the country's economic condition. Beginning in late 1979, as insurgency spread in neighboring countries, Honduran military leaders enthusiastically came to support United States policies in the region. This alignment resulted in financial support that benefited the civilian as well as the military ministries and agencies of Honduras. Honduran defense spending rose throughout the 1980s until it consumed 20 to 30 percent of the national budget. Before the military buildup began in fiscal year (FY) 1980, United States military assistance to Honduras was less than US$4\u00a0million. Military aid more than doubled to reach just under US$9\u00a0million by FY 1981, surged to more than $31\u00a0million by FY 1982, and stood at $48.3\u00a0million in FY 1983. Tiny Honduras soon became the tenth largest recipient of United States assistance aid; total economic and military aid rose to more than $200\u00a0million in 1985 and remained at more than $100\u00a0million for the rest of the 1980s.\nThe increasing dependence of the Honduran economy on foreign aid was aggravated by a severe, regionwide economic decline during the 1980s. Private investment plummeted in 1980, and capital flight for that year was $500\u00a0million. To make matters worse, coffee prices plunged on the international market in the mid-1980s and remained low throughout the decade. In 1993 average annual per capita income remained depressingly low at about $580, and 75 percent of the population was poor by internationally defined standards.\nTraditionally, Honduran economic hopes have been pinned on land and agricultural commodities. Despite those hopes, however, usable land has always been severely limited. Honduras's mostly mountainous terrain confines agriculturally exploitable land to narrow bands along the coasts and to some previously fertile but now largely depleted valleys. The country's once abundant forest resources have also been dramatically reduced, and Honduras has not derived economically significant income from mineral resources since the 19th century. Similarly, Honduras's industrial sector never was fully developed. The heady days of the CACM (mid to -late 1960s), which produced an industrial boom for El Salvador and Guatemala, barely touched the Honduran economy except to increase its imports because of the comparative advantages enjoyed by the Salvadoran and Guatemalan economies and Honduras's inability to compete.\nBananas and coffee have also proven unreliable sources of income. Although bananas are less subject to the vagaries of international markets than coffee, natural disasters such as Hurricane Fifi in 1974, drought, and disease have appeared with a regular, albeit random, frequency to take their economic toll through severely diminished harvests. Moreover, bananas are grown and marketed mostly by international corporations, which keep the bulk of wealth generated. Coffee exports, equally unreliable as a major source of economic support, surpassed bananas in the mid1970s as Honduras's leading export income earner, but international price declines coupled with huge fiscal deficits underlined the vulnerability of coffee as an economic base.\n1990s.\nAs Honduras entered the 1990s, it did have some factors working in its favor\u2014relative peace and a stronger civilian government with less military interference in the politics and economy of the country than in past years. The country was hobbled, however, by horrendous foreign debt, could claim only diminished natural resources, and had one of the fastest-growing and urbanizing populations in the world. The government's daunting task then became how to create an economic base able to compensate for the withdrawal of much United States assistance without becoming solely dependent on traditional agricultural exports.\nIn the 1990s, bananas were booming again, particularly as new European trade agreements increased market size. Small banana producing cooperatives lined up in the 1990s to sell their land to the commercial giants, and the last banana-producing lands held by the government were privatized. Like most of Central America, Honduras in the 1990s began to woo foreign investors, mostly Asian clothing assembly firms, and it held high hopes for revenue to be generated by privatizing national industries. With one of the most strike-prone labor forces in Central America, debt-burdened and aging industrial assets, and a dramatically underdeveloped infrastructure, Honduras, however, has distinct economic disadvantages relative to its Central American and Caribbean neighbors, who compete with Honduras in the same export markets.\nHonduran president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, elected in November 1989, enjoyed little success in the early part of his administration as he attempted to adhere to a standard economic austerity package prescribed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. As the November 1993 presidential elections drew closer, the political fallout of austere economic measures made their implementation even less likely. Any hope for his party's winning the 1993 election was predicated on improving social programs, addressing employment needs, and appeasing a disgruntled, vocal public sector. However, reaching those goals required policies that moved away from balancing the budget, lowering inflation, and reducing the deficit and external debt to attract investment and stimulate economic growth.\nCallejas inherited an economic mess. The economy had deteriorated rapidly, starting in 1989, as the United States Agency for International Development (AID) pointedly interrupted disbursements of its grants to Honduras to signal displeasure with the economic policies of the old government and to push the new government to make economic reforms. Nondisbursal of those funds greatly exacerbated the country's economic problems. Funds from the multilateral lending institutions, which eventually would help fill the gap left by the reduction of United States aid, were still under negotiation in 1989 and would be conditioned first on payment of arrears on the country's enormous external debt.\nBetween 1983 and 1985, the government of Honduras\u2014pumped up by massive infusions of external borrowing\u2014had introduced expensive, high-tech infrastructure projects. The construction of roads and dams, financed mostly by multilateral loans and grants, was intended to generate employment to compensate for the impact of the regionwide recession. In reality, the development projects served to swell the ranks of public-sector employment and line the pockets of a small elite. The projects never sparked private-sector investment or created substantial private employment. Instead, per capita income continued to fall as Honduras's external debt doubled. Even greater injections of foreign assistance between 1985 and 1988 kept the economy afloat, but it soon became clear that the successive governments had been borrowing time as well as money.\nForeign aid between 1985 and 1989 represented about 4.6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). About 44 percent of the government's fiscal shortfall was financed through cash from foreign sources. Side effects of the cash infusion were that the national currency, the lempira became overvalued and the number of exports dropped. A booming public sector, with its enhanced ability to import, was enough to keep the economy showing growth, based on private consumption and government spending. But the government did little to address the historical, underlying structural problems of the economy\u2014its overdependence on too few traditional commodities and lack of investment. Unemployment mushroomed, and private investment withered.\nBy 1989 president Callejas's broad economic goal led a return of Honduran economic growth to 1960\u201380 levels. During the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, the country's economy, spurred mostly by erratically fluctuating traditional agricultural commodities, nevertheless averaged real annual growth of between 4 and 5 percent. At the end of the 1980s, however, Callejas had few remaining vehicles with which to pull the country out of the deep regionwide recession of the 1980s. Real growth between 1989 and 1993 translated to mostly negative or small positive per capita changes in the GDP for a population that was growing at close to 4 percent annually.\nPresident Callejas attempted to adhere to conditions of desperately needed new loans. Cutting the size of the public sector workforce, lowering the deficit, and enhancing revenues from taxes\u2014as mandated by the multilateral lending institutions\u2014were consistently his biggest stumbling blocks. Despite his all-out effort to reduce the public-sector deficit, the overall ratio of fiscal deficit to the GDP in 1990 showed little change from that in 1989. The total public-sector deficit actually grew to 8.6 percent of the GDP, or nearly L1\u00a0billion, in 1991.\nThe 1993 deficit expanded to 10.6 percent of GDP. The Honduran government's medium-term economic objectives, as dictated by the IMF, were to have generated real GDP growth of 3.5 percent by 1992 and 4 percent by 1993. In fact, GDP growth was 3.3 percent in 1991, 5.6 percent in 1992, and an estimated 3.7 percent in 1993. The economy had operated so long on an ad hoc basis that it lacked the tools to implement coherent economic objectives. Solving the most immediate crisis frequently took precedence over long-term goals.\nInflation.\nBy 1991 President Callejas had achieved modest success in controlling inflation. Overall inflation for 1990 had reached 36.4 percent\u2014not the hyperinflation experienced by some Latin American counties\u2014but still the highest annual rate for Honduras in forty years. The Honduran government and the IMF had set an inflation target of 12 percent for 1992 and 8 percent for 1993. The actual figures were 8.8 percent in 1992 and an estimated 10.7 percent for 1993. Hondurans had been accustomed to low inflation (3.4 percent in 1985, rising to 4.5 percent by the end of 1986), partly because pegging the lempira to the dollar-linked Honduras's inflation rate to inflation rates in developed countries. But the expectation for low inflation made the reality of high inflation that much worse and created additional pressures on the government for action when inflation soared in 1990.\nUnemployment.\nBetween 1980 and 1983, 20 percent of the workforce was unemployed\u2014double the percentage of the late 1970s. Job creation remained substantially behind the growth of the labor force throughout the 1980s. Unemployment grew to 25 percent by 1985, and combined unemployment and underemployment jumped to 40 percent in 1989. By 1993, 50 to 60 percent of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be either underemployed or unemployed.\nThe government's acceptance of foreign aid during the 1980s, in lieu of economic growth sparked by private investment, allowed it to ignore the necessity of creating new jobs. Honduras's GDP showed reasonable growth throughout most of the 1980s, especially when compared to the rest of Latin America, but it was artificially buoyed by private consumption and public-sector spending.\nMainstay agricultural jobs became scarcer in the late 1970s. Coffee harvests and plantings in border area decreased because fighting in neighboring Nicaragua and El Salvador spilled over into Honduras. Other factors contributing to the job scarcity were limited land, a reluctance on the part of coffee growers to invest while wars destabilized the region, and a lack of credit. Small farmers became increasingly unable to support themselves as their parcels of land diminished in size and productivity.\nProblems in the agricultural sector have fueled urbanization. The Honduran population was 77 percent rural in 1960. By 1992 only 55 percent of the Honduran population continued to live in rural areas. Peasants (campesinos) flocked to the cities in search of work but found little there. Overall unemployment has been exacerbated by an influx of refugees from the wars in neighboring countries, attracted to Honduras, ironically, by its relatively low population density and relative peace. In the agricultural sector (which in 1993 still accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force), unemployment has been estimated to be far worse than the figures for the total labor force.\nHonduran urban employment in the early 1990s has been characterized by underemployment and marginal informal-sector jobs, as thousands of former agricultural workers and refugees have moved to the cities seeking better lives. Few new jobs have been generated in the formal sector, however, because the domestic private sector and foreign investments have dropped and coveted public-sector jobs have been reserved mostly for the small Honduran middle-class with political or military connections. Only one of ten Honduran workers were securely employed in the formal sector in 1991.\nIn the mid-1980s, the World Bank reported that only 10,000 new jobs were created annually; the low rate of job creation resulted in 20,000 people being added to the ranks of the unemployed every year. The actual disparity between jobs needed for full employment and new jobs created exceeded that projection, however. For those with jobs, the buying power of their wages tumbled throughout the 1980s while the cost of basic goods, especially food, climbed precipitously.\nRole of government.\nThroughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, the military-led governments of Honduras ran a state-sponsored and state-financed economy. The governments provided most guarantees for loans to a strong but patronage-dominated and somewhat corrupt public sector that included recipients of graft extracted from foreign and domestic investors, and to costly state-developed enterprises. By 1989 and the election of president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, however, a heavy toll had been taken by regionwide economic recession, civil war in neighboring countries, the drying up of most external credit, and capital flight equaling more than $1.5\u00a0billion.\nCallejas began to shift economic policy toward privatizing government-owned enterprises, liberalizing trade and tariff regulations, and encouraging increased foreign investment through tax and other incentives. The Callejas administration did not seek less government control. Rather it changed the government's objectives by focusing on reducing public-sector spending, the size of the public-sector workforce, and the trade deficit. Overall economic planning became the responsibility of the National Superior Planning Council, directed by the minister of economy and commerce. President Callejas, a US-trained economist, brought new professionalism and technical skills to the central government as he began the arduous task of long-term economic reform.\nThe official exchange rate of the lempira, pegged at US$1=L2 since 1918, was dramatically devalued in 1990. Exchange controls had been introduced in 1982, resulting in a parallel currency market (black market) and several confusing official exchange rates operating simultaneously. Some of those rates were legally recognized in 1990 when President Callejas introduced a major series of economic policy reforms, which included reducing the maximum import tariff rate from 90 to 40 percent and getting rid of most surcharges and exemptions.\nThe value of the lempira was adjusted to US$1=L4, with the exception of the rate for debt equity conversions, which remained at the old rate of US$1=L2. The official conversion rate of the lempira fell to US$1=L7.26 in December 1993. The president also introduced temporary taxes on exports, which were intended to increase central government revenue. Additional price and trade liberalization measures and fewer government regulations became part of his ongoing reforms.\nBudget.\nThroughout the 1980s, the Honduran government was heavily financed by foreign assistance. External financing\u2014mostly bilateral credit from the United States\u2014rose dramatically until it reached 87 percent of the public deficit in 1985, rising even further in subsequent years. By 1991 the public-sector deficit was entirely financed with net external credit. That financing permitted the government to reduce the demand for internal credit and, therefore, to maintain its established exchange rate.\nIn 1991 Callejas managed to give the appearance of having reduced the overall fiscal deficit, a requirement for new credit. But the deficit decrease was mostly an accounting device because it resulted from the postponement of external payments to the Paris Club debtors and eventually would be offset by pressure to raise public investment. During 1991, loan negotiations with multilateral and bilateral lending institutions brought Honduras $39.5\u00a0million in United States development assistance, $70\u00a0million in balance-of-payments assistance in the form of cash grants, and $18.8\u00a0million in food aid.\nHonduras country also negotiated $302.4\u00a0million in concessional loans from the multilateral lending institutions. Total outstanding external debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 119 percent in 1990 to 114 percent in 1991 and to 112 percent in 1993. This drop was largely the result of debt forgiveness of $448.4\u00a0million by the United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Scheduled amortization payments of an average $223.2\u00a0million per year, however, guaranteed that Honduras's gross funding requirements would remain large indefinitely.\nThe government of Honduras projected that overall tax revenues would increase from 13.2 percent of GDP in 1989 to about 15.7 percent in 1991. Adjustments for low coffee prices and the continuation of lax collection methods, however, undermined those goals. Despite these tax increases, compared to developed countries, Honduras has low tax rates with, particularly low property taxes.\nLabor force.\nHonduras suffers from an overabundance of unskilled and uneducated laborers. Most Honduran workers in 1993 continued to be employed in agriculture, which accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force. More than half of the rural population, moreover, remains landless and heavily dependent on diminishing seasonal labor and low wages. Fifty-five percent of the farming population subsists on less than two hectares and earns less than $70 per capita per year from those plots, mostly by growing subsistence food crops.\nIn 1993 only about 9\u201313 percent of the Honduran labor force was engaged in the country's tiny manufacturing sector\u2014one of the smallest in Central America. Skilled laborers are scarce. Only 25,000 people per year, of which about 21 percent are industrial workers, graduate yearly from the National Institute of Professional Training (Instituto Nacional de Formaci\u00f3n Profesional-INFOP) established in 1972.\nHundreds of small manufacturing firms, the traditional backbone of Honduran enterprise, began to go out of business beginning in the early 1990s, as import costs rose and competition through increasing wages for skilled labor from the mostly Asian-owned assembly industries strengthened. The small Honduran shops, most of which had manufactured clothing or food products for the domestic market, traditionally received little support in the form of credit from the government or the private sector and were more like artisans than conventional manufacturers. Asian-owned export assembly firms (maquiladoras), operating mostly in free zones established by the government on the Caribbean coast, attract thousands of job seekers and swell the populations of new city centers such as San Pedro Sula, Tela, and La Ceiba. Those firms employ approximately 16,000 workers in 1991.\nAbout one-third of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be working in the service or \"other\" sector in 1993. That classification usually means that a person ekes out a precarious livelihood in the urban informal sector or as a poorly paid domestic. As unemployment soared throughout Central America in the 1980s, more and more people were forced to rely on their own ingenuity in order to simply exist on the fringes of Honduran society.\nAs for the informal sector, research has shown that evidence of child labor has been observed mostly in the Honduran agricultural sector. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor's \"List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor\" cites three goods produced in such working conditions in Honduras; namely coffee, lobsters and melons.\nEmployment indicators and benefits.\nHonduran governments have set minimum wages since 1974, but enforcement has generally been lax. That laxity increased at the beginning of the 1980s. Traditionally, most Honduran workers have not been covered by social security, welfare, or minimum wages. Multinational companies usually paid more than the standard minimum wage, but, overall, the Honduran wage earner has experienced a diminution of real wages and purchasing ability for more than a decade. When they occurred, minimum wage adjustments generally did not keep up with the cost of living increases.\nAfter a major currency devaluation in 1990, average Honduran workers were among the most poorly paid workers in the Western Hemisphere. By contrast, the banana companies paid relatively high wages as early as the 1970s. Banana workers continued at the top of the wage scale in the 1990s; however, in the 1980s, as banana production became less labor-intensive, the companies had decreased their investment and workforce. Consequently, fewer workers were employed as relatively well-paid agricultural wage earners with related benefits.\nPresident Callejas responded to the severe poverty by implementing a specially financed Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondure\u00f1o de Inversi\u00f3n Social\u2014FHIS) in 1990. The fund created public works programs such as road maintenance and provided United States surplus food to mothers and infants. Many Hondurans slipped through that fragile social safety net. As a continuing part of the social pact, and even more as the result of a fierce union-government battle, President Callejas announced in 1991 a 27.8 percent increase over a minimum wage that the government had earlier agreed upon. That increase was in addition to raises of 50 and 22 percent set, respectively, in January and September 1990. Despite those concessions, the minimum daily rate in 1991 was only $1.75 for workers employed by small agricultural enterprises and $3.15 for workers in the big exporting concerns; most workers did not earn the minimum wage.\nLabor unions.\nHonduras has long been heavily unionized. In 1993 approximately 15 to 20 percent of the overall formal workforce was represented by some type of union, and about 40 percent of urban workers were union members. There were forty-eight strikes in the public sector alone in 1990, protesting the government's economic austerity program and layoffs of public-sector workers. More than 4,000 public-sector employees from the Ministry of Communications, Public Works, and Transport were fired in 1990. About 70,000 unionized workers remained in the faltering public sector at the beginning of 1991. However, the government largely made good its pledge to trim that number by 8,000 to 10,000 throughout 1991 as part of its austerity program.\nIn the private sector, 1990 saw 94 strikes in 64 firms, as workers fought for wage increases to combat inflation. A forty-two-day strike at the Tela Railroad Company (owned by Chiquita Brands International\u2014formerly United Brands and United Fruit Company) was unsuccessful, however, and that defeat temporarily ended union efforts at direct confrontation.\nIn 1993 Honduras had three major labor confederations: the Confederation of Honduran Workers (Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014CTH), claiming a membership of about 160,000 workers; the General Workers Central (Central General de Trabajadores\u2014CGT), claiming to represent 120,000 members; and the Unitary Confederation of Honduran Workers (Confederaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014CUTH), a new confederation formed in May 1992, with an estimated membership of about 30,000. The three confederations included numerous trade union federations, individual unions, and peasant organizations.\nThe CTH, the nation's largest trade confederation, was formed in 1964 by the nation's largest peasant organization, the National Association of Honduran Peasants (Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos de Honduras\u2014Anach), and by Honduran unions affiliated with the Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers (Organizaci\u00f3n Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores\u2014ORIT), a hemispheric labor organization with close ties to the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).\nIn the early 1990s, the confederation had three major components: the 45,000-member Federation of Unions of National Workers of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n Sindical de Trabajadores Nacionales de Honduras\u2014Fesitranh); the 22,000 member Central Federation of Honduran Free Trade Unions (Federaci\u00f3n Central de Sindicatos Libres de Honduras); and the 2,200-member Federation of National Maritime Unions of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n de Sindicales Mar\u00edtimas Nacionales de Honduras). In addition, Anach, claiming to represent between 60,000 and 80,000 members, was affiliated with Fesitranh.\nFesitranh was by far the country's most powerful labor federation, with most of its unions located in San Pedro Sula and the Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone. The unions of the United States-owned banana companies and the United States-owned petroleum refinery also were affiliated with Fesitranh. The CTH received support from foreign labor organizations, including ORIT, the American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), and Germany's Friedrich Ebert Foundation and was an affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).\nAlthough it was not legally recognized until 1982, the CGT was originally formed in 1970 by the Christian Democrats and received external support from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the Latin American Workers Central (Central Latinoamericana de Trabajadores\u2014CLAT), a regional organization supported by Christian Democratic parties. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, the CGT leadership developed close ties to the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras\u2014PNH), and several leaders served in the Callejas government. Another national peasant organization, the National Union of Peasants (Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos\u2014UNC), claiming a membership of 40,000, was affiliated with the CGT for many years and was a principal force within the confederation.\nThe CUTH was formed in May 1992 by two principal labor federations, the Unitary Federation of Honduran Workers (Federaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014FUTH) and the Independent Federation of Honduran Workers (Federaci\u00f3n Independiente de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014FITH), as well as several smaller labor groups, all critical of the Callejas government's neoliberal economic reform program.\nThe Marxist FUTH, with an estimated 16,000 members in the early 1990s, was first organized in 1980 by three communist-influenced unions, but did not receive legal status until 1988. The federation had external ties with the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the Permanent Congress for Latin American Workers Trade Union Unity (Congreso Permanente de Unidad Sindical de Trabajadores de Am\u00e9rica Latina\u2014CPUSTAL), and the Central American Committee of Trade Union Unity (Comit\u00e9 de Unidad Sindical de Centroam\u00e9rica\u2014CUSCA). Its affiliations included water utility, university, electricity company, brewery, and teacher unions, as well as several peasant organizations, including the National Central of Farm Workers (Central Nacional de Trabajadores del Campo\u2014CNTC), formed in 1985 and active in land occupations in the early 1980s.\nFUTH also became affiliated with a number of leftist popular organizations in a group known as the Coordinating Committee of Popular Organizations (Comit\u00e9 Coordinadora de las Organizaciones Populares\u2014CCOP) that was formed in 1984. Dissident FUTH member formed the FITH, which was granted legal status in 1988. The FITH consisted of fourteen unions claiming about 13,000 members in the early 1990s.\nAgriculture and land use.\nIn 2018, Honduras produced 5.5 million tons of sugar cane, 2.5 million tons of palm oil, 771 thousand tons of banana and 481 thousand tons of coffee, these being its main crops. In addition, it produced 704 thousand tons of maize, 261 thousand tons of orange, 293 thousand tons of melon, 127 thousand tons of beans and 81 thousand tons of pineapple, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products such as watermelon, potato, tomato, cabbage, grapefruit, sorghum etc.\nThe total land area of Honduras is 11.2\u00a0million hectares, of which a scant 1.7\u00a0million hectares (about 15 percent) are well suited for agriculture. Most land in Honduras is covered by mountains, giving rise to the country's nickname, \"the Tibet of Central America.\" Nevertheless, the Honduran economy has always depended almost exclusively on agriculture, and in 1992 agriculture was still the largest sector of the economy, contributing 28 percent to the GDP.\nLess than half of Honduras's cultivable land was planted with crops as recently as the mid-1980s. The rest was used for pastures or was forested and was owned by the government or the banana corporations. Potential for additional productivity from fallow land was questionable, however, because much of Honduras's soil lacks the thick volcanic ash found elsewhere in Central America. By 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land had been seriously eroded as a result of misuse by cattle ranchers and slash-and-burn squatters who planted unsuitable food crops.\nThe Honduran government and two banana companies\u2014Chiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company\u2014owned approximately 60 percent of Honduras's cultivable land in 1993. The banana companies acquired most of their landholdings in the early 20th century in return for building the railroads used to transport bananas from the interior to the coast. Much of their land remained unused because it lacked irrigation. Only about 14 percent of cultivated land was irrigated in 1987. Most land under cultivation in 1992 was planted in bananas, coffee, and specialized export crops such as melons and winter vegetables.\nAgricultural policy.\nThe agricultural sector's output showed little or no growth between 1970 and 1985. As a result of favorable weather and market conditions beginning in 1995, however, the agricultural sector grew at a rate of 2.6 percent annually, slightly above the average for Latin America during that period. Production of basic grains and coffee increased; the export price of bananas was high; and pork, poultry, and milk produced for the domestic market increased. Nontraditional fruits and vegetables also increased in value.\nHonduran agricultural production overall has tended to be low because the amount of crop yielded by a given amount of land has been low. For example, Honduran chocolate yields historically have been only about half those of Costa Rica. Instead of using improved techniques to increase the productivity of the land, Honduran farmers have merely expanded the hectarage under cultivation to produce more crops\u2014pushing their fields ever farther into the forests. Given the limited amount of good quality agricultural land, to begin with, that policy has resulted in continual deforestation and subsequent erosion. This reluctance to improve techniques, coupled with generally poor soil, a lack of credit, and poor infrastructure, has contributed to low production figures.\nLand reform.\nThe Honduran government nominally began to address inequitable land ownership in the early 1960s. Those efforts at reform focused on organizing rural cooperatives. About 1,500 hectares of government-owned land were distributed by the National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario\u2014INA) beginning in 1960.\nA military coup in 1963 resulted in an end to the land reform program. Lacking even modest government-directed land reforms, squatting became the primary means for poor people to gain land throughout the early 1970s. These actions spurred the government to institute new agrarian reforms in 1972 and 1975. Although all lands planted in export crops were exempted from reform, about 120,000 hectares were, nevertheless, divided among 35,000 poor families.\nBy 1975 the pendulum had swung back, and agrarian reform was all but halted. From 1975 through the 1980s, illegal occupations of unused land increased once again. The need for land reform was addressed mostly by laws directed at granting titles to squatters and other landholders, permitting them to sell their land or to use it as collateral for loans.\nDespite declarations by the Callejas government in 1989 of its intent to increasingly address social issues, including land tenure and other needs of small farmers, the early 1990s were jolted by increased conflicts between peasants and the Honduran security forces. Agricultural credit and government support increasingly favored export crop producers at the expense of producers of basic food crops.\nThe Honduran land reform process under President Callejas between 1989 and 1992 was directed primarily at large agricultural landowners. An agrarian pact, signed by landowners and peasant organizations in August 1990, remained underfunded and largely unimplemented. Furthermore, violence erupted as discharged members of the Honduran military forcibly tried to claim land that had already been awarded to the peasant organization Anach in 1976.\nIn May 1991, violence initiated by members of the Honduran military resulted in the deaths of eight farmers. To keep similar situations around the country from escalating into violence, the government promised to parcel out land belonging to the National Corporation for Investment (Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional de Inversiones\u2014Conadin). The government also pledged to return to peasants land that had been confiscated by the Honduran military in 1983.\nAn Agricultural Modernization Law, passed in 1992, accelerated land titling and altered the structure of land cooperatives formed in the 1960s. The law permitted cooperative members to break up their holdings into small personal plots that could be sold. As a result, some small banana producers suffering from economic hard times chose to sell their land to the giant banana producers. After an agreement was reached with the European Union (EU) to increase Honduras's banana quota to the EU, the large banana companies were avid for additional land for increased production to meet the anticipated new demand from Europe.\nTraditional crops.\nThroughout the 20th century, Honduras's agriculture has been dominated first by bananas and then to a lesser extent by coffee and sugar. In 1992, bananas and coffee together accounted for 50 percent of the value of Honduran exports and made the biggest contribution to the economy. Total banana sales were $287\u00a0million and total coffee sales amounted to $148\u00a0million. These figures are impressive yet reflect production losses suffered by banana producers and the withholding of coffee exports from the market in an effort to fight steep price declines.\nAnother major blow to Honduran agriculture came from Hurricane Mitch and its aftermath in 1998 and 1999. As of 2012 both industries are on the upswing. The banana industry is dominated by Chiquita and the Dole Food Company, two multinational corporations. The coffee industry, in contrast, offers better opportunities for small Honduran family farms to compete. Sugar has also been an important Honduran crop.\nChiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company now account for most Honduran banana production and exports. Honduras's traditional system of independent banana producers, who, as late as the 1980s, sold their crops to the international banana companies, was eroded in the 1990s. In the absence of policies designed to protect independent suppliers, economically strapped cooperatives began to sell land to the two large corporations.\nAlthough Honduran banana production is dominated by multinational giants, such is not the case with coffee, which is grown by about 55,000 mostly small producers. Coffee production in Honduras has been high despite relatively low independent yields because of the large numbers of producers. Honduras, in fact, consistently produced more than its international quota until growers began to withhold the crop in the 1980s in an attempt to stimulate higher prices. Despite the efforts of the growers, coffee prices plunged on the international market from a high of more than $2.25 per kilogram in the mid-1970s to less than $0.45 per kilogram in the early 1990s. As a result of the declining prices, coffee producers were becoming increasingly marginalized. With the aid of affordable loans from foreign investors, more and more Honduran coffee growers are learning to produce high-value organic coffee for today's economy.\nThe outlook for the sugar industry, which had boomed during the 1980s when Honduran producers were allowed to fill Nicaragua's sugar quota to the United States, seemed bleak in 1993. Restoration of the sugar quota to Nicaraguan growers has been a major blow to Honduras's small independent producers, who had added most of Nicaragua's quota to their own during the United States embargo of Nicaragua. Higher costs for imported fertilizers because of the devaluation of the lempira add to the problem.\nHonduran producers seek relief from a relatively low official price of 25 lempiras per kilogram of sugar by smuggling sugar across the borders to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where the support prices are higher. Sugar growers who can afford it have begun to diversify by growing pineapples and rice. Many independent sugar growers, like independent banana producers, have become indignant over the relatively high profits shown by refiners and exporters. Strikes by producers at harvest time in 1991 forced the closure of the Choluteca refinery for a short time but had little effect on the depressed long-term outlook for the industry.\nNontraditional crops.\nWhile the total value of export merchandise fell in 1990 and 1991 and had still not recovered in 1993 to its 1989 level, the overall agricultural sector output has grown somewhat because of growth in the sale of winter vegetables and shrimp. Nontraditional vegetables and fruit produced $23.8\u00a0million in export revenue in 1990, a figure that was almost double the 1983 figure. Nontraditional agricultural crops represented 4.8 percent of the value of total exports in 1990, compared to 2.8 percent in 1983.\nSome development experts argue that government protection of corn, bean, and rice production by small farmers is a futile effort in the long-term goal of poverty reduction. On the other hand, they see significant economic potential for nontraditional crops, if they are handled properly. Analysts also note, however, that Honduras is at a distinct disadvantage relative to its Central American neighbors because of its poor transportation system. Nontraditional exports require the ability to get fresh produce from the fields to distant markets rapidly.\nLivestock.\nIn the early 1980s, the cattle industry appeared to have the potential to be an important part of the Honduran economy. The Honduran cattle sector, however, never developed to the extent that it did in much of the rest of Central America. Cattle production grew steadily until 1980\u201381 but then declined sharply when profits fell because of high production costs. The small Honduran meat packing industry declined at the same time, and several meat packing plants closed. As late as 1987, livestock composed 16 percent of the value-added agricultural sector but the industry continued to decline. By 1991\u201392, beef exports accounted for only 2.9 percent of the value of total exports.\nSales of refrigerated meat were the third or fourth highest source of export earnings in the mid-1980s, but like other Honduran agricultural products, beef yields were among the lowest in Central America. As world prices fell and production costs, exacerbated by drought, rose, there was less incentive to raise cattle. For a period of time, cattle farmers illegally smuggled beef cattle to Guatemala and other neighboring countries where prices were higher, but the Honduran cattle sector never became competitive internationally. The two large banana companies have also owned large cattle ranches where they raised prime beef, but these large companies had the flexibility to change crops as the market demanded.\nHonduran dairy herds fared about the same as beef cattle, and Honduran milk yields were also among the lowest in Central America. The dairy industry was further handicapped by the difficulties of trying to transport milk over poor roads in a tropical country, as well as by stiff competition in the domestic market from subsidized foreign imports, mostly from the United States.\nFishing.\nHonduras significantly developed its shrimp industry during the 1980s and in the Latin American market was second only to Ecuador in shrimp exports by 1991. In 1992 shrimp and lobster jumped to 12 percent of export earnings. Shrimp contributed $97\u00a0million in export sales to the economy in 1992\u2014an increase of 33 percent over the previous year. The industry was dependent, however, on larvae imported from the United States to augment its unstable natural supply.\nTechnicians from Taiwan were contracted by large producers in 1991 to help develop laboratory larvae, but bitter feuds developed between independent shrimpers and the corporations. Local shrimpers charged that corporate methods were damaging the environment and destroying natural stock through destruction of the mangrove breeding swamps. Corporate shrimp farmers then began to move their operations farther inland, leaving local shrimpers to contend with diminished natural supplies on the mosquito-infested coast.\nForestry.\nAs in much of Central America, Honduras's once abundant forest resources have been badly squandered. In 1964 forests covered 6.8\u00a0million hectares, but by 1988 forested areas had declined to 5\u00a0million hectares. Honduras continued to lose about 3.6 percent of its remaining forests annually during the 1980s and early 1990s. The loss is attributable to several factors. Squatters have consistently used land suitable only for forests to grow scant yield food crops; large tracts have been cleared for cattle ranches; and the country has gravely mismanaged its timber resources, focusing far more effort on logging than on forestry management.\nThe government began an intensive forestry development program in 1974, supposedly intended to increase management of the sector and to prevent exploitation by foreign-owned firms. The Honduran Corporation for Forestry Development (Corporaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Desarrollo Forestal\u2014Cohdefor) was created in 1974, but it quickly developed into a corrupt monopoly for overseeing forest exports. Timber was mostly produced by private sawmills under contracts selectively granted by Cohdefor officials.\nOngoing wasteful practices and an unsustainable debt, which was contracted to build infrastructure, appear to have undercut most conservation efforts. The military-dominated governments contracted huge debt with the multilateral development agencies, then extracted timber to pay for it. Cohdefor generally granted licenses to private lumber companies with few demands for preservation, and it had little inclination or incentive to enforce the demands it did make.\nWith encouragement from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), the Honduran government began to decentralize Cohdefor beginning in 1985. Under the decentralization plan, regulatory responsibilities were transferred from the central government to mayors and other municipal officials on the assumption that local officials would provide better oversight. Despite decentralization and the sale of government assets, Cohdefor's remaining debt was $240\u00a0million in 1991. The government also assumed continued financial responsibility for the construction of a new airstrip in the area of timber extraction, upgrading facilities at Puerto Castilla and Puerto Lempira, and providing electricity at reduced prices to lumber concerns as part of the privatization package.\nMajor legislation was passed in 1992 to promote Honduran reforestation by making large tracts of state-owned land more accessible to private investors. The legislation also supplied subsidies for development of the sector. The same law provided for replanting mountainous regions of the country with pine to be used for fuel.\nNatural resources and energy.\nMining, the mainstay of the Honduran economy in the late 19th century, declined dramatically in importance in the 20th century. The New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company (NYHRMC) produced $60\u00a0million worth of gold and silver between 1882 and 1954 before discontinuing most of its operations.\nMining's contribution to the GDP steadily declined during the 1980s, to account for a 2 percent contribution in 1992. El Mochito mine in western Honduras, the largest mine in Central America, accounted for most mineral production. Ores containing gold, silver, lead, zinc, and cadmium were mined and exported to the United States and Europe for refining.\nMining exports will represent 293 million dollars in 2021. The NGO Fosdeh points out that mineral and hydrocarbon extraction is \"changing the geography\" of Honduras: with the mining concessions underway, the area earmarked for extraction could reach 5% of the national territory in the coming years.\nEnergy sources.\nHonduras has for many years relied on fuelwood and biomass (mostly waste products from agricultural production) to supply its energy needs. The country has never been a producer of petroleum and depends on imported oil to fill much of its energy needs. In 1991 Honduras consumed about of oil daily. Honduras spent about $143\u00a0million, or 13 percent of its total export earnings, to purchase oil in 1991. The country's one small refinery at Puerto Cort\u00e9s closed in 1993.\nVarious Honduran governments have done little to encourage oil exploration, although substantial oil deposits have long been suspected in the R\u00edo Sula valley and offshore along the Caribbean coast. An oil exploration consortium consisting of the Venezuelan state oil company, Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. (Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. or PDVSA), Cambria Oil, and Texaco expressed interest in the construction of a refinery at Puerto Castilla in 1993, with production aimed at the local market.\nGasolineras Uno is a Honduran gas stations company that has expanded its presence to include stores in most of Central America and in South America.\nFuelwood and biomass have traditionally met about 67 percent of the country's total energy demand; petroleum, 29 percent; and electricity, 4 percent. In 1987 Honduran households consumed approximately 60 percent of total energy used, transportation and agriculture used about 26 percent, and industry used about 14 percent. Food processing consumed about 50 percent of industrial sector energy, followed by petroleum and chemical manufacturing.\nElectric power.\nHonduran electrification is low and uneven relative to other countries in Latin America. The World Bank estimates that only about 36 percent of the Honduran population had access to electricity (20 percent of the rural population) in 1987. The country's total capacity in 1992 was 575 megawatts (MW), with 2,000 megawatt-hours produced. A mammoth hydroelectric plant, the 292-MW project at El Caj\u00f3n, began producing electricity in 1985 to help address the country's energy needs. The plant, however, soon became heavily indebted because of the government's electricity pricing policies (not charging public-sector institutions, for example) and because of the appointment of political cronies as top management officials. El Caj\u00f3n also developed costly structural problems requiring extensive maintenance and repairs.\nOfficials estimated that the government's decision to provide free service to public-sector institutions contributed to a 23 percent increase in public sector consumption in 1990. Experts estimated that additional electrical generation capacity would likely be needed to keep pace with demand. The Honduran Congress assumed authority for setting electric prices beginning in 1986 but then became reluctant to increase rates. Under pressure from the World Bank, it did agree to a 60 percent increase in 1990, with additional increases in 1991. To offset these increased rates for residential users, the National Congress initiated a system of direct subsidies that ran through 1992.\nSecondary and tertiary industries.\nManufacturing.\nThe country's manufacturing sector was small, contributing only 15 percent to the total GDP in 1992. Textile exports, primarily to the US, led the Honduran manufacturing sector. The maquiladora, or assembly industry, was a growth industry in the generally bleak economy. Asian-owned firms dominated the sector, with twenty-one South Korean-owned companies in export processing zones located in the R\u00edo Sula valley in 1991.\nThe maquiladoras employed approximately 16,000 workers in 1991; another nine firms opened in 1992. Job creation, in fact, is considered to be the primary contribution of the assembly operations to the domestic economy. The export textile manufacturing industry all but wiped out small, Honduran manufacturers, and food processors, whose goods were historically aimed at the domestic market, were also adversely affected.\nThe small Honduran firms could not begin to compete with the assembly industry for labor because of the maquiladoras' relatively high wage scale of close to $4 per day. Small firms also found it increasingly difficult to meet the high cost of mostly imported inputs. Membership in the Honduran Association of Small and Medium Industry (Asociaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Empresas Peque\u00f1as y Medianas) declined by 70 percent by 1991, compared to pre-maquiladora days, foreshadowing the likely demise of most of the small shops.\nHonduran domestic manufacturers also suffered from increased Central American competition resulting from a trade liberalization pact signed in May 1991 by Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Overall, the Honduran manufacturing sector has mimicked other sectors of the economy\u2014it is mostly noncompetitive, even in a regional context, because of insufficient credit and the high cost of inputs. Relatively high interest rates and a complicated investment law have also inhibited the foreign-dominated manufacturing sector from taking off.\nThe government-sponsored Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone was opened in 1976. By 1990 an additional five free zones were in operation in Omoa, Coloma, Tela, La Ceiba, and Amapala. A series of privately run Export Processing Zones were also established in competition with the government-sponsored free zones. These privately run zones offered the same standard import-export incentives as the government zones. Most of the government and privately run zones were located along the Caribbean coast in a newly developing industrial belt.\nFirms operating outside of the special \"enterprise zones\" (either privately run, export-processing zones or government sponsored free zones) enjoy many of the same benefits as those operating within the zones. The Honduran Temporary Import Law permits companies that export 100 percent of their production to countries outside the CACM countries to hold ten-year exemptions on corporate income taxes and duty-free import of industrial inputs.\nAnalysts continue to debate the actual benefits of the shift away from the import-substitution industrialization (ISI) policies of the 1960s and 1970s toward a new focus on free zones and assembly industries in the 1990s. Critics point to the apparent lack of commitment by foreign manufactures to any one country site or to the creation of permanent infrastructure and employment. They question whether new employment will be enough to offset the loss of jobs in the more traditional manufacturing sector. A value of $195\u00a0million to the Honduran economy from assembly industries in 1991\u2014when the value of clothing exports was greater than that of coffee\u2014was a compelling argument in favor of the shift, however.\nConstruction.\nHigh interests rates, particularly for housing, continued to hurt the Honduran construction industry in 1993, but danger from high rates was partially offset by some public-sector investment. Privatization of formerly state-owned industries through debt swaps also negatively affected construction as prices for basic materials such as cement increased and credit tightened. A major devaluation of the lempira added to the already high cost of construction imports. Construction contributed 6.0 percent to the GDP in 1992.\nBanking.\nThe Honduran financial sector is small in comparison to the banking systems of its neighbors. After 1985, however, the sector began to grow rapidly. The average annual growth rate of value added to the economy from the financial sector for the 1980s was the second-highest in Latin America, averaging 4 percent. By 1985 Honduras had twenty-five financial institutions with 300 branch offices. Honduran commercial banks held 60 percent of the financial system's assets in 1985 and nearly 75 percent of all deposits. With the exception of the Armed Forces Social Security Institute, all commercial banks were privately owned, and most were owned by Honduran families. In 1985 there were two government-owned development banks in Honduras, one specializing in agricultural credit and the other providing financing to municipal governments.\nAt the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, Honduras began a process of financial liberalization in 1990. The process began with the freeing of agricultural loan rates and was quickly followed by the freeing of loan rates in other sectors. Beginning in late 1991, Honduran banks were allowed to charge market rates for agricultural loans if they were using their own funds. By law, the banks had to report their rates to monetary authorities and could fix rates within two points of the announced rate.\nIn 1991 commercial banks pressured the government to reduce their 35 percent minimum reserve ratio. This rate remained standard until June 1993 when the minimum requirement was temporarily lifted to 42 percent. The rate was dropped to 36 percent three months later. The banks had excess reserves, and lending rates were in the area of 26 to 29 percent, with few borrowers. Prior to liberalization measures, the Central Bank of Honduras (Banco Central de Honduras) maintained interest rate controls, setting a 19 percent ceiling, with the market lending rate hovering around 26 percent in late 1991. With inflation hitting 33 percent in 1990, there was, in fact, a negative real interest rate, but this situation reversed in 1991 when rates were high relative to inflation. Rates of 35 to 43 percent in 1993 were well above the inflation rate of 13 to 14 percent. Bankers argued for further liberalization, including easing of controls in the housing and nonexport agricultural sectors.\nA Honduran stock exchange was established in August 1990 with transactions confined to trading debt. Nine companies were registered with the exchange in 1991; in 1993 this number had grown to eighteen. It appears doubtful, however, that the market will develop fully, given the reluctance of family-held firms to open their books to public scrutiny.\nTourism.\nForeign tourists are attracted to Honduras by the Mayan ruins in Cop\u00e1n and coral reef skin-diving off the Islas de la Bah\u00eda (Bay Islands). Poor infrastructure, however, has discouraged the development of substantial international tourism. Despite these problems, the number of visitors arriving in Honduras rose from fewer than 200,000 in 1987 to almost 250,000 in 1989. Small ecotourism projects, in particular, are considered to have significant potential.\nTrade.\nIn the early 1990s, the United States was by far Honduras's leading trading partner, with Japan a distant second. United States exports to Honduras in 1992 were valued at US$533\u00a0million, about 54 percent of the country's total imports of $983\u00a0million. Most of the rest of Honduras's imports come from its Central American neighbors. Despite its status as a beneficiary of both the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)--both of which confer duty-free status on Honduran imports to the United States\u2014Honduras has run a long-standing trade deficit with the United States.\nTotal exports of goods and services by Honduras in 1992 was $843\u00a0million, of which about 52 percent went to the United States. The current amount exported by Honduras as of 2017 is $8.675 billion (USD$), with 34.5% of the said exports now going to the United States.\nLinkages to the United States.\nAs with most Latin American countries, Honduras's economy is closely tied to the US. The US is Honduras's primary trading partner and the source of about two-thirds of the country's foreign direct investment.\nUS multinationals Dole Food Company and Chiquita control a large portion of Honduras's agricultural exports. Presently, Honduras participates alongside the Rainforest Alliance for the exporting of agricultural goods to the US.\nHondurans working in the US send more than $2\u00a0billion each year to their families in Honduras; these remittances account for 28.2% of Honduras's GDP (2007 information\nForeign investment.\nWith the exception of relatively recent, Asian-dominated investment in assembly firms along Honduras's northern coast, the country remains heavily dependent on United States-based multinational corporations for most of its investment needs in the early 1990s. Overall investment as a percentage of GDP declined dramatically during the 1980s, from about 25 percent in 1980 to a meager 15 percent in 1990. Dole Food Company and Chiquita Brands International together have invested heavily in Honduran industries as diverse as breweries and plastics, cement, soap, cans, and shoes.\nAs Honduras enters the 1990s, it faces challenging economic problems. The solutions relied on in the past\u2014traditional export crops, the maquiladora assembly industry, and the 1980s' development schemes\u2014appear unlikely to provide enough new jobs for a rapidly growing population. The major economic challenge for Honduras over the next decade will be to find dependable sources of sustainable economic growth.\nStatistics.\nThe slowed rate of growth in 2008 (4%, vs. 6.3% in 2007) reflected the general downturn in the world economy that year. The \"Banco Central de Honduras\" (central bank) named the debilitation of global demand, and loss of dynamism in final consumer demand, as important factors in the slowing of Honduras's economic growth in 2008.\nThe table here shows the slowing of growth in 2008 versus 2007 in various economies.\nWorld development indicators.\nThe above graph reflects Honduras performance in the World Development Indicators since 2008 up to 2013.

In 1831 the Military School was created with a seat at the San Francisco Barracks, and Colonel Narciso Ben\u00edtez of Colombian origin was appointed director; From this school graduated: Francisco Moraz\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Antonio M\u00e1rquez, Diego Vigil, Liberato Moncada, Joaqu\u00edn Rivera and Jos\u00e9 Santos Guardiola who were presidents of Honduras, among others.\nThe first weaponry used was flintlock and gunpowder, the product of mixing sulfur, saltpeter, and coal in relative quantities: the Remington single-load rifle was one of the first bullet rifles that were introduced into the country during the government of General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Medina.\nMid 19th century.\nThe second stage of the Armed Forces is between the years 1842 and 1876 when the collective uniform emerged in the mid-1840s when the troops of General Jos\u00e9 Santos Guardiola faced those of General Nicol\u00e1s \u00c1ngulo, in 1845 in the \" Combate del Obrajuelo \", in San Miguel, El Salvador.\nIn 1865 the first attempt was made to organize a Naval Force with its respective regulations; however, the cost of this service made it unsustainable; However, there were several attempts to reactivate the idea and one of them was carried out by Doctor Policarpo Bonilla, who ordered the construction of the Tatumbla steamship in the Kiel shipyard, Germany on November 22, 1895, and then in 1896 respectively, General Manuel Bonilla had the 'Hornet built. While he administered Honduras, the Doctor and General Don Tiburcio Carias Andino also ordered the construction of the steamers B\u00fafalo and El Tigre. On January 1, 1881, the first Military Code of the Honduran army was issued, a legal instrument to govern its own organization.\n20th century.\nDuring the twentieth century, Honduran military leaders frequently became presidents, either through elections or by coups d'\u00e9tat. General Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino was elected in 1932, he later on called a constituent assembly that allowed him to be reelected, and his rule became more authoritarian until an election in 1948.\nDuring the following decades, the military of Honduras carried out several coups d'\u00e9tat, starting in October 1955. General Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano carried out the next coup in October 1963 and a second in December 1972, followed by coups in 1975 by Juan Alberto Melgar Castro and in 1978 by Policarpo Paz Garc\u00eda.\n1980s.\nEvents during the 1980s in El Salvador and Nicaragua led Honduras \u2013 with US assistance \u2013 to expand its armed forces considerably, laying particular emphasis on its air force, which came to include a squadron of US-provided F-5s.\nThe military unit Battalion 316 carried out political assassinations and the torture of suspected political opponents of the government during this same period. Battalion members received training and support from the United States Central Intelligence Agency, in Honduras, at U.S. military bases and in Chile during the presidency of the dictator Augusto Pinochet. Amnesty International estimated that at least 184 people \"disappeared\" from 1980 to 1992 in Honduras, most likely due to actions of the Honduran military.\n1990s.\nThe resolution of the civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and across-the-board budget cuts made in all ministries, has brought reduced funding for the Honduran Armed Forces. The abolition of the draft has created staffing gaps in the now all-volunteer armed forces. The military is now far below its authorized strength, and further reductions are expected. In January 1999, the Constitution was amended to abolish the position of military Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, thus codifying civilian authority over the Military.\n2000s.\nSince 2002, soldiers have been involved in crime prevention and law enforcement, patrolling the streets of the major cities alongside the national police.\n2009.\nOn 28 June 2009, in the context of a constitutional crisis, the Military, acting on orders of the Supreme Court of Justice, arrested the President Manuel Zelaya, after which they forcibly removed elected President Zelaya from Honduras. See the article 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis regarding claims regarding legitimacy and illegitimacy of the event, and events preceding and following the removal of Zelaya from Honduras.\nThe military's chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza Membre\u00f1o, made public statements regarding the removal of Zelaya. On June 30, he showed a detention order, apparently signed June 26 by a Supreme Court judge, which ordered the armed forces to detain the president. Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order: \"In the moment that we took him out of the country, in the way that he was taken out, there is a crime. Because of the circumstances of the moment this crime occurred, there is going to be a justification and cause for acquittal that will protect us.\" He said the decision was taken by the military leadership \"in order to avoid bloodshed\".\nFollowing the 2009 ouster of the president, the Honduran military together with other government security forces were allegedly responsible for thousands of allegedly arbitrary detentions and for several forced disappearances and extrajudicial executions of opponents to the \"de facto\" government, including members of the Democratic Unification Party. However, evidence about these actions has yet to be provided and there has been some questioning in local media about the actual perpetrators, suggesting that they could actually be related to disputes within the leftists organizations themselves.\nArmy.\nThe Honduran Army () is the land service branch of the Armed Forces of Honduras.\nAir Force.\nThe FAH operates from four air bases located at:\nWith the exception of Soto Cano Air Base, all other air bases operate as dual civil and military aviation facilities.\nAdditionally, three air stations are located at:\nAlso a radar station operates at:\nNavy.\nThe Navy is a small force dealing with coastal and riverine security.\nThe Navy has 71 patrol boats, interceptors and landing craft units.\nThe Honduran navy has 4 naval bases:\nAdditionally, the Honduran navy has the following unit and schools:\nMilitary-civilian relations and leadership.\nAccording to a statement in July 2009 by a legal counsel of the Honduras military, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza, part of the elite Honduran Military generals were opposed to President Manuel Zelaya, whom the Military had removed from Honduras via a military Coup d'\u00e9tat, because of his left-wing politics. Inestroza stated, \"It would be difficult for us [the military], with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible.\"\nThe current Head of the Armed Forces is Carlos Antonio Cu\u00e9llar, graduate of the General Francisco Morazan Military Academy and the School of the Americas. In January 2011, the General Rene Arnoldo Osorio Canales, former Head of the Presidential Honor Guard, was appointed Commander.\nAs of 2012 the Honduran Military has the highest military expenditures of all Central America. They have 52,225 troops in their Army, they have 16,500 troops in their Air Force, and 5,300 troops in their Navy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated on China's southern coast just south of Shenzhen, it consists of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. With 7.5 million residents in a territory, Hong Kong is the fourth-most densely populated region in the world.\nHong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing dynasty ceded Hong Kong Island in 1841\u20131842 as a consequence of losing the First Opium War. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 and was further extended when the United Kingdom obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. Hong Kong was occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II. The territory was handed over from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of one country, two systems.\nOriginally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages, Hong Kong is now one of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports. Hong Kong is the world's third-ranked global financial centre behind New York City and London, ninth-largest exporter, and eighth-largest importer. Its currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is the in the world. Home to the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, Hong Kong has the second largest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals. The city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, although severe income inequality still exists among the population. Hong Kong is the city with the most skyscrapers in the world, even though its housing is consistently in high demand.\nHong Kong is a highly developed territory and has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.955, ranking eighth in the world and currently the only place in Asia to be in the top ten. The city has the highest life expectancy in the world, and a public transport usage exceeding 90 per cent.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe name of the territory, first romanised as \"He-Ong-Kong\" in 1780, originally referred to a small inlet located between Aberdeen Island and the southern coast of Hong Kong Island. Aberdeen was an initial point of contact between British sailors and local fishermen. Although the source of the romanised name is unknown, it is generally believed to be an early phonetic rendering of the Cantonese (or Tanka Cantonese) phrase \"h\u0113ung g\u00f3ng\". The name translates as \"fragrant harbour\" or \"incense harbour\". \"Fragrant\" may refer to the sweet taste of the harbour's freshwater influx from the Pearl River or to the odour from incense factories lining the coast of northern Kowloon. The incense was stored near Aberdeen Harbour for export before Victoria Harbour was developed. Sir John Davis (the second colonial governor) offered an alternative origin; Davis said that the name derived from \"Hoong-keang\" (\"red torrent\"), reflecting the colour of soil over which a waterfall on the island flowed.\nThe simplified name \"Hong Kong\" was frequently used by 1810. The name was also commonly written as the single word \"Hongkong\" until 1926, when the government officially adopted the two-word name. Some corporations founded during the early colonial era still keep this name, including Hongkong Land, Hongkong Electric Company, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).\nHistory.\nPrehistory and Imperial China.\nEarliest known human traces in what is now called Hong Kong are dated by some to 35,000 and 39,000 years ago during the Paleolithic period. The claim is based on an archaeological investigation in Wong Tei Tung, Sai Kung in 2003. The archaeological works revealed knapped stone tools from deposits that were dated using optical luminescence dating.\nDuring the Middle Neolithic period, about 6,000 years ago, the region had been widely occupied by humans. Neolithic to Bronze Age Hong Kong settlers were semi-coastal people. Early inhabitants are believed to be Austronesians in the Middle Neolithic period and later the Yue people. As hinted by the archaeological works in Sha Ha, Sai Kung, rice cultivation had been introduced since Late Neolithic period. Bronze Age Hong Kong featured coarse pottery, hard pottery, quartz and stone jewelry, as well as small bronze implements.\nThe Qin dynasty incorporated the Hong Kong area into China for the first time in 214 BCE, after conquering the indigenous Baiyue. The region was consolidated under the Nanyue kingdom (a predecessor state of Vietnam) after the Qin collapse and recaptured by China after the Han conquest. During the Mongol conquest of China in the 13th century, the Southern Song court was briefly located in modern-day Kowloon City (the Sung Wong Toi site) before its final defeat in the 1279 Battle of Yamen by the Yuan Dynasty. By the end of the Yuan dynasty, seven large families had settled in the region and owned most of the land. Settlers from nearby provinces migrated to Kowloon throughout the Ming dynasty.\nThe earliest known European visitor was Portuguese explorer Jorge \u00c1lvares, who arrived in 1513. Portuguese merchants established a trading post called Tam\u00e3o in Hong Kong waters and began regular trade with southern China. Although the traders were expelled after military clashes in the 1520s, Portuguese-Chinese trade relations were re-established by 1549. Portugal acquired a permanent lease for Macau in 1887.\nAfter the Qing conquest, maritime trade was banned under the \"Haijin\" policies. From 1661 to 1683, the population of most of the area forming present day Hong Kong was cleared under the Great Clearance, turning the region into a wasteland. The Kangxi Emperor lifted the maritime trade prohibition, allowing foreigners to enter Chinese ports in 1684. Qing authorities established the Canton System in 1757 to regulate trade more strictly, restricting non-Russian ships to the port of Canton. Although European demand for Chinese commodities like tea, silk, and porcelain was high, Chinese interest in European manufactured goods was insignificant, so that Chinese goods could only be bought with precious metals. To reduce the trade imbalance, the British sold large amounts of Indian opium to China. Faced with a drug crisis, Qing officials pursued ever more aggressive actions to halt the opium trade.\nBritish colony.\nIn 1839, the Daoguang Emperor rejected proposals to legalise and tax opium and ordered imperial commissioner Lin Zexu to eradicate the opium trade. The commissioner destroyed opium stockpiles and halted all foreign trade, triggering a British military response and the First Opium War. The Qing surrendered early in the war and ceded Hong Kong Island in the Convention of Chuenpi. British forces began controlling Hong Kong shortly after the signing of the convention, from 26 January 1841. However, both countries were dissatisfied and did not ratify the agreement. After more than a year of further hostilities, Hong Kong Island was formally ceded to the United Kingdom in the 1842 Treaty of Nanking.\nAdministrative infrastructure was quickly built by early 1842, but piracy, disease, and hostile Qing policies initially prevented the government from attracting commerce. Conditions on the island improved during the Taiping Rebellion in the 1850s, when many Chinese refugees, including wealthy merchants, fled mainland turbulence and settled in the colony. Further tensions between the British and Qing over the opium trade escalated into the Second Opium War. The Qing were again defeated and forced to give up Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island in the Convention of Peking. By the end of this war, Hong Kong had evolved from a transient colonial outpost into a major entrep\u00f4t. Rapid economic improvement during the 1850s attracted foreign investment, as potential stakeholders became more confident in Hong Kong's future.\nThe colony was further expanded in 1898 when the United Kingdom obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories. The University of Hong Kong was established in 1911 as the territory's first institution of higher education. Kai Tak Airport began operation in 1924, and the colony avoided a prolonged economic downturn after the 1925\u201326 Canton\u2013Hong Kong strike. At the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Governor Geoffry Northcote declared Hong Kong a neutral zone to safeguard its status as a free port. The colonial government prepared for a possible attack, evacuating all British women and children in 1940. The Imperial Japanese Army attacked Hong Kong on 8 December 1941, the same morning as its attack on Pearl Harbor. Hong Kong was occupied by Japan for almost four years before the British resumed control on 30 August 1945.\nIts population rebounded quickly after the war, as skilled Chinese migrants fled from the Chinese Civil War and more refugees crossed the border when the Chinese Communist Party took control of mainland China in 1949. Hong Kong became the first of the Four Asian Tiger economies to industrialise during the 1950s. With a rapidly increasing population, the colonial government attempted reforms to improve infrastructure and public services. The public-housing estate programme, Independent Commission Against Corruption, and Mass Transit Railway were all established during the post-war decades to provide safer housing, integrity in the civil service, and more reliable transportation.\nNevertheless, widespread public discontent resulted in multiple protests from the 1950s to 1980s, including pro-Republic of China and pro-Chinese Communist Party protests. In the 1967 Hong Kong riots, pro-PRC protestors clashed with the British colonial government. As many as 51 were killed and 802 were injured in the violence, including dozens killed by the Royal Hong Kong Police via beatings and shootings.\nAlthough the territory's competitiveness in manufacturing gradually declined because of rising labour and property costs, it transitioned to a service-based economy. By the early 1990s, Hong Kong had established itself as a global financial centre and shipping hub.\nChinese special administrative region.\nThe colony faced an uncertain future as the end of the New Territories lease approached, and Governor Murray MacLehose raised the question of Hong Kong's status with Deng Xiaoping in 1979. Diplomatic negotiations with China resulted in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which the United Kingdom agreed to the handover of the colony in 1997 and China would guarantee Hong Kong's economic and political systems for 50 years after the handover. The impending handover triggered a wave of mass emigration as residents feared an erosion of civil rights, the rule of law, and quality of life. Over half a million people left the territory during the peak migration period, from 1987 to 1996. The Legislative Council became a fully elected legislature for the first time in 1995 and extensively expanded its functions and organisations throughout the last years of the colonial rule. The handover of Hong Kong to China was at midnight on 1 July 1997, after 156 years of British rule.\nImmediately after the handover, Hong Kong was severely affected by several crises. The Hong Kong government was forced to use substantial foreign exchange reserves to maintain the Hong Kong dollar's currency peg during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the recovery from this was muted by an H5N1 avian-flu outbreak and a housing surplus. This was followed by the 2003 SARS epidemic, during which the territory experienced its most serious economic downturn.\nChinese communists portrayed the return of Hong Kong as a key moment in the PRC's rise to great power status.51\nPolitical debates after the handover have centred around the region's democratic development and the Chinese central government's adherence to the \"one country, two systems\" principle. After reversal of the last colonial era Legislative Council democratic reforms following the handover, the regional government unsuccessfully attempted to enact national security legislation pursuant to Article 23 of the Basic Law. The central government decision to implement nominee pre-screening before allowing chief executive elections triggered a series of protests in 2014 which became known as the Umbrella Revolution. Discrepancies in the electoral registry and disqualification of elected legislators after the 2016 Legislative Council elections and enforcement of national law in the West Kowloon high-speed railway station raised further concerns about the region's autonomy. In June 2019, mass protests erupted in response to a proposed extradition amendment bill permitting the extradition of fugitives to mainland China. The protests are the largest in Hong Kong's history, with organisers claiming to have attracted more than three million Hong Kong residents.\nFollowing the 2019 protests.\nThe Hong Kong regional government and Chinese central government responded to the protests with a number of administrative measures to quell dissent. In June 2020, the Legislative Council passed the National Anthem Ordinance, which criminalised \"insults to the national anthem of China\". The Chinese central government meanwhile enacted the Hong Kong national security law to help quell protests in the region. Nine months later, in March 2021, the Chinese central government introduced amendments to Hong Kong's electoral system, which included the reduction of directly elected seats in the Legislative Council and the requirement that all candidates be vetted and approved by a Beijing-appointed Candidate Eligibility Review Committee.\nIn May 2023, the Legislative Council also introduced legislation to reduce the number of directly elected seats in the district councils, and a District Council Eligibility Review Committee was similarly established to vet candidates.\nIn terms of international connectedness, as of 2024, the city was one of eight worldwide that was classified as an \"Alpha+\" city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\nGovernment and politics.\nHong Kong is a special administrative region of China, with executive, legislative, and judicial powers devolved from the national government. The Sino-British Joint Declaration provided for economic and administrative continuity through the handover, resulting in an executive-led governing system largely inherited from the territory's history as a British colony. Under these terms and the \"one country, two systems\" principle, the Basic Law of Hong Kong is the regional constitution. The regional government is composed of three branches:\nThe chief executive is the head of government and serves for a maximum of two five-year terms. The State Council (led by the Premier of China) appoints the chief executive after nomination by the Election Committee, which is composed of 1500 business, community, and government leaders.\nThe Legislative Council has 90 members, each serving a four-year term. Twenty are directly elected from geographical constituencies, thirty represent functional constituencies (FC), and forty are chosen by an election committee consisting of representatives appointed by the Chinese central government. Thirty FC councillors are selected from limited electorates representing sectors of the economy or special interest groups. Geographical constituency elected members are chosen by single non-transferable vote (SNTV), yielding two candidates per GC. The 30 limited electorate functional constituencies fill their seats using first-past-the-post or instant-runoff voting.\nTwenty-two political parties had representatives elected to the Legislative Council in the 2016 election. These parties have aligned themselves into three ideological groups: the pro-Beijing camp (the current government), the pro-democracy camp, and localist groups. The Chinese Communist Party does not have an official political presence in Hong Kong, and its members do not run in local elections. Hong Kong is represented in the National People's Congress by 36 deputies chosen through an electoral college and 203 delegates in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference appointed by the central government.\nThere are major differences between the legal system of Hong Kong and rest of China. Its judicial system is based on common law, continuing the legal tradition established during British rule. Local courts may refer to precedents set in English law and overseas jurisprudence. However, mainland criminal procedure law applies to cases investigated by the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR. Interpretative and amending power over the Basic Law and jurisdiction over acts of state lie with the central authority, making regional courts ultimately subordinate to the mainland's socialist civil law system. Decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress override any territorial judicial process.&lt;ref name=\"HCAL185/2016\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in circumstances where the Standing Committee declares a state of emergency in Hong Kong, the State Council may enforce national law in the region.\nThe territory's jurisdictional independence is most apparent in its immigration and taxation policies. The Immigration Department issues passports for permanent residents which differ from those of the mainland or Macau, and the region maintains a regulated border with the rest of the country. All travellers between Hong Kong and mainland China and Macau must pass through border controls, regardless of nationality. Mainland Chinese residents do not have right of abode in Hong Kong and are subject to immigration controls. Public finances are handled separately from the national government; taxes levied in Hong Kong do not fund the central authority.\nThe Hong Kong Garrison of the People's Liberation Army is responsible for the region's defence. Although the Chairman of the Central Military Commission is supreme commander of the armed forces, the regional government may request assistance from the garrison. Hong Kong residents are not required to perform military service, and current law has no provision for local enlistment, so its defence is composed entirely of non-Hongkongers.\nThe central government and Ministry of Foreign Affairs handle diplomatic matters, but Hong Kong retains the ability to maintain separate economic and cultural relations with foreign nations. The territory actively participates in the World Trade Organization, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the International Olympic Committee, and many United Nations agencies. The regional government maintains trade offices in Greater China and other nations.\nThe imposition of the Hong Kong national security law by the central government in Beijing in June 2020 resulted in the suspension of bilateral extradition treaties by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, and Ireland. The United States ended its preferential economic and trade treatment of Hong Kong in July 2020 because it was no longer able to distinguish Hong Kong as a separate entity from the People's Republic of China. In 2024, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council to grant officials the power to prosecute crimes such as treason and insurrection. Critics state that this expansion will give more powers to crack down on opposition to the central government of China and the Hong Kong government as well as strike a lasting blow to the partial autonomy the city had been promised by China in the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\nAdministrative divisions.\nHong Kong's administrative divisions are divided into three levels: Areas (\u5340\u57df), Districts (\u5730\u5340), and Sub-districts (\u5206\u5340). Hong Kong is administratively divided into three areas: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. They are further divided into 18 districts. The area of Hong Kong Island has four districts, the area of Kowloon has five districts, and the area of the New Territories has nine districts. Each district is represented by a district council. The district councils advise the government on local issues such as public facility provisioning, community programme maintenance, cultural promotion, and environmental policy.\nAs of 2024,[ [update]] there are a total of 470 district council seats, 88 of which are directly elected. In May 2023, the government proposed reforms to the District Council electoral system which further cut the number of directly elected seats from 452 to 88, and total seats from 479 to 470. A requirement that district council candidates be vetted and approved by the District Council Eligibility Review Committee was also proposed. The Legislative Council approved the reforms in July 2023.\nPolitical reforms and sociopolitical issues.\nHong Kong is governed by a hybrid regime that is not fully representative of the population. Legislative Council members elected by functional constituencies composed of professional and special interest groups are accountable to these narrow corporate electorates and not the general public. This electoral arrangement has guaranteed a pro-Beijing camp majority in the legislature since the handover. Similarly, the chief executive is selected by establishment politicians and corporate members of the Election Committee rather than directly elected. Despite universal suffrage being established as ultimate goals for the election of the chief executive and all members of the Legislative Council in Articles 45 and 68 of the basic law, the legislature is only partially directly elected, and the executive continues to be nominated by an unrepresentative body. The government has been repeatedly petitioned to introduce direct elections for these positions, but has not introduced these direct elections as of 2024.\nEthnic minorities (except those of European ancestry) have marginal representation in government and often experience discrimination in housing, education, and employment. Employment vacancies and public service appointments frequently have language requirements which minority job seekers do not meet, and language education resources remain inadequate for Chinese learners. Foreign domestic helpers, mostly women from the Philippines and Indonesia, have little protection under regional law. Although they live and work in Hong Kong, these workers are not treated as ordinary residents and do not have the right of abode in the territory. Sex trafficking is also an issue, local, mainland Chinese, and foreign women have been trafficked for sex in brothels, homes, and businesses in the city.\nThe Joint Declaration guarantees the Basic Law of Hong Kong for 50 years after the handover. It does not specify how Hong Kong will be governed after 2047, and the central government's role in determining the territory's future system of government is the subject of political debate and speculation. Hong Kong's political and judicial systems may be integrated with China's at that time, or the territory may continue to be administered separately. However, in response to large-scale protests in 2019 and 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the controversial Hong Kong national security law. The law criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign elements and establishes the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR, an investigative office under Central People's Government authority immune from HKSAR jurisdiction. Some of the aforementioned acts were previously considered protected speech under Hong Kong law. The United Kingdom considers the law to be a serious violation of the Joint Declaration. In October 2020, the Hong Kong Police arrested seven pro-democracy politicians over tussles with pro-Beijing politicians in the Legislative Council in May. They were charged with contempt and interfering with members of the council, while none of the pro-Beijing lawmakers were detained. Annual commemorations of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre were also cancelled amidst fears of violating the national security law. In March 2021, the Chinese central government unilaterally changed Hong Kong's electoral system and established the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee, which would be tasked with screening and evaluating political candidates for their \"patriotism\", effectively crushing the remainder of the pro-democracy camp.\nIn February 2024, Xia Baolong, the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said that the \"one country, two systems\" principle would be kept permanently.\nGeography.\nHong Kong is on China's southern coast, east of Macau, on the east side of the mouth of the Pearl River estuary. It is surrounded by the South China Sea on all sides except the north, which neighbours the Guangdong city of Shenzhen along the Sham Chun River. The territory's area (2,754.97\u00a0km2 if the maritime area is included) consists of Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula, the New Territories, Lantau Island, and over 200 other islands. Of the total area, is land and is water. The territory's highest point is Tai Mo Shan, above sea level. Urban development is concentrated on the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong Island, and in new towns throughout the New Territories. Much of this is built on reclaimed land; (6% of the total land or about 25% of developed space in the territory) is reclaimed from the sea.\nUndeveloped terrain is hilly to mountainous, with very little flat land, and consists mostly of grassland, woodland, shrubland, or farmland. About 40% of the remaining land area is country parks and nature reserves. The territory has a diverse ecosystem; over 3,000 species of vascular plants occur in the region (300 of which are native to Hong Kong), and thousands of insect, avian, and marine species.\nClimate.\nHong Kong has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cwa\"), characteristic of southern China, despite being located south of the Tropic of Cancer, although closely bordering on a tropical climate. Summers are long, hot and humid, with occasional showers and thunderstorms and warm air from the southwest. The humid nature of Hong Kong exacerbates the warmth of summer. Typhoons occur most often then, sometimes resulting in floods or landslides. Also rarely occurring are waterspouts and tornadoes, which occurred at Hong Kong International Airport on 26 September 2020 and at Victoria Harbour on 28 September 2024. Winters are short, mild and usually sunny at the beginning, becoming cloudy towards February. Frequent cold fronts bring strong, cooling winds from the north and occasionally result in chilly weather. Autumn is the sunniest season, whilst spring is generally cloudy. Snowfall has been extremely rare in Hong Kong; the last reported instance was on Tai Mo Shan in 1975. Hong Kong averages 1,709 hours of sunshine per year. Historic temperature extremes at the Hong Kong Observatory are on 22 August 2017 and on 18 January 1893, record highest daily minimum temperature there was on 18 August 1990 and the lowest daily maximum temperature there was on 16 January 1893. The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in all of Hong Kong are at Wetland Park on 22 August 2017, and at Tai Mo Shan on 24 January 2016.\nEnvironment.\nAir pollution in Hong Kong is considered a serious problem. It became a concern soon after the start of 2000s. According to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), the major air pollutants in Hong Kong include nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), respirable suspended particulates (RSP or PM10), fine suspended particulates (FSP or PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone and lead.\nArchitecture.\nHong Kong has the world's largest number of skyscrapers, with 554 towers taller than , and the third-largest number of high-rise buildings in the world. The lack of available space restricted development to high-density residential tenements and commercial complexes packed closely together on buildable land. Single-family detached homes are uncommon and generally only found in outlying areas. The International Commerce Centre and Two International Finance Centre are the tallest buildings in Hong Kong and are among the tallest in the Asia-Pacific region. Other distinctive buildings lining the Hong Kong Island skyline include the HSBC Main Building, the anemometer-topped triangular Central Plaza, the circular Hopewell Centre, and the sharp-edged Bank of China Tower.\nDemand for new construction has contributed to frequent demolition of older buildings, freeing space for modern high-rises. However, many examples of European and Lingnan architecture are still found throughout the territory. Older government buildings are examples of colonial architecture. The 1846 Flagstaff House, the former residence of the Commander of the British forces in Hong Kong, is the oldest Western-style building in Hong Kong. Some buildings, such as the Court of Final Appeal Building and the Hong Kong Observatory retain their original functions, and others have been adapted and reused; the Former Marine Police Headquarters was redeveloped into a commercial and retail complex, and B\u00e9thanie (built in 1875 as a sanatorium) houses the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. The Tin Hau Temple, dedicated to the sea goddess Mazu (originally built in 1012 and rebuilt in 1266), is the territory's oldest existing structure. The Ping Shan Heritage Trail has architectural examples from several imperial Chinese dynasties, including the Tsui Sing Lau Pagoda (Hong Kong's only remaining pagoda).\n\"Tong lau\", mixed-use tenement buildings constructed during the colonial era, blended southern Chinese architectural styles with European influences. These were especially prolific during the immediate post-war period, when many were rapidly built to house large numbers of Chinese migrants. Examples include Lui Seng Chun, the Blue House in Wan Chai, and the Shanghai Street shophouses in Mong Kok. Mass-produced public-housing estates, built since the 1960s, are mainly constructed in modernist style.\nDemographics.\nThe Census and Statistics Department estimated Hong Kong's population at 7,413,070 in 2021. The overwhelming majority (91.6%) is Han Chinese, most of whom are Taishanese, Teochew, Hakka, and other Cantonese peoples. The remaining 8.4% are non-ethnic Chinese minorities, primarily Filipinos, Indonesians, and South Asians. However, most Filipinos and Indonesians in Hong Kong are short-term workers. According to a 2021 thematic report by the Hong Kong government, after excluding foreign domestic helpers, the real number of non-Chinese ethnic minorities in the city was 301,344, or 4% of Hong Kong's population. About half the population have some form of British nationality, a legacy of colonial rule; 3.4\u00a0million residents have British National (Overseas) status, and 260,000 British citizens live in the territory. The vast majority also hold Chinese nationality, automatically granted to all ethnic Chinese residents at the handover. Headline population density exceeds 7,060 people/km2, and is the fourth-highest in the world.\nAmong the religious population, the traditional \"three teachings\" of China, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, have the most adherents (20%), followed by Christianity (12%) and Islam (4%). Followers of other religions, including Sikhism, Hinduism, and Judaism, generally originate from regions where their religion predominates.\nLife expectancy in Hong Kong was 81.3 years for males and 87.2 years for females in 2022, one of the highest in the world. The birth rate in 2023 was 0.751 per woman of child-bearing age. Cancer, pneumonia, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and accidents are the territory's five leading causes of death. The universal public healthcare system is funded by general-tax revenue, and treatment is highly subsidised; on average, 95% of healthcare costs are covered by the government.\nThe city has a severe amount of income inequality, which has risen since the handover, as the region's ageing population has gradually added to the number of nonworking people. Although median household income steadily increased during the decade to 2021, the wage gap remained high; the 90th percentile of earners receive 41% of all income. The city has the most billionaires per capita, with one billionaire per 109,657 people, as well as the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, the highest number of billionaires of any city in Asia, and the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world. Despite government efforts to reduce the growing disparity, median income for the top 10% of earners is 57 times that of the bottom 10%.\nEconomy.\nOne of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports, Hong Kong has a market economy focused on services, characterised by low taxation, minimal government market intervention, and an established international financial market. It is the world's 38th-largest economy, with a nominal GDP of approximately US$407\u00a0billion. Hong Kong is highly developed, and ranks fourth on the UN Human Development Index. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the seventh-largest in the world, with a market capitalisation of HK$30.4\u00a0trillion (US$3.87\u00a0trillion) as of \u00a02018[ [update]]. Hong Kong was ranked as the 15th most innovative territory in the 2025 Global Innovation Index, and 3rd in the Global Financial Centres Index. The city was sometimes referred to as \"Silicon Harbor\" in the 1990s, a nickname derived from Silicon Valley in California.\nHong Kong is the ninth largest trading entity in exports and eighth largest in imports (2021), trading more goods in value than its gross domestic product. Over half of its cargo throughput consists of transshipments (goods travelling through Hong Kong). Products from mainland China account for about 40% of that traffic. The city's location allowed it to establish a transportation and logistics infrastructure which includes the world's seventh-busiest container port and the busiest airport for international cargo. The territory's largest export markets are mainland China and the United States. Hong Kong is a key part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It has little arable land and few natural resources, importing most of its food and raw materials. More than 90% of Hong Kong's food is imported, including nearly all of its meat and rice. Agricultural activity is 0.1% of GDP and consists of growing premium food and flower varieties.\nAlthough the territory had one of Asia's largest manufacturing economies during the latter half of the colonial era, Hong Kong's economy is now dominated by the service sector. The sector generates 92.7% of economic output, with the public sector accounting for about 10%. Between 1961 and 1997 Hong Kong's gross domestic product increased by a factor of 180, and per capita GDP increased by a factor of 87. The territory's GDP relative to mainland China's peaked at 27% in 1993; it fell to less than 3% in 2017, as the mainland developed and liberalised its economy. Economic and infrastructure integration with China has increased significantly since the 1978 start of market liberalisation on the mainland. Since resumption of cross-boundary train service in 1979, many rail and road links have been improved and constructed, facilitating trade between regions. The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement formalised a policy of free trade between the two areas, with each jurisdiction pledging to remove remaining obstacles to trade and cross-boundary investment. A similar economic partnership with Macau details the liberalisation of trade between the special administrative regions. Chinese companies have expanded their economic presence in the territory since the handover. Mainland firms represent over half of the Hang Seng Index value, up from 5% in 1997.\nAs the mainland liberalised its economy, Hong Kong's shipping industry faced intense competition from other Chinese ports. Half of China's trade goods were routed through Hong Kong in 1997, dropping to about 13% by 2015. The territory's minimal taxation, common law system, and civil service attract overseas corporations wishing to establish a presence in Asia. The city has the second-highest number of corporate headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region. Hong Kong is a gateway for foreign direct investment in China, giving investors open access to mainland Chinese markets through direct links with the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The territory was the first market outside mainland China for renminbi-denominated bonds, and is one of the largest hubs for offshore renminbi trading. In November 2020, Hong Kong's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau proposed a new law that will restrict cryptocurrency trading to professional investors only, leaving amateur traders (93% of Hong Kong's trading population) out of the market. The Hong Kong dollar, the local currency, is the eighth-most traded currency in the world. Due to extremely compact house sizes and the extremely high housing density, the city has the most expensive housing market in the world.\nThe government has had a passive role in the economy. Colonial governments had little industrial policy and implemented almost no trade controls. Under the doctrine of \"positive non-interventionism\", post-war administrations deliberately avoided the direct allocation of resources; active intervention was considered detrimental to economic growth. While the economy transitioned to a service basis during the 1980s, late colonial governments introduced interventionist policies. Post-handover administrations continued and expanded these programmes, including export-credit guarantees, a compulsory pension scheme, a minimum wage, anti-discrimination laws, and a state mortgage backer.\nTourism is a major part of the economy, accounting for 5% of GDP. In 2016, 26.6\u00a0million visitors contributed HK$258\u00a0billion (US$32.9\u00a0billion) to the territory, making Hong Kong the 14th-most popular destination for international tourists. It is the most popular Chinese city for tourists, receiving over 70% more visitors than its closest competitor (Macau). The city is ranked as one of the most expensive cities for expatriates. However, since 2020, there has been a sharp decline in incoming visitors due to tight COVID-19 travel restrictions. Additionally, due to the closure of Russian airspace in 2022, multiple airlines decided to cease their operations in Hong Kong. In an attempt to attract tourists back to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government announced plans to give away 500,000 free airline tickets in 2023. Hong Kong was the most visited city internationally in the Asia-Pacific region in 2023, with over 2 million more international visitors than its closest competitor, Bangkok.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nHong Kong has a highly developed, sophisticated transport network. Over 90% of the daily trips made by its residents are made with public transport, the highest percentage in the world. The Octopus card, a contactless smart payment card made for Hong Kong, is widely accepted on railways, trams, buses and ferries, and can be used for payment in most retail stores. Alternative payments such as Apple Pay, AliPay, Mastercard and Visa have also been gradually introduced to public transports.\nThe Peak Tram, Hong Kong's first public transport system, has provided funicular rail transport between Central and Victoria Peak since 1888.\nThe Central and Western District has an extensive system of escalators and moving pavements, which being the Mid-Levels escalator, the world's longest outdoor covered escalator system.\nHong Kong Tramways\u2019 tram network covers a portion of Hong Kong Island, covering from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan, with a branch to Happy Valley. It operates 6 routes and has had a rideship of 42,558 in 2022. It began servicing Hong Kong since 1904. Hong Kong Tramways currently holds the Guinness World Record as the \"Largest double-decker tram fleet in service\", certified on 30 July 2021, with a fleet of 165 double-decker trams. The fleet of trams was mostly built by Hong Kong Tramways.\nThe Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is an extensive passenger rail network, connecting 99 metro stations and 68 light-rail stops throughout the territory. With a daily ridership of almost five million, the system serves 41% of all public transit passengers in the city and has an on-time rate of 99.9%. Cross-boundary train service to Shenzhen is offered by the East Rail line, and longer-distance inter-city trains to Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing are operated from Hung Hom station. This train service has however been suspended since the outbreak of COVID-19, and officially closed by the State Council on 31 July 2024, as announced by the General Administration of Customs, citing that high-speed passenger trains have effectively met the travel needs of passengers between the mainland and Hong Kong. Connecting service to the national high-speed rail system is provided at West Kowloon railway station.\nAlthough public transport systems handle most passenger traffic, there are over 500,000 private vehicles registered in Hong Kong. Automobiles drive on the left (unlike in mainland China), because of the historical influence of the British Empire. Vehicle traffic is extremely congested in urban areas, exacerbated by limited space to expand roads and an increasing number of vehicles. More than 18,000 taxicabs, easily identifiable by their bright colours and taxi lights, are licensed to carry riders in the territory. Unlicensed ride-hailing services such as Uber exist in Hong Kong as well, with some operating with licensed taxis to legitimise their business in ride-sharing. Unlicensed drivers have been targeted by the government and taxi drivers in the past, mainly due to the lack of third-party insurance on passengers and taxi drivers fearing the competition from drivers of these ride-hailing services. In 2024, the government looked into legalising these services.\nBus services operate more than 700 routes across the territory, with smaller public light buses (also known as minibuses) serving areas standard buses do not reach as frequently or directly. Expressways and truck roads, organised with the Hong Kong Strategic Route and Exit Number System, connect all major areas of the territory. The Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge provides a direct route to the western side of the Pearl River estuary.\nHong Kong International Airport is the territory's primary airport, replacing Kai Tak International Airport that ended its operation in 1998. Over 100 airlines operate flights from the airport, including locally based Cathay Pacific (flag carrier), Hong Kong Airlines, low-cost airline HK Express and cargo airline Air Hong Kong. It was the eighth-busiest airport by passenger traffic pre-COVID and handles the most air-cargo traffic in the world. Most private recreational aviation traffic flies through Shek Kong Airfield, under the supervision of the Hong Kong Aviation Club.\nThe Star Ferry operates two lines across Victoria Harbour for its 53,000 daily passengers. Ferries also serve outlying islands inaccessible by other means. Smaller kai-to boats serve the most remote coastal settlements. Ferry travel to Macau and mainland China is also available. Junks, once common in Hong Kong waters, are no longer widely available and are used privately and for tourism.\nThe large size of the port gives Hong Kong the classification of Large-Port Metropolis.\nUtilities.\nHong Kong generates most of its electricity locally. The vast majority of this energy comes from fossil fuels, with 46% from coal and 47% from petroleum. The rest is from other imports, including nuclear energy generated in mainland China. Renewable sources account for a negligible amount of energy generated for the territory. Small-scale wind-power sources have been developed, and a small number of private homes and public buildings have installed solar panels.\nWith few natural lakes and rivers, high population density, inaccessible groundwater sources, and extremely seasonal rainfall, the territory does not have a reliable source of freshwater. The Dong River in Guangdong supplies 70% of the city's water, and the remaining demand is filled by harvesting rainwater locally. Toilets in most built-up areas of the territory flush with seawater, which reduces freshwater use.\nBroadband Internet access is widely available, with 92.6% of households connected. Connections over fibre-optic infrastructure are increasingly prevalent, contributing to the high regional average connection speed of 21.9 Mbit/s (the world's fourth-fastest). Mobile-phone use is ubiquitous; there are almost 22 million mobile-phone accounts registered in Hong Kong, which is almost triple the territory's population.\nCulture.\nHong Kong is characterised as a hybrid of East and West. Traditional Chinese values emphasising family and education blend with Western ideals, including economic liberty and the rule of law. Although the vast majority of the population is ethnically Chinese, Hong Kong has developed a distinct identity. The territory diverged from the mainland through its long period of colonial administration and a different pace of economic, social, and cultural development. Mainstream culture was derived from immigrants originating from various parts of China; it was then influenced by British-style education, a separate political system, and the territory's rapid development during the late 20th century. Most migrants of that era fled poverty and war, reflected in the prevailing attitude toward wealth; Hongkongers would tend to link self-image and decision-making to material benefits. Residents' sense of local identity has increased post-handover: polling in December 2022 had 32% of respondents identifying as \"Hongkongers\", 34.1% identifying as \"Hongkongers in China\" 45.9% purporting a \"Mixed Identity\", 20.5% identifying as \"Chinese\" and 11.9% identifying as \"Chinese in Hong Kong\".\nTraditional Chinese family values, including family honour, filial piety, and a preference for sons, are prevalent. Nuclear families are the most common households, although multi-generational and extended families are not unusual. Spiritual concepts such as \"feng shui\" are observed; large-scale construction projects often hire consultants to ensure proper building positioning and layout. The degree of its adherence to \"feng shui\" is believed to determine the success of a business. \"Bagua\" mirrors are regularly used to deflect evil spirits, and buildings often lack floor numbers with a 4; the number has a similar sound to the word for \"die\" in Cantonese.\nCuisine.\nFood in Hong Kong is primarily based on Cantonese cuisine, despite the territory's exposure to foreign influences and its residents' varied origins. Rice is the staple food, and is usually served plain with other dishes. Freshness of ingredients is emphasised. Poultry and seafood are commonly sold live at wet markets, and ingredients are used as quickly as possible when still fresh. There are up to five daily meals: breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and \"siu yeh\". Dim sum, as part of \"yum cha\" (brunch), is a dining-out tradition with family and friends. Dishes include congee, \"cha siu bao\", \"siu yuk\", egg tarts, and mango pudding. Local versions of Western food are served at \"cha chaan teng\" (Hong Kong-style cafes). Common \"cha chaan teng\" menu items include macaroni in soup, deep-fried French toast, and Hong Kong-style milk tea.\nLanguage.\nThe predominant language today is Cantonese, a variety of Chinese originating in Guangzhou. It is spoken by 93.7% of the population, 88.2% as a first language and 5.5% as a second language. Slightly over half the population (58.7%) speaks English, the other official language; 4.6% are native speakers, and 54.1% speak English as a second language. Code-switching, mixing English and Cantonese in informal conversation, is common among the bilingual population. Post-handover governments have promoted Mandarin, which is currently about as prevalent as English; 54.2% of the population speak Mandarin, with 2.3% native speakers and 51.9% as a second language. Traditional Chinese characters are used in writing, rather than the simplified characters used in the mainland.\nBefore the First Opium War, Hong Kong did not have significant Cantonese-speaking populations. Instead, the majority of people spoke Hakka varieties, though large areas with Waitaunese and Tanka speakers can be found in the northern New Territories and southern coastal areas respectively. Hong Kong Hakka is a variety of Neo-Hakka, and belongs to the Mei-Hui Hakka subbranch of Yuetai Hakka, making it closely related to Moiyenese. Waitaunese is a variety that is closely related to the Yue Chinese varieties spoken in Bao'an and Dongguan, and was the primary language of the Five Great Clans of the New Territories, brought into Hong Kong during the Song dynasty from Jiangxi. Some of the native Yue Chinese varieties were noticeably Hakka-influenced. Smaller communities of Hoklo speakers also existed, and many villages were multicultural.\nToday, communities of speakers of other Chinese varieties (such as Teochew, Szeyap, Hokkien, and Shanghainese) also live in Hong Kong. Southeast Asian languages such as Tagalog and Malay-Indonesian speaking communities also live in Hong Kong. Other minority languages with significant speakerbases in Hong Kong include French, Dutch, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindustani, Japanese, and Korean, among others.\nCinema.\nHong Kong developed into a filmmaking hub during the late 1940s as a wave of Shanghai filmmakers migrated to the territory, and these movie veterans helped build the colony's entertainment industry over the next decade. By the 1960s, the city was well known to overseas audiences through films such as \"The World of Suzie Wong\". When Bruce Lee's \"The Way of the Dragon\" was released in 1972, local productions became popular outside Hong Kong. During the 1980s, films such as \"A Better Tomorrow\", \"As Tears Go By\", and \"Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain\" expanded global interest beyond martial arts films; locally made gangster films, romantic dramas, and supernatural fantasies became popular.\nHong Kong cinema continued to be internationally successful over the following decade with critically acclaimed dramas such as \"Farewell My Concubine\", \"To Live\", and \"Chungking Express\". The city's martial arts film roots are evident in the roles of the most prolific Hong Kong actors. Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, and Michelle Yeoh frequently play action-oriented roles in foreign films. Hong Kong films have also grown popular in overseas markets such as Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, earning the city the moniker \"Hollywood of the East\". At the height of the local movie industry in the early 1990s, over 400 films were produced each year; since then, industry momentum has shifted to mainland China. The number of films produced annually has declined to about 60 in 2017.\nMusic.\nCantopop is a genre of Cantonese popular music which emerged in Hong Kong during the 1970s. Evolving from Shanghai-style \"shidaiqu\", it is also influenced by Cantonese opera and Western pop. Local media featured songs by artists such as Sam Hui, Anita Mui, Leslie Cheung, and Alan Tam; during the 1980s, exported films and shows exposed Cantopop to a global audience. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1990s, when the Four Heavenly Kings dominated Asian record charts. Despite a general decline since late in the decade, Cantopop remains dominant in Hong Kong; contemporary artists such as Eason Chan, Joey Yung, and Twins are popular in and beyond the territory.\nWestern classical music has historically had a strong presence in Hong Kong and remains a large part of local musical education. The publicly funded Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, the territory's oldest professional symphony orchestra, frequently hosts musicians and conductors from overseas. The Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, composed of classical Chinese instruments, is the leading Chinese ensemble and plays a significant role in promoting traditional music in the community.\nHong Kong has never had a separate national anthem to the country that controlled it; its current official national anthem is therefore that of the People's Republic of China, \"March of the Volunteers\". The song \"Glory to Hong Kong\" has been used by protestors as an unofficial anthem of the city.\nSport and recreation.\nDespite its small area, the territory is home to a variety of sports and recreational facilities. The city has hosted numerous major sporting events, including the 2009 East Asian Games, the 2008 Summer Olympics equestrian events, and the 2007 Premier League Asia Trophy. The territory regularly hosts the Hong Kong Sevens, Hong Kong Marathon, Hong Kong Tennis Classic and Lunar New Year Cup, and has hosted the inaugural AFC Asian Cup and the 1995 Dynasty Cup.\nHong Kong represents itself separately from mainland China, with its own sports teams in international competitions. The territory has participated in almost every Summer Olympics since 1952 and has earned nine medals. Lee Lai-shan won the territory's first Olympic gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and Cheung Ka Long won the second one in Tokyo 2020. Hong Kong athletes have won 126 medals at the Paralympic Games and 17 at the Commonwealth Games. No longer part of the Commonwealth of Nations, the city's last appearance in the latter was in 1994.\nDragon boat races originated as a religious ceremony conducted during the annual Tuen Ng Festival. The race was revived as a modern sport as part of the Tourism Board's efforts to promote Hong Kong's image abroad. The first modern competition was organised in 1976, and overseas teams began competing in the first international race in 1993.\nThe Hong Kong Jockey Club, the territory's largest taxpayer, has a monopoly on gambling and provides over 7% of government revenue. Three forms of gambling are legal in Hong Kong: lotteries, horse racing, and football.\nEducation.\nEducation in Hong Kong is largely modelled on that of the United Kingdom, particularly the English system. Children are required to attend school from age 6 until the completion of secondary education, generally at age 18. At the end of secondary schooling, all students take a public examination and are awarded the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education upon successful completion of the exam.\nOf residents aged 15 and older, 81% completed lower-secondary education, 66% graduated from an upper secondary school, 32% attended a non-degree tertiary program, and 24% earned a bachelor's degree or higher.\nMandatory education has contributed to an adult literacy rate of 95.7%. This literacy rate is lower than that of other developed economies because of the influx of refugees from mainland China during the post-war colonial era; much of the elderly population were not formally educated because of war and poverty.\nComprehensive schools fall under three categories: public schools, which are government-run; subsidised schools, including government aid-and-grant schools; and private schools, often those run by religious organisations and that base admissions on academic merit. These schools are subject to curriculum guidelines as provided by the Education Bureau. Private schools subsidised under the Direct Subsidy Scheme and international schools fall outside of this system and may elect to use differing curricula and teach using other languages.\nMedium of instruction.\nAt primary and secondary school levels, the government maintains a policy of \"mother tongue instruction\"; most schools use Cantonese as the medium of instruction, with written education in both Chinese and English. Other languages being used as the medium of instruction in non-international school education include English and Putonghua (Standard Mandarin Chinese). Secondary schools emphasise \"bi-literacy and tri-lingualism\", which has encouraged the proliferation of spoken Mandarin language education.\nEnglish is the official medium of instruction and assessments for most university programmes in Hong Kong, although use of Cantonese is predominant in informal discussions among local students and professors.\nTertiary education.\nHong Kong has twelve universities. The University of Hong Kong (HKU) was founded as the city's first institute of higher education during the early colonial period in 1911. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) was established in 1963 to fill the need for a university that taught using Chinese as its primary language of instruction. Along with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) established in 1991, these universities are consistently ranked among the top 50 or top 100 universities worldwide.\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and City University of Hong Kong (CityU), both granted university status in 1994, are consistently ranked among the top 100 or top 200 universities worldwide. The Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) was granted university status in 1994 and is a liberal arts institution. Hong Kong Metropolitan University (formerly as Open University of Hong Kong prior to 2021) (attaining status in 1997), Lingnan University (in 1999), Hong Kong Shue Yan University (in 2006), Education University of Hong Kong (in 2016), Hang Seng University of Hong Kong (in 2018) and Saint Francis University (in 2024) all attained full university status in subsequent years.\nMedia.\nMost of the newspapers in Hong Kong are written in Chinese but there are also a few English-language newspapers, the major one being the \"South China Morning Post\", with \"The Standard\" serving as a business-oriented alternative. A variety of Chinese-language newspapers are published daily; the most prominent are \"Ming Pao\" and \"Oriental Daily News\". Local publications are often politically affiliated, with pro-Beijing or pro-democracy sympathies. The central government has a print-media presence in the territory through the state-owned \"Ta Kung Pao\" and \"Wen Wei Po\". Several international publications have regional operations in Hong Kong, including \"The Wall Street Journal\", the \"Financial Times\", \"USA Today\", the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\", and \"The Nikkei\".\nFour free-to-air television broadcasters operate in the territory; TVB, HKTVE, HOY and Phoenix Television air eight digital channels. TVB, Hong Kong's dominant television network, has an 80% viewer share. Paid television services operated by PCCW offer hundreds of additional channels and cater to a variety of audiences. RTHK is the public broadcaster, providing seven radio channels and six free-to-air television channels. Ten non-domestic broadcasters air programming for the territory's foreign population. Access to media and information over the Internet is not subject to mainland Chinese regulations, including the Great Firewall, yet local control applies.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrint.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLegislation and case law.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAcademic publications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nInstitutional reports.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNews and magazine articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWebsites.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nGovernment\nTrade\nMaps"}

Hong Kong is a coastal city, bordering Guangdong Province through the city of Shenzhen to the north and the South China Sea to the east, south, and west. Hong Kong and its 260 nearby islands and peninsulas are located at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta. Being a special administrative region since 1997, Hong Kong is distinct from mainland China, but constitutionally defined to be an \"inalienable part\" of the People's Republic of China.\nHong Kong has a total area of , of which 3.16% is water. 260 islands are dispersed around Hong Kong, the largest of which by area is Lantau Island, located southwest of the main peninsula. Lantau Island and the majority of the remaining islands are parts of the New Territories, an area that also encompasses the hilly terrain north of New Kowloon. Hong Kong Island is separated from Kowloon by Victoria Harbour, a natural harbour. The Kowloon Peninsula to the south of Boundary Street, and New Kowloon and the New Territories to the north of Boundary Street were added to British Hong Kong in 1860 and 1898, respectively.\nFurther from Victoria Harbour and the coast, the landscape of Hong Kong is fairly hilly to mountainous with steep slopes. The highest point in the territory is Tai Mo Shan, at a height of in the New Territories. Lowlands exist in the northwestern part of the New Territories. Portions of land on Hong Kong Island and the New Territories are reserved as country parks and nature reserves.\nWith the fourth-highest population density in the world at , Hong Kong is known for its shortage of residential space. Hong Kong has undergone several land reclamation projects to provide more space for residential and economic purposes, increasing its land area. This has caused the distance between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon to decrease. Hong Kong International Airport is the sole public airport in the territory, and is mostly located on reclaimed land on the island of Chek Lap Kok.\nPolitically, Hong Kong is divided into 18 districts, each having a district council. Nevertheless, most public services operate across the territory, and travel between the districts is not restricted. Sha Tin is the most populous district as of 2019.\nThe name \"Hong Kong\", literally meaning \"fragrant harbour\", is derived from the area around present-day Aberdeen on Hong Kong Island, where fragrant wood products and incense were once traded. The narrow body of water separating Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula, Victoria Harbour, is one of the deepest natural maritime ports in the world.\nHong Kong is east of Macau, on the opposite side of the Pearl River estuary. Hong Kong and Macau are connected through the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClimate.\nHong Kong's climate is subtropical and monsoonal (K\u00f6ppen: Cwa), with cool dry winters and hot and wet summers. As of 2006, its annual average rainfall is , though about 80% of the rain falls between May and September. It is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones between May and November, most often from July to September. The mean temperature of Hong Kong ranges from in January and February to in July and August.\nJanuary and February are cloudier, with occasional cold fronts followed by dry northerly winds. It is not uncommon for temperatures to drop below in urban areas. Sub-zero temperatures and frost occur at times on high ground and in the New Territories. March and April can be pleasant although there are occasional spells of high humidity. Fog and drizzle are common on high ground which is exposed to the southeast. May to August are hot and humid with occasional showers and thunderstorms. Afternoon temperatures often exceed whereas at night, temperatures generally remain around with high humidity. In November and December there are pleasant breezes, plenty of sunshine and comfortable temperatures.\nGeographical information.\nLocation.\nHong Kong is on China's southern coast, east of Macau, on the east side of the mouth of the Pearl River estuary. It is surrounded by the South China Sea on all sides except the north, which neighbours the Guangdong city of Shenzhen along the Sham Chun River. The territory's area consists of Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula, the New Territories, Lantau Island, and over 200 other islands. Of the total area, is land and is water. The territory's highest point is Tai Mo Shan, above sea level. Urban development is concentrated on the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong Island, and in new towns throughout the New Territories. Much of this is built on reclaimed land, due to the lack of developable flat land; (six per cent of the total land or about 25 per cent of developed space in the territory) is reclaimed from the sea.\nUndeveloped terrain is hilly to mountainous, with very little flat land, and consists mostly of grassland, woodland, shrubland, or farmland. About 40 per cent of the remaining land area is country parks and nature reserves. The territory has a diverse ecosystem; over 3,000 species of vascular plants occur in the region (300 of which are native to Hong Kong), and thousands of insect, avian, and marine species.\nLand boundaries.\n\"Total:\" \"Border city:\" Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, Guangdong Province\nCoastline.\n\"Total:\" Maritime claims:\n\"Territorial sea:\" \nIslands.\nHong Kong has 263 islands over , including Hong Kong Island, Lantau Island, Cheung Chau, Lamma Island, Peng Chau and Tsing Yi Island.\nTerrain.\nHong Kong's terrain is hilly and mountainous with steep slopes. There are lowlands in the northern part of Hong Kong. A significant amount of land in Hong Kong, especially on the Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula, is reclaimed.\nExtreme points.\nThe lowest elevation in Hong Kong is in the South China Sea (0\u00a0m) while the highest elevation is at Tai Mo Shan () in Tsuen Wan, the New Territories.\nPrincipal peaks of Hong Kong.\nVictoria Peak, the highest point on Hong Kong Island, at is the 24th highest peak in Hong Kong.\nNatural resources.\nThe natural resources of Hong Kong can be divided into three main categories:\nDespite its small size, Hong Kong has a relatively large number of mineral occurrences. Some mineral deposits have been exploited commercially. Metalliferous mineral occurrences are grouped into four broad categories: tin-tungsten-molybdenum mineralisation, copper-lead-zinc mineralisation, iron mineralisation and placer deposits of tin and gold. Mesozoic igneous activity is largely responsible for this diversity of mineral deposits and the mineral concentrations have been variably enhanced by hydrothermal activity associated with faulting. Concentrations of non-metalliferous minerals that have been commercially exploited include kaolin clay, feldspar, quartz, beryl and graphite.\nFor many years, granite and volcanic rocks have been quarried locally for road base metal, riprap, armour stone and asphalt, although the main purpose now is for concrete aggregates. At present, there are three quarries operating in Hong Kong. These are principally in granite and are located at Lam Tei, Shek O and Anderson Road. All the quarries are in the process of rehabilitation and have a life expectancy of between two and eight years.\nOffshore sand bodies have been dredged for aggregate sand and reclamation fill in Hong Kong as the rate of urban development has increased.\nAdditional natural resources include forest and wildlife.\nLand use.\n\"Arable land:\" 2.95%\n\"Permanent crops:\" 0.95%\n\"Other:\" 96.10% (2012 est.)\nBig 22\nNatural hazards.\nTropical cyclones are frequent in Hong Kong during the summer months between July and September. Landslides are common after rainstorms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At the same time, Hong Kong has one of the world's lowest birth rates\u20140.68 per woman of child-bearing age as of 2022, far below the replacement rate of 2.1. It is estimated that 26.8% of the population will be aged 65 or more in 2033, up from 12.1% in 2005. Hong Kong recorded a crude birth rate of 8.2 per 1,000 people on average annually in 2005\u20132010.\nEthnically, Hong Kong mainly consists of Chinese who constitute approximately 92% of the population. Of these, many originate from various regions in Guangdong. There are also a number of descendants of immigrants from elsewhere in Southern China during and after the Chinese Civil War.\nTerminology.\nPeople from Hong Kong generally refer to themselves, in Cantonese, as \"H\u00e8ung G\u00f3ng Y\u00e0hn\" (); however, the term is not restricted to those of Chinese descent, owing to Hong Kong's roughly 160-year colonial history that saw the civil servants and traders of British, Indian, Russian and other ethnic groups stationed in Hong Kong.\nIn English, the term 'Hongkongers' (or sometimes 'Hong Kongers') is also used to refer to Hong Kongese people, while the term 'Hongkongese' is sometimes used as an adjective to describe people or things related to Hong Kong.\nPopulation size and structure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe following census data is available for Hong Kong between the years 1841\u20132011. In 2011, Hong Kong had a population of just over 7 million, with a density of approximately 6,300 people per square kilometer. This makes Hong Kong the fourth most densely populated region in the world, after Macau, Monaco, and Singapore.\nAge groups.\nUnited Nations data.\nAccording to United Nations estimates from 1 July 2013, Hong Kong's population is distributed in the following age ranges, with the largest age group represented being 50\u201354 years:\nPopulation Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.VII.2020):\nHong Kong government data.\nThe Hong Kong government provides the following estimates for mid-2013:\nMedian age: 45.0 (2013 est.)\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nVital statistics.\nAt the end of the 20th century, Hong Kong had one of the lowest birth rates in the world. However, the number of births doubled in the decade between 2001 and 2011, largely due to an increase in the number of children born in Hong Kong to women with residence in mainland China. In 2001 there were 7,810 births to Mainland women (16%) out of a total of 48,219 births. By 2009 it increased to 37,253 births to Mainland women (45%) out of a total of 82,095 births.\nSource: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nLife expectancy.\nHong Kong is the territory with the world's highest life expectancy according to the United Nations.\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\nMarriage and fertility.\nAccording to The World Factbook in 2006, the average marriage age in Hong Kong was 30 years for males and 27 years for females, and the population was subdivided into the following categories:\nEthnicity.\nAccording to Hong Kong census data more than 90% of the population are Chinese. The largest minority are Filipino with over 200,000 in 2021, almost doubled since 2006. Other minorities include Indonesians, Indians, Nepalese and Whites.\nChinese.\nHistorically, the major Chinese groups in Hong Kong include the Cantonese (including Punti and Toishanese), Hakka, Hoklo, and Tanka (mostly Cantonese speakers). The Punti, and Tanka people in Hong Kong are largely descendants of the indigenous population, while the Hakka and Hoklo groups are composed of both indigenous groups and more recent migrants.\nMost Teochew-speaking migrants immigrated to Hong Kong between the late 1940s and early 1970s, while migrants from Fujian (previously Southern Min speakers, and increasingly more Central Min and Northern Min speakers) have constituted a growing number of migrants since 1978. Many Yue-speaking people such as Taishanese and Cantonese also migrated after 1949.\nAccording to the 2016 by-census, 92% of the Hong Kong population belongs to a Chinese ethnicity. The Hong Kong census does not currently categorise Han Chinese subgroups nor does it differentiate other Chinese ethnicities, although in the past the census would collect information on language and dialect use. However, the majority of Hongkongers of Chinese descent trace their ancestry to various parts of Southern China: the Guangzhou area, followed by Siyi (Toishanese people), Chaoshan (a region of Eastern Guangdong home to Teochew speakers), Fujian, and Shanghai. Some Cantonese people also originate from Hakka-speaking villages in the New Territories.\nEthnic minorities.\n8% of the population of Hong Kong are categorised as \"ethnic minorities\", including a large number of Filipinos and Indonesians, who together make up approximately 4.6% of the population. However, the majority of the Filipinos and Indonesians population are short-termed foreign domestic helpers. After excluding foreign domestic helpers, the number of ethnic minorities was 263,593 in 2016, making up 3.6% of the whole Hong Kong population.\nCirca 2018 there were about 2,000 people of African origins with about 800\u20131,000 in Yuen Long. Chungking Mansions is another area of settlement and employment. Some Africans seeking to asylum travelled to Hong Kong as of June 2020. According to Lingnan University professor Lisa Leung Yuk-ming, African settlement began in the 1990s. The Hong Kong African Association (\u9999\u6e2f\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u5354\u6703) is an ethnic association for those people.\nA Thai community began in Hong Kong when Thai women travelled with their husbands, of Chaozhou (Chiu Chow) origin, to Hong Kong in the 1970s. In 2016, Hong Kong had about 10,215 Thai residents, with around 33% residing in Kowloon City.\nNationality.\nDue to its history as trading, business, and tourism hub, a large number of expatriates live in Hong Kong, representing 8% of the population. The following lists ethnic groups with significant presence in Hong Kong in alphabetical order by category:\nLanguage.\nAs a former British colony, Hong Kong has 2 official languages: English, and Chinese, although the specific variety of Chinese is not specified. The majority of the population uses Cantonese as their usual spoken language. However, due to Hong Kong's role as an international trade and finance hub, there are also a wide variety of minority groups speaking dozens of languages present in the territory.\nHowever, a very large proportion of the population in Hong Kong are able to communicate in multiple languages. The school system is separated into English-medium and Chinese-medium school, both of which teach English and Mandarin.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOver half of all people (56.1% as of 2010) are not religious. Religious people in Hong Kong follow a diverse range of religions, among which Taoist and Buddhist (specifically Chinese Buddhism) faiths are common for people of Chinese descent.\nConfucian beliefs are popular in Hong Kong, but it is arguable whether Confucianism can be considered as a religion. As such, Confucianism is excluded in some studies.\nThe Christian beliefs of Protestantism (with 500,000 members) and Catholicism (401,000 members) are also common, as well as non-organised Chinese folk religions, whose followers may state that they are not religious.\nTraditional religions including Chinese Buddhism were discouraged under British rule, which officially represented Christianity. The handover of sovereignty from Britain to China has led to a resurgence of Buddhist and Chinese religions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is led by the Chief Executive, the head of government.\nThe Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitutional document, was approved in March 1990 by National People's Congress of China, and entered into force on 1 July 1997, when sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to China (PRC), ending over one and a half centuries of British rule. Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC with a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign affairs and defence, which are responsibilities of the PRC government. In accordance with Article 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong's Special Administrative Region status provides constitutional guarantees for implementing the policy of \"one country, two systems\".\nAccording to the Sino-British Joint Declaration (1984) and the Basic Law, Hong Kong was to retain its political, economic and judicial systems and unique way of life and continue to participate in international agreements and organisations as a dependent territory for at least 50 years after retrocession. For instance, the International Olympic Committee has recognised Hong Kong as a participating nation under the name, \"Hong Kong, China\", separate from the delegation from the People's Republic of China.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated Hong Kong a \"Hybrid regime\" in .\nSince 2021, universal suffrage is only granted in elections for 20 out of 90 seats of the Legislative Council and 88 out of 470 seats of the district councils. The head of the government (Chief Executive of Hong Kong) is elected through an electoral college with the majority of its members elected by a limited number of voters mainly within business and professional sectors.\nBranches.\nExecutive branch.\nThe Chief Executive (CE) is the head of the special administrative region, and is also the highest-ranking official in the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and is the head of the executive branch.\nThe Chief Executive is elected by a 1200-member Election Committee drawn mostly from the voters in the functional constituencies but also from religious organizations and municipal and central government bodies. The CE is legally appointed by the Premier of the People's Republic of China. The Executive Council, the top policy organ of the executive government that advises on policy matters, is entirely appointed by the Chief Executive.\nLegislative branch.\nIn accordance with Article 26 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, permanent residents of Hong Kong are eligible to vote in direct elections for the 20 seats representing geographical constituencies. Some of the permanent residents who have specific occupational backgrounds are eligible to vote in the 30 seats from functional constituencies in the 90-seat, unicameral Legislative Council (LegCo).\nWithin functional constituencies, the franchise for the 30 seats is limited to about 230,000 voters in the other functional constituencies (mainly composed of business and professional sectors).\nThe 1,500-member election committee of Hong Kong will vote for the remaining 40 seats to enter the Legislative Council as the sector of Election Committee.\nJudicial branch.\nThe Judiciary consists of a series of courts, of which the court of final adjudication is the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.\nWhile Hong Kong retains the common law system, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China has the power of final interpretation of national laws affecting Hong Kong, including the Basic Law, and its opinions are therefore binding on Hong Kong courts on a prospective and often retrospective basis and may not be in line with common law principles.\nTransition, 1984-1997.\nAccording to the Sino-British Joint Declaration (1984), Hong Kong was to retain its political, economic and judicial systems and unique way of life and continue to participate in international agreements and organizations as a dependent territory for at least 50 years after retrocession. The International Olympic Committee has recognized Hong Kong as a participating nation under the name, \"Hong Kong, China\", separate from the delegation from the People's Republic of China.\nIn March 1990, the National People's Congress of China approved the Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitutional document, which entered into force on 1 July 1997, when sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to China (PRC). This ended over one and a half centuries of British rule. Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC with a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign affairs and defense, which are responsibilities of the PRC government. In accordance with Article 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong's Special Administrative Region status provides constitutional guarantees for implementing the policy of \"one country, two systems\".\nMajor political issues since 1997.\nRight of abode, 1999.\nOn 29 January 1999, the Court of Final Appeal, the highest judicial authority in Hong Kong interpreted several Articles of the Basic Law, in such a way that the Government estimated would allow 1.6\u00a0million Mainland China immigrants to enter Hong Kong within ten years. This caused widespread concerns among the public on the social and economic consequences.\nWhile some in the legal sector advocated that the National People's Congress (NPC) should be asked to amend the part of the Basic Law to redress the problem, the Government of Hong Kong (HKSAR) decided to seek an interpretation to, rather than an amendment of, the relevant Basic Law provisions from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC). in June 1999, the NPCSC issued an interpretation in favour of the Hong Kong Government thereby overturning parts of the court decision. While the full powers of NPCSC to interpret the Basic Law was provided for in the Basic Law itself, some critics argued this undermined judicial independence.\n1 July 2003 marches and Article 23.\nThe Hong Kong 1 July March has been an annual protest rally led by the Civil Human Rights Front since the 1997 handover on the HKSAR establishment day. However, it was only in 2003 when it drew large public attention by opposing the bill of Article 23. It has become the annual platform for demanding universal suffrage, calling for observance and preservation of civil liberties such as free speech, venting dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong Government or the Chief Executive, rallying against actions of the Pro-Beijing camp.\nIn 2003, the HKSAR Government proposed to implement Article 23 of the Basic Law by enacting national security bill against acts such as treason, subversion, secession and sedition. However, there were concerns that the legislation would infringe upon human rights by introducing the mainland's concept of \"national security\" into the HKSAR. Together with the general dissatisfaction with the Tung administration, about 500,000 people participated in this protest. Article 23 enactment was \"temporarily suspended\".\nUniversal suffrage, 2003 - to date.\nTowards the end of 2003, the focus of political controversy shifted to the dispute of how subsequent Chief Executives get elected. The Basic Law's Article 45 stipulates that the ultimate goal is universal suffrage; when and how to achieve that goal, however, remains open but controversial. Under the Basic Law, electoral law could be amended to allow for this as soon as 2007 (Hong Kong Basic Law Annex .1, Sect.7). Arguments over this issue seemed to be responsible for a series of mainland Chinese newspapers commentaries in February 2004 which stated that power over Hong Kong was only fit for \"patriots.\"\nThe interpretation of the NPCSC to Annex I and II of the Basic Law, promulgated on 6 April 2004, made it clear that the National People's Congress' support is required over proposals to amend the electoral system under Basic Law. On 26 April 2004, the Standing Committee of National People's Congress denied the possibility of universal suffrage in 2007 (for the Chief Executive) and 2008 (for LegCo).\nThe NPCSC interpretation and decision were regarded as obstacles to the democratic development of Hong Kong by the democratic camp, and were criticized for lack of consultation with Hong Kong residents. On the other hand, the pro-government camp considered them to be in compliance with the legislative intent of the Basic Law and in line with the 'One country, two systems' principle, and hoped that this would put an end to the controversies on development of political structure in Hong Kong.\nMid December 2007 Chief Executive Sir Donald Tsang requested that Beijing allow direct elections for the Chief Executive. He referred to a survey in which more than half of the citizens of Hong Kong wanted direct elections by 2012. However, he said waiting for 2017 may be the best way to get two-thirds of the support of Legislative Council. End of December Donald Tsang announced that the NPC said, it planned to allow the 2017 Chief Executive Elections and the 2020 Legislative Council elections to take place by universal suffrage.\nIn 2013, public concern was sparked that the election process for the Chief Executive would involve a screening process that selects for candidates deemed suitable for the position by Beijing, incited by a comment made by a Deputy of the National People's Congress at an off-the-record gathering.\nResignation of Tung Chee-hwa and interpretation of Basic Law, 2005.\nOn 12 March 2005, the Chief Executive, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned. Immediately after Tung's resignation, there was dispute over the length of the term of the Chief Executive. To most local legal professionals, the length is obviously five years, under whatever circumstances. It should also be noted that the wording of the Basic Law on the term of the Chief Executive is substantially different from the articles in the PRC constitution concerning the length of term of the president, premier, etc. Nonetheless, legal experts from the mainland said it is a convention a successor will only serve the remainder of the term if the position is vacant because the predecessor resigned. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress affirmed that the successor would only serve the remainder of the term. Many in Hong Kong saw this as having an adverse impact on one country, two systems, as the Central People's Government interpret the Basic Law to serve its need, that is, a two-year probation for Tsang, instead of a five-year term.\nPolitical reform package protests, 2005.\nOn 4 December 2005, people in Hong Kong demonstrated against Sir Donald Tsang's proposed reform package, before a vote on 21 December. According to the organizers, an estimated 250,000 turned out into the streets. The police supplied a figure of 63,000, and Michael de Golyer of Baptist University estimated between 70,000 and 100,000.\nThe march sent a strong message to hesitant pro-democracy legislators to follow public opinion. The pro-government camp claimed to have collected 700,000 signatures on a petition backing Tsang's reform package. This number, however, was widely seen as too small to influence pro-democracy lawmakers. The Reform Package debate saw the return of key political figure and former Chief Secretary Anson Chan, raising speculations of a possible run up for the 2007 Chief Executive election, though she dismissed having a personal interest in standing for the next election.\nIn an attempt to win last minute votes from moderate pro-democracy lawmakers, the government amended its reform package on 19 December 2005 by proposing a gradual cut in the number of district council members appointed by the Chief Executive. Their number was to be reduced from 102 to 68 by 2008. It was to be decided in 2011 whether to scrap the remaining seats in 2012 or in 2016.\nThe amendment was seen as a reluctant response by Sir Donald Tsang to give satisfaction to the democratic demands made by demonstrators on 4 December. The move was qualified \"Too little, too late\" by pan-democrats in general.\nOn 21 December 2005, the political reform package was vetoed by pro-democracy lawmakers. Chief Secretary Rafael Hui openly criticized pro-democracy Martin Lee and Bishop Zen for blocking the proposed changes.\nPolitical appointment system, 2008.\nAs of 2008, the 24 non-civil service positions under the political appointment system comprised 11 undersecretaries and 13 political assistants.\nIn May 2008, the government named eight newly appointed Undersecretaries and nine Political Assistants. The posts were newly created, ostensibly to work closely with bureau secretaries and top civil servants in implementing the Chief Executive's policy blueprint and agenda in an executive-led government. Donald Tsang described the appointments as a milestone in the development of Hong Kong's political appointment system. In June 2008 controversies arose with the disclosure of foreign passports and salaries. Pressure for disclosure continued to mount despite government insistence on the right of the individuals to privacy: on 10 June 2008, newly appointed Undersecretaries and political assistants, who had previously argued were contractually forbidden from disclosing their remuneration, revealed their salaries. The Government news release stated that the appointees had \"voluntarily disclosed their salaries, given the sustained public interest in the issue.\"\nInflation relief measures, 2008.\nOn 16 July 2008, Donald Tsang announced some \"extraordinary measures for extraordinary times\", giving a total of HK$11\u00a0billion in inflation relief to help families' finances. Of which, the Employee Retraining levy on the employment of Foreign domestic helpers would be temporarily waived, at an estimated cost of $HK2\u00a0billion. It was intended that the levy would be waived for a two-year period on all helpers' employment contracts signed on or after 1 September 2008, but would not apply to ongoing contracts. The Immigration Department said it would not reimburse levies, which are prepaid half-yearly or yearly in advance. The announcement resulted in chaos and confusion, and uncertainty for the helpers as some employers deferred contracts or had dismissed helpers pending confirmation of the effective date, leaving helpers in limbo.\nIn July 2008, Secretary for Labor and Welfare Matthew Cheung announced the waiver commencement date would be brought forward by one month. The Immigration Department would relax its 14-day re-employment requirement for helpers whose contracts expired. On 30 July, the Executive Council approved the measures. After widespread criticism of the situation, the government also conceded that maids having advanced renewal of contract would not be required to leave Hong Kong through the discretion exercised by the Director of Immigration, and employers would benefit from the waiver simply by renewing the contract within the two-year period, admitting that some employers could benefit from the waiver for up to 4 years. The administration's poor handling of the matter was heavily criticized. The administrative credibility and competence were called into question by journals from all sides of the political spectrum, and by helpers and employers alike.\nLeung Chin-man appointment, 2008.\nIn August 2008, the appointment of Leung Chin-man as deputy managing director and executive director of New World China Land, subsidiary of New World Development (NWD), was greeted with uproar amidst widespread public suspicion that job offer was a \"quid pro quo\" for the favors he allegedly granted to NWD. Leung was seen to have been involved with the sale of the Hung Hom Peninsula Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) public housing estate to NWD at under-value in 2004.\nAfter a 12-month 'sterilization period' after retirement, Leung submitted an application to the government on 9 May for approval to take up employment with New World China Land. The Secretary for the Civil Service, Denise Yue Chung-yee, signed off on the approval for him to take up the job after his request passed through the vetting committee.\nControversies surrounded not only the suspicions of Leung's own conflict of interest, but also of the insensitivity of the committee which recommended the approval for him to take up his lucrative new job less than two years after his official retirement. New World argued that they hired Leung in good faith after government clearance.\nOn 15 August, the Civil Service Bureau issued the report requested by Donald Tsang, where they admitted that they had neglected to consider Leung's role in the Hung Hom Peninsula affair. Donald Tsang asked the SCS to reassess the approval, and submit a report to him. New World Development announced in the early hours of 16 August that Leung had resigned from his post, without any compensation from either side or from the government, for the termination.\nThe next day, Donald Tsang confirmed that Denise Yue would not have to resign. He was satisfied with her apology and with the explanations offered by her. Tsang ordered a committee, of which Yue was to be a member, to be set up to perform a sweeping review of the system to process applications for former civil servants.\nMay 2010 by-election.\nIn January 2010, five pan-democrats resigned from the Legislative Council of Hong Kong to trigger a by-election in response to the lack of progress in the move towards universal suffrage.\nThey wanted to use the by-election as a de facto referendum for universal suffrage and the abolition of the functional constituencies.\nUmbrella Revolution, 2014.\nThe Umbrella Revolution erupted spontaneously in September 2014 in protest of a decision by China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) on proposed electoral reform.\nThe austerity package provoked mobilization by students, and the effects became amplified into the Umbrella Movement a political movement involving hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens provoking heavy-handed policing and government tactics.\nHong Kong Extradition bill, 2019.\nIn February 2019, the Legislative Council proposed a bill to amend extradition rights between Hong Kong and other countries. This bill was proposed because of an incident in which a Hong Kong citizen killed his pregnant girlfriend on vacation in Taiwan. However, there is no agreement to extradite to Taiwan, so he was unable to be charged in Taiwan. The bill proposed a mechanism for transfers of fugitives not only for Taiwan, but also for mainland China and Macau, which are not covered in the existing laws. The 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests were a series of protests against the bill, such as on 9 June 2019 and 16 June 2019, which were estimated to number one million and two million protesters, respectively. Police brutality and subsequent further oppression of the protesters by the government have led to even more demonstrations, including the anniversary of the handover on 1 July 2019, which saw the storming of the Legislative Council Complex, and subsequent protests throughout the summer spreading to different districts.\nOn 15 June 2019, Chief Executive Carrie Lam decided to indefinitely suspend the bill in light of the protests, but also made it clear in her remarks that the bill was not withdrawn. On 4 September 2019, Lam announced that the government would \"formally withdraw\" the Fugitive Offenders Bill, as well as enacting a number of other reforms.\nThe 2019 Hong Kong District Council election was held on 24 November, the first poll since the beginning of the protests, and one that had been billed as a \"referendum\" on the government. More than 2.94 million votes were cast for a turnout rate of 71.2%, up from 1.45 million and 47% from the previous election. This was the highest turnout in Hong Kong's history, both in absolute numbers and in turnout rates. The results were a resounding landslide victory for the pro-democracy bloc, as they saw their seat share increased from 30% to almost 88%, with a jump in vote share from 40% to 57%. The largest party before the election, DAB, fell to third place, with its leader's vote share cut from a consistent 80% to 55%, and their three vice-chairs losing. Among those who were also legislators, the overwhelming majority of the losing candidates were from the pro-Beijing bloc. Commenting on the election results, \"New Statesman\" declared it \"the day Hong Kong's true \"silent majority\" spoke.\nAfter the election, the protests slowly became quiet due to the COVID-19 pandemic and government crackdown.\nNationality and citizenship.\nChinese nationality.\nBefore and after the handover, the People's Republic of China has recognized ethnic Chinese people in Hong Kong as its citizens. The PRC issues Home Return Permits for them to enter mainland China. As of 2007, Hong Kong issued the HKSAR passport through its Immigration Department to all PRC citizens who were permanent residents of Hong Kong fitting the right of abode rule.\nThe HKSAR passport is not the same as the ordinary PRC passport, which is issued to residents of mainland China. Only permanent residents of Hong Kong who are PRC nationals are eligible to apply. To acquire the status of permanent resident one has to have \"ordinarily resided\" in Hong Kong for a period of seven years and adopted Hong Kong as their permanent home. Therefore, citizenship rights enjoyed by residents of mainland China and residents Hong Kong are differentiated even though both hold the same citizenship.\nNew immigrants from mainland China (who possess Chinese Citizenship) to Hong Kong are denied from getting a PRC passport from the mainland authorities, and are not eligible to apply for an HKSAR passport. They usually hold the Document of Identity (DI) as the travel document, until the permanent resident status is obtained after seven years of residence.\nNaturalization as a PRC Citizen is common among ethnic Chinese people in Hong Kong who are not PRC Citizens. Some who have surrendered their PRC citizenship, usually those who have emigrated to foreign countries and have retained the permanent resident status, can apply for PRC citizenship at the Immigration Department, though they must renounce their original nationality in order to acquire the PRC citizenship.\nNaturalization of persons that are not of Chinese ethnicity is rare because China does not allow dual citizenship and becoming a Chinese citizen requires the renouncement of other passports. A notable example is Michael Rowse, a permanent resident of Hong Kong and the current Director-General of Investment Promotion of Hong Kong Government, naturalized and became a PRC citizen, for the offices of secretaries of the policy bureaux are only open to PRC citizens.\nIn 2008, a row erupted over political appointees. Five newly appointed Undersecretaries declared that they were in the process of renouncing foreign citizenship as at 4 June 2008, citing public opinion as an overriding factor, and one Assistant had initiated the renunciation process. This was done despite there being no legal or constitutional barrier for officials at this level of government to have foreign nationality.\nBritish nationality.\nHong Kong residents who were born in Hong Kong in the British-administered era could acquire the British Dependent Territories citizenship. Hong Kong residents who were not born in Hong Kong could also naturalize as a British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) before the handover. To allow them to retain the status of British national while preventing a possible flood of immigrants from Hong Kong, the United Kingdom created a new nationality status, British National (Overseas) that Hong Kong British Dependent Territories citizens could apply for. Holders of the British National (Overseas) passport - BN(O) - have no right of abode in the United Kingdom. See British nationality law and Hong Kong for details.\nBritish National (Overseas) status was given effect by the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986. Article 4(1) of the Order provided that on and after 1 July 1987, there would be a new form of British nationality, the holders of which would be known as British Nationals (Overseas). Article 4(2) of the Order provided that adults and minors who had a connection to Hong Kong were entitled to make an application to become British Nationals (Overseas) by \"registration\".\nBecoming a British National (Overseas) was therefore not an automatic or involuntary process and indeed many eligible people who had the requisite connection with Hong Kong never applied to become British Nationals (Overseas). Acquisition of the new status had to be voluntary and therefore a conscious act. To make it involuntary or automatic would have been contrary to the assurances given to the Chinese government which led to the words \"eligible to\" being used in paragraph (a) of the United Kingdom Memorandum to the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The deadline for applications passed in 1997. Any person who failed to register as a British Nationals (Overseas) by 1 July 1997 and were eligible to become PRC citizens became solely PRC citizens on 1 July 1997. However, any person who would be rendered stateless by failure to register as a British Nationals (Overseas) automatically became a British Overseas citizen under article 6(1) of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986.\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, people urged the British Government to grant full British citizenship to all Hong Kong BDTCs \u2013 but this request was never accepted. However, it was considered necessary to devise a British Nationality Selection Scheme to enable some of the population to obtain British citizenship. The United Kingdom made provision to grant citizenship to 50,000 families whose presence was important to the future of Hong Kong under the British Nationality Act (Hong Kong) 1990.\nAfter handover, all PRC citizens with the right of abode in Hong Kong (holding Hong Kong permanent identity cards) are eligible to apply for the HKSAR passport issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the visa-free-visit destinations of the HKSAR passport are very similar with that of a BN(O) passport and the application fee for the former is much lower (see articles HKSAR passport and British passport for comparison and verification), the HKSAR passport is becoming more popular among residents of Hong Kong.\nHong Kong residents who were not born in Hong Kong (and had not naturalized as a BDTC) could only apply for the Certificate of identity (CI) from the colonial government as travel document. They are not issued (by neither the British nor Chinese authorities) after handover. Former CI holders holding PRC Citizenship (e.g. born in mainland China or Macau) and are permanent residents of Hong Kong are now eligible for the HKSAR passports, making the HKSAR passports more popular.\nAccording to The Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 No. 948 \u00a7 6: A baby born in Hong Kong, who has at least one parent with British national origin, shall have the right to submit an application for duel-citizenship between Hong Kong and the UK.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nHong Kong political parties in the pro-establishment camp support the policies of the PRC's central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.124 Supporters of the pro-establishment camp generally have a strong sense of Chinese identity.124 As of at least 2024, the pro-establishment camp is the governing coalition in Hong Kong politics.124\nPolitical parties in the pan-democratic camp view the principle of One Country, Two Systems as standing for democracy in Hong Kong.124 They support universal suffrage.124 Supporters of the pan-democratic camp generally have a strong sense of Hong Kong identity.124\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13409", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13409", "title": "Economy of Hong Kong", "text": "Set of productive activities developed in Hong Kong \nThe economy of Hong Kong is a highly developed free-market economy. It is characterised by low taxation, almost free port trade and a well-established international financial market. Its currency, called the Hong Kong dollar, is legally issued by three major international commercial banks, and is pegged to the US dollar. Interest rates are determined by the individual banks in Hong Kong to ensure that they are market driven. There is no officially recognised central banking system, although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority functions as a financial regulatory authority.\nIts economy is governed under positive non-interventionism, and is highly dependent on international trade and finance. For this reason it is regarded as among the most favorable places to start a company. In fact, a recent study shows that Hong Kong has come from 998 registered start-ups in 2014 to over 2800 in 2018, with eCommerce (22%), Fintech (12%), Software (12%) and Advertising (11%) companies comprising the majority. The Economic Freedom of the World Index lists Hong Kong as the freest economy, with a score of 8.58 based on data from 2022.\nEffects.\nHong Kong's economic strengths include a sound banking system, virtually no public debt, a strong legal system, ample foreign exchange reserves with assets of US$481.6 billion represent over six times the currency in circulation or about 46 per cent of Hong Kong dollar M3 as at the end of March 2022, rigorous anti-corruption measures and close ties with mainland China. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is a favourable destination for international firms and firms from mainland China to be listed, due to Hong Kong's highly internationalised and modernised financial industry. Additional advantages include the city's capital market in Asia, its size, regulations and available financial tools, which are comparable to London and New York City.\nHong Kong's gross domestic product had grown 180 times between 1961 and 1997. Also, the GDP per capita rose by 87 times within the same time frame. Its economy is slightly larger than Chile's or Romania's and its GDP per capita at purchasing power parity was the twelfth highest globally in 2023. By the latter measure, its GDP per capita was higher than those of the Netherlands, and slightly lower than Brunei. In 2009, Hong Kong's real economic growth fell by 2.8% as a result of the Great Recession.\nBy the late 20th century, Hong Kong was the seventh largest port in the world and second only to New York City and Rotterdam in terms of container throughput. Hong Kong is a full Member of the World Trade Organization. The Kwai Chung container complex was the largest in Asia, while Hong Kong shipping owners were second only to those of Greece in terms of total tonnage holdings in the world. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the sixth largest in the world, with a market capitalisation of about US$3.732 trillion.\nHong Kong has also had an abundant supply of labour from the regions nearby. A skilled labour force coupled with the adoption of modern British/Western business methods and technology ensured that opportunities for external trade, investment, and recruitment were maximised. Prices and wages in Hong Kong are relatively flexible, depending on the performance and stability of the economy of Hong Kong.\nHong Kong raises revenues from the sale and taxation of land and through attracting international businesses to provide capital for its public finance, due to its low tax policy. According to Healy Consultants, Hong Kong has the most attractive business environment within East Asia, in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2013, Hong Kong was the third largest recipient of FDI in the world.\nHong Kong ranked fourth on the Tax Justice Network's 2011 Financial Secrecy Index. The Hong Kong Government was the fourth highest ranked Asian government in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI), a measure of a government's information and communication technologies in 2016, and ranked 13th globally.\nHong Kong is ranked as the 18th most innovative territory in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, and 3rd in the Global Financial Centres Index.\nAccording to the \"Economic Freedom of the World 2024\" report, Hong Kong emerged as the top-ranked region, excelling particularly in the domains of Freedom to Trade Internationally and Regulation.\nSince the 1997 handover.\nSince the 1997 handover, Hong Kong's economic future became far more exposed to the challenges of economic globalisation and the direct competition from cities in mainland China. In particular, Shanghai claimed to have a geographical advantage. The Shanghai municipal government dreamt of turning the city into China's main economic centre by as early as 2010.\nSince the 1997 handover, Hong Kong's share of China's GDP has dropped from 18.4% to 2.1% in 2021. In 2021, the Housing Price Index was double of what it was in 1997, while the Real Wage Index\u00a0was almost unchanged.\nPositive non-interventionism.\nHong Kong's economic policy has often been cited by economists such as Milton Friedman and the Cato Institute as an example of laissez-faire capitalism, attributing the city's success to the government having a relatively low level of involvement in the economy. However, others have argued that the economic strategy is not at all adequately characterised by the term \"laissez-faire\". They point out that there are still many ways in which the government is involved in the economy, some of which exceed the degree of involvement in other capitalist countries. For example, the government is involved in public works projects, healthcare, education, and social welfare spending. Further, although rates of taxation on personal and corporate income are low by international standards, unlike most other countries Hong Kong's government raises a significant portion of its revenues from land leases and land taxation. All land in Hong Kong is owned by the government and is leased to private developers and users on fixed terms, for fees which are paid to the state treasury. By restricting the sale of land leases, the Hong Kong government keeps the price of land at what some consider as artificially high prices and this allows the government to support public spending with a low tax rate on income and profit. Moreover, as demonstrated in the regulation of finance companies in the 1970s and 1980s, the principle of positive non-interventionism in practice involved the government intervening in markets, albeit often hesitantly and belatedly, when the public interest was perceived to be threatened. The concept evolved towards a policy of \"when in doubt, do nothing\" during this period of financial instability.\nEconomic data.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022\u20132027). Inflation below 5% is in green.\nGDP.\nSource:\nLabour.\nSource:\n2022\u20132023 fiscal year budget.\nSources:\nTrade.\nSource:\nTrade with Macau.\nAs at 2015, Macau is Hong Kong's second largest export destination, occupying 6.1% of Hong Kong's total exports. The amount of export totaled US$8.4B, with broadcasting equipment, jewelry, and precious metal watches as the major products. On the other hand, Hong Kong is Macau's largest export destination. Totaled USD 774M, with precious metal watches, jewelry, trunks and cases as the major trading products, the exports to the Hong Kong forms 53% of Macau's total exports. Since 2018, Hong Kong and Macau have been connected via road by the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge.\nPoverty.\nThe international poverty line is a monetary threshold under which an individual is considered to be living in poverty. This threshold is calculated using Purchasing Power Parity. According to the World Bank, the international poverty line was most recently updated in October 2015, in which it was increased from $1.25 per day to $1.90 per day using the value of 2011 dollars. Raising this threshold helps account for changes in costs of living, which directly effects individuals ability to obtain basic necessities across countries.\nRecent figures show that 1.37 million people are living below the poverty line and struggling to survive on HK$4,000 (US$510) per month for a one-person household, HK$9,800 for a two-person household earning, and HK$15,000 or a three-person household. The poverty rate in Hong Kong hit a high of 20.1%, but recent efforts by government programs have lowered this number to 14.7%.\nIn December 2012, the Commission on Poverty (CoP) was reinstated to prevent and alleviate poverty with three primary functions; analyze the poverty situation, assist policy formulation and to assess policy effectiveness. Cash handouts have been credited with alleviating much of the poverty, but the extent in which poverty has been alleviated is still questionable. Although cash handouts raise households above the poverty line, they are still struggling to meet certain standards as the cost of living in Hong Kong steadily increases.\nCoupled with these cash payments, statutory minimum wage is set to increase for a second time in the past 10 years. Statutory Minimum Wage (SMW) came into existence on 1 May 2011 and the SMW rate has been HK$34.5 per hour since May 2017. The Legislative Council in Hong Kong most recently approved the revision on the SMW rate to increase to HK$37.5 per hour, effective 1 May 2019. Although the total statistics for Hong Kong show declining poverty, child poverty increased .3 percentage points from 2017 to 2018, up to a total of 23.1%, as a result of larger households due to children staying with their elderly parents. With economic growth projected to slow in the coming years, poverty becomes an increasingly pressing issue.\nOne of the largest issues affecting low income families is the availability of affordable housing. Over the past decade, residential Hong Kong property prices have increased close to 242%, with growth finally starting to decelerate in 2019. Considering housing is a basic necessity, prices have continuously increased while disposable incomes remain virtually unchanged. As the amount of affordable housing diminishes, it has become much harder for families to find homes in their home country. Public housing programs have been implemented by the government, but delayed construction and growing waitlists have not helped to the extent they planned for. Recent results from a Hong Kong think tank show that by 2022, the average citizen could wait up to 6 years for public housing. Evidence shows that the availability of affordable housing has declined, forcing households to spend more on shelter and less on other necessities. These issues can lead to worse living conditions and imbalanced diets, both of which pose problems beyond just financial well-being.\nFinancial markets.\nStock exchange.\nThe Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the sixth largest in the world, with a market capitalisation of about US$3.732 trillion as of mid-2017. In 2006, the value of initial public offerings (IPO) conducted in Hong Kong was second highest in the world after London. In 2009, Hong Kong raised 22 percent of IPO capital, becoming the largest centre of IPOs in the world. The exchange is the world's 10th largest by turnover and third largest in China.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The territory is in addition the East and Southeast Asian headquarters for most of the major international communications and media services.\nBroadcast media and news is provided by several television and radio companies, one of which is government-run. Television provides the major source of news and entertainment for the average family. Chinese television programs are produced for both local and overseas markets.\nHong Kong also ranks as an important centre of publishing and printing: numerous books are published yearly for local consumption, several leading foreign publishers have their regional offices in Hong Kong, and many international magazines are printed in the territory.\nTelevision.\nTerrestrial television.\nThere are a total of nine terrestrial television channels in Hong Kong, owned by three television networks, one of which is a public broadcaster.\nHong Kong's terrestrial commercial TV networks can also be seen in Macau, via cable.\nTVB.\nTelevision Broadcasts Limited operates TVB Jade, TVB Pearl, TVB Plus (formerly two separate channels, TVB J2 and J5), and TVB News, of which Jade and Pearl are available on analogue frequencies. TVB is the city's first commercial terrestrial television network (Asia Television (ATV) began as a subscription television network), and is the city's predominant TV network.\nHKTVE.\nHK Television Entertainment operates ViuTV, which is a Cantonese general entertainment channel. The network is mandated by its service license to launch a 17-hour English television channel on or before 31 March 2017. The English channel named \"ViuTVsix\" officially launched on March 31, 2017 (local time).\nViuTV does not broadcast on analogue frequencies.\nRTHK.\nPublic broadcaster RTHK operates three digital channels, two of which have been simulcast on analogue frequencies formerly used by ATV since April 2, 2016.\nPaid television.\nPaid cable and satellite television have also been widespread, with Cable TV Hong Kong, Now TV, TVB Network Vision and HKBN bbTV being the more prominent providers.\nThe production of Hong Kong's soap drama, comedy series and variety shows have reached mass audiences throughout the Chinese-speaking world. Many international and pan-Asian broadcasters are based in Hong Kong, including News Corporation's STAR TV.\nTelecommunication industry.\nThe Hong Kong telecommunication industry was deregulated in 1995. There are no foreign ownership restrictions. The Office of Telecommunications Authority (OFTA) is the legislative body responsible for regulating the telecommunications industry. Competition in this sector is fierce. Since 2008, one can get 10\u00a0Mbit/s up and down unlimited VDSL, telephone line rental, unlimited local calls, and 100 minutes of international calls for US$25/month. Telephone line rental and unlimited local calls is only US$3/month.\nTelecommunication company.\nAs of \u00a02017[ [update]], the penetration rate in Hong Kong was estimated at 240.8% over a population estimate of over 7.325 million. Hong Kong's telecom regulator is the Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA).\nInternet.\nBroadband Internet access.\nAs of April 2006, HKBN offers its customers Internet access with speeds starting from 10\u00a0Mbit/s up to 1000\u00a0Mbit/s (1\u00a0Gbit/s) via Fiber to the building and Fiber to the Home. However the speed to non-Hong Kong destinations is capped to 20\u00a0Mbit/s.\nAs of November 2009, the company was offering 100 Mbit/s service for HK$99 (about $13 US) per month.\nMajor Internet Service Providers (ISPs) include:\nInternet censorship in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong law provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Although freedom of expression is protected by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, the Hong Kong national security law gives the government the power to \"take down any electronic messages published\" that the government considers endangering national security. No government licenses are required to operate a website. Democratic activists claim central government authorities closely monitor their e-mails and Internet use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the Hong Kong Government's Travel Characteristics Survey, over 90% of daily journeys are on public transport, the highest rate in the world. However, in 2014, the Transport Advisory Committee issued a report on the worsening congestion problem in Hong Kong and pointed at the excessive growth of private cars over the past 10\u201315 years.\nThe Octopus card, a smart electronic money payment system, was introduced in September 1997 to provide an alternative to traditional banknotes and coins. Available for purchase and renewal in every stop of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system and at a select few ferry customer service centers, the Octopus card is a non-touch payment system which allows payment not only for public transport (such as trains, buses, trams, ferries and minibuses), but also at parking meters, convenience stores, supermarkets, select restaurants and most vending machines.\nPublic transport statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Hong Kong, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 min. 21% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average during their commutes every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 11.2\u00a0km, while 31% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nRail transport.\nHong Kong has an extensive railway network, and the Hong Kong Government has long established that the public transit system has the \"railway as its backbone\". Public transport trains are operated by the MTR Corporation. The MTR operates the metro network within inner urban Hong Kong, Kowloon Peninsula and the northern part of Hong Kong Island with newly developed areas, Tsuen Wan, Tseung Kwan O, Tung Chung, Hong Kong Disneyland, the Hong Kong International Airport, the northeastern and northwestern parts of the New Territories. The Hong Kong Tramways operates a tram service exclusively on northern Hong Kong Island. The Peak Tram connects Central, Hong Kong's central business district, with Victoria Peak.\nMass Transit Railway.\nOpened in 1979, the system now includes 240.6\u00a0km (149.5\u00a0mi) of rail with 167 stations, including 98 railway stations and 68 light rail stops. The railway lines include the East Rail, Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan, Island, Tung Chung, Tseung Kwan O, Tuen Ma, South Island, the Airport Express and the Disneyland Resort lines. Eight of the lines provide general metro services, whereas the Airport Express provides a direct link from the Hong Kong International Airport into the city center, and the Disneyland Resort Line exclusively takes passengers to and from Hong Kong Disneyland. \nThe Light Rail possesses many characteristics of a tramway, including running on streets with other traffic (at grade) on most of its tracks and providing services for the public in the northwestern New Territories, including Tuen Mun and Yuen Long.\nAll trains and underground MTR stations are air-conditioned.\nTramways.\nThe Hong Kong Tramways is the tram system run exclusively with double deckers. The electric tram system was proposed in 1881; however nobody was willing to invest in a system at the time. In August 1901, the Second Tramway Bill was introduced and passed into law as the 1902 Tramway Ordinance. Hong Kong Tramway Electric Company Limited, a British company, was authorised to take the responsibilities in construction and daily operation. In 1904, the tram system first got into service. It was soon taken over by another company, Electric Tranction Company of Hong Kong Limited and then the name was changed to Hong Kong Tramways Company Limited in 1910.\nThe rail system is long, with a total track length of , and it runs together with other vehicles on the street. Its operation relies on the 550V direct current (d.c.) from the overhead cables, on 3'6\" gauge (1067\u00a0mm) tracks. The trams provide service to only parts of Hong Kong Island: they run on a double track along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan, with a single clockwise-running track of about around Happy Valley Racecourse.\nFunicular railways.\nThere are two funicular railway services in Hong Kong:\nAirport people-mover system.\nThe Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover is a driverless people-mover system located within the Hong Kong International Airport in Chek Lap Kok. It operates in two \"segments\". For departures, the train runs from Terminal 2 to the East Hall to the West Hall. For arrivals, the train runs only from the West Hall to the East Hall, where all passengers must disembark for immigration, customs, and baggage claim. Operation of the first segment commenced in 1998, and the operation of the second segment commenced in early-2007. The HKIA APM is being extended to the future Terminal 2 Concourse, which is being constructed and will be finished by 2024.\nThere is another system between the terminals. There is also a travellator which can be used.\nCross-border trains.\nInter-city train services crossing the Hong Kong-China boundary are known as Intercity Through Trains. They are jointly operated by Hong Kong's MTR Corporation and China Railway High-speed. Hung Hom station (formerly called \"Kowloon station\") and West Kowloon Terminus are the stations in Hong Kong where passengers can catch these trains. Passengers have to go through immigration and customs before boarding. There are currently four through train routes:\nIn 2024, Hung Hom cross-border trains are halted.\nRoad transport.\nBuses.\nBus services have a long history in Hong Kong. As of 2023, four companies operate franchised public bus services, each granted ten-year exclusive operating rights to the set of routes that they operate. Franchise buses altogether carry about one-third of the total daily public transport market of around 12,000,000 passengers, with KMB having 67% of the franchised bus market share and CityBus with 29%. There are also a variety of non-franchised public buses services, including feeder bus services to railway stations operated by the railway companies, and residents' services for residential estates (particularly those in the New Territories).\nThe four franchised bus companies are:\nFounded in 1933, the Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited (KMB) is one of the largest privately owned public bus operators in the world. KMB's fleet consist of about 3,900 buses on 400 routes and a staff of over 12,000 people. In 1979, Citybus began its operations in Hong Kong with one double-decker, providing shuttle service for the Hong Kong dockyard. It later expanded into operating a residential bus route between City One, Sha Tin and Kowloon Tong MTR station. New World First Bus Services Limited was established in 1998, taking over China Motor Bus's franchise to provide bus services on Hong Kong Island together with Citybus. NWFB's owner company later bought Citybus, and NWFB and Citybus shared the same website, but the two companies had essentially been operating independently until their merger on 1 July 2023.\nPublic light buses.\nPublic light buses (\u5c0f\u5df4) (widely referred to as minibuses, or sometimes \"maxicabs\", a \"de facto\" share taxi) run the length and breadth of Hong Kong, through areas which the standard bus lines can not or do not reach as frequently, quickly or directly. Minibuses carry a maximum of 16 (19 for some routes since 2017) passengers; standing is not permitted.\nThe Hong Kong Transport Department (HKTD) allows and licenses the operation of two types of public light buses:\nRed minibuses often provide more convenient transport for passengers not served by green minibuses or other public buses, and are thus quite popular. Where green minibus drivers are paid fixed wages to drive their routes, red minibus drivers often rely on their fares for a living and thus are often seen to be more aggressive drivers. The prevalence of aggressive driving has resulted in the Transport Department making it mandatory for Hong Kong minibuses to be equipped with large read-out speedometers which allow passengers to track the speed at which minibus drivers operate. Currently, if minibuses exceed 80\u00a0km/h, the speedometer will sound an audible warning signal to the driver and passengers. If the minibus exceeds 100\u00a0km/h, the beeping will turn into a sustained tone.\nThe Transport Department has also regulated, after a series of minibus accidents, that all new minibuses brought into service after August 2005 must have seat belts installed, and passengers must use seat belts when they are provided.\nTaxis.\nAs of March\u00a02016[ [update]], there were 18,138 taxis in Hong Kong, operating in three distinct (but slightly overlapping) geographical areas, and distinguished by their colour. Of these, 15,250 are red urban taxis, 2,838 green New Territories taxis, and 50 blue Lantau taxis. Every day, they serve 1,100,000, 207,900, and 1,400 passengers respectively. Taxis carry an average of 1,000,000 passengers each day, occupying about 12% of the daily patronage carried by all modes of public transport in Hong Kong.\nMost of the taxis in Hong Kong run on LPG (liquified petroleum gas) to reduce emissions. In August 2000, a one-off grant was paid in cash to taxi owners who replaced their diesel taxi with an LPG one. Since August 2001, all newly purchased taxis run on LPG. By the end of 2003, over 99.8% of the taxi fleet in Hong Kong ran on LPG.\nTaxi fares are charged according to the taximeter; however, additional charges on the fare table may apply, such as road tolls and luggage fees. Urban taxis are the most expensive, while Lantau taxis are the cheapest. The standard of service among different kinds of taxis is mostly the same. The reason for having three types of taxis is to ensure service availability in less populated regions, as running in the urban centre is considered to be more profitable.\nPrivate cars.\nAs of May 2015, the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong reports that there are 504,798 licensed vehicles in Hong Kong. In terms of private car ownership, the number of cars per capita is half that of Singapore and one-third that of Taiwan. However, the Transport Advisory Committee, which advises the government on transport policies, issued a report stating that the growth of private cars is too fast and must be contained so as to alleviate congestion problems of Hong Kong. Private cars are most popular in newly developed areas such as New Territories and Lantau and areas near the border with mainland China, as there are fewer public transportation options, and more parking spaces compared to other areas of Hong Kong.\nMost cars are right-hand drive models, from Japanese or European manufacturers. Almost all private vehicles in Hong Kong have dual airbags and are tested by JNCAP. Vehicles must also be maintained to a high standard, contrary to mainland China regulations. Hong Kong does not allow left-hand drive vehicles to be primarily registered in Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong registered vehicles may apply for secondary mainland Chinese registration plates, and these can be driven across the border to mainland China; likewise, left-hand drive cars seen in Hong Kong are usually primarily registered in mainland China and carry supplementary Hong Kong registration plates.\nCars are subjected to a first-time registration tax, which varies from 35% to over 100%, based on the size and value of the car. The level of vehicle taxation was increased by a law passed on 2 June 1982 to discourage private car ownership, and also as an incentive to buy smaller, more efficient cars, as these have less tax levied on them. First-time registration tax was doubled, annual licensing fees were increased by 300%, and $0.70 duty fee was imposed on each litre of light oils.\nIn addition to the heavy traffic at times, parking may be problematic. Due to high urban density, there are not many filling stations; petrol in Hong Kong averages around US$2.04 per litre, of which over half the cost is taxes. It was suggested in the news that the government had deliberately impeded the use of new environmentally friendly diesel engines by allowing only light goods vehicles to be fuelled by diesel. While it cannot be determined why exactly the government does not allow private cars to be fuelled by diesel, it has been pointed out that the government does receive a tax that is 150% of the actual fuel cost. This is mostly to discourage car ownership for environmental reasons.\nThere is a waiting list for local driving tests, while a full (private car) driving licence valid for ten years costs around US$115. Residents of Hong Kong holding licences issued by other Chinese authorities and some foreign countries can get a Hong Kong driving licence exempt from tests if they can adequately show that they obtained their licence while residing in the place concerned (common proofs are school transcripts or employer's documentation). Some private car owners, known as white card drivers, provide a taxi service for a nominal fee.\nBicycles.\nCycling is a popular means of transport in many parts of the New Territories, where new towns such as Sha Tin, Tai Po and Sheung Shui have significant cycle track networks. In the auto congested urban areas of Hong Kong and Kowloon, cycling is less common, despite the relatively flat topography of populated areas, in part because it is government policy not to support cycling as part of the transportation system. In 2011, the MTR Corporation announced that bicycles were permitted to be taken on all MTR rail lines.\nMotorcycles.\nMotorcycles by the private users in Hong Kong urban districts are not as popular as in South East Asian countries like Vietnam. They are mostly used for commercial and business purposes.\nCross-border buses.\nA large number of buses leave various parts of Hong Kong (usually from side streets and hotel entrances) to various cities in the Pearl River Delta, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.\nMiniature Golf Carts\nOn some of the outlying islands, such as Lamma Island, residents rely on miniature golf carts for transportation. These compact electric vehicles serve as an efficient mode of transport for short distances and are a unique sight on the island's narrow pathways.\nMaritime transport.\nFerries.\nInternal routes.\nMost ferry services are provided by licensed ferry operators. As of September 2003[ [update]], there were 27 regular licensed passenger ferry services operated by 11 licensees, serving outlying islands, new towns and inner-Victoria Harbour. Two of the routes operated by the Star Ferry are franchised. Additionally, 78 \"kai-to\" ferries are licensed to serve remote coastal settlements.\nThe following companies operate ferry services in Hong Kong:\nStar Ferry:\nSun Ferry:\nHong Kong &amp; Kowloon Ferry:\nChuen Kee Ferry:\nHKR International Limited:\nPark Island Transport Company Ltd.:\nDiscovery Bay Transport Services Ltd.\nDiscovery Bay to Central\nFortune Ferry (\u5bcc\u88d5\u5c0f\u8f2a)\nCoral Sea Ferry (\u73ca\u745a\u6d77\u8239\u52d9)\nTsui Wah Ferry:\nExternal routes.\nIn Hong Kong, there are three piers that provides ferry services to Macau and cities in southern China:\nFerry services are provided by several different ferry companies at these piers.\nFastferry hydrofoil and catamaran service is available at all times of the week between Hong Kong and Macau.\nTurboJet provides 24-hour services connecting Central and Macau at a frequency of up to every 15 to 30 minutes. It also provides these regular services:\nCotai Water Jet provides about 18-hour services connecting Central and Taipa or Outer Harbour, Macau at a frequency of up to every 30 to 60 minutes. It also provides these regular services:\nChu Kong Passenger Transport (CKS) connects Hong Kong to cities in Guangdong province, including Zhuhai (Jiuzhou), Shenzhen (Shekou), Zhongshan (Zhongshan Kong), Lianhua Shan (Panyu), Jiangmen, Gongyi, Sanbu, Gaoming, Heshan, Humen, Nanhai, Shunde, Doumen.\nAir transport.\nAeroplanes.\nHong Kong International Airport (HKG) is the primary airport for the territory and has been at Chep Lap Kok since 1998. Over 100 airlines operate flights to international and mainland China destinations from the airport; it is the main hub of flag carrier Cathay Pacific as well as Air Hong Kong, Hong Kong Express, and Hong Kong Airlines. HKG is an important regional transhipment centre, passenger hub, and gateway for destinations in mainland China and the rest of Asia. It also handles the most air cargo traffic in the world. With over 70 million passengers annually, it is the eighth busiest airport worldwide by passenger traffic. HKG is constructed on an artificial island north of Lantau Island and was built to replace the overcrowded Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon Bay. A third runway was constructed as part of the Three-Runway-System. The massive upgrades to the Terminal 2, and the construction of a new Terminal 2 Concourse, High-Speed Baggage Systems, the upgrades to the Centre Runway, and the extension of the APM, will be completed in 2024.\nFerry services link Hong Kong and Macau International Airport; there is an express service at the Hong Kong\u2013Macau Ferry Terminal in which passengers can check in to flights at Macau Airport. Macau Airport has an \"Express Link\" service operating from the Hong Kong-Macau terminal, China Ferry Terminal, and Tuen Mun Ferry Terminal in which transiting passengers to Macau Airport are not processed through Macau customs. In addition there is a bus service between Hong Kong and Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport in Shenzhen, and people going to Shenzhen Airport may also board a ferry that goes to Fuyong Ferry Terminal at Shenzhen Airport.\nThe majority of area private recreational aviation traffic, under the supervision of the Hong Kong Aviation Club (HKAC), goes in and out of Shek Kong Airfield in the New Territories. The HKAC sent most of its aircraft to Shek Kong in 1994 after the hours for general aviation at Kai Tak Airport were sharply reduced, to two hours per morning, as of 1 July that year. Usage of private aircraft at Shek Kong is restricted to weekends.\nHelicopters.\nExternally, frequent passenger helicopter flights to Macau are scheduled daily. There are also chartered services for the VIP and business community within Hong Kong.\nAerial lift transport.\nCable cars.\nThere are two cable car systems in Hong Kong:\nInfrastructure.\nPorts and harbours.\nThe port of Hong Kong has always been a key factor in the development and prosperity of the territory, which is strategically located on the Far East trade routes and is in the geographical centre of the fast-developing Asia-Pacific Basin. The sheltered harbour provides good access and a safe haven for vessels calling at the port from around the world.\nThe Victoria Harbour is one of the busiest ports in the world. An average of 220,000 ships visit the harbour each year, including both oceanliners and river vessels, carrying both goods and passengers. The container port in Hong Kong is one of the busiest in the world. The Kwai Chung Terminal operates 24 hours a day. Together with other facilities in Victoria Harbour, they handled more than 20\u00a0million\u00a0twenty-foot equivalent units\u00a0(TEU) in 2005. Some 400 container liners serve Hong Kong weekly, connecting to over 500 destinations around the world.\nAirports.\nHong Kong has a fully active international airport. The famous former Kai Tak International Airport retired in favour of the recently constructed Hong Kong International Airport, also known as Chek Lap Kok International Airport. The airport now serves as a transport hub for East Asia, and as the hub for Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Express, Hong Kong Airlines, and Air Hong Kong. Ferry services link the airport with several piers in Pearl River Delta, where immigrations and customs are exempted. Kai Tak airport was closed because of privacy reasons and also because of safety reasons; the aircraft came very close to the skyscrapers.\nHKIA's network to China expanded with the opening of SkyPier in late-September 2003, offering millions in the PRD direct access to the airport. Passengers coming to SkyPier by high-speed ferries can board buses for onward flights while arriving air passengers can board ferries at the pier for their journeys back to the PRD. Passengers travelling in both directions can bypass custom and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports \u2013 Shekou, Shenzhen, Macau and Humen (Dongguan) \u2013 were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves Shenzhen's Shekou and Fuyong, Dongguan's Humen, Macau, Zhongshan and Zhuhai. Moreover, passengers travelling from Shekou and Macau piers can even complete airline check-in procedures with participating airlines before boarding the ferries and go straight to the boarding gate for the connecting flight at HKIA. The provision of cross boundary coach and ferry services has transformed HKIA into an inter-modal transportation hub combining air, sea and land transport.\nAs of March\u00a02009[ [update]], the airport is the third busiest airport for passenger traffic, and second-busiest airport for cargo traffic in the world. It is popular with travellers \u2013 from 2001 to 2005 and 2007\u20132008 Hong Kong International Airport has been voted the World's Best Airport in an annual survey of several million passengers worldwide by Skytrax.\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, the passenger terminal of the HKIA was the world's largest airport terminal upon opening, and is at present the world's third-largest airport terminal building, with a covered area of 550,000 m2 and recently increased to 570,000 m2. The Airport Core Programme was one of the most expensive airport projects in the world.\nShek Kong Airfield, located near Yuen Long, is a military airfield for the People's Liberation Army, which is of limited operating capabilities due to surrounding terrain. The only aircraft operating on the airfield are PLA's Z-9 helicopters, which is the license-built version of the Eurocopter Dauphin.\nHeliports.\nHong Kong has three heliports. Shun Tak Heliport (ICAO: VHST) is located in the Hong Kong\u2013Macau Ferry Terminal, by the Shun Tak Centre, in Sheung Wan, on Hong Kong Island. Another is located in southwest Kowloon, near Kowloon station. The other is located inside Hong Kong International Airport.\nHeli Express operates regular helicopter service between Macao Heliport (ICAO:VMMH) on the Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal in Macau and the Shun Tak Heliport. There are around 16 flights daily. Flights take approximately 20 minutes in the eight-seater aircraft.\nThere are also a number of helipads across the territory, including the roof of the Peninsula Hotel (which is the only rooftop helipad in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, excluding the rooftop heliport of Shun Tak Centre and those in hospitals) and Cheung Chau Island, between Tung Wan Beach and Kwun Yam Beach.\nHighways.\nThere are a total of cvt of paved highways in Hong Kong. These roads are built to British standards with a maximum of four lanes with hard shoulders.\nThere are nine roads classified as trunk roads in Hong Kong and were renumbered from 1 to 9 in 2004. Routes 1 to 3 are in a north\u2013south direction (with each crossing one of the cross-harbour tunnels) while the others are in an east\u2013west direction:\nSouthern District \u21c4 Wan Chai \u21c4 Hung Hom \u21c4 Kowloon Tong \u21c4 Sha Tin\nEastern District \u21c4 Kwun Tong \u21c4 Wong Tai Sin \u21c4 Sha Tin\nCentral &amp; Western District \u21c4 West Kowloon \u21c4 Sham Shui Po \u21c4 Kwai Tsing \u21c4 Tsuen Wan \u21c4 Yuen Long\nEastern District \u21c4 Wan Chai \u21c4 Central \u21c4 Sai Ying Pun\nKowloon City \u21c4 Yau Ma Tei \u21c4 Sham Shui Po \u21c4 Kwai Tsing \u21c4 Tsuen Wan\nTseung Kwan O \u21c4 Kwun Tong \u21c4 Wong Tai Sin \u21c4 Sham Shui Po \u21c4 Kwai Chung\nSha Tin &lt;&gt; Kwai Tsing \u21c4 Lantau Island North \u21c4 Tung Chung \u21c4 Airport\nCircular Route linking the whole New Territories (Sha Tin, Tai Po, Northern District, Yuen Long, Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan)\nTuen Mun \u21c4 Nam Tei (Divided from Route 9) \u21c4 Ha Tsuen \u21c4 Deep Bay \u21c4 Shenzhen Bay Bridge \u21c4 Shenzhen Bay Border Crossing \u21c4 Mainland China\nRoute 6 is a proposed highway, and is now under construction.\nThere are 120 CCTV cameras monitoring traffic on these highways and connecting roads which are available on-demand (Now TV) and on the Transport Department's website.\nHighways in Hong Kong use two types of barrier system for divided highways. Older roads use metal guard rails and newer roads use the British Concrete step barrier.\nAll signage on highways and roads in Hong Kong are bilingual (traditional Chinese below and English above). Street signs use black text on a white background. Highway and directional signage are white lettering on blue or green background.\nBridges and tunnels.\nThere are 13 major vehicular tunnels in Hong Kong. They include three cross-harbour tunnels and ten road tunnels.\nOther road tunnels and bridges which are proposed or under construction are:\nBus lanes.\nThere are approximately 22 km of bus priority lanes in Hong Kong.\nBus terminals.\nThere are 298 bus terminals in Hong Kong. Notable examples include:\nBicycles.\nBike path exists across Hong Kong, mostly in newly developed residential areas in New Territories. Most of the traditional urban core does not have bike paths, with them only present in some newly redeveloped or reclaimed coastal areas.\nA network of bike rental shops is present near bike paths, in addition to dockless bike renting apps, enabling infrequent users to lease and drop off their bikes along bike paths.\nMost public transit require bikes to be folded up and wheels be removed before bikes can be allowed to board.\nPedestrian.\nEscalators and moving pavements.\nHong Kong Island is dominated by steep, hilly terrain, which required the development of unusual methods of transport up and down the slopes. In Central and Western District, there is an extensive system of zero-fare escalators and moving pavements. The Mid-Levels Escalator is the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world, operating downhill until 10am for commuters going to work, and then operating uphill until midnight.\nThe Mid-levels Escalator consists of twenty escalators and three moving pavements. It is 800 metres long, and climbs 135 vertical metres. Total travel time is approximately 25 minutes, but most people walk while the escalator moves to shorten the travel time. Due to its vertical climb, the same distance is equivalent to several miles of zigzagging roads if travelled by car. Daily traffic exceeds 35,000 people. It has been operating since 1993 and cost HK$240,000,000 (US$30,000,000) to build.\nA smaller Mid-Levels escalator system was built on Centre Street in Sai Ying Pun. Also in Sai Ying Pun are small escalators between First and Second Streets, in an uphill plaza that forms a giant hole through the Island Crest building. There is also a small escalator on Sands Street in Kennedy Town. There have been several more proposed outdoor escalators, including plans for Pound Lane, the entrance to the campus of the University of Hong Kong (which already has some escalators within and connecting it with the MTR) and projects in parts of Hong Kong away from Hong Kong Island.\nPedestrian bridges, tunnels, and skyways.\nExample includes:\nPavement railings.\nDuring the 2019\u20132020 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, of pavement railings were damaged by the demonstrators. Hong Kong's Transport and Highways Departments spent an estimated HK$15 million ($1.9 million) of taxpayer money rebuilding and reinforcing the fencing. The city government has more than doubled its installation of pedestrian rails, from in 2010 to by 2018. Many of the railings prevent pedestrians from walking in a straight line along major roads by prohibiting direct crossing of perpendicular side streets. Paul Zimmerman, a district councillor and a member of a government advisory commission to improve urban design, and other pavement-fence critics argue the barriers are emblematic of the way Hong Kong streets are built to prioritise vehicles over pedestrians. The city likes the guardrails because they do not want to slow turning cars but prioritising vehicles limits the \"throughput capacity\" of the city. Pedestrians who want to walk faster than the shuffling crowds must go into the streets, exposing them to vehicle traffic. The Transport and Highways departments say the railings are critical \u201cto regulate and guide pedestrians for road safety and traffic management purposes.\u201d Hong Kong's high \"population density\" makes \"pedestrian mobility\" complicated and the railings offer a clear distinction between the automobiles and walkers. But in a city where less than 10% of the population owns a car, anti-fence advocates question why automobiles get primacy. Nonprofit groups like Walk DVRC, in conjunction with Zimmerman, have worked to remove some of the guardrails but the city believes they are necessary. The railings, which are too flimsy to fend off cars, provide little to no protection from automobiles. Walk DVRC has submitted a detailed proposal including pictures and recommendations for 456 railings. There are 105 of those that they claim \u201chave been removed to the benefit of pedestrians\u201d and should not be reinstalled. Nevertheless, the city is determined to replace the removed railings and is moving forward despite public pushback.\nPorts of entry.\nThis is a list of ports of entry (i.e. immigration control points) in Hong Kong.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a separate customs territory, Hong Kong maintains and develops relations with foreign states and regions, and plays an active role in such international organisations as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in its own right under the name of \"Hong Kong, China\". Hong Kong participates in 16 projects of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nOverview.\nHong Kong makes strenuous law enforcement efforts, but faces serious challenges in controlling transit of heroin and methamphetamine to regional and world markets; modern banking systems that provide a conduit for money laundering; rising indigenous use of synthetic drugs, especially among young people.\nHong Kong has its own immigration policy and administration. Permanent residents of Hong Kong with PRC nationality hold a different type of passport, called the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Passport, which is different from that for PRC citizens in mainland China. Hong Kong permanent residents and mainland Chinese need a passport-like document (the \"Home Return Permit\" for Hong Kong permanent residents and the Two-way Permit for mainland Chinese) to cross the boundary between mainland China and Hong Kong. Visitors from other countries and regions not participating in waiver programme are required to apply for visas directly to the Hong Kong Immigration Department.\nAccording to the official data provided by the Hong Kong Immigration Department in January 2020, There are 168 countries and regions that implement visa-free policies for residents holding Hong Kong passports.\nHong Kong Office.\nHong Kong was under British rule before 1 July 1997. Prior to the implementation of the \"Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Act 1996\" enacted by the British Parliament, Hong Kong represented its interests abroad through the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) and via a special office in the British Embassies or High Commissions, but the latter ceased after the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the PRC and became a special administrative region (SAR) of the PRC in 1997. At present, the \"Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices\" under the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in countries that are the major trading partners of Hong Kong, including Japan, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, the European Union as well as an ETO in Geneva to represent HKSAR Government in the WTO. These offices serve as the official representative of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR in these countries and international organisations. Its major functions include facilitating trade negotiations and handling trade related matters, inter-government relations with foreign governments; the promoting of investment in Hong Kong; and liaising with the media and business community. The Hong Kong Government has also set up the Hong Kong Tourism Board with offices in other countries and regions to promote tourism.\nInternational agreements.\nIn accordance with Article 151 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong concluded over 20 agreements with foreign states in 2010 on matters such as economic and financial co-operation, maritime technical co-operation, postal co-operation and co-operation on wine-related businesses. Under the Basic Law, the Hong Kong also concluded 12 bilateral agreements with foreign states on air services, investment promotion and protection, mutual legal assistance and visa abolition during the year.\nFree trade agreement.\nNegotiating.\nFrom the Chief Executive's Policy Address in October 2018.\nInternational organisations.\nHong Kong participates in 41 intergovernmental international organisations with countries as participating units. Hong Kong participates in 54 intergovernmental international organisations that do not use countries as their participating units.\nHong Kong participates in the following international organizations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOverseas visits made by senior officials.\nThe Chief Executive of Hong Kong &amp; other senior officials often make a duty visit to foreign countries. These visits usually aim to advance Hong Kong's economic and trade relations with the foreign countries. During these visits, the Chief Executive will meet with political and business leaders. Usually, the head of state or head of government of the foreign countries will receive the Chief Executive. For example, former Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa made three visits to the United States during his term. In these three visits, Tung Chee-hwa met with the US President in the Oval Office at the White House. Chief Executive Donald Tsang had visited Japan, South Korea, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Brazil, India, France and other countries during his term of government.\nFor example, the then Chief Executive Donald Tsang visited London and Edinburgh in 2011 as part of his European tour to renew ties with the UK and promote Hong Kong as a gateway to Asia. He met Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. In mid-2011, Donald Tsang visited Australia in June to strengthen ties between Hong Kong and Australia, promote trade opportunities, and encourage more Australian companies, particularly resources companies, to list in Hong Kong. During his visit, Mr Tsang held meetings with the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, as well as the leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop.\nMany foreign dignitaries visit Hong Kong each year. The number of such visits has grown since 1997 as many of them have included Hong Kong as a destination on their trips to China, while others have visited Hong Kong specifically to see \"one country, two systems\" in operation. The level of VIP visits is also boosted by major international conferences held in Hong Kong in recent years. In 2009\u20132012, there were 11 official visits to Hong Kong, including the visits of the Prime Minister of Canada, Secretary of State of the United States of America, President of the Russian Federation, President of the Republic of Indonesia, President of the Republic of Korea and other foreign dignitaries.\nForeign officials visit Hong Kong.\nProtocol Division Government Secretariat.\nThe Protocol Division Government Secretariat is responsible for liaising with the large consulate groups of various countries stationed in the Hong Kong and providing host government services to these consular groups.The Protocol Division Government Secretariat also represents Hong Kong government to receive national leaders and international organisations visiting Hong Kong, and plan and coordinate official visits to Hong Kong by members of the foreign royal family and senior government leaders.\nForeign officials.\nAs of November 2005, the Hong Kong Government has received more than 60 foreign heads of state, government and senior ministers for official visits to Hong Kong. Leaders who have visited Hong Kong include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Russian President, President of Panama, Prime Minister of New Zealand, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Prime Minister of Vietnam, Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Dmitry Medvedev, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. President Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski of Poland was the first head of state to make an official visit to Hong Kong after the handover, on 20 November 1997.\nOverseas representation in Hong Kong.\nWhen Hong Kong was under British rule, most Commonwealth member states, unlike other countries, were represented in Hong Kong by Commissions. However, following the 1997 handover, they were all renamed Consulates-General. Owing to Hong Kong's economic importance, and the large number of British passport holders, the British Consulate-General is the largest of its kind in the world and bigger than many British Embassies and High Commissions abroad.\nMost countries maintain Consulates-General or Consulates in Hong Kong. However, despite their name, many Consulates-General are not subordinate to their country's embassy to the PRC in Beijing. For example, the British Consulate-General is directly subordinate to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the UK rather than the British embassy in the Chinese capital. The Consul-General of the United States, likewise, holds ambassadorial rank, and reports to the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs in the US Department of State.

The island lies almost halfway between Hawaii and Australia and is an unincorporated, unorganized territory of the United States. Together with Baker Island, it forms part of the Phoenix Islands. For statistical purposes, Howland is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The island has an elongated cucumber-shape on a north\u2013south axis, , and covers .\nHowland Island National Wildlife Refuge consists of the entire island and the surrounding of submerged land. The island is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an insular area under the U.S. Department of the Interior. It is part of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument.\nThe atoll currently has no economic activity. It is managed as a nature reserve. It is best known as the island Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan were striving for but failed to reach when they and their airplane disappeared on July 2, 1937, during their planned round-the-world flight. Airstrips constructed to accommodate their planned stopover were subsequently damaged in World War II, not maintained, and gradually disappeared. There are no harbors or docks. The fringing reefs may pose a maritime hazard. There is a boat landing area along the middle of the sandy beach on the west coast and a crumbling day beacon. The island is visited every two years by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It was mined for guano in the 19th century, and in the 1930s it was colonized by the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project. In modern times, it is a nature reserve, and there are some historical remains from the colony and a stone tower called Earhart Light.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe climate is equatorial, with little rainfall and intense sunshine. Temperatures are moderated somewhat by a constant wind from the east. The terrain is low-lying and sandy: a coral island surrounded by a narrow fringing reef with a slightly raised central area. The highest point is approximately above sea level.\nThere are no natural fresh water resources. The landscape features scattered grasses along with prostrate vines and low-growing pisonia trees and shrubs. A 1942 eyewitness description spoke of \"a low grove of dead and decaying kou trees\" on a very shallow hill at the island's center. In 2000, a visitor accompanying a scientific expedition reported seeing \"a flat bulldozed plain of coral sand, without a single tree\" and some traces of buildings from colonization or World War II building efforts, all wood and stone ruins overgrown by vegetation.\nHowland is primarily a nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat for seabirds, shorebirds, and marine wildlife. The island, with its surrounding marine waters, has been recognized as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports seabird colonies of lesser frigatebirds, masked boobies, red-tailed tropicbirds and sooty terns, as well as serving as a migratory stopover for bristle-thighed curlews.\nEconomics.\nThe U.S. claims an Exclusive Economic Zone of and a territorial sea of around the island.\nTime zone.\nSince Howland Island is uninhabited, no time zone is specified. It lies within a nautical time zone, which is 12 hours behind UTC, named International Date Line West (). Howland Island and Baker Island are the only places on Earth observing this time zone. This time zone is also called AoE, Anywhere on Earth, a calendar designation indicating that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth.\nHistory.\nHowland Island was claimed by the United States in 1857 under the 1856 Guano Islands Act and was mined for guano later that century. In the 1930s, economic activity on the island began with a few people, several buildings, a day beacon, and a cleared landing strip. This was the island Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan were going to land on when they were not heard from again on their long flight. The day after Pearl Harbor, the island was bombed and attacked several more times, which damaged the day beacon and killed two people, finally leading to the island's evacuation. After the war, the day beacon was repaired, and the island became a nature reserve. It has been the subject of visits to honor or look for the lost aviator, Earhart.\nPrehistoric settlement.\nSparse remnants of trails and other surface features indicate a possible early Polynesian presence, including excavations and mounds, stacked rocks, and a footpath made of long, flat stones. In the 1860s, James Duncan Hague noted discovering the remains of a hut, canoe fragments, a blue bead, and a human skeleton buried in the sand. However, the perishable nature of the wooden materials and the lack of beadwork in Polynesia suggests these materials are historical. The presence of the kou tree (\"Cordia subcordata\") and Polynesian rats (\"Rattus exulans\") on the island is also considered a possible indicator of early Polynesian visits to Howland.\nHowever, the only modern archaeological survey of Howland, conducted by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1987, found no evidence of prehistoric settlement or use of the island. Still, sub-surface testing was limited in scope due to time constraints. Additionally, the USACE survey failed to locate the architectural features described by Hague. However, they concede this may be due to the destruction of these features later during the construction of an airstrip. A later conservation plan by the US Fish and Wildlife Service suggests that Howland was likely used as a stopover or meeting point as opposed to being permanently occupied.\nSightings by whalers.\nCaptain George B. Worth of the Nantucket whaler \"Oeno\" sighted Howland around 1822 and called it Worth Island. Daniel MacKenzie of the American whaler \"Minerva Smith\" was unaware of Worth's sighting when he charted the island in 1828 and named it after his ship's owners on December 1, 1828. Howland Island was at last named on September 9, 1842 after a lookout who sighted it from the whaleship \"Isabella\" under Captain Geo. E. Netcher of New Bedford.\nCaptain William Bligh of \"HMS Bounty\", in his diary after the mutiny, described stopping at the island shortly after being set adrift by the mutineers in April 1789. He had 18 crew members who scoured the island for sustenance, such as oysters, water, and birds. Bligh was unsure of the island's name, but apparently, it was known to cartographers. \u00a0Bligh's account on Howland Island is open to question since his route in the boat began between Tonga and Tofua and ran more or less west directly to Timor.\nU.S. possession and guano mining.\nHowland Island was uninhabited when the United States took possession of it under the Guano Islands Act of 1856. The island was a known navigation hazard for decades, and several ships were wrecked there. Its guano deposits were mined by American companies from about 1857 until October1878, although there was a dispute between mining companies.\nCaptain Geo. E. Netcher of the \"Isabella\" informed Captain Taylor of its discovery. As Taylor had discovered another guano island in the Indian Ocean, they agreed to share the benefits of the guano on the two islands. Taylor put Netcher in communication with Alfred G. Benson, president of the American Guano Company, which was incorporated in 1857. Other entrepreneurs were approached as George and Matthew Howland, who later became United States Guano Company members, engaged Mr. Stetson to visit the island on the ship \"Rousseau\" under Captain Pope. Mr. Stetson arrived on the island in 1854 and described it as being occupied by birds and a plague of rats.\nThe American Guano Company established claims with respect to Baker Island and Jarvis Island, which were recognized under the U.S. Guano Islands Act of 1856. Benson tried to interest the American Guano Company in the Howland Island deposits; however, the company directors considered they already had sufficient deposits. In October1857, the American Guano Company sent Benson's son Arthur to Baker and Jarvis Islands to survey the guano deposits. He also visited Howland Island and took samples of the guano. Subsequently, Alfred G. Benson resigned from the American Guano Company. Netcher, Taylor, and George W. Benson formed the United States Guano Company to exploit the guano on Howland Island, with this claim recognized under the U.S. Guano Islands Act of 1856.\nHowever, when the United States Guano Company dispatched a vessel in 1859 to mine the guano, they found that Howland Island was already occupied by men sent there by the American Guano Company. The companies ended up in New York state court, with the American Guano Company arguing that the United States Guano Company had, in effect, abandoned the island since the continual possession and actual occupation required for ownership by the Guano Islands Act did not occur. The result was that both companies were allowed to mine the guano deposits, which were substantially depleted by October1878. Laborers for the mining operations came from around the Pacific, including from Hawai\u02bbi; the Hawaiian laborers named Howland Island ('kou tree grove'). Established in 1861, the Pacific Guano Company purchased Howland Island to provide a source of guano for its fertilizer plant. \nIn the late 19th century, British claims were made on the island, and attempts were made to set up mining. John T. Arundel and Company, a British firm using laborers from the Cook Islands and Niue, occupied the island from 1886 to 1891.\nExecutive Order 7368 was issued on May 13, 1936 to clarify American sovereignty.\nItascatown (1935\u20131942).\nIn 1935, colonists from the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project arrived on the island to establish a permanent U.S. presence in the Central Pacific. It began with a rotating group of four alumni and students from the Kamehameha School for Boys, a private school in Honolulu. Although the recruits had signed on as part of a scientific expedition and expected to spend their three-month assignment collecting botanical and biological samples, once out to sea, they were told, according to one of the Jarvis Island colonists, George West, \"Your names will go down in history\" and that the islands would become \"famous air bases in a route that will connect Australia with California\".\nThe settlement was named Itascatown after the USCGC \"Itasca\" that brought the colonists to Howland and made regular cruises between the other equatorial islands during that era. Itascatown was a line of a half-dozen small wood-framed structures and tents near the beach on the island's western side. The fledgling colonists were given large stocks of canned food, water, and other supplies, including a gasoline-powered refrigerator, radio equipment, medical kits, and (characteristic of that era) vast quantities of cigarettes. Fishing provided variety in their diet. Most of the colonists' endeavors involved making hourly weather observations and constructing rudimentary infrastructure on the island, including clearing a landing strip for airplanes. During this period, the island was on Hawaii time, which was then 10.5hours behind UTC. Similar colonization projects were started on nearby Baker Island and Jarvis Island, as well as Canton Island and Enderbury in the Phoenix Islands, which later became part of Kiribati. According to the 1940 U.S. census, Howland Island had a population of four people on April 1, 1940.\nKamakaiwi Field.\nGround was cleared for a rudimentary aircraft landing area during the mid-1930s in anticipation that the island might eventually become a stopover for commercial trans-Pacific air routes and also to further U.S. territorial claims in the region against rival claims from Great Britain. Howland Island was designated as a scheduled refueling stop for American pilot Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan on their round-the-world flight in 1937. Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds were used by the Bureau of Air Commerce to construct three graded, unpaved runways meant to accommodate Earhart's twin-engined Lockheed Model 10 Electra.\nThe facility was named \"Kamakaiwi Field\" after James Kamakaiwi, a young Hawaiian who arrived with the first group of four colonists. He was selected as the group's leader and spent more than three years on Howland, far longer than the average recruit. It has also been referred to as \"WPA Howland Airport\" (the WPA contributed about 20 percent of the $12,000 cost). \nEarhart and Noonan took off from Lae, New Guinea, and their radio transmissions were picked up near the island when their aircraft reached the vicinity, but they failed to arrive. It is known that they must have gotten within the radio range of Howland due to the strength of the final radio communications that morning, despite some problems with radio communication and radio direction finding. In some of the last messages recorded from them on 2 July 1937, 7:42\u00a0am, Earhart reported, \"We must be on you, but cannot see you \u2013 but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.\" At 8:43\u00a0am, Earhart reported, \"We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait.\" Between Earhart's low-on-fuel message at 7:42\u00a0am and her last confirmed message at 8:43, her signal strength remained consistent, indicating that she never left the immediate Howland area as she ran low on fuel. The U.S. Coast Guard determined this by tracking her signal strength as she approached the island, noting signal levels from her reports of 200 and 100 miles out. These reports were roughly 30 minutes apart, providing vital ground-speed clues.\nAfter the largest search and rescue attempt in history up to that time, the U.S. Navy concluded that the Electra had run out of fuel, and Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea and perished. Based on the strength of the transmission signals from Earhart, the Coast Guard concluded that the plane ran out of fuel north of Howland. Many later studies came to the same conclusion; however, an alternative hypothesis that Earhart and Noonan may have landed the plane on Gardner Island (now called Nikumaroro) and died as castaways has been considered.\nJapanese attacks during World War II.\nA Japanese air attack on December 8, 1941, by 14 twin-engined Mitsubishi G3M \"Nell\" bombers of Chitose K\u014dk\u016btai, from Kwajalein islands, killed colonists Richard \"Dicky\" Kanani Whaley and Joseph Kealoha Keli\u02bbihananui. The raid came one day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It damaged the three airstrips of Kamakaiwi Field. Two days later, shelling from a Japanese submarine destroyed what was left of the colony's buildings. A single bomber returned twice during the following weeks and dropped more bombs on the rubble. The two survivors were finally evacuated by the , a U.S. Navy destroyer, on January 31, 1942. Thomas Bederman, one of the two survivors, later recounted his experience during the incident in a March 9, 1942 edition of \"Life\". Howland was occupied by a battalion of the United States Marine Corps in September1943 and was known as Howland Naval Air Station until May1944.\nAll attempts at habitation were abandoned after 1944. Colonization projects on the other four islands, also disrupted by the war, were abandoned. No aircraft is known to have landed on the island, though anchorages nearby were used by float planes and flying boats during World War II. For example, on July 10, 1944, a U.S. Navy Martin PBM-3-D Mariner flying boat (BuNo 48199), piloted by William Hines, had an engine fire and made a forced landing in the ocean off Howland. Hines beached the aircraft, and though it burned, the crew were unharmed, rescued by the , transferred to a subchaser, and taken to Canton Island.\nNational Wildlife Refuge.\nOn June 27, 1974, Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton created Howland Island National Wildlife Refuge, which was expanded in 2009 to add submerged lands within of the island. The refuge now includes of land and of water. Along with six other islands, the island was administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex. In January2009, that entity was upgraded to the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument by President George W. Bush.\nMultiple invasive exotic species have affected the island habitat. Black rats were introduced in 1854 and eradicated in 1938 by feral cats introduced the year before. The cats proved destructive to bird species and were eliminated by 1985. Pacific crabgrass continues to compete with local plants.\nPublic entry to the island is allowed with a special use permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and it is generally restricted to scientists and educators. Representatives from the agency visit the island on average once every two years, often coordinating transportation with amateur radio operators or the U.S. Coast Guard to defray the high cost of logistical support.\nEarhart Light.\nColonists sent to the island in the mid-1930s to establish possession by the United States, built the Earhart Light (), named after Amelia Earhart, as a day beacon or navigational landmark. It is shaped like a short lighthouse. It was constructed of white sandstone with painted black bands and a black top meant to be visible several miles out to sea during daylight hours. It is located near the boat landing in the middle of the west coast, near Itascatown. The beacon was partially destroyed early in World War II by Japanese attacks but was rebuilt in the early 1960s by men from the U.S. Coast Guard ship \"Blackhaw\". By 2000, the beacon was reported to be crumbling, and it had not been repainted in decades.\nAnn Pellegreno overflew the island in 1967, and Linda Finch did so in 1997 during memorial circumnavigation flights to commemorate Earhart's 1937 world flight. No landings were attempted, but Pellegreno and Finch flew low enough to drop a wreath on the island.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated in the Carpathian Basin, it has a land area of 93,030 square km, measuring about 250\u00a0km from north to south and 524\u00a0km from east to west. It has 2,106\u00a0km of boundaries, shared with Slovakia to the north, Ukraine to the northeast, Romania to the east and southeast, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the south and southwest, Slovenia to the west and southwest, and Austria to the west.\nHungary's modern borders were first established after World War I when, by the terms of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, it lost more than 71% of what had formerly been the Kingdom of Hungary, 58.5% of its population, and 32% of the Hungarians. The country secured some boundary revisions from 1938 to 1941: In 1938 the First Vienna Award gave back territory from Czechoslovakia, in 1939 Hungary occupied Carpatho-Ukraine. In 1940 the Second Vienna Award gave back Northern Transylvania and finally Hungary occupied the B\u00e1cska and Murak\u00f6z regions during the Invasion of Yugoslavia. However, Hungary lost these territories again with its defeat in World War II. After World War II, the Trianon boundaries were restored with a small revision that benefited Czechoslovakia.\nMost of the country has an elevation of less than 200 m. Although Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains, those reaching heights of 300 m or more cover less than 2% of the country. The highest point in the country is K\u00e9kes (1,014 m) in the M\u00e1tra Mountains northeast of Budapest. The lowest spot is 77.6 m above sea level, located in the south of Hungary, near Szeged.\nThe major rivers in the country are the Danube and Tisza. The Danube is navigable within Hungary for 418 kilometers. The Tisza River is navigable for 444\u00a0km in the country. Less important rivers include the Drava along the Croatian border, the R\u00e1ba, the Szamos, the Si\u00f3, and the Ipoly along the Slovakian border. Hungary has three major lakes. Lake Balaton, the largest, is 78\u00a0km long and from 3 to 14\u00a0km wide, with an area of 600 square km. Hungarians often refer to it as the \"Hungarian Sea\". It is Central Europe's largest freshwater lake and an important recreation area. Its shallow waters offer good summer swimming, and in winter its frozen surface provides excellent opportunities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water are Lake Velence (26 square km) in Fej\u00e9r County and Lake Fert\u0151 (Neusiedler See\u2014about 82 square km within Hungary), and the artificial Lake Tisza.\nHungary has three major geographic regions (which are subdivided to seven smaller ones): the Great Alf\u00f6ld, lying east of the Danube River; the Transdanubia, a hilly region lying west of the Danube and extending to the Austrian foothills of the Alps; and the North Hungarian Mountains, which is a mountainous and hilly country beyond the northern boundary of the Great Hungarian Plain.\nThe country's best natural resource is fertile land, although soil quality varies greatly. About 70% of the country's total territory is suitable for agriculture; of this portion, 72% is arable land. Hungary lacks extensive domestic sources of energy and raw materials needed for industrial development.\nPlains and hills.\nThe Little Alf\u00f6ld or Little Hungarian Plain is a plain (tectonic basin) of approximately 8,000\u00a0km2 in northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and eastern Austria, along the lower course of the R\u00e1ba River, with high quality fertile soils.\nThe Transdanubia region lies in the western part of the country, bounded by the Danube River, the Drava River, and the remainder of the country's border with Slovenia and Croatia. It lies south and west of the course of the Danube. It contains Lake Fert\u0151 and Lake Balaton. The region consists mostly of rolling hills. Transdanubia is primarily an agricultural area, with flourishing crops, livestock, and viticulture. Mineral deposits and oil are found in Zala county close to the border of Croatia.\nThe Great Alf\u00f6ld contains the basin of the Tisza River and its branches. It encompasses more than half of the country's territory. Bordered by mountains on all sides, it has a variety of terrains, including regions of fertile soil, sandy areas, wastelands, and swampy areas. Hungarians have inhabited the Great Plain for at least a millennium. Here is found the puszta, a long, and uncultivated expanse (the most famous such area still in existence is the Hortob\u00e1gy National Park), with which much Hungarian folklore is associated. In earlier centuries, the Great Plain was unsuitable for farming because of frequent flooding. Instead, it was the home of massive herds of cattle and horses. In the last half of the 19th century, the government sponsored programs to control the riverways and expedite inland drainage in the Great Plain. With the danger of recurrent flooding largely eliminated, much of the land was placed under cultivation, and herding ceased to be a major contributor to the area's economy.\nMountains.\nAlthough the majority of the country has an elevation lesser than 300 m, Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains. They can be classified to four geographic regions, from west to east: Alpokalja, Transdanubian Mountains, Mecsek and North Hungarian Mountains. Alpokalja (literally \"the foothills of the Alps\") is located along the Austrian border; its highest point is \u00cdrott-k\u0151 with an elevation of 882 metres. The Transdanubian Mountains stretch from the west part of Lake Balaton to the Danube Bend near Budapest, where it meets the North Hungarian Mountains. Its tallest peak is the 757 m high Pilis. Mecsek is the southernmost Hungarian mountain range, located north from P\u00e9cs - Its highest point is the Zeng\u0151 with 682 metres.\nThe North Hungarian Mountains lie north of Budapest and run in a northeasterly direction south of the border with Slovakia. The higher ridges, which are mostly forested, have rich coal and iron deposits. Minerals are a major resource of the area and have long been the basis of the industrial economies of cities in the region. Viticulture is also important, producing the famous Tokaji wine. The highest peak of it is the K\u00e9kes, located in the M\u00e1tra mountain range.\nClimate.\nHungary has a mainly continental climate with the rest of the Pannonian Plain, with cold winters and warm to hot summers. The average annual temperature is about , in summer , and in winter , with extremes ranging from about in summer to in winter. Average yearly rainfall is about . Distribution and frequency of rainfall are unpredictable. The western part of the country usually receives more rain than the eastern part, where severe droughts may occur in summertime. Weather conditions in the Great Plain can be especially harsh, with hot summers, cold winters, and scant rainfall.\nBy the 1980s, the countryside was beginning to show the effects of pollution, both from herbicides used in agriculture and from industrial pollutants. Most noticeable was the gradual contamination of the country's bodies of water, endangering fish and wildlife. Although concern was mounting over these disturbing threats to the environment, no major steps had yet been taken to arrest them.\nRivers and lakes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAgriculture.\nHungary, with its plains and hilly regions, is highly suitable for agriculture.\nArable land.\nDoubtless, one of Hungary's most important natural resources is arable land. It covers about 48.57% of the country, which is outstanding in the world (see the related ). The mass majority of the fertile soil has a good quality.\nThe most important agricultural zones are the Little Hungarian Plain (it has the highest quality fertile soil in average), Transdanubia, and the Great Hungarian Plain. The last covers more than half of the country (52,000\u00a0km2 in number), whereas soil quality varies extremely; the territory even contains a small, grassy semi-desert, the so-called puszta (steppe in English). Puszta is exploited by sheep and cattle raising.\nThe most important Hungarian agricultural products include corn, wheat, barley, oat, sunflower, poppy, [[potato]], [[millet]], [[beet|sugar-beet]], [[flax]], and many other plants. There are also some newly naturalized plants too, for example [[amaranth]]. [[Poppy seed]] is part of the traditional [[Hungarian cuisine]].\n[[File:Paprikahungarian.jpg|right|thumb|A greengrocer's in Hungary]] The country is well known for producing high quality [[Capsicum annuum|peppers]], which are often made into [[paprika]]. There are numerous fruits reared, including many subspecies of [[apple]], [[pear]], [[peach]], [[grape]], [[apricot]], [[watermelon]], [[cantaloupe]], etc.\nHungary does not grow any [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]] products, thus these products are mainly imported from the [[United States]]. They cannot, however, be distributed without a mark on the wrapping.\nViticulture.\nWine production has a long history in Hungary. There are two languages in [[Europe]] in which the word for \"wine\" does not derive from the [[Latin language|Latin]], being [[Greek language|Greek]] \u2013 and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. The Hungarian word is \"bor\".\nViticulture has been recorded in the territory of today's Hungary since the Roman times, who were responsible for the introduction of the cultivation of wines. The arriving Hungarians took over the practice and have maintained it ever since.\nToday, there are numerous wine regions in Hungary, producing quality and inexpensive wines as well, comparable to Western European ones. The majority of the country's wine regions are located in the mountains or in the hills, such as [[Transdanubian Mountains]], [[North Hungarian Mountains]], [[Vill\u00e1ny Mountains]], and so on. Important ones include the regions of [[Eger]], [[Haj\u00f3s]], [[Soml\u00f3]], [[Sopron]], [[Vill\u00e1ny]], [[Szeksz\u00e1rd]], and [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]].\nForestry.\n19% of the country is covered by [[forest]]s. These are mainly mountainous areas, such as the North Hungarian and the Transdanubian Mountains, and the [[Alpokalja]]. The composition of forests is various, with trees like [[fir]], [[beech]], [[oak]], [[willow]], [[acacia]], [[Platanus|plane]], etc. \nPolitical geography.\nHungary's current [[Counties of Hungary|counties]] are largely based on the country's historic regions. The counties are subdivided into \"[[Districts of Hungary|district]]s\" (\"j\u00e1r\u00e1s\"), and these are further divided into \"[[municipality|municipalities]]\" (\"telep\u00fcl\u00e9s\").

The population composition at the foundation of Hungary (895) depends on the size of the arriving Hungarian population and the size of the Slavic (and remains of Avar-Slavic) population at the time. One source mentions 200,000 Slavs and 400,000 Hungarians, while other sources often don't give estimates for both, making comparison more difficult. The size of the Hungarian population around 895 is often estimated between 120,000 and 600,000, with a number of estimates in the 400-600,000 range. Other sources only mention a fighting force of 25,000 Magyar warriors used in the attack, while declining to estimate the total population including women and children and warriors not participating in the invasion. In the historical demographics the largest earlier shock was the Mongol Invasion of Hungary, several plagues also took a toll on the country's population.\nAccording to demographers, about 80 percent of the population was made up of Hungarians before the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. However, the Hungarian ethnic group became a minority in its own country in the 18th century due to centuries long Ottoman and Habsburg wars, the resettlement policies and continuous immigration from neighboring countries. Major territorial changes made Hungary ethnically homogeneous after World War I. Nowadays, more than nine-tenths of the population is ethnically Hungarian and speaks Hungarian as the mother tongue.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nPopulation over time.\nNote: The data refer to the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, and not that of the present-day republic.\nDemographic changes in pre-Trianon Hungary (1867\u20131914).\nFertility.\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period in the present-day Hungary. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.\nTotal Fertility Rate by county\nSource: 2011 census \nLife expectancy.\nInfant mortality rate.\nThe infant mortality rate (IMR) decreased considerably after WW II. In 1949, the IMR was 91.0. The rate decreased to 47.6 in 1960, 35.9 in 1970, 23.2 in 1980, 14.8 in 1990, 9.2 in 2000 and reached an all-time low in 2023 at 3.1 per 1000 live born children.\nVital statistics.\nSource: Hungarian Central Statistical Office\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nStructure of the population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.01.2021) (Data refer to usual resident population.): \nVital statistics by county.\nThere are large variations in the birth rates as of 2016: Zala County has the lowest birth rate with 7.5 births per thousand inhabitants, while Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg County has the highest birth rate with 11.2 births per thousand inhabitants.\nThe death rates also differ greatly from as low as 11.3 deaths per thousand inhabitants in Pest County to as high as 15.7 deaths per thousand inhabitants in B\u00e9k\u00e9s County.\nEthnic groups and language.\nSource:\nHistory and census numbers.\nHungary before the Treaty of Trianon (4 June 1920)\nHungary lost 64% of its total population in consequence of the Treaty of Trianon, decreasing from 20.9\u00a0million to 7.6\u00a0million, and 31% (3.3 out of 10.7\u00a0million) of its ethnic Hungarians, Hungary lost five of its ten most populous cities.\nAccording to the census of 1910, the largest ethnic group in the Kingdom of Hungary were Hungarians, who were 54.5% of the population of Kingdom of Hungary, excluding Croatia-Slavonia.\nAlthough the territories of the former Kingdom of Hungary that were assigned by the treaty to neighbouring states in total had a majority of non-Hungarian population, they also included areas of Hungarian majority and significant Hungarian minorities, numbering 3,318,000 in total.\nThe number of Hungarians in the different areas based on census data of 1910. The present day location of each area is given in parentheses.\nNon-Hungarian population in the Kingdom of Hungary, based on 1910 census data\nRomanians, Slovaks, Ruthenians, Serbs, Croats and Germans, who represented the majority of the populations of the above-mentioned territories:\nPost-Trianon Hungary\nAccording to the 1920 census 10.4% of the population spoke one of the minority languages as mother language:\nThe number of bilingual people was much higher, for example 1,398,729 people spoke German (17%), 399,176 people spoke Slovak (5%), 179,928 people spoke Croatian (2.2%) and 88,828 people spoke Romanian (1.1%). Hungarian was spoken by 96% of the total population and was the mother language of 89%. The percentage and the absolute number of all non-Hungarian nationalities decreased in the next decades, although the total population of the country increased.\nNote: 300.000 Hungarian refugees fled to Hungary from the territory of successor states (Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) after the WW I.\nFrom 1938 to 1945\nHungary expanded its borders with territories from Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia following the First Vienna Award (1938) and Second Vienna Award (1940). The remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia and parts of Yugoslavia were occupied and annexed in 1939 and 1941, respectively. Regarding Northern Transylvania, the Romanian census from 1930 counted 38% Hungarians and 49% Romanians, while the Hungarian census from 1941 counted 53.5% Hungarians and 39.1% Romanians. The territory of B\u00e1cska had 789,705 inhabitants, and 45,4% or 47,2% declared themselves to be Hungarian native speakers or ethnic Hungarians. The percentage of Hungarian speakers was 84% in southern Czechoslovakia and 25% in the Sub-Carpathian Rus.\nAfter WW II: 1949\u20131990\nAfter World War II, about 200,000 Germans were deported to Germany according to the decree of the Potsdam Conference. Under the forced exchange of population between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, approximately 73,000 Slovaks left Hungary. After these population movements Hungary became an ethnically almost homogeneous country except the rapidly growing number of Romani people in the second half of the 20th century.\nFor historical reasons, significant Hungarian minority populations can be found in the surrounding countries, notably in Ukraine (in Transcarpathia), Slovakia, Romania (in Transylvania), and Serbia (in Vojvodina). Austria (in Burgenland), Croatia, and Slovenia (Prekmurje) are also host to a number of ethnic Hungarians.\n2001\u20132022\nHistorical ethnic groups of Hungary.\nWhen the Hungarians invaded the Carpathian Basin, it was inhabited by Slavic and Avar peoples. Written sources from the 9th century also suggest that some groups of Onogurs and Bulgars occupied the valley of the river Mure\u0219 at the time of the Magyars\u2019 invasion. There is a dispute as to whether Romanian population existed in Transylvania during that time.\nThe Roma minority\nThe first Romani groups arrived in Hungary in the fifteenth century from Turkey. Nowadays, the real number of Roma in Hungary is a disputed question.\nIn the 2001 census only 190 046 (2%) called themselves Roma, but experts and Roma organisations estimate that there are between 450,000 and 1,000,000 Roma living in Hungary. Since then, the size of the Roma population has increased rapidly. Today every fifth or sixth newborn child belongs to the Roma minority. Based on current demographic trends, a 2006 estimate by Central European Management Intelligence claims that the proportion of the Roma population will double by 2050, putting the percentage of its Roma community at around 14-15% of the country's population.\nThere are problems related to the Roma minority in Hungary, and the very subject is a heated and disputed topic.\nObjective problems:\nKabars\nThree Kabar tribes joined to the Hungarians and participated in the Hungarian conquest of Hungary. They settled mostly in Bihar county.\nB\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9nys\nThe Muslim B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9nys migrated to the Carpathian Basin in the course of the 10th-12th centuries and they were composed of various ethnic groups. Most of them must have arrived from Volga Bulgaria and Khwarezm.\nPechenegs\nCommunities of Pechenegs (Beseny\u0151 in Hungarian) lived in the Kingdom of Hungary from the 11-12th centuries. They were most numerous in the county of Tolna.\nOghuz Turks (Ouzes)\nSmaller groups of Oghuz Turk settlers ('\u00dazok' or 'Fekete Kunok/Black Cumans' in Hungarian) came to the Carphatian Basin from the middle of the 11th century. They were settled mostly in Barcas\u00e1g. The city of \u00d3zd got its name after them.\nJassics\nThe Jassic (J\u00e1sz in Hungarian) people were a nomadic tribe which settled -with the Cumans- in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 13th century. Their name is almost certainly related to that of the Iazyges. B\u00e9la IV, king of Hungary granted them asylum and they became a privileged community with the right of self-government. During the centuries they were fully assimilated to the Hungarian population, their language disappeared, but they preserved their Jassic identity and their regional autonomy until 1876. Over a dozen settlements in Central Hungary (e.g. J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny, J\u00e1sz\u00e1roksz\u00e1ll\u00e1s, J\u00e1szf\u00e9nyszaru) still bear their name.\nCumans\nDuring the Russian campaign, the Mongols drove some 200,000 Cumans, a nomadic tribe who had opposed them, west of the Carpathian Mountains. There, the Cumans appealed to King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary for protection. In the Kingdom of Hungary, Cumans created two regions named Cumania (\"Kuns\u00e1g\" in Hungarian): Greater Cumania (\"Nagykuns\u00e1g\") and Little Cumania (\"Kiskuns\u00e1g\"), both located the Great Hungarian Plain. Here, the Cumans maintained their autonomy, language and some ethnic customs well into the modern era. According to P\u00e1l\u00f3czi's estimation originally 70\u201380,000 Cumans settled in Hungary.\nRomanians\nThe oldest extant documents from Transylvania make reference to Vlachs too. Regardless of the subject of Romanian presence/non-presence in Transylvania prior to the Hungarian conquest, the first chronicles to write of Vlachs in the intra-Carpathian regions is the \"Gesta Hungarorum\", while the first written Hungarian sources about Romanian settlements derive from the 13th century, record was written about \"Olahteluk\" village in Bihar County from 1283. The 'land of Romanians', \"Terram Blacorum\" (1222, 1280) showed up in Fogaras and this area was mentioned under different name (Olachi) in 1285. The first appearance of a probably Romanian name 'Ola' in Hungary derives from a charter (1258).\nThey were a significant population in Transylvania, Banat, Maramure\u0219 and Partium (Cri\u0219ana). There are different estimations in connection with number of Romanians in Kingdom of Hungary. According to a research based on place-names made by Istv\u00e1n Kniezsa, 511 villages of Transylvania and Banat appear in documents at the end of the 13th century, however only 3 of them bore Romanian names, and around 1400\u00a0AD, Transylvania and Banat consisted of 1757 villages, though only 76 (4.3%) of them had names of Romanian origin. The number of Romanians started to increase significantly from the Early modern period, and by 1700 the Romanian ethnic group consisted of 40 percent of the Transylvanian population and their number raised even more in the 18th century. Although, in 1574, Pierre Lescalopier, relating his voyage from Venice to Constantinople, claimed that most of the inhabitants of Transylvania were Romanians and according to other estimates, the Romanian inhabitants who were primarily peasants, consisted of more than 60 percent of the population in 1600. Jean W. Sedlar estimates that Vlachs (Romanians) constituted about two-thirds of Transylvania's population in 1241 on the eve of the Mongol invasion, however according to K\u00e1roly Kocsis and Eszter Kocsisn\u00e9 Hodosi the Hungarian ethnic group in Transylvania was in decent majority before Battle of Moh\u00e1cs and only lost its relative majority by the 17th century. Nevertheless, Grigore Ureche in \"Letopise\u021bul \u021a\u0103rii Moldovei\" (1642 - 1647) noticed that in Transylvania Romanians were more numerous than Hungarians. Official censuses with information on Hungary's ethnic composition have been conducted since the 19th century.\nIn 1881, Romanian-majority settlements projected to the present-day territory of Hungary were: Bed\u0151, Csenger\u00fajfalu, K\u00e9tegyh\u00e1za, K\u00f6r\u00f6sszak\u00e1l, Magyarcsan\u00e1d, M\u00e9hker\u00e9k, Mez\u0151peterd, Pusztaottlaka and Vekerd.\nImportant communities lived in the villages of Battonya, Elek, K\u00f6r\u00f6sszegap\u00e1ti, L\u00e9tav\u00e9rtes, Ny\u00edradony, Pocsaj, Sarkadkereszt\u00far, Zs\u00e1ka and in the town of Gyula.\nSlovaks\nThe Slovak people lived mainly in Upper Hungary, northern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. Due to post-Ottoman resettlements, the regions of Vojvodina, Banat and B\u00e9k\u00e9s county received bigger Slovak communities in the 18th century, which revitalized many deserted villages and towns, such as B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba, where Slovaks became the biggest ethnic group, or Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, where they comprised more than a third of the population in 1881. After WWII a major population exchange with Czechoslovakia was carried out: 71,787 or 73,200 Slovaks from Hungary were transferred to Slovakia \u2013 the exact number depends on source consulted \u2013 were resettled in South Slovakia in exchange for, according to different estimations, 45,000 or 120,000 Hungarians.\nSerbs\nFrom the 14th century, escaping from the Ottoman threat, a large number of Serbs migrated to the Hungarian Kingdom. After the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, most of the territory of Hungary got into Ottoman rule. In that time, especially in the 17th century, many Serb, and other Southern Slavic immigrants settled in Hungary. Most of the Ottoman soldiers in the territory of present-day Hungary were South Slavs (the Janissary). After the Turkish withdrawal, Kingdom of Hungary came under Habsburg rule, a new wave of Serb refugees migrated to the area around 1690, as a consequence of the Habsburg-Ottoman war. In the first half of the 18th century, Serbs and South Slavs were ethnic majority in several cities in Hungary.\nGermans\nThree waves of German migration can be distinguished in Hungary before the 20th century. The first two waves settled in Upper Hungary and in Southern Transylvania (Transylvanian Saxons), with the first being in the 11th century and the second in the 13th century.\nThe third, largest wave of German-speaking immigrants into Hungary occurred after the withdrawal of the Ottoman Empire from Hungarian territory, after the Treaty of Karlowitz. Between 1711 and 1780, German-speaking settlers immigrated to the regions of Southern Hungary, mostly region of B\u00e1n\u00e1t, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog, Baranya and Tolna counties (as well as into present-day Romania and Yugoslavia), which had been depopulated by the Ottoman wars. At the end of the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary contained over one million German-speaking residents (collectively known as Danube Swabians). In 2011, 131,951 people declared to be German in Hungary (1,6%).\nRusyns\nRusyns had lived mostly in Carpathian Ruthenia, Northeast Hungary, however significant Rusyn population appeared in Vojvodina from the 18th century.\nCroats\nCroatia was in personal union with Hungary from 1102. Croat communities were spread mostly in the western and southern part of the country and along the Danube, including Budapest.\nPoles\nThe Poles lived at the northern borders of Kingdom of Hungary from the arrival of the Hungarians.\nSlovenes\nThe Slovenes (\"Vendek\" in Hungarian) lived in the western part of the Carpathian basin before the Hungarian conquest. In the 11th and 12th century, the current linguistic and ethnic border between the Hungarian and Slovene people was established. Nowadays, they live in Vendvid\u00e9k (\"Slovenska krajina\" in Slovenians) between the Mura and the R\u00e1ba rivers. In 2001, there were around 5,000 Slovenes in Hungary.\nJews\nThe first historical document about Jews of Hungary is the letter written about 960 to King Joseph of the Khazars by Hasdai ibn Shaprut, the Jewish statesman of C\u00f3rdoba, in which he says Jews living in \"the country of Hungarin\". There are Jewish inscriptions on tombs and monuments in Pannonia (Roman Hungary) dated to the second or third century CE.\nArmenians\nThe first Armenians came to Hungary from the Balkans in the 10 - 11th century.\nGreeks\nGreeks migrated to Kingdom of Hungary from the 15th and 16th centuries. Mass migrations did not occur until the 17th century, the largest waves being in 1718 and 1760\u20131770; they were primarily connected to the economic conditions of the period. It is estimated that 10,000 Greeks emigrated to Hungary in the second half of the 18th century. A number of Greeks Communists escaped to Hungary\nafter the Greek Civil War, notably in the 'Greek' village of Beloiannisz.\nBulgarians\nThe town of Szentendre and the surrounding villages were inhabited by Bulgarians since the Middle Ages. However, present day Bulgarians are largely descended from gardeners who migrated to Hungary from the 18th century.\nReligion.\nThe majority of Hungarians became Christian in the 11th century. Hungary remained predominantly Catholic until the 16th century, when the Reformation led to the first Lutherans, and later Calvinists, which were embraced by nearly the entire Hungarian population at the time.\nIn the second half of the 16th century, Jesuits led a successful campaign of counterreformation among the Hungarians, although Protestantism survived as the faith of a significant minority, especially in the far east and northeast of the country. Orthodox Christianity in Hungary has been the religion mainly of some national minorities in the country, notably Romanians, Rusyns, Ukrainians, and Serbs.\nFaith Church, one of Europe's largest Pentecostal churches, is also located in Hungary. Hungary has historically been home to a significant Jewish community.\nAccording to 2011 census data, Christianity is the largest religion in Hungary, with around 5.2\u00a0million adherents (52.9%), while the largest denomination in Hungary is the Catholic Church (38.9% \u2014 Latin Church 37.1%; Hungarian Greek Catholic Church 1.8%). There is a significant Calvinist minority (11.6% of the population) and smaller Lutheran (2.2%), Orthodox (0.1%) and Jewish (0.1%) minorities. However, these census figures are representative of religious affiliation rather than attendance; around 12% of Hungarians attend religious services more than least once a week and around 50% more than once a year, while 30% of Hungarians do not believe in God at all. The census showed a large drop of religious adherents who wish to answer, from 74.6% to 54.7% in ten years' time, replacing them by people either who do not wish to answer or people who are not following a religion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prime minister is the head of government of a pluriform multi-party system, while the president is the head of state and holds a largely ceremonial position. As of 2024, The country is considered \"no longer a full democracy\" by the EU, and is generally said to have democratically backslid since 2010 when the Fidesz\u2013KDNP Party Alliance led by Viktor Orb\u00e1n won a two-third parliamentary supermajority and adopted a new constitution of Hungary that have both remained in place since.\nExecutive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the parliament. The party system since the last elections has been dominated by the conservative Fidesz. The three larger oppositions are Democratic Coalition (DK), Momentum and Jobbik; there are also opposition parties with a small fraction in parliament (e.g. Politics Can Be Different). The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nHungary is an independent state, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004. Since 1989 Hungary has been a parliamentary republic. Legislative power is exercised by the unicameral National Assembly that consists of 199 members. Members of the National Assembly are elected for four years.\nIn the April 2022 election, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n won a fourth consecutive term in office. His party, Fidesz, secured another two-thirds majority in parliament.\nThe longest-serving prime minister is incumbent office-holder Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who held the position from 6 July 1998 to 27 May 2002 and from 29 May 2010 until present-day. He surpassed K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza as the longest-serving prime minister on 30 November 2020. if the years are counted cumulatively, with 19 years in total as of 2025.\nExecutive branch.\nThe president of the republic, elected by the National Assembly every five years, has a largely ceremonial role, but they are nominally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and their powers include the nomination of the prime minister, who is to be elected by a majority of the votes of the members of Parliament, based on the recommendation made by the president of the republic. If the president dies, resigns or is otherwise unable to carry out his duties, the speaker of the National Assembly becomes acting president.\nDue to the Hungarian Constitution, based on the post-World War II Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, the prime minister has a leading role in the executive branch as he selects Cabinet ministers and has the exclusive right to dismiss them (similarly to the competences of the German federal chancellor). Each cabinet nominee appears before one or more parliamentary committees in consultative open hearings, survive a vote by the Parliament and must be formally approved by the president.\nThe laws are decided by the Diet of Hungary and later by the National Assembly.\nIn Communist Hungary, the executive branch of the Hungarian People's Republic was represented by the Council of Ministers.\nLegislative branch.\nThe unicameral, 199-member National Assembly (\"Orsz\u00e1ggy\u0171l\u00e9s\") is the highest organ of state authority and initiates and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. Its members are elected for a four-year term. The election threshold is 5%, but it only applies to the multi-seat constituencies and the compensation seats, not the single-seat constituencies.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nIn the 2022 Hungarian election there were two main coalitions as well as some minor parties who had the ability to put together a party list. The two largest were the right-wing FIDESZ-KDNP coalition, and the big tent (mostly from center-right to left-wing) United for Hungary a coalition which consists of the following parties: DK, MSZP, Jobbik, Dialogue-The Greens' Party, LMP - Hungary's Green Party, and Momentum. There were also associate parties and movements such as \u00daVNP, Liberals, New Start, MMM, 99 movement. There minor parties mentioned above who were not part of these two coalitions are as folllows: the far-right Our Homeland Movement which also won seats during the 2022 elections, a joke party called Hungarian Two Tailed Dog Party, Megold\u00e1s Mozgalom, a party which wants to digitalize, and a party called Norm\u00e1lis \u00c9let P\u00e1rtja primarily an anti-vaccine party. Another larger coalition was the so-called Leftist Alliance, comprising the socilaist ISZOMM (Igen Szolidait\u00e1s Mozgalom) and the communist Munk\u00e1sp\u00e1rt, and although they were unable to create a party list due to lacking enough signatures, however they still ran in 66 constituencies according to the electoral commission of Hungary \nJudicial branches.\nA fifteen-member Constitutional Court has power to challenge legislation on grounds of unconstitutionality. This body was last filled in July 2010. Members are elected for a term of twelve years. Critics of the ruling coalition contend that since the Hungarian government filled the Constitutional Court with loyal judges, the institution mostly serves to legitimize government interests and has lost its original purpose as democratic defender of the rule of law and of human rights - as several reports of independent human rights NGOs, such as the Hungarian Helsinki Committee emphasize.\nThe president of the Supreme Court of Hungary (Curia) and the Hungarian civil and penal legal system he leads is fully independent of the Executive Branch.\nThe attorney general or chief prosecutor of Hungary is currently fully independent of the executive branch, but his status is actively debated.\nSeveral ombudsman offices exist in Hungary to protect civil, minority, educational and ecological rights in non-judicial matters. They have held the authority to issue legally binding decisions since late 2003.\nFinancial branch.\nThe central bank, the Hungarian National Bank was fully self-governing between 1990 and 2004, but new legislation gave certain appointment rights to the executive branch in November 2004 which is disputed before the Constitutional Court.\nAdministrative divisions.\nHungary is divided in 19 counties (\"megy\u00e9k\", singular \u2013 \"megye\"), 23 urban counties* (\"megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1rosok\", singular \u2013 \"megyei jog\u00fa v\u00e1ros\"), and 1 capital city** (\"f\u0151v\u00e1ros\"); B\u00e1cs-Kiskun, Baranya, B\u00e9k\u00e9s, B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba*, Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n, Budapest**, Csongr\u00e1d, Debrecen*, Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros*, Eger*, \u00c9rd*, Fej\u00e9r, Gy\u0151r*, Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron, Hajd\u00fa-Bihar, Heves, H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely*, J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok, Kaposv\u00e1r*, Kecskem\u00e9t*, Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom, Miskolc*, Nagykanizsa*, N\u00f3gr\u00e1d, Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za*, P\u00e9cs*, Pest, Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n*, Somogy, Sopron*, Szabolcs-Szatm\u00e1r-Bereg, Szeged*, Szeksz\u00e1rd*, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r*, Szolnok*, Szombathely*, Tatab\u00e1nya*, Tolna, Vas, Veszpr\u00e9m, Veszpr\u00e9m*, Zala, Zalaegerszeg*\nInvolvement in international organisations.\nHungary is a member of the ABEDA, Australia Group, BIS, CE, CEI, CERN, CEPI EAPC, EBRD, ECE, EU (member, as by 1 May 2004), FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICRM, IDA, IEA, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, ITUC, NAM (guest), NATO, NEA, NSG, OAS (observer), OECD, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, SECI, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNFICYP, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNIKOM, UNMIBH, UNMIK, UNOMIG, UNU, UPU, WCO, WFTU, Visegr\u00e1d Group, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, WTrO, and the Zangger Committee.\nMinistries.\n\"Note: with restructuring and reorganisation, this information may change even within a governmental period.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13428", "revid": "49632817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13428", "title": "Economy of Hungary", "text": "The economy of Hungary is a developing, high-income mixed economy that is the 53rd-largest economy in the world (out of 188 countries measured by IMF) with $265.037 billion annual output, and ranks 41st in the world in terms of GDP per capita measured by purchasing power parity. Hungary has a very high human development index and a skilled labour force, with the 22nd lowest income inequality by Gini index in the world. Hungary has an export-oriented market economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade; thus the country is the 35th largest export economy in the world. The country had more than $100 billion of exports in 2015, with a high trade surplus of $9.003 billion, of which 79% went to the European Union (EU) and 21% was extra-EU trade. Hungary's productive capacity is more than 80% privately owned, with 39.1% overall taxation, which funds the country's welfare economy. On the expenditure side, household consumption is the main component of GDP and accounts for 50% of its total, followed by gross fixed capital formation with 22% and government expenditure with 20%.\nIn 2015 Hungary attracted $119.8 billion in FDI and invested more than $50 billion abroad. As of 2015, the key trading partners of Hungary were Germany, Austria, Romania, Slovakia, France, Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic. Major industries include food processing, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles, information technology, chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods, and tourism (in 2014 Hungary received 12.1 million international tourists). Hungary is the largest electronics producer in Central and Eastern Europe. Electronics manufacturing and research are among the main drivers of innovation and economic growth in the country. In the past 20 years Hungary has also grown into a major center for mobile technology, information security, and related hardware research.\nThe employment rate in the economy was 68.7% in January 2017, while the employment structure shows the characteristics of post-industrial economies. An estimated 63.2% of the employed workforce work in the service sector, industry contributed by 29.7%, while agriculture employed 7.1%. The unemployment rate was 3.8% in September\u2013November 2017, down from 11% during the Great Recession. Hungary is part of the European single market, which represents more than 448 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union members and by EU legislation.\nLarge Hungarian companies are included in the BUX, the Hungarian stock market index listed on Budapest Stock Exchange. Well-known companies include Graphisoft, Magyar Telekom, MKB Bank, MOL Group, Opus Global, OTP Bank, R\u00c1BA Automotive Group, Gedeon Richter and Zwack Unicum. Hungary also has a large number of specialised small and medium enterprises, for example many automotive industry suppliers and technology start ups.\nBudapest is the financial and business capital of Hungary. The capital is a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- world city in the study by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network and it is the second fastest-developing urban economy in Europe. The per capita GDP in the city increased by 2.4% and employment by 4.7% compared to the previous year, 2014. On the national level, Budapest is the primary city of Hungary for business, accounting for 39% of the national income. The city had a gross metropolitan product of more than $100 billion in 2015, making it one of the largest regional economies in the European Union. Budapest is also among the top 100 GDP performing cities in the world, as measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers. In a global city competitiveness ranking by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Budapest is ranked above Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Moscow and Johannesburg, among others.\nHungary maintains its own currency, the Hungarian forint (HUF), although the economy fulfills the Maastricht criteria with the exception of public debt. The ratio of public debt to GDP is significantly below the EU average at 66.4% in 2019. The Hungarian National Bank was founded in 1924, after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is currently focusing on price stability, with an inflation target of 3%.\nThe economy of Hungary is a high-income mixed economy, and a member of the European Union's single market. In recent years, it has become one of the faster-growing economies in the EU, transitioning towards an export-oriented market economy with a strong focus on foreign trade and investment, particularly in the automotive and electronics sectors.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Hungary's estimated annual output was $219 billion (nominal GDP) in 2024, ranking it as the 57th-largest economy in the world. In terms of GDP per capita measured by purchasing power parity (PPP), it ranked 42nd globally at approximately $47,213.\nHungary maintains a **very high Human Development Index**, ranking 47th in the 2023/24 report, and possesses a skilled labour force. The country has one of the lowest income inequalities in the EU, with a Gini coefficient of 29.6 in 2023. The economy is heavily reliant on exports, primarily to other EU nations. In 2023, its goods exports reached \u20ac149.2 billion, generating a significant trade surplus of \u20ac9.8 billion. On the expenditure side, household consumption accounts for approximately 50% of GDP, followed by gross fixed capital formation (26%) and government expenditure (18%).\nKey industries include automobile manufacturing, battery production, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. After facing the highest inflation in the EU in 2023 (averaging 17.1%), policy measures successfully brought the rate down to a forecasted 3.5% for 2025. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1% in early 2025, while the government debt-to-GDP ratio was projected to be around 72.0%. Budapest, the capital, serves as the nation's primary financial and business hub.\nHistory of the Hungarian economy.\n\u00c1rp\u00e1d Age.\nIn the age of feudalism the key economic factor was land. The new economic and social orders created private ownership of land. There are three forms of existence: the royal, ecclesiastical and secular private estate. The royal estate of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty had evolved from the tribal lands.\nThe origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estates, which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders.\nHowever, from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line. This organization developed a feudal estate, which had two elements: the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by Saint Stephen I, and then the royal donations. B\u00e9la III was the wealthiest European monarch of his time, according to a list of his revenues, but the reliability of the list is questioned. Over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king. In the Order of the laws changed in 1351, which abolished the nobility's possessions for free disposal. It forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land.\nThe Carpathian Basin was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing, and therefore increased steadily in the former weight. In the 11th and 12th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met: grazing the animals, and they used the fertilized land until depletion. The most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox.\nModern Age.\n \nThe Hungarian economy prior to World War II was primarily oriented toward agriculture and small-scale manufacturing. Hungary's strategic position in Europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade. For instance, its largest car manufacturer, Magomobil (maker of the \"Magosix\"), produced a total of a few thousand units. In the early 1920s the textile industry began to expand rapidly, by 1928 it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of Hungary exporting textile goods worth more than 60 million peng\u0151s in that year. Companies like M\u00c1VAG exported locomotives to India and South-America, its locomotive no. 601 was the largest and most powerful in Europe at the time.\nPost-war Hungarian communism.\nFrom the late 1940s, the Communist government started to nationalize the industry. At first, only factories with more than 100 workers were nationalized; later, this limit was reduced to only 10. In the agriculture, the government started a successful program of collectivization. From the early 1950s, more and more new factories were built. This rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard Stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more self-sufficient economy. Most economic activity was conducted by state-owned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms. In 1968, Stalinist self-sufficiency was replaced by the \"New Economic Mechanism\", which reopened Hungary to foreign trade, gave limited freedom to the workings of the market, and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector. \nIn this era great social progress was made, for example the population between 20 and 24 years old with less than 8 years of education decreased from 71.2% in 1949 to 4.9% in 1984, the annual consumption of meat and fish increased from 35 kilograms in 1950 to 78 in 1984, the percentage of homes with electricity increased from 46.6% in 1949 to 99% in 1984, in the same period the percentage of homes with running water increased from 17.1% to 76.6%, the number of cars per 1,000 people increased from 3 in 1960 to 122 in 1984, in the case of televisions from 10 to 276, in the case of washing machines from 45 to 317, in the case of refrigerators from 4 to 328, infant mortality (per\u00a01,000 live births) fell from 91 in 1949 to 20.4 in 1984. \nPer capita national income grew by 343% from 1950 to 1983 (4.6% per year), real wages by 136% and real incomes by 251% over the same period, meanwhile real value of per capita social benefits rose by 432% from 1960 to 1980. From 1949 to 1984, Hungary's GDP grew as fast as that of countries like Spain. \nAlso poverty was greatly reduced, although from 1962 to 1982 the price index rose by 96%, people with less than 800 forints were 55% in 1962 and after 20 years only 6.4% of those with less than 1800 forints. In 1987, inequality was minimal, with a Gini coefficient of 0.21, and poverty was the same, with a 1% poverty rate (poverty line: $120 PPP per person per month). \nAlthough Hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former Eastern Bloc even though at the end of the 1980s state employment represented 94% of the total, both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the 1970s, and Hungary's net foreign debt rose significantly\u2014from $1\u00a0billion in 1973 to $15\u00a0billion in 1993\u2014due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises. In the face of economic stagnation, Hungary opted to liberalize further by passing a joint venture law, instating an income tax, and joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. By 1988, Hungary had developed a two-tier banking system, and had enacted significant corporate legislation that paved the way for the ambitious market-oriented reforms of the post-communist years.\nTransition to a market economy (1990\u20131995).\nAfter the fall of communism, the former Eastern Bloc had to transition from a one-party, centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multi-party political system. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods, and subsidizing from the Soviet Union. Hungary, for example, \"lost nearly 70% of its export markets in Eastern and Central Europe.\" The loss of external markets in Hungary left \"800,000 unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed.\" Another form of Soviet subsidizing that greatly affected Hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programs. Because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures, many social programs in Hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending. As a result, many people in Hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy. Following privatization and tax reductions on Hungarian businesses, unemployment suddenly rose to 12% in 1991 (it was 1.7% in 1990 ), gradually decreasing until 2001. Economic growth, after a fall in 1991 to \u221211.9%, gradually grew until the end of the 1990s at an average annual rate of 4.2%. With the stabilization of the new market economy Hungary experienced growth in foreign investment, with a \"cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than $60\u00a0billion since 1989.\" \nThe Antall government of 1990\u201394 began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures, a revamped tax system, and a nascent market-based banking system. By 1994, however, the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible. Cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food, medicine, transportation services, and energy. Reduced exports to the former Soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in GDP. Unemployment rose rapidly to about 12% in 1993. The external debt burden, one of the highest in Europe, reached 250% of annual export earnings, while the budget and current account deficits approached 10% of GDP. The devaluation of the currency (in order to support exports), without effective stabilization measures, such as indexation of wages, provoked an extremely high inflation rate, that in 1991 reached 35% and slightly decreased until 1994, growing again in 1995. In March 1995, the government of Prime Minister Gyula Horn implemented an austerity program, coupled with aggressive privatization of state-owned enterprises and an export-promoting exchange raw regime, to reduce indebtedness, cut the current account deficit, and shrink public spending. By the end of 1997 the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to 4.6% of GDP\u2014with public sector spending falling from 62% of GDP to below 50%\u2014the current account deficit was reduced to 2% of GDP, and government debt was paid down to 94% of annual export earnings. \nThe Government of Hungary no longer requires IMF financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund. Consequently, Hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms. Hungary's sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investment-grade ratings from all major credit-rating agencies, although recently the country was downgraded by Moody's, S&amp;P and remains on negative outlook at Fitch. In 1995 Hungary's currency, the Forint (HUF), became convertible for all current account transactions, and subsequent to OECD membership in 1996, for almost all capital account transactions as well. Since 1995, Hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies (in which the U.S. dollar is 30%), and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate, originally set at 0.8% per month, the Forint is now an entirely free-floating currency. The government privatization program ended on schedule in 1998: 80% of GDP is now produced by the private sector, and foreign owners control 70% of financial institutions, 66% of industry, 90% of telecommunications, and 50% of the trading sector. \nAfter Hungary's GDP declined about 18% from 1990 to 1993 and grew only 1%\u20131.5% up to 1996, strong export performance propelled GDP growth to 4.4% in 1997, with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving. These successes allowed the government to concentrate in 1996 and 1997 on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system (partly modelled after Chile's pension system with major modifications), reform of higher education, and the creation of a national treasury. Remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation, maintaining stable external balances, and completing structural reforms of the tax system, health care, and local government financing. Recently, the overriding goal of Hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the European Union, which it joined in late 2004. \nPrior to the change of regime in 1989, 65% of Hungary's trade was with Comecon countries. By the end of 1997, Hungary had shifted much of its trade to the West. Trade with EU countries now comprises 80% of the total. Germany is Hungary's single most important trading partner. The US has become Hungary's sixth-largest export market, while Hungary is ranked as the 72nd largest export market for the U.S. Bilateral trade between the two countries increased 46% in 1997 to more than $1\u00a0billion. The U.S. has extended to Hungary most-favored-nation status, the Generalized System of Preferences, Overseas Private Investment Corporation insurance, and access to the Export-Import Bank. \nWith about $18\u00a0billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1989, Hungary has attracted over one-third of all FDI in central and eastern Europe, including the former Soviet Union. Of this, about $6\u00a0billion came from American companies. Foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively inexpensive labor, tax incentives, modern infrastructure, and a good telecommunications system. \nBy 2006 Hungary's economic outlook had deteriorated. Wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region; however, this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending. This resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over 10% of GDP and inflation rates predicted to exceed 6%. Nouriel Roubini, an economist in the Clinton administration, said that \"Hungary is an accident waiting to happen.\"\nPrivatization in Hungary.\nIn January 1990, the State Privatization Agency (SPA, \"\u00c1llami Vagyon\u00fcgyn\u00f6ks\u00e9g\") was established to manage the first steps of privatization. Because of Hungary's $21.2 billion foreign debt, the government decided to sell state property instead of distributing it to the people for free. The SPA was attacked by populist groups because several companies' management had the right to find buyers and discuss sale terms with them thus \"stealing\" the company. Another reason for discontent was that the state offered large tax subsidies and environmental investments, which sometimes cost more than the selling price of the company. Along with the acquisition of companies, foreign investors launched many \"greenfield investments\".\nThe center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum government of 1990\u20131994 decided to abolish agricultural co-operatives by splitting them up and giving machinery and land to their former members. The government also introduced a Recompensation Law which offered vouchers to people who had owned land before it was nationalized in 1948. These people (or their descendants) could exchange their vouchers for land previously owned by agricultural co-operatives, who were forced to give up some of their land for this purpose.\nSmall stores and retail businesses were privatized between 1990 and 1994, however, greenfield investments by foreign retail companies like Tesco, Cora and IKEA had a much bigger economic impact. Many public utilities, including the national telecommunications company Mat\u00e1v, the national oil and gas conglomerate MOL Group, and electricity supply and production company MVM Group were privatized as well.\nThough most banks were sold to foreign investors, the largest bank, National Savings Bank (OTP), remained Hungarian-owned. 20%\u201320% of the shares were sold to foreign institutional investors and given to the Social Security organizations, 5% were bought by employees, and 8% was offered at the Budapest Stock Exchange.\nHungary's economy since 1995.\nReaching 1995, Hungary's fiscal indices deteriorated: foreign investment fell as well as judgement of foreign analysts on economic outlook. Due to high demand in import goods, Hungary also had a high trade deficit and budget gap, and it could not reach an agreement with the IMF, either.\nAfter not having a minister of finance for more than a month, prime minister Gyula Horn appointed Lajos Bokros as Finance Minister on 1 March 1995. He introduced a string of austerity measures (the \"Bokros Package\") on 12 March 1995 which had the following key points: one-time 9% devaluation of the forint, introducing a constant sliding devaluation, 8% additional customs duty on all goods except for energy sources, limitation of growth of wages in the public sector, simplified and accelerated privatization. The package also included welfare cutbacks, including abolition of free higher education and dental service; reduced family allowances, child-care benefits, and maternity payments depending on income and wealth; lowering subsidies of pharmaceuticals, and raising retirement age.\nThese reforms not only increased investor confidence, but they were also supported by the IMF and the World Bank, however, they were not welcome widely by the Hungarians; Bokros broke the negative record of popularity: 9% of the population wanted to see him in an \"important political position\" and only 4% were convinced that the reforms would \"improve the country's finances in a big way\"\nIn 1996, the Ministry of Finance introduced a new pension system instead of the fully state-backed one: private pension savings accounts were introduced, which were 50% social security based and 50% funded.\nIn 2006 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny was reelected on a platform promising economic \"reform without austerity\".\nHowever, after the elections in April 2006, the Socialist coalition under Gyurcs\u00e1ny unveiled a package of austerity measures which were designed to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2008.\nBecause of the austerity program, the economy of Hungary slowed down in 2007.\nGreat Recession.\nDeclining exports, reduced domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation affected Hungary during the Great Recession, making the country enter a severe recession of \u22126.4%, one of the worst economic contractions in its history.\nOn 27 October 2008, Hungary reached an agreement with the IMF and EU for a rescue package of US$25 billion, aiming to restore financial stability and investors' confidence.\nBecause of the uncertainty of the crisis, banks gave less loans which led to a decrease in investment. This along with price-awareness and fear of bankruptcy led to a fallback in consumption which then increased job losses and decreased consumption even further. Inflation did not rise significantly, but real wages decreased.\nThe fact that the euro and the Swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people. According to The Daily Telegraph, \"statistics show that more than 60 percent of Hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies\". After the election in 2010 of the new Fidesz-party government of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungarian banks were forced to allow the conversion of foreign-currency mortgages to the forint. The new government also nationalized $13 billion of private pension-fund assets, which could then be used to support the government debt position.\nPost 2008 recession Hungarian economy.\nThe economy showed signs of recovery in 2011 with decreasing tax rates and a moderate 1.7 percent GDP growth.\nFrom November 2011 to January 2012, all three major credit rating agencies downgraded Hungarian debt to a non-investment speculative grade, commonly called \"junk status\". In part this is because of political changes creating doubts about the independence of the Hungarian National Bank.\nEuropean Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso wrote to Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n stating that new central bank regulations, allowing political intervention, \"seriously harm\" Hungary's interests, postponing talks on a financial aid package. Orb\u00e1n responded \"If we don't reach an agreement, we'll still stand on our own feet.\"\nThe European Commission launched legal proceedings against Hungary on 17 January 2012. The procedures concern Hungary's central bank law, the retirement age for judges and prosecutors and the independence of the data protection office, respectively. One day later Orb\u00e1n indicated in a letter his willingness to find solutions to the problems raised in the infringement proceedings. On 18 January he participated in plenary session of the European Parliament which also dealt with the Hungarian case. He said \"Hungary has been renewed and reorganised under European principles\". He also said that the problems raised by the European Union can be resolved \"easily, simply and very quickly\". He added that none of the EC's objections affected Hungary's new constitution.\nFollowing the mild recession of 2012, the GDP picked up again from 2014, and based on the commission's Winter 2015 forecast it was projected to have accelerated to 3.3%. The more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation. The surge (3.8% in the first half of 2014), however was only achieved via temporary measures and factors, such as the stepped-up absorption of EU-funds and the central bank's Funding for Growth Scheme, which subsidised loans for small-and medium-sized enterprises. The fundaments of growth didn't considerably change in 2015 as well \u2013 the government supported EU-fund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization \u2013 fueled the fair GDP growth.\nHungarian economy during and after the covid pandemic.\nThe Hungarian GDP, GDP per capita, living standards and wages have been steadily rising until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when just like the rest of Europe, the stats above tanked. GDP fell to $155 Billion, GDP PPP has fallen to $322 Billion, GDP per capita to $15,855, inflation slightly rose to 4.54%.\nNational debt rose considerably, to around 80% Debt-to-GDP from the previous 60\u201365%.\nThe country was hard hit, unemployment was also higher than average until 2021 when after the lockdowns have stopped. The GDP, GDP per capita, GDP PPP, unemployment and national debt have all recovered to and beyond their pre-covid values. On the other hand, inflation has risen to the record levels, reaching 24.5% in December 2022, being the highest in Europe.\nPhysical properties.\nNatural resources.\nHungary's total land area is 93,030\u00a0km2 along with 690\u00a0km2 of water surface area which altogether makes up 1% of Europe's area.\nNearly 75% of Hungary's landscape consists of flat plains. Additional 20% of the country's area consists of foothills whose altitude is 400 m at the most; higher hills and water surface makes up the remaining 5%.\nThe two flat plains that take up three-quarters of Hungary's area are the Great Hungarian Plain and the Little Hungarian Plain. Hungary's most significant natural resource is arable land. About 83% of the country's total territory is suitable for cultivation; of this portion, 75% (around 50% of the country's area) is covered by arable land, which is an outstanding ratio compared to other EU countries. Hungary lacks extensive domestic sources of energy and raw materials needed for further industrial development.\n19% of the country is covered by forests. These are located mainly in the foothills such as the North Hungarian and the Transdanubian Mountains, and the Alpokalja. The composition of forests is various; mostly oak or beech, but the rest include fir, willow, acacia and plane.\nIn European terms, Hungary's underground water reserve is one of the largest. Hence the country is rich in brooks and hot springs as well as medicinal springs and spas; as of 2003, there are 1250 springs that provide water warmer than 30\u00a0\u00b0C. 90% of Hungary's drinking water is mostly retrieved from such sources.\nThe major rivers of Hungary are the Danube and the Tisza. The Danube also flows through parts of Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Serbia, and Romania. It is navigable within Hungary for 418\u00a0km. The Tisza River is navigable for 444\u00a0km in the country. Hungary has three major lakes. Lake Balaton, the largest, is 78\u00a0km long and from 3 to 14\u00a0km wide, with an area of 592\u00a0km2. Lake Balaton is Central Europe's largest lake and a prosperous tourist spot and recreation area. Its shallow waters offer summer bathing and during the winter its frozen surface provides facilities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water include Lake Velence (26\u00a0km2) in Fej\u00e9r County and Lake Fert\u0151 (82\u00a0km2 within Hungary).\nThe waters of the country are in danger, since more water is going out of the county than in. In 2022, a severe drought which has impacted all of Europe is endangering among others, Lake Velence, Lake Balaton, the Danube and Tisza rivers. The flow of the aforementioned rivers have been modified in the late 19th century, and while it prevented larger floods and helped water transport, it has its downsides, such as the inability to support large-scale watering of crops, worsening the drought of 2022. Large-scale reforms and rebuilding of the Alf\u00f6ld water system is needed, but no such plans are being announced by the government as of 2022.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nHungary has 31,058\u00a0km of roads and motorways of 1,118\u00a0km. The total length of motorways has doubled in the last ten years with the most (106) kilometers built in 2006. Budapest is directly connected to the Austrian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Croatian, Romanian and Serbian borders via motorways.\nDue to its location and geographical features, several transport corridors cross Hungary. Pan-European corridors no. IV, V, and X, and European routes no. E60, E71, E73, E75, and E77 go through Hungary. Thanks to its radial road system, all of these routes touch Budapest.\nThere are five international, four domestic, four military and several non-public airports in Hungary. The largest airport is the Budapest Ferihegy International Airport (BUD) located at the southeastern border of Budapest. In 2008, the airport had 3,866,452 arriving and 3,970,951 departing passengers.\nIn 2006, the Hungarian railroad system was 7,685\u00a0km long, 2,791\u00a0km of it electrified.\nPublic utilities.\nElectricity is available in every settlement in Hungary.\nPiped gas is available in 2873 settlements, 91.1% of all of them. To avoid gas shortages due to Ukrainian pipeline shutdowns like the one in January 2009, Hungary participates both in the Nabucco and the South Stream gas pipeline projects. Hungary also has strategical gas reserves: the latest reserve of 1.2 billion cubic meters was opened in October 2009.\nIn 2008, 94.9% of households had running water. Though it is the responsibility of municipal governments to provide people with healthy water supply, the Hungarian government and the European Union offer subsidies to those who wish to develop water supplies or sewage systems. Partly because of these subsidies, 71.3% of all dwellings are connected to the sewage system, up from 50,1% in 2000.\nInternet penetration has been rising significantly over the past few years: the ratio of households having an internet connection has risen from 22.1% (49% of which was broadband) in 2005 to 48.4% (87.3% of which was broadband) in 2008.\nThe Ministry of Economy and Transport introduced the eHungary program in 2004 aiming to provide every person in Hungary with internet access by setting up \"eHungary points\" in public spaces like libraries, schools and cultural centers. The program also includes \"the introduction of the eCounsellor network \u2013 a service through which professionals provide assistance for citizens in the effective usage of electronic information, services and knowledge\".\nSectors.\nIn 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Hungary is Services with 273,851 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate and Retail Trade with 113,153 and 87,237 companies respectively.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture accounted for 4.3% of GDP in 2008 and along with the food industry occupied roughly 7.7% of the labor force. These two figures represent only the primary agricultural production: along with related businesses, agriculture makes up about 13% of the GDP. Hungarian agriculture is virtually self-sufficient and due to traditional reasons export-oriented: exports related to agriculture make up 20\u201325% of the total. About half of Hungary's total land area is agricultural area under cultivation; this ratio is prominent among other EU members. This is due to the country's favorable conditions including continental climate and the plains that make up about half of Hungary's landscape. The most important crops are wheat, corn, sunflower, potato, sugar beet, canola and a wide variety of fruits (notably apple, peach, pear, grape, watermelon, plum etc.). Hungary has several wine regions producing among others the worldwide famous white dessert wine Tokaji and the red Bull's Blood. Another traditional world-famous alcoholic drink is the fruit brandy \"p\u00e1linka\".\nMainly cattle, pigs, poultry and sheep are raised in the country. The livestock includes the Hungarian Grey Cattle which is a major tourist attraction in the Hortob\u00e1gy National Park. An important component of the country's gastronomic heritage is foie gras with about 33,000 farmers engaged in the industry. Hungary is the second largest world producer and the biggest exporter of foie gras (exporting mainly to France).\nAnother symbol of Hungarian agriculture and cuisine is the \"paprika\" (both sweet and hot types). The country is one of the leading paprika producers of the world with Szeged and Kalocsa being the centres of production.\nHungary produced, in 2018, 7.9 million tons of maize (15th largest producer in the world); 5.2 million tons of wheat; 1.8 million tons of sunflower seed (8th largest producer in the world); 1.1 million tons of barley; 1 million tons of rapeseed (14th largest producer in the world); 941 thousand tons of sugar beet, which is used to produce sugar and ethanol; 674 thousand tons of apple; 539 thousand tons of grape; 330 thousand tons of potato; 330 thousand tons of triticale; in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\nHealth care.\nHungary has a tax-funded universal health care system, organized by the state-owned National Healthcare Fund (). Health insurance is not directly paid for by children, mothers or fathers with baby, students, pensioners, people with socially poor background, handicapped people (including physical and mental disorders), priests and other church employees. Health in Hungary can be described with a rapidly growing life expectancy and a very low infant mortality rate (4.9 per 1,000 live births in 2012). Hungary spent 7.4% of the GDP on health care in 2009 (it was 7.0% in 2000), lower than the average of the OECD. Total health expenditure was 1,511 US$ per capita in 2009, 1,053 US$ governmental-fund (69.7%) and 458 US$ private-fund (30.3%) but has now risen to 2047 US$ per capita (as per 2018 data), roughly a 33% increase total, with the government funding 1439 US$ (70.3%) of the total versus the private funding 608 US$ (29.7%). This amount totals to 6.6% of the country's total GDP, roughly a percent decrease overall.\nIndustry.\nThe main sectors of Hungarian industry are heavy industry (mining, metallurgy, machine and steel production), energy production, mechanical engineering, chemicals, food industry and automobile production. The industry is leaning mainly on processing industry and (including construction) accounted for 29.32% of GDP in 2008. Due to the sparse energy and raw material resources, Hungary is forced to import most of these materials to satisfy the demands of the industry. Following the transition to market economy, the industry underwent restructuring and remarkable modernization. The leading industry is machinery, followed by chemical industry (plastic production, pharmaceuticals), while mining, metallurgy and textile industry seemed to be losing importance in the past two decades. In spite of the significant drop in the last decade, Hungary's food industry is still giving up to 14% of total industrial production and amounts to 7\u20138% of the country's exports.\nNearly 50% of energy consumption is dependent on imported energy sources. Gas and oil are transported through pipelines from Russia forming 72% of the energy structure, while nuclear power produced by the nuclear power station of Paks accounts for 53,6%.\nAutomobile production.\nHungary is a favoured destination of foreign investors of automotive industry resulting in the presence of General Motors (Szentgotth\u00e1rd), Magyar Suzuki (Esztergom), Mercedes-Benz (Kecskem\u00e9t), BMW (Debrecen), BYD (Szeged), and Audi factory (Gy\u0151r) in Central Europe.\n17% of the total Hungarian exports comes from the exports of Audi, Opel and Suzuki. The sector employs about 90,000 people in more than 350 car component manufacturing companies.\nAudi has built the largest engine manufacturing plant of Europe (third-largest in the world) in Gy\u0151r, becoming Hungary's largest exporter with total investments reaching over \u20ac3,300 million until 2007. Audi's workforce assembles the Audi TT, the Audi TT Roadster and the A3 Cabriolet in Hungary. The plant delivers engines to carmakers Volkswagen, Skoda, SEAT, and also to Lamborghini.\nDaimler-Benz invests \u20ac800 million ($1.2 billion) and creates up to 2,500 jobs at a new assembly plant in Kecskem\u00e9t, Hungary, with capacity for producing 100,000 Mercedes-Benz compact cars a year.\nOpel produced 80,000 Astra and 4,000 Vectra cars from March 1992 until 1998 in Szentgotth\u00e1rd, Hungary. Today, the plant produces about half million engines and cylinder heads a year.\nIn 2018, BMW announced that it will build a car factory near Debrecen, which will produce around 150.000 cars per year.\nIn 2021, BYD announced its plan to build a car factory near Szeged as its first European factory.\nBattery production\nHungary is rapidly becoming a significant player in the battery production industry. The country has attracted substantial investments, including a new gigafactory by the Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) in Debrecen. This factory is expected to produce 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery capacity annually by the end of the decade, enough to equip a million electric vehicles.\nServices.\nThe tertiary (service) sector is the largest component of the Hungarian economy, accounting for approximately 65.5% of GDP in 2023 and employing over 63% of the workforce. Located in the heart of Central Europe, the country's geostrategic position has been a key factor in the growth of its service sector, attracting investment in logistics, finance, and business services.\nHungary's economy is heavily reliant on foreign trade. In 2023, the total value of goods exports was \u20ac149.2 billion, while imports stood at \u20ac139.4 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of \u20ac9.8 billion. The vast majority of this trade is with other European Union member states, with Germany being the most significant trading partner.\nTourism.\nTourism remains a key sector for the Hungarian economy. In 2023, the country received 16.2 million international tourists, with tourism revenues reaching \u20ac7.1 billion, showing a strong recovery to pre-pandemic levels. One of Hungary's top tourist destinations is Lake Balaton, the largest freshwater lake in Central Europe, with a number of 1.2 million visitors in 2008. The most visited region is Budapest, the Hungarian capital attracted 3.61 million visitors in 2008.\nHungary was the world's 24th most visited country in 2011. The Hungarian spa culture is world-famous, with thermal baths of all sorts and over 50 spa hotels located in many towns, each of which offer the opportunity of a pleasant, relaxing holiday and a wide range of quality medical and beauty treatments.\nCurrency.\nThe currency of Hungary is the Hungarian forint (HUF, Ft) since 1 August 1946. A forint consists of 100 fill\u00e9rs; however, since these have not been in circulation since 1999, they are only used in accounting.\nThere are six coins (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200) and six banknotes (500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000 and 20,000). The 1 and 2 Forint coins were withdrawn in 2008, yet prices remained the same as stores follow the official rounding scheme for the final price. The 200 Forint note was withdrawn on 16 November 2009.\nSocioeconomic characteristics.\nHuman capital.\nEducation in Hungary is free and compulsory from the age of 5 to 16. The state provides free pre-primary schooling for all children, 8 years of general education and 4 years of upper secondary level general or vocational education. Higher education system follows the three-cycle structure and the credit system of the bologna process. Governments aim to reach European standards and encourage international mobility by putting emphasis on digital literacy, and enhancing foreign language studies: all secondary level schools teach foreign languages and at least one language certificate is needed for the acquisition of a diploma. Over the past decade, this resulted in a drastic increase in the number of people speaking at least one foreign language.\nHungary's most prestigious universities are:\nFinancial sources for education are mainly provided by the state (making up 5.1\u20135.3% of the annual GDP). In order to improve the quality of higher education, the government encourages contributions by students and companies. Another important contributor is the EU.\nThe system has weaknesses, the most important being segregation and unequal access to quality education. The 2006 PISA report concluded that while students from comprehensive schools did better than the OECD average, pupils from vocational secondary schools did much worse. Another problem is of the higher education's: response to regional and labour market needs is insufficient. Government plans include improving the career guidance system and establishing a national digital network that will enable the tracking of jobs and facilitate the integration into the labour market.\nBrain drain.\nHungary has one of the highest levels of citizen emigration inside the EU, particularly among young people. Of those immigrating 44% are under 30 and 77% are under 40. Most who leave the country and migrate to western or central Europe. Current immigration is exceedingly high, with 239,924 Hungarians immigrating abroad since 2010, peaking in 2015. Young women tend to be one of the main groups emigrating. The increase in immigration coincides with the Fidesz party coming to power in 2010. Common destination countries include Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom.\nCommon reasons for immigrating include low wages when compared to the rest of the EU. According to the Hungarian Central Statistical Office the number of Hungarian students enrolled in university decreased by 25% from 2003 to 2013, roughly a third of those immigrating are college graduates leading to brain drain. Compounding this is that the Hungarian Forint tends to be less stable then the Euro and often suffers from high levels of inflation. Other than economic reasons, familial, social, and educational factors also contribute. The high rate of immigration coupled with low birth rates (1.59 births per woman) results in Hungary's aging and decreasing population.\nSocial stratification.\nAs most post-communist countries, Hungary's economy is affected by its social stratification in terms of income and wealth, age, gender and racial inequalities.\nHungary's Gini coefficient of 0.269 ranks 11th in the world. The graph on the right shows that Hungary is close in equality to the world-leader Denmark. The highest 10% of the population gets 22.2% of the incomes. According to the business magazine \"Napi Gazdas\u00e1g\", the owner of the biggest fortune, 300 billion HUF, is S\u00e1ndor Demj\u00e1n. On the other hand, the lowest 10% gets 4% of the incomes. Considering the standard EU indicators (Percentage of the population living under 60% of the per capita median income), 13% of the Hungarian population is stricken by poverty. According to the Human Development Report, the country's HPI-1 value is 2.2% (3rd among 135 countries), and its HDI value is 0.879 (43rd out of 182).\nThe fertility rate in Hungary, just like in many European countries, is very low: 1.34 children/women (205th in the world) Life expectancy at birth is 73.3 years., while the expected number of healthy years is 57.6 for females and 53.5 for males. The average life expectancy overall is 73.1 years.\nHungary's GDI (gender-related development index) value of 0.879 is 100% of its HDI value (3rd best in the world). 55.5% of the female population (between 15 and 64) participate in the labour force, and the ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education is 99%.\nEthnic inequality, which strikes primarily Roma in Hungary, is a serious problem. Although the definition of the Roma identity is controversial, qualitative studies prove that the Roma employment rate decreased significantly following the fall of Communism: due to the tremendous layoffs of unskilled workers during the transition years, more than one-third of Roma were excluded from the labour market. Therefore, this ethnic conflict is inherently interconnected with the income inequalities in the country \u2013 at least two-thirds of the poorest 300,000 people in Hungary are Romas. Furthermore, ethnic discrimination is outstandingly high, 32% of Romas experience discrimination when looking for work. Consequently, new Roma entrants to the labour market are rarely able to find employment, which creates a motivation deficit and further reinforces segregation and unemployment.\nInstitutional quality.\nTwenty years after the change of the regime, corruption remains a severe issue in Hungary. According to Transparency International Hungary, almost one-third of top managers claim they regularly bribe politicians. Most people (42%) in Hungary think that the sector most affected by bribery is the political party system. Bribery is common in the healthcare system in the form of gratitude payment\u201392% of all people think that some payment should be made to the head surgeon conducting a heart operation or an obstetrician for a child birth.\nAnother problem is the administrative burden: in terms of the ease of doing business, Hungary ranks 47th out of 183 countries in the world. The five days' time required to start a new business ranks 29th, and the country is 122nd concerning the ease of paying taxes.\nIn accordance with the theory of the separation of powers, the judicial system is independent from the legislative and the executive branches. Consequently, courts and prosecutions are not influenced by the government. However, the legal system is slow and overburdened, which makes proceedings and rulings lengthy and inefficient. Such a justice system is hardly capable of prosecuting corruption and protecting the country's financial interests.\nState participation.\nMonetary policy.\nThe Hungarian organization responsible for controlling the country's monetary policy is the Hungarian National Bank (Hungarian: \"Magyar Nemzeti Bank\", MNB) which is the central bank in Hungary. According to the Hungarian Law of National Bank (which became operative in 2001. \u2013 LVIII. Law about The Hungarian National Bank), the primary objective of MNB is to achieve and maintain price stability. This aim is in line with the European and international practice.\nPrice stability means achieving and maintaining a basically low, but positive inflation rate. This level is around 2\u20132.5% according to international observations, while the European Central Bank \"aims at inflation rates of below, but close to 2% over the medium term\". Since Hungary is in the process of catching up (Balassa-Samuelson effect), the long-term objective is a slightly higher figure, around 2.3\u20133.2%. Therefore, the medium term inflation target of the Hungarian National Bank is 3%.\nConcerning the exchange rate system, the floating exchange rate system is in use since 26 February 2008, as a result of which HUF is fluctuating in accordance with the effects of the market in the face of the reference currency, the euro.\nThe chart on the right shows forint exchange rates for the British pound (GBP), euro (EUR), Swiss franc (CHF), and the U.S. dollar (USD) from June 2008 to September 2009. It indicates that a relatively strong forint weakened during the Great Recession, and that its value increased afterwards.\nCompared to the euro the forint was at peak on 18 June 2008 when 1000 Ft was \u20ac4.36 and \u20ac1 was 229.11Ft. The forint was worth the least on 6 March 2009; this day 1000 Ft was \u20ac3.16 and \u20ac1 was 316Ft).\nCompared to USD, most expensive/cheapest dates are 22 June 2008 and 6 March 2009 with 1000HUF/USD rates 6.94 and 4.01 respectively.\nOn 24 March 2015 the Euro was at 299.1450 and USD was at 274.1650,\nFiscal policy.\nIn Hungary, state revenue makes up 44% and expenditure makes up 45% of the GDP which is relatively high compared to other EU members. This can be traced back to historical reasons such as socialist economic tradition as well as cultural characteristics that endorse paternalist behaviour on the state's part, meaning that people have a habitual reflex that make them call for state subsidies. Some economists dispute this point, claiming that expenditure ran up to today's critical amount from 2001, during two left-wing government cycles.\nAlong with joining the EU the country undertook the task of joining the Eurozone as well. Therefore, the Maastricht criteria which forms the condition of joining the Eurozone acts as an authoritative guideline to Hungarian fiscal politics. Although there has been remarkable progress, recent years' statistics still point at significant discrepancies between the criteria and fiscal indices. The target date for adapting the Euro has not been fixed, either.\nGeneral government deficit has shown a drastic decline to \u22123.4% (2008) from \u22129.2% (2006). According to an MNB forecast however, until 2011, the deficit will by a small margin fall short of the 3.0% criterion.\nAnother criterion that is found lacking is the ratio of gross government debt to GDP which, since 2005, exceeds the allowed 60%. According to an ESA95 figure, in 2008 the ratio increased from 65.67% to 72.61%, which primarily results from the requisition of an IMF-arranged financial assistance package.\nHungary's balance of payments on its current account has been negative since 1995, around 6\u20138% in the 2000s reaching a negative peak 8.5% in 2008.\nTax system.\nIn Hungary, the 1988 reform of taxes introduced a comprehensive tax system which mainly consists of central and local taxes, including a personal income tax, a corporate income tax and a value added tax. Among the total tax income the ratio of local taxes is solely 5% while the EU average is 30%. Until 2010, the taxation of an individual was progressive, determining the tax rate based on the individual's income: with earning up to 1,900,000 forints a year, the tax was 18%, the tax on incomes above this limit was 36% since 1 July 2009.\nBased on the new one-rate tax regime introduced January 2011, the overall tax rate for all income-earnings bands has been 16%. According to the income-tax returns of 2008, 14,6% of taxpayers was charged for 64,5% of the total tax burdens. Before the new corporate income tax regime, the corporate tax was fixed at 16% of the positive rateable value, with an additional tax called solidarity tax of 4%, the measure of which is calculated based on the result before tax of the company (the solidarity tax has been in use since September, 2006). The actual rateable value might be different is the two cases. From January 2011, under the new corporate income tax regime the tax rate was divided into two parts (i) corporations having income before tax below 500 million HUF (appr. USD 2.5 million) was lowered to 10% and (ii) 16% remained for all other companies until 2013. After this, the unified corporate income tax rate will be 10%, irrespectively from the size of the net income before tax. In January 2017, corporate tax was unified at a rate of 9% \u2013 the lowest in the European Union. The rate of value added tax in Hungary is 27%, the highest in Europe, since 1 January 2012.\nMiscellaneous data.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132025.

The EU's free trade system helps Hungary, as it is a relatively small country and thus needs export and import.\nAfter the accession to the EU, Hungarian workers could immediately go to work to Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Other countries imposed restrictions.\nIn 2007, 25% of all exports of Hungary were of high technology, which is the 5th largest ratio in the European Union after Malta, Cyprus, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The EU10 average was 17.1% and the Eurozone average was 16% in 2007.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A part of this route is the same as where electric trams made their world first run in 1887. Since the 2000s, the Budapest tram network has been improved, by ordering new trams (Combino Supra and CAF Urbos 3) as well as extending some lines (such as line 1 to Kelenf\u00f6ld railway station).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThere were some towns, where narrow-gauge railways were used as tram lines or interurban lines (for example: S\u00e1rospatak, S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely, B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba, B\u00e9k\u00e9s, Cegl\u00e9d).

Since 2007, the Hungarian Armed Forces has been under a unified command structure. The Ministry of Defence maintains political and civil control over the army. A subordinate Joint Forces Command coordinates and commands the HDF corps. In 2020, the armed forces had 22,700 personnel on active duty. In 2019, military spending was $1.904 billion, about 1.22% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2016, the government adopted a resolution in which it pledged to increase defence spending to 2.0% of GDP and the number of active personnel to 37,650 by 2026.\nMilitary service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime. In a significant move for modernization, Hungary decided in 2001 to buy 14 JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft for about \u20ac800 million. It also bought two used Airbus A319 and two Falcon 7X transport aircraft. Three C-17 III Globemaster transport aircraft are operating from P\u00e1pa Air Base under Hungarian nationality mark but are maintained by the NATO Heavy Airlift Wing (HAW). An intensive modernization program started in 2016 under the name \"Zr\u00ednyi 2026\". New helicopters, tanks, IFVs and artillery equipment were purchased beside others. Hungarian National Cyber Security Center was re-organized in 2016.\nAs of 2016, the Hungarian military has about 700 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including 100 HDF troops in the NATO-led ISAF force in Afghanistan, 210 Hungarian soldiers in Kosovo under command of KFOR, and 160 troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hungary sent a 300-strong logistics unit to Iraq in order to help the US occupation with armed transport convoys, though public opinion opposed the country's participation in the war. One soldier was killed in action by a roadside bomb in Iraq.\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the HDF drove Habsburg forces from the country in the Spring Campaign of 1849, but was defeated by an Austro-Russian offensive in the summer. The Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d was established in 1868. During World War I, out of the eight million men mobilized by Austria-Hungary, over one million died. Conscription was introduced on a national basis in 1939. The peacetime strength of the Royal Hungarian Army grew to 80,000 men organized into seven corps commands. During World War II the Hungarian Second Army was destroyed on the banks of the Don River in December 1942 in the Battle of Stalingrad. During the Socialist and the Warsaw Pact era (1947\u20131989), the entire 200,000 strong Southern Group of Forces was garrisoned in Hungary, complete with artillery, tank regiments, air force and missile troops with nuclear weapons.\nFlag and emblem.\nThe central element of the emblem of the Hungarian Defence Forces is the Turul bird with extended wings holding the sword of King Saint Stephen in its claws. The element is surrounded by a turkey oak branch on the right and an olive branch on the left. At the meeting point of the branches is the \"Hungarian Defense Shield\" in the national color. The inscription \"A HAZ\u00c1\u00c9RT\" can be read at the top as \"for the homeland\", and \"MAGYAR HONV\u00c9DS\u00c9G\" can be read in a semicircle at the bottom as \"Hungarian Defence Forces\". The flag of the Hungarian Defence Forces is white, and the emblem is placed in the middle of the flag.\nHistory.\nAncient, medieval, and early modern military.\nThe Hungarian tribes of \"\u00c1rp\u00e1d vez\u00e9r\" who came to settle in the Carpathian Basin were noted for their fearsome light cavalry, which conducted frequent raids throughout much of Western Europe (as far as present-day Spain), maintaining their military supremacy with long-range and rapid-firing reflex bows. Not until the introduction of well-regulated, plate-armored knight heavy cavalry could German emperors stop the Hungarian armies.\nDuring the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds the light-cavalry-based army was transformed slowly into a western-style one. The light cavalry lost its privileged position, replaced by a feudal army formed mainly from heavy cavalry.\nThe Hungarian field armies were drawn up into an articulated formation (as it happened in Battle of Przemy\u015bl (1099), Battle at Leitha (1146), Battle of Morvamez\u0151 (1278), (1349), in three main battle (formation) (1146, 1278, 1349). According to the contemporary sources and later speculations, the first line was formed by light cavalry archers (Battle of Oslava (1116, 1146, 1260, 1278). Usually, they started the battle followed by a planned retreat (1116, 1146), Battle of Kressenbrunn (1260). The major decisive battles of the Hungarian army were placed in the second or third lines consisted mainly of the most valuable parts of the army \u2013 in general heavy cavalry (1146, 1278, 1349).\nThe commanders of the Hungarian Kingdom's army used different tactics, based on a recognition of their own and the enemies' (Holy Roman Empire, Pechenegs, Uzes, Cumans, Mongols, Byzantine Empire) abilities and deficiencies.\nThe Hungarian knight army had its golden age under King Louis the Great, who himself was a famed warrior and conducted successful campaigns in Italy due to family matters (his younger brother married Joanna I, Queen of Naples who murdered him later.) King Matthias Corvinus maintained very modern mercenary-based royal troops, called the \"Black Army\". King Matthias favoured ancient artillery (catapults) as opposed to cannons, which were the favourite of his father, Johannes Hunyadi, former Regent of Hungary.\nDuring the Ottoman invasion of Central Europe (between late 14th century and circa 1700) Hungarian soldiers protected fortresses and launched light cavalry attacks against the Turks (see Hungarian Hussars). The northern fortress of Eger was famously defended in the autumn of 1552 during the 39-day Siege of Eger against the combined forces of two Ottoman armies numbering circa 120,000 men and 16 ultra-heavy siege guns. The victory was very important, because two much stronger forts of Szolnok and Temesv\u00e1r had fallen quickly during the summer. Public opinion attributed Eger's success to the all-Hungarian garrison, as the above two forts had fallen due to treason by the foreign mercenaries manning them. In 1596, Eger fell to the Ottomans for the same reason.\nIn the 1566 Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r, Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi defended Szigetv\u00e1r for 30 days against the largest Ottoman army ever seen up to that day, and died leading his remaining few soldiers on a final suicide charge to become one of the best-known national heroes. His great-grandson, Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi, poet and general, became one of the better-known strategists of the 1660s. In 1686, the capital city Buda was freed from the Ottomans by an allied Christian army composed of Austrian, Hungarian, and Western European troops, each roughly one-third of the army. The Habsburg empire then annexed Hungary.\nHabsburg Hungarian military.\nUnder Habsburg rule, Hungarian Hussars rose to international fame and served as a model for light cavalry in many European countries. During the 18th and 19th centuries hundreds of thousands of forcibly enrolled Hungarian males served 12 years or more each as line infantry in the Austrian Imperial Army.\nTwo wars of independence interrupted this era, that of Prince Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi between 1703 and 1711 and that of Lajos Kossuth in 1848\u20131849. A July 11, 1848 act of parliament in Budapest called for the formation of an army, the \"Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g\", of 200,000 which would use the Magyar language of command. It was to be formed around already extant imperial units, twenty battalions of infantry, ten hussar regiments, and two regiments of Sz\u00e9kely from the Transylvanian Military Frontier. They were further joined by eight companies of two Italian regiments stationed in Hungary and parts of the Fifth Bohemian Artillery Regiment.\nIn 1848\u20131849 the Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g (mostly made up of enthusiastic patriots with no prior military training) achieved incredible successes against better-trained and -equipped Austrian forces, despite the obvious advantage in numbers on the Austrian side. The Winter Campaign of J\u00f3zef Bem and the Spring Campaign of Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey are to this day taught at prestigious military schools around the globe, including at West Point Academy in the United States. Having suffered initial setbacks, including the loss of Pest-Buda, the Honv\u00e9d took advantage of the Austrians' lack of initiative and re-formed around the Debrecen-based Kossuth government. The Hungarians advanced again and by the end of spring 1849, Hungary was basically cleared of foreign forces, and would have achieved independence, were it not for the Russian intervention. At the request of the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph, the Russians invaded with a force of 190,000 soldiers \u2013 against the Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g's 135,000 \u2013 and decisively defeated Bem's Second Army in Transylvania, opening the path into the heart of Hungary. This way the Austrian-Russian coalition outnumbered Hungarian forces 3:1, which led to Hungary's surrender at Vil\u00e1gos on 13 August 1849. S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi, the great Hungarian poet, went missing in action in the Battle of Segesv\u00e1r, against invading Russian forces.\nIn April 1867, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was established. Franz Josef, the head of the ancient Habsburg dynasty, was recognized as both Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. Nevertheless, the issue of what form the Hungarian military would take remained a matter of serious contention between Hungarian patriots and Austrian leaders. As the impasse threatened the political union, Emperor Franz Josef ordered a council of generals in November of the same year. Ultimately, the leaders resolved on the following solution: in addition to the joint (k.u.k.) army, Hungary would have its own defence force, whose members would swear their oath to the King of Hungary (who was also Emperor of Austria) and the national constitution, use the Hungarian language of command, and display their own flags and insignia. (Austria would also form its own parallel national defence force, the \"Landwehr\".) As a result of these negotiations, on 5 December 1868, the Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d (\"Magyar Kiralyi Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g\", or Defence Force) was established.\nThe Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g was usually treated generously by the Diet in Budapest. By 1873 it already had over 2,800 officers and 158,000 men organized into eighty-six battalions and fifty-eight squadrons. In 1872, the Ludovika Academy officially began training cadets (and later staff officers). Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g units engaged in manoeuvres and were organized into seven divisions in seven military districts. While artillery was not allowed, the force did form batteries of Gatling guns in the 1870s.\nIn the midst of trouble between the imperial government and the parliament in 1906, the Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g was further expanded and finally received its own artillery units. In this form, the force approached the coming world war in most respects as a truly \"national\" Hungarian army.\nWorld War I.\nHungarian soldiers \"fought with distinction\" on every front contested by Austria-Hungary in the First World War. Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g units (along with the Austrian Landwehr) were considered fit for front line combat service and equal to those of the joint forces K.U.K. army. They saw combat especially on the Eastern Front and at the Battles of the Isonzo on the Italian Front. Out of the eight million men mobilized by Austria-Hungary, over one million died. Hungarians as a national group were second only to German Austrians in their share of this burden, experiencing twenty-eight war deaths for every thousand persons.\nAfter the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in late 1918, the Red Army of the Hungarian communist state (Hungarian Soviet Republic) conducted successful campaigns to protect the country's borders. However, in the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War of 1919 Hungary came under occupation by the Romanian, Serbian, American, and French troops, as after four years of extensive fighting, the country lacked both the necessary manpower and equipment to fend off foreign invaders.\nIn accordance with the Treaty of Bucharest, upon leaving, the Romanian army took substantial compensation for reparations. This included agricultural goods and industrial machinery as well as raw materials. The Trianon Treaty limited the Hungarian National Army to 35,000 men and forbade conscription. The army was forbidden to possess tanks, heavy armor, or an air force.\nMid-twentieth century.\nOn 9 August 1919, Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy united various anti-communist military units into an 80,000-strong National Army (\"Nemzeti Hadsereg\"). On 1 January 1922, the National Army was once again redesignated the Royal Hungarian Army.\nDuring the 1930s and early 1940s, Hungary was preoccupied with the regaining the vast territories and huge amount of population lost in the Trianon peace treaty at Versailles in 1920. This required strong armed forces to defeat the neighbouring states and this was something Hungary could not afford. Instead, the Hungarian Regent, Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, made an alliance with Nazi Germany. In exchange for this alliance and via the First and Second Vienna Awards, Hungary received back parts of its lost territories from Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. Hungary was to pay dearly during and after World War II for these temporary gains.\nOn 5 March 1938, Prime Minister K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Dar\u00e1nyi announced a rearmament program (the so-called \"Gy\u0151r Programme\", named after the city where it was announced to the public). Starting 1 October, the armed forces established a five-year expansion plan with Huba I-III revised orders of battle. Conscription was introduced on a national basis in 1939. The peacetime strength of the Royal Hungarian Army grew to 80,000 men organized into seven corps commands.\nIn March 1939, Hungary launched an invasion of the newly formed Slovak Republic. Both the Royal Hungarian Army and the Royal Hungarian Air Force fought in the brief Slovak-Hungarian War. This invasion was launched to reclaim a part of the Slovakian territory lost after World War I.\nOn 1 March 1940, Hungary organized its ground forces into three field armies. The Royal Hungarian Army fielded the Hungarian First Army, the Hungarian Second Army, and the Hungarian Third Army. With the exception of the independent \"Fast Moving Army Corps\" (\"Gyorshadtest\"), all three Hungarian field armies were initially relegated to defensive and occupation duties within the regained Hungarian territories.\nWorld War II.\nIn November 1940, Hungary signed the Tripartite Pact and became a member of the Axis with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\nIn April 1941, in order to regain territory and because of the German pressure, Hungary allowed the Wehrmacht to cross her territory in order to launch the invasion of Yugoslavia. The Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00e1l Teleki who wanted to maintain a pro-allied neutral stance for Hungary, could no longer keep the country out of the war, as the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden had threatened to break diplomatic relations with Hungary if it did not actively resist the passage of German troops across its territory, and General Henrik Werth, chief of the Hungarian General Staff made a private arrangement - unsanctioned by the Hungarian government - with the German High Command for the transport of the German troops across Hungary. P\u00e1l Teleki, no longer being able to stop the unfolding events, committed suicide on April 3, 1941, and Hungary joined the war on April 11 after the proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia.\nAfter the controversial \"Kassa attack\", elements of the Royal Hungarian Army joined the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, one week later than the start of the operation. In spite of the arguments made that Hungary (unlike Romania) had no territorial claims in the Soviet Union, the fateful decision was made to join the war in the East. In the late summer of 1941, the Hungarian \"Rapid Corps\" (\"Gyorshadtest\"), alongside German and Romanian army groups, scored a huge success against the Soviets at the Battle of Uman. A little more than a year later and contrasting sharply with the success at Uman, was the near-total devastation of the Hungarian Second Army on banks of the Don River in December 1942 during the Battle for Stalingrad.\nDuring 1943, the Hungarian Second Army was rebuilt. In late 1944, as part of \"Panzerarmee Fretter-Pico\", it participated in the destruction of a Soviet mechanized group at the Battle of Debrecen. But this proved to be a Pyrrhic victory. Unable to rebuild again, the Hungarian Second Army was disbanded towards the end of 1944.\nTo keep Hungary as an ally, the Germans launched Operation Margarethe and occupied Hungary in March 1944. However, during the Warsaw Uprising, Hungarian troops refused to participate.\nOn 15 October 1944, the Germans launched Operation Panzerfaust and forced Horthy to abdicate. Pro-Nazi Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi was made prime minister by the Germans.\nOn 28 December 1944, a provisional government under the control of the Soviet Union was formed in liberated Debrecen with B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s as its prime minister. Mikl\u00f3s was the commander of the Hungarian First Army, but most of the First Army sided with the Germans and most of what remained of it was destroyed about 200 kilometres north of Budapest between 1 January and 16 February. The pro-Communist government formed by Mikl\u00f3s competed with the pro-Nazi government of Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi. The Germans, Sz\u00e1lasi, and pro-German Hungarian forces loyal to Sz\u00e1lasi fought on. On 20 January 1945, representatives of the provisional government of B\u00e9la Mikl\u00f3s signed an armistice in Moscow. But forces loyal to Sz\u00e1lasi still continued to fight on.\nThe Red Army, with assistance from Romanian army units, completed the encirclement of Budapest on 29 December 1944 and the Siege of Budapest began. On 2 February 1945, the strength of the Royal Hungarian Army was 214,465 men, but about 50,000 of these had been formed into unarmed labor battalions. The siege of Budapest ended with the surrender of the city on 13 February. But, while the German forces in Hungary were generally in a state of defeat, the Germans had one more surprise for the Soviets.\nIn early March 1945, the Germans launched the Lake Balaton Offensive with support from the Hungarians. This offensive was almost over before it began. By 19 March 1945, Soviet troops had recaptured all the territory lost during a 13-day German offensive.\nAfter the failed offensive, the Germans in Hungary were defeated. Most of what remained of the Hungarian Third Army was destroyed about 50 kilometres west of Budapest between 16 March and 25 March 1945. Officially, Soviet operations in Hungary ended on 4 April 1945 when the last German troops were expelled.\nSome pro-fascist Hungarians like Sz\u00e1lasi retreated with the Germans into Austria and Czechoslovakia. During the very last phase of the war, Fascist Hungarian forces fought in Vienna, Breslau, K\u00fcstrin, and along the Oder River.\nOn 7 May 1945, General Alfred Jodl, the German Chief of Staff, signed the document of unconditional surrender for all German forces. Jodl signed this document during a ceremony in France. On 8 May, in accordance with the wishes of the Soviet Union, the ceremony was repeated in Germany by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel. On 11 June, the Allies agreed to make 9 May 1945 the official \"Victory in Europe\" day. Sz\u00e1lasi and many other pro-fascist Hungarians were captured and ultimately returned to Hungary's provisional government for trial.\nWarsaw Pact.\nDuring the Socialist and the Warsaw Pact era (1947\u20131989), the Soviet Southern Group of Forces, 200,000 strong, was garrisoned in Hungary, complete with artillery, tank regiments, air force and missile troops (with nuclear weapons). It was, by all means, a very capable force but which had little contact with the local population. Between 1949 and 1955 there was also a huge effort to build a big Hungarian army. All procedures, disciplines, and equipment were exact copies of the Soviet Armed Forces in methods and material, but the huge costs collapsed the economy by 1956.\nDuring the autumn 1956 revolution, the army was divided. When the opening demonstrations on 23 October 1956 were fired upon by \u00c1VH secret policemen, Hungarian troops sent to crush the demonstrators instead provided their arms to the latter or joined them outright. While most major military units in the capital were neutral during the fighting, thousands of rank-and-file soldiers went over to the Revolution or at least provided the revolutionaries with arms. Many significant military units went over to the uprising in full, such as the armored unit commanded by Colonel P\u00e1l Mal\u00e9ter which joined forces with the insurgents at the Battle of the Corvin Passage. However, there were 71 recorded clashes between the people and the army between 24 and 29 October in fifty localities; these were typically either defending certain military targets from rebel attack or fighting the insurgents outright, depending on the commander. When the Soviets crushed the Revolution on 4 November, the Army put up sporadic and disorganized resistance; lacking orders, many of their divisions were simply overpowered by the invading Soviets.\nAfter the Revolution was crushed in Budapest, the Soviets took away most of the Hungarian People's Army's equipment, including dismantling the entire Hungarian Air Force, because a sizable percentage of the Army fought alongside the Hungarian revolutionaries. Three years later in 1959, the Soviets began helping rebuild the Hungarian People's Army and resupplying them with new arms and equipment as well as rebuilding the Hungarian Air Force. Satisfied that Hungary was stable and firmly committed once again to the Warsaw Pact, the Soviets offered the Hungarians a choice of withdrawal for all Soviet troops in the country. The new Hungarian leader, J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r, asked for all the 200,000 Soviet troops to stay, because it allowed the socialist Hungarian People's Republic to neglect its own draft-based armed forces, quickly leading to deterioration of the military. Large sums of money were saved that way and spent on feel-good socialist measures for the population, thus Hungary could become \"the happiest barrack\" in the Soviet Bloc. Limited modernization though, would happen from the mid-1970s onward to replace older stocks of military equipment with newer ones. Thus enabling the HPA, in a small way, to honor its Warsaw Pact commitments coupled with a mid-1980s organization which abolished divisions and replaced them with ground force brigades and a singular air force command.\nThe HPA was divided into the Ground and Air Forces. Until 1985, the Ground Forces were organized into:\nAir Forces Headquarters at Veszpr\u00e9m\nTraining for conscripts was poor and most of those drafted were actually used as a free labour force (esp. railway track construction and agricultural work) after just a few weeks of basic rifle training. Popular opinion grew very negative towards the Hungarian People's Army and most young men tried to avoid the draft with bogus medical excuses.\nThe 1990s and Twenty-first century.\nIn 1997, Hungary spent about 123 billion HUF (US$560 million) on defence. Hungary became a member of NATO on 12 March 1999. Hungary provided airbases and support for NATO's air campaign against Serbia and has provided military units to serve in Kosovo as part of the NATO-led KFOR operation. Hungary has sent a 300 strong logistics unit to Iraq in order to help the US occupation with armed transport convoys, though public opinion opposed the country's participation in the war. One soldier was killed in action due to a roadside bomb in Iraq. The parliament refused to extend the one year mandate of the logistics unit and all troops have returned from Iraq as of mid-January 2005. Hungarian troops were still in Afghanistan as of early 2005 as part of the International Security Assistance Force. There were reports that Hungary would most probably replace its old UAZ 4x4 vehicles with the modern Iveco LMV types, but it never happened. Hungarian forces deploy the Gep\u00e1rd anti-materiel rifle, which is a heavy 12.7\u00a0mm portable gun. This equipment is also in use by the Turkish and Croatian armed forces, among other armies.\nIn a significant move for modernization, Hungary decided in 2001 to lease 14 JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft (the contract includes 2 dual-seater airplanes and 12 single-seaters as well as ground maintenance facilities, a simulator, and training for pilots and ground crews) for 210 billion HUF (about 800 million EUR). Five Gripens (3 single-seaters and 2 two-seaters) arrived in Kecskem\u00e9t on 21 March 2006, expected to be transferred to the Hungarian Air Force on March 30.\n10 or 14 more aircraft of this type might follow up in the coming years.\nIn early 2015, Hungary and Sweden extended the lease-program for another 10 years with a total of 32,000 flight-hours (95% increase) for only a 45% increase in cost.\nZr\u00ednyi 2026 Modernization Program.\nIn 2016, PM Orb\u00e1n confirmed that Hungary will meet its NATO obligations by increasing its defense spending to about 2 percent of GDP. The official government \"Zr\u00ednyi 2026\" program of upgrading military equipment is scheduled to last until 2026, but the timeline has been expanded until 2030\u20132032. New purchased and ordered equipment so far includes new CZ BREN 2 assault rifles (to be manufactured locally), helicopters, transport and trainer aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles, radars and surface-to-air missiles.\nHungary ordered 20 H145M and 16 H225M in 2018. All H145M aircraft had been delivered by the end of 2021. H225M are expected to arrive between 2023 and 2024.\nIn early 2019 the first batch of Carl Gustaf M4s has arrived, starting to replace the old RPG-7s.\nIn late 2019, Hungary signed a contract for 44 Leopard 2 A7+ tanks and 24 PzH 2000 howitzers for \u20ac300 million to be delivered in 2021 to 2025. In 2020 Hungary and Rheinmetall Group have signed a contract to start manufacturing the Lynx infantry fighting vehicle family in Hungary. Estimated to start arriving around 2024\u20132025, the first batch of 200+ Lynx vehicles are expected to reach operational capability in the Hungarian Defence Forces by 2026-2027\nIn 2020 the Hungarian airforce ordered two KC-390 cargo and tanker aircraft to be delivered in 2023 and 2024. This year Kongsberg and Raytheon were awarded a 410 million EUR contract by Hungary for NASAMS surface-to air missile systems. 11 ELM-2084 radars were also ordered in late 2020. The Mistral SAM system has been upgraded: new M3 missiles were purchased and both the launchers and the MCPs were modernized.\nIn 2021 Spike LR2 anti-tank missiles has been ordered, mainly for the Lynx IFVs. In August 2021 contract has been signed with SAAB to upgrade the Hungarian Gripen fleet to the MS20 Block 2 standard. This upgrade greatly increases both Gripen's combat and communication capabilities, as well as access to a wide range of weapons that can be integrated on Hungarian Air Force Gripen fighters. The cutting edge IRIS-T missile has been also ordered in 2021. Meteor and GBU-49 is planned to be purchased for the Gripen's arsenal. There is a plan to also set up a second fighter squadron, but it has not been confirmed. \nCurrent international missions.\nThe Hungarian Defence Forces currently takes part in the following international missions:\nOther missions include: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, EUNAVFOR MED, MINURSO and EUMM\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The foreign policy of Hungary includes commitments to international development, international law, European integration, Atlantic co-operation and increased co-operation within the Global East. The Hungarian economy is fairly open and relies strongly on international trade.\nHungary has been a member of the United Nations since December 1955 and holds current membership with the European Union, NATO, the OECD, the Visegr\u00e1d Group, the WTO, the World Bank, the AIIB and the IMF. Hungary took on the presidency of the Council of the European Union for half a year in 2011 and the next will be in 2024. In 2015, Hungary was the fifth largest OECD Non-DAC donor of development aid in the world, which represents 0.13% of its Gross National Income. In this regard, Hungary stands before Spain, Israel or Russia.\nHungary's capital city, Budapest is home to more than 100 embassies and foreign representative bodies. Hungary hosts the main and regional headquarters of many international organizations as well, including European Institute of Innovation and Technology, European Police College, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, International Centre for Democratic Transition, Institute of International Education, International Labour Organization, International Organization for Migration, International Red Cross, Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe, Danube Commission and even others.\nFrom 1989, Hungary's top foreign policy goal was achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. It joined the Partnership for Peace program in 1994 and has actively supported the IFOR and SFOR missions in Bosnia. It also improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with Ukraine, Slovakia, and Romania. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary since 1989 has signed all of the OSCE documents, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing CSCE \"Helsinki Final Act\" provisions, including those on the reunification of divided families, remains among the best in Central and Eastern Europe.\nExcept for the short-lived neutrality declared by the anti-Soviet leader Imre Nagy in November 1956, Hungary's foreign policy generally followed the Soviet lead from 1947 to 1989. During the Communist period, Hungary maintained treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria. It was one of the founding members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and Comecon, and it was the first country to withdraw from those organizations. After 1989, it began to orient more towards the West, joining NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004. In 2010, Hungary initiated its Eastern Opening Policy, marking a commitment to enhancing its relations with other nations within the Global East. \nOverview.\nAs with any country, Hungarian security attitudes are shaped largely by history and geography. For Hungary, this is a history of more than 400 years of domination by great powers\u2014the Ottomans, the Habsburg dynasty, the Germans during World War II, and the Soviets during the Cold War\u2014and a geography of regional instability and separation from Hungarian minorities living in neighboring countries. Hungary's foreign policy priorities, largely consistent since 1990, represent a direct response to these factors. From 1990, Hungary's top foreign policy goal was achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the Partnership for Peace program in 1994 and has actively supported the IFOR and SFOR missions in Bosnia. The Horn government achieved Hungary's most important foreign policy successes of the post-communist era by securing invitations to join both NATO and the European Union in 1997. Hungary became a member of NATO in 1999, and a member of the EU in 2004.\nHungary also has improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in Slovakia and Romania periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Hungary was a signatory to the Helsinki Final Act in 1975, has signed all of the CSCE/OSCE follow-on documents since 1989, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997. Hungary's record of implementing CSCE Helsinki Final Act provisions, including those on the reunification of divided families, remains among the best in eastern Europe. Hungary has been a member of the United Nations since December 1955.\nThis involves Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and was agreed on September 16, 1977 (\"Budapest Treaty\"). The treaty envisioned a cross-border barrage system between the towns Gab\u010d\u00edkovo, Czechoslovakia and Nagymaros, Hungary. After an intensive campaign, the project became widely hated as a symbol of the old communist regime. In 1989 the Hungarian government decided to suspend it. In its sentence from September 1997, the International Court of Justice stated that both sides breached their obligation and that the 1977 Budapest Treaty is still valid. In 1998 the Slovak government turned to the International Court, demanding the Nagymaros part to be built. The international dispute was partially solved in 2017.\nOn March 19, 2008, Hungary recognized Kosovo as an independent country.\nRelations between Hungary and its Western partners have strained, because Orban's government has maintained relations with Russia despite sanctions against Russia after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIllicit drugs:\nMajor trans-shipment point for Southwest Asian heroin and cannabis and transit point for South American cocaine destined for Western Europe; limited producer of precursor chemicals, particularly for amphetamines and methamphetamines\nRefugee protection:\nThe Hungarian border barrier was built in 2015, and Hungary was criticized by other European countries for using tear gas and water cannons on refugees of the Syrian Civil War as they were trying to pass the country.\nSince 2017, Hungary\u2013Ukraine relations have rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the Hungarian minority in Ukraine.\nThe U.S. election on 5 November 2024 resulted in a landslide Republican victory. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n loudly and consistently proclaimed that he not only expected Trump to take back the presidency but heartfully wished him to do so. Thanks to Orb\u00e1n's unwavering support towards Trump, the personal relationship between the two statesmen has become impeccable, especially during the Biden administration when U.S.-Hungarian relations hit rock bottom.\nHungary and Central Asia.\nA number of Hungarian anthropologists and linguists have long had an interest in the Turkic peoples, fueled by the eastern origin of the Hungarians' ancestors. The Hungarian ethnomusicologist Bence Szabolcsi explained this motivation as follows: \"Hungarians are the outermost branch leaning this way from age-old tree of the great Asian musical culture rooted in the souls of a variety of peoples living from China through Central Asia to the Black Sea\".\nSince the political transformation in 1990, Hungary has prioritized its diplomatic engagements with the Turkic world. in 2018, Hungary became an observer within the Organisation of Turkic States, underscoring a deepened engagement in regional cooperation.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Hungary maintains diplomatic relations with:\nForeign criticism.\nIn December 2010, the Fidesz government adopted a press and media law which threatens fines on media that engage in \"unbalanced coverage\". The law aroused criticism in the European Union as possibly \"a direct threat to democracy\".\nIn 2013, the government adopted a new constitution that modified several aspects of the institutional and legal framework in Hungary. These changes have been criticized by the Council of Europe, the European Union and Human Rights Watch as possibly undermining the rule of law and human rights protection.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is remembered for his historical novels, such as the Trilogy series and especially for his internationally known best-seller \"Quo Vadis\" (1895\u20131896).\nBorn into an impoverished Polish noble family in the Kingdom of Poland, at the time part of the Russian Empire, he began publishing journalistic and literary pieces in the late 1860s. In the late 1870s he traveled to the United States, sending back travel essays that won him popularity with Polish readers. In the 1880s he began serializing novels that further increased his popularity. He soon became one of the most popular Polish writers of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and numerous translations gained him international renown, culminating in his receipt of the 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature for his \"outstanding merits as an epic writer\".\nMany of his novels remain in print. In Poland he is known for his \"Trilogy\" of historical novels\u2014\"With Fire and Sword\", \"The Deluge\", and \"Sir Michael\"\u2014set in the 17th-century Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth; internationally he is known for \"Quo Vadis\", set in Nero's Rome. \"The Trilogy\" and \"Quo Vadis\" have been filmed, the latter several times, with Hollywood's 1951 version receiving the most international recognition.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nSienkiewicz came into the world on 5 May 1846 in Wola Okrzejska, Lublin Governorate, now a village in the central part of the eastern Polish region of Lubelskie in the Kingdom of Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side deriving from Lipka Tatars who had settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His parents were J\u00f3zef Sienkiewicz of the Oszyk coat of arms and Stefania Cieciszowska. His mother descended from an old and affluent Podlachian family. He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (who died during January Uprising of 1863\u20131864), and four sisters: Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria. His family were entitled to use the Polish Oszyk coat of arms. Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska. His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in Grabowce G\u00f3rne, W\u0119\u017cyczyn, and Burzec. In September 1858 he began his education in Warsaw, where the family would finally settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house (\"kamienica\") in eastern Warsaw's Praga district. He received relatively poor school-grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.\nDue to hard times, the 19-year-old Sienkiewicz took a job as private tutor to the Weyher family in P\u0142o\u0144sk. It was probably in this period that he wrote his first novel, (\"Sacrifice\"); he is thought to have destroyed the manuscript of the never-published novel. He also worked on his first novel to be published, (\"In Vain\"). He completed extramural secondary-school classes, and in 1866 he received his secondary-school diploma. He first tried to study medicine, then law, at the Imperial University of Warsaw, but he soon transferred to the university's Institute of Philology and History, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of Ancient Greek and Latin literature and Old Polish language. Little is known about this period of his life, other than that he moved out of his parents' home, tutored part-time, and lived in poverty. His situation improved somewhat in 1868 when he became a private tutor to the princely Woroniecki family.\nIn 1867 he wrote a rhymed piece, \"\" (\"Idyll of Youth\"), which was rejected by \"Tygodnik Illustrowany\" (\"The Illustrated Weekly\"). In 1869 he debuted as a journalist; (1866\u20131904) (\"The Weekly Review\") ran his review of a play on 18 April 1869, and shortly afterward \"The Illustrated Weekly\" printed an essay of his about the late-Renaissance Polish poet Miko\u0142aj S\u0119p Szarzy\u0144ski. He completed his university studies in 1871, though he failed to receive a diploma because he did not pass the examination in Ancient Greek language. Sienkiewicz also wrote for (\"The Polish Gazette\") and (\"Magazine\"), under the pen name \"Litwos\". In 1873 he began writing a column, \"\" (\"Without a title\"), in \"The Polish Gazette\"; in 1874 a second column, \"\" (\"Current matters\"), for \"Niwa\"; and in 1875 the third column, \"\" (\"The present moment\"). He also collaborated on a Polish translation of Victor Hugo's last novel, \"Ninety-Three\", published in 1874. In June of that same year he became co-owner of \"Niwa\" (in 1878, he would sell his share in the magazine).\nMeanwhile, in 1872, he had debuted as a fiction writer with his short novel (\"In Vain\"), published in the magazine (\"Garland\"). This was followed by (\"Humorous Sketches from Woroszy\u0142\u0142a's Files\", 1872), (\"The Old Servant\", 1875), \"Hania\" (\"Sienkiewicz\") (1876), and (1877). The last three are known as the \"Little Trilogy\". These publications made him a prominent figure in Warsaw's journalistic-literary world, and a guest at popular dinner parties hosted by the actress Helena Modrzejewska.\nTravels abroad.\nIn 1874, Sienkiewicz was briefly engaged to Maria Keller, and traveled abroad to Brussels and Paris. Soon after he returned, his fianc\u00e9e's parents cancelled the engagement. In 1876 Sienkiewicz went to the United States with Helena Modrzejewska (soon to become famous in the U.S. as actress Helena Modjeska) and her husband. He traveled via London to New York and then on to San Francisco, staying for some time in California. His travels were financed by (\"The Polish Gazette\") in exchange for a series of travel essays: Sienkiewicz wrote (\"Letters from a Journey\") and (\"Litwos' Letters from a Journey\"), which were published in \"The Polish Gazette\" in 1876\u20131878 and republished as a book in 1880. Other articles by him also appeared in (The Weekly Review) and (The Learned and Literary Guide), discussing the situation of American Polonia. He briefly lived in the town of Anaheim, later in Anaheim Landing (now Seal Beach, California). He hunted, visited Native American camps, traveled in the nearby mountains (the Santa Ana, Sierra Madre, San Jacinto, and San Bernardino Mountains), and visited the Mojave Desert, Yosemite Valley, and the silver mines at Virginia City, Nevada. On 20 August 1877 he witnessed Modjeska's U.S. theatrical debut at San Francisco's California Theatre, which he reviewed for \"The Polish Gazette\"; and on 8 September he published in the Daily Evening Post an article, translated into English for him by Modjeska, on \"Poland and Russia\".\nIn America, he also continued writing fiction, in 1877 publishing (Charcoal Sketches) in \"The Polish Gazette\". He wrote a play, , soon retitled (On a Single Card), later staged at Lviv (1879) and, to better reception, at Warsaw (1881). He also wrote a play for Modjeska, aimed at an American public, (Partisan Struggles), but it was never performed or published, and the manuscript appears to be lost.\nOn 24 March 1878 Sienkiewicz left the U.S. for Europe. He first stayed in London, then for a year in Paris, delaying his return to Poland due to rumors of possible conscription into the Imperial Russian Army on the eve of a predicted new war with Turkey.\nReturn to Poland.\nIn April 1879 Sienkiewicz returned to Polish soil. In Lw\u00f3w he gave a lecture that was not well attended: \"\" (\"From New York to California\"). Subsequent lectures in Szczawnica and Krynica in July\u2013August that year, and in Warsaw and Pozna\u0144 the following year, were much more successful. In late summer 1879 he went to Venice and Rome, which he toured for the next few weeks, on 7 November 1879 returning to Warsaw. There he met Maria Szetkiewicz, whom he married on 18 August 1881. The marriage was reportedly a happy one. The couple had two children, Henryk J\u00f3zef (1882\u20131959) and Jadwiga Maria (1883\u20131969). It was a short-lived marriage, however, because on 18 August 1885 Maria died of tuberculosis.\nIn 1879 the first collected edition of Sienkiewicz's works was published, in four volumes; the series would continue until 1917, ending with a total of 17 volumes. He also continued writing journalistic pieces, mainly in \"The Polish Gazette\" and \"Niwa\". In 1881 he published a favorable review of the first collected edition of works by Boles\u0142aw Prus.\nIn 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a historical novella, (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief of a new Warsaw newspaper, \"S\u0142owo\" (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in the running of the newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.\nFrom 1883 he increasingly shifted his focus from short pieces to historical novels. He began work on the historical novel, (With Fire and Sword). Initially titled (The Wolf's Lair), it appeared in serial installments in \"The Word\" from May 1883 to March 1884. It also ran concurrently in the Krak\u00f3w newspaper, (Time).\nSienkiewicz soon began writing the second volume of his Trilogy, \"Potop\" (The Deluge). It ran in \"The Word\" from December 1884 to September 1886. Beginning in 1884, Sienkiewicz accompanied his wife Maria to foreign sanatoriums. After her death, he kept on traveling Europe, leaving his children with his late wife's parents though he often returned to Poland, particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w beginning in the 1890s. After his return to Warsaw in 1887, the third volume of his Trilogy appeared \u2013 \"Pan Wo\u0142odyjowski\" (Sir Michael) \u2013 running in \"The Word\" from May 1887 to May 1888. The Trilogy established Sienkiewicz as the most popular contemporary Polish writer.\nSienkiewicz received 15,000 rubles, in recognition of his achievements, from an unknown admirer who signed himself \"Micha\u0142 Wo\u0142odyjowski\" after the Trilogy character. Sienkiewicz used the money to set up a fund, named for his wife and supervised by the Academy of Learning, to aid artists endangered by tuberculosis.\nIn 1886, he visited Constantinople; in 1888, Spain. At the end of 1890 he went to Africa, resulting in (Letters from Africa, published in \"The Word\" in 1891\u201392, then collected as a book in 1893). The turn of the 1880s and 1890s was associated with intensive work on several novels. In 1891 his novel \"Without dogma\" (\"Bez Dogmatu\"), previously serialized in 1889\u201390 in \"The Word\", was published in book form. In 1892 Sienkiewicz signed an agreement for another novel, Rodzina Po\u0142anieckich (Children of the Soil), which was serialized in \"The Polish Gazette\" from 1893 and came out in book form in 1894.\nLater years.\nSienkiewicz had several romances, and in 1892 Maria Romanowska-Wo\u0142odkowicz, stepdaughter of a wealthy Odessan, entered his life. He and Romanowska became engaged there in 1893 and married in Krak\u00f3w on 11 November. Just two weeks later, however, his bride left him; Sienkiewicz blamed \"in-law intrigues\". On 13 December 1895 he obtained papal consent to dissolution of the marriage. In 1904 he married his niece, Maria Babska.\nSienkiewicz used his growing international fame to influence world opinion in favor of the Polish cause (throughout his life and since the late 18th century, Poland remained partitioned by her neighbors, Russia, Austria and Prussia, and later Germany). He often criticized the German policy of Germanization of the Polish minority in Germany; in 1901 he expressed support of Wrze\u015bnia schoolchildren who were protesting the banning of the Polish language. In 1907, amid German attempts to expropriate Polish land, he appealed to the global intellectual community for support. More cautiously, he called on Russia's government to introduce reforms in Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland, he advocated broader Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire.\nSienkiewicz maintained some ties with Polish right-wing National Democracy politicians and was critical of the socialists, but he was generally a moderate and declined to become a politician and a deputy to the Russian Duma. In the cultural sphere, he was involved in the creation of the Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw monuments to Adam Mickiewicz. He supported educational endeavors and co-founded the Polska Macierz Szkolna organization. \"Reasonably wealthy\" by 1908 thanks to sales of his books, he often used his new wealth to support struggling writers. He helped gather funds for social-welfare projects such as starvation relief, and for construction of a tuberculosis sanatorium at Zakopane. He was as prominent in philanthropy as in literature.\nIn February 1895 he wrote the first chapters of \"Quo Vadis\". The novel was serialized beginning in March 1895 in Warsaw's \"Polish Gazette\", Krak\u00f3w's \"Czas\" (Time), and Pozna\u0144's \"Dziennik Pozna\u0144ski\" (Pozna\u0144 Daily). The novel was finished by March 1896. The book edition appeared later the same year and soon gained international renown. In February 1897 he began serializing a new novel, \"Krzy\u017cacy\" (The Teutonic Knights, or The Knights of the Cross); serialization finished in 1900, and the book edition appeared that year.\nIn 1900, with a three-year delay due to the approaching centenary of Mickiewicz's birth, Sienkiewicz celebrated his own quarter-century, begun in 1872, as a writer. Special events were held in a number of Polish cities, including Krak\u00f3w, Lw\u00f3w, and Pozna\u0144. A jubilee committee presented him with a gift from the Polish people: an estate at Obl\u0119gorek, near Kielce, where he later opened a school for children.\nIn 1905 he won the Nobel Prize for his lifetime achievements as an epic writer. In his acceptance speech, he said this honor was of particular value to a son of Poland: \"She was pronounced dead \u2013 yet here is proof that she lives on... She was pronounced defeated \u2013 and here is proof that she is victorious.\"\nHis social and political activities resulted in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, \"Na polu chwa\u0142y\" (On the Field of Glory), that was meant as the beginning of a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original \"Trilogy\" and was discontinued. Similarly, his contemporary novel (Whirlpools), 1910, which criticized some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, \"W pustyni i w puszczy\" (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.\nAfter the outbreak of World War I, Sienkiewicz was visited at Obl\u0119gorek by a Polish Legions cavalry unit under Boles\u0142aw Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowski. Soon after, he left for Switzerland. Together with Ignacy Paderewski and Erazm Piltz, he established an organization for Polish war relief. He also supported the work of the Red Cross. Otherwise he eschewed politics though shortly before his death he endorsed the Act of 5th November 1916, a declaration by Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria and king of Hungary, pledging the creation of a Kingdom of Poland envisioned as a puppet state allied with, and controlled by, the Central Powers.\nDeath.\nSienkiewicz died on 15 November 1916 at the Grand Hotel du Lac in Vevey, Switzerland where he was buried on 22 November. The cause of death was ischemic heart disease. His funeral was attended by representatives of both the Central Powers and the Entente, and an address by Pope Benedict XV was read.\nIn 1924, after Poland had regained her independence, Sienkiewicz's remains were repatriated to Warsaw, Poland, and placed in the crypt of St. John's Cathedral. During the coffin's transit, solemn memorial ceremonies were held in a number of cities. Thousands accompanied the coffin to its Warsaw resting place, and Poland's President Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski delivered a eulogy.\nWorks.\nHis first work, \"Victim\", was written between 1865 and 1866 and is only known because of a letter in which he told to his friend that he burned the book simply because he was not satisfied with it.\nSienkiewicz's early works (e.g., the 1872 ) show him a strong supporter of Polish Positivism, endorsing constructive, practical characters such as engineers. Polish \"Positivism\" advocated economic and social modernization and deprecated armed irredentist struggle. Unlike most other Polish Positivist writers, Sienkiewicz was a conservative. His Little Trilogy (\"Stary S\u0142uga\", 1875; \"Hania\", 1876; \"Selim Mirza\", 1877) shows his interest in Polish history and his literary maturity, including fine mastery of humor and drama. His early works focused on three themes: the oppression and poverty of the peasants (\"Charcoal Sketches\", 1877); criticism of the partitioning powers (\"'\", \"Janko Muzykant\" [\"Janko the Musician\"], 1879); and his voyage to the United States (\"'\", \"For Bread\", 1880). His most common motif was the plight of the powerless: impoverished peasants, schoolchildren, and emigrants.\nHis \"Latarnik\" (\"The Lighthouse keeper\", 1881) has been described as one of the best Polish short stories. His 1882 stories \"\" (\"Bart the Conqueror\") and \"Sachem\" draw parallels between the tragic fates of their heroes and that of the occupied Polish nation.\nHis novel \"With Fire and Sword\" (1883\u201384) was enthusiastically received by readers (as were the next two volumes of The Trilogy), becoming an \"instant classic\", though critical reception was lukewarm. The Trilogy is set in 17th-century Poland. While critics generally praised its style, they noted that some historic facts are misrepresented or distorted. The Trilogy merged elements of the epic and the historical novel, infused with special features of Sienkiewicz's style. The Trilogy's patriotism worried the censors; Warsaw's Russian censor I. Jankul warned Sienkiewicz that he would not allow publication of any further works of his dealing with Polish history.\nSienkiewicz's \"Without dogma\" (\"Bez dogmatu\", 1889\u201390) was a notable artistic experiment, a self-analytical novel written as a fictitious diary. His works of the period are critical of decadent and naturalistic philosophies. He had expressed his opinions on naturalism and writing, generally, early on in \"\" (\"Naturalism in the Novel\", 1881). A dozen years later, in 1893, he wrote that novels should strengthen and ennoble life, rather than undermining and debasing it. Later, in the early 1900s, he fell into mutual hostility with the Young Poland movement in Polish literature.\nThese views informed his novel \"Quo Vadis\" (1896). This story of early Christianity in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the Emperor Nero's regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, due to its focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian West. The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of materialism and decadence, and also an allegory for the strength of the Polish spirit.\nHis \"Teutonic Knights\" returned to Poland's history, describing the Battle of Grunwald (1410), a Polish-Lithuanian victory over the Teutonic Knights in the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War. Both in German and Polish culture the Teutonic Knights were incorrectly viewed as precursors to modern Germans while the Polish-Lithuanian union was regarded as a model for a future independent Polish state. These assumptions tied in well with the contemporary political context of ongoing Germanization efforts in German Poland. So, the book quickly became another Sienkiewicz bestseller in Poland, and was received by critics better than his Trilogy had been; it was also applauded by the Polish right-wing, anti-German National Democracy political movement, and became part of the Polish school curriculum after Poland regained independence in 1918.\nIt is often incorrectly asserted that Sienkiewicz received his Nobel Prize for \"Quo Vadis\". While \"Quo Vadis\" is the novel that brought him international fame, the Nobel Prize does not name any particular novel, instead citing \"his outstanding merits as an epic writer\".\nSienkiewicz often carried out substantial historic research for his novels, but he was selective in the findings that made it into the novels. Thus, for example, he prioritized Polish military victories over defeats. Sienkiewicz kept a diary, but it has been lost. A life of him written in English by Monica M. Gardner was published in 1926.\nRecognition.\nAbout the turn of the 20th century, Sienkiewicz was the most popular writer in Poland, and one of the most popular in Germany, France, Russia, and the English-speaking world. The Trilogy went through many translations; \"With Fire and Sword\" saw at least 26 in his lifetime. \"Quo Vadis\" became extremely popular, in at least 40 different language translations, including English-language editions totaling a million copies. The American translator Jeremiah Curtin has been credited with helping popularize his works abroad. However, as Russia (of which Sienkiewicz was a citizen) was not a signatory to the Berne Convention, he rarely received any royalties from the translations.\nAlready in his lifetime his works were adapted for theatrical, operatic and musical presentations and for the emerging film industry. Writers and poets devoted works to him, or used him or his works as inspiration. Painters created works inspired by Sienkiewicz's novels, and their works were gathered in Sienkiewicz-themed albums and exhibitions. The names of his characters were given to a variety of products. The popularity of \"Quo Vadis\" in France, where it was the best-selling book of 1900, is shown by the fact that horses competing in a Grand Prix de Paris event were named for characters in the book. In the United States, \"Quo Vadis\" sold 800,000 copies in eighteen months. To avoid intrusive journalists and fans, Sienkiewicz sometimes traveled incognito.\nHe was inducted into many international organizations and societies, including the Polish Academy of Learning, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Royal Czech Society of Sciences, and the Italian Academy of Arcadia. He received the French \"L\u00e9gion d'honneur\" (1904), honorary doctorates from the Jagiellonian University (1900) and Lw\u00f3w University (1911), and honorary citizenship of Lw\u00f3w (1902). In 1905 he received the most prestigious award in the world of literature, the Nobel Prize, after having been nominated in that year by Hans Hildebrand, member of the Swedish Academy.\nNamed for Sienkiewicz, in Poland, are numerous streets and squares (the first street to bear his name was in Lw\u00f3w, in 1907). Named for him is Bia\u0142ystok's \"Osiedle Sienkiewicza\"; city parks in Wroc\u0142aw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, and W\u0142oc\u0142awek; and over 70 schools in Poland. He has statues in a number of Polish cities, including Warsaw's \u0141azienki Park (the first statue was erected at Zbara\u017c, now in Ukraine), and in Rome A Sienkiewcz Mound stands at Okrzeja, near his birthplace, Wola Okrzejska. He has been featured on a number of postage stamps.\nThere are three museums dedicated to him in Poland. The first, the Henryk Sienkiewicz Museum in Obl\u0119gorek (his residence), opened in 1958. The second, founded in 1966, is in his birthplace: the Henryk Sienkiewicz Museum in Wola Okrzejska. The third opened in 1978 at Pozna\u0144.\nIn Rome (Italy), in the small church of \"Domine Quo Vadis\", there is a bronze bust of Henryk Sienkiewicz. It is said that Sienkiewicz was inspired to write his novel \"Quo Vadis\" while sitting in this church.\nOutside Poland, Sienkiewicz's popularity declined beginning in the interbellum, except for \"Quo Vadis\", which retained relative fame thanks to several film adaptations, including a notable American one in 1951. In Poland his works are still widely read; he is seen as a classic author, and his works are often required reading in schools. They have also been adapted for Polish films and television series.\nThe first critical analyses of his works were published in his lifetime. He has been the subject of a number of biographies. His works have received criticism, in his lifetime and since, as being simplistic: a view expressed notably by the 20th-century Polish novelist and dramatist Witold Gombrowicz, who described Sienkiewicz as a \"first-rate second-rate writer\". Vasily Rozanov described \"Quo Vadis\" as \"not a work of art\", but a \"crude factory-made oleograph\", while Anton Chekhov called Sienkiewicz's writing \"sickeningly cloying and clumsy\". Nonetheless, the Polish historian of literature Henryk Markiewicz, writing the \"Polski s\u0142ownik biograficzny\" (Polish Biographical Dictionary) entry on Sienkiewicz (1997), describes him as a master of Polish prose, as the foremost Polish writer of historical fiction, and as Poland's internationally best-known writer.\nBibliography.\nNovels.\nSeries.\n\"The Small Trilogy\"\n\"The Trilogy\" (\"Trylogia\")\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A practitioner of hydrology is called a hydrologist. Hydrologists are scientists studying earth or environmental science, civil or environmental engineering, and physical geography. Using various analytical methods and scientific techniques, they collect and analyze data to help solve water related problems such as environmental preservation, natural disasters, and water management.\nHydrology subdivides into surface water hydrology, groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology), and marine hydrology. Domains of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface hydrology, hydrogeology, drainage-basin management, and water quality.\nOceanography and meteorology are not included because water is only one of many important aspects within those fields.\nHydrological research can inform environmental engineering, policy, and planning.\nHistory.\nHydrology has been subject to investigation and engineering for millennia. Ancient Egyptians were one of the first to employ hydrology in their engineering and agriculture, inventing a form of water management known as basin irrigation. Mesopotamian towns were protected from flooding with high earthen walls. Aqueducts were built by the Greeks and Romans, while history shows that the Chinese built irrigation and flood control works. The ancient Sinhalese used hydrology to build complex irrigation works in Sri Lanka, also known for the invention of the Valve Pit which allowed construction of large reservoirs, anicuts and canals which still function.\nMarcus Vitruvius, in the first century BC, described a philosophical theory of the hydrologic cycle, in which precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the Earth's surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands. With the adoption of a more scientific approach, Leonardo da Vinci and Bernard Palissy independently reached an accurate representation of the hydrologic cycle. It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified.\nPioneers of the modern science of hydrology include Pierre Perrault, Edme Mariotte and Edmund Halley. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area, Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for the flow of the Seine. Mariotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain a discharge value, again in the Seine. Halley showed that the evaporation from the Mediterranean Sea was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing into the sea.\nAdvances in the 18th century included the Bernoulli piezometer and Bernoulli's equation, by Daniel Bernoulli, and the Pitot tube, by Henri Pitot. The 19th century saw development in groundwater hydrology, including Darcy's law, the Dupuit-Thiem well formula, and Hagen-Poiseuille's capillary flow equation.\nRational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century, while governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs. Of particular importance were Leroy Sherman's unit hydrograph, the infiltration theory of Robert E. Horton, and C.V. Theis' aquifer test/equation describing well hydraulics.\nSince the 1950s, hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis than in the past, facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of hydrological processes and by the advent of computers and especially geographic information systems (GIS). (See also GIS and hydrology)\nThemes.\nThe central theme of hydrology is that water circulates throughout the Earth through different pathways and at different rates. The most vivid image of this is in the evaporation of water from the ocean, which forms clouds. These clouds drift over the land and produce rain. The rainwater flows into lakes, rivers, or aquifers. The water in lakes, rivers, and aquifers then either evaporates back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean, completing a cycle. Water changes its state of being several times throughout this cycle.\nThe areas of research within hydrology concern the movement of water between its various states, or within a given state, or simply quantifying the amounts in these states in a given region. Parts of hydrology concern developing methods for directly measuring these flows or amounts of water, while others concern modeling these processes either for scientific knowledge or for making a prediction in practical applications.\nGroundwater.\nGround water is water beneath Earth's surface, often pumped for drinking water. Groundwater hydrology (hydrogeology) considers quantifying groundwater flow and solute transport. Problems in describing the saturated zone include the characterization of aquifers in terms of flow direction, groundwater pressure and, by inference, groundwater depth (see: aquifer test). Measurements here can be made using a piezometer. Aquifers are also described in terms of hydraulic conductivity, storativity and transmissivity. There are a number of geophysical methods for characterizing aquifers. There are also problems in characterizing the vadose zone (unsaturated zone).\nInfiltration.\nInfiltration is the process by which water enters the soil. Some of the water is absorbed, and the rest percolates down to the water table. The infiltration capacity, the maximum rate at which the soil can absorb water, depends on several factors. The layer that is already saturated provides a resistance that is proportional to its thickness, while that plus the depth of water above the soil provides the driving force (hydraulic head). Dry soil can allow rapid infiltration by capillary action; this force diminishes as the soil becomes wet. Compaction reduces the porosity and the pore sizes. Surface cover increases capacity by retarding runoff, reducing compaction and other processes. Higher temperatures reduce viscosity, increasing infiltration.\nSoil moisture.\nSoil moisture can be measured in various ways; by capacitance probe, time domain reflectometer or tensiometer. Other methods include solute sampling and geophysical methods.\nSurface water flow.\nHydrology considers quantifying surface water flow and solute transport, although the treatment of flows in large rivers is sometimes considered as a distinct topic of hydraulics or hydrodynamics. Surface water flow can include flow both in recognizable river channels and otherwise. Methods for measuring flow once the water has reached a river include the stream gauge (see: discharge), and tracer techniques. Other topics include chemical transport as part of surface water, sediment transport and erosion.\nOne of the important areas of hydrology is the interchange between rivers and aquifers. Groundwater/surface water interactions in streams and aquifers can be complex and the direction of net water flux (into surface water or into the aquifer) may vary spatially along a stream channel and over time at any particular location, depending on the relationship between stream stage and groundwater levels.\nPrecipitation and evaporation.\nIn some considerations, hydrology is thought of as starting at the land-atmosphere boundary and so it is important to have adequate knowledge of both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation can be measured in various ways: disdrometer for precipitation characteristics at a fine time scale; radar for cloud properties, rain rate estimation, hail and snow detection; rain gauge for routine accurate measurements of rain and snowfall; satellite for rainy area identification, rain rate estimation, land-cover/land-use, and soil moisture, snow cover or snow water equivalent for example.\nEvaporation is an important part of the water cycle. It is partly affected by humidity, which can be measured by a sling psychrometer. It is also affected by the presence of snow, hail, and ice and can relate to dew, mist and fog. Hydrology considers evaporation of various forms: from water surfaces; as transpiration\nfrom plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems. Direct measurement of evaporation can be obtained using Simon's evaporation pan.\nDetailed studies of evaporation involve boundary layer considerations as well as momentum, heat flux, and energy budgets.\nRemote sensing.\nRemote sensing of hydrologic processes can provide information on locations where \"in situ\" sensors may be unavailable or sparse. It also enables observations over large spatial extents. Many of the variables constituting the terrestrial water balance, for example surface water storage, soil moisture, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and snow and ice, are measurable using remote sensing at various spatial-temporal resolutions and accuracies. Sources of remote sensing include land-based sensors, airborne sensors and satellite sensors which can capture microwave, thermal and near-infrared data or use lidar, for example.\nWater quality.\nIn hydrology, studies of water quality concern organic and inorganic compounds, and both dissolved and sediment material. In addition, water quality is affected by the interaction of dissolved oxygen with organic material and various chemical transformations that may take place. Measurements of water quality may involve either in-situ methods, in which analyses take place on-site, often automatically, and laboratory-based analyses and may include microbiological analysis.\nPrediction.\nObservations of hydrologic processes are used to make predictions of the future behavior of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is \"Prediction in Ungauged Basins\" (PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist.\nStatistical hydrology.\nThe aims of Statistical hydrology is to provide appropriate statistical methods for analyzing and modeling various parts of the hydrological cycle. By analyzing the statistical properties of hydrologic records, such as rainfall or river flow, hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena. When making assessments of how often relatively rare events will occur, analyses are made in terms of the return period of such events. Other quantities of interest include the average flow in a river, in a year or by season.\nThese estimates are important for engineers and economists so that proper risk analysis can be performed to influence investment decisions in future infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water supply systems. Statistical information is utilized to formulate operating rules for large dams forming part of systems which include agricultural, industrial and residential demands.\nModeling.\nHydrological models are simplified, conceptual representations of a part of the hydrologic cycle. They are primarily used for hydrological prediction and for understanding hydrological processes, within the general field of scientific modeling. Two major types of hydrological models can be distinguished:\nRecent research in hydrological modeling tries to have a more global approach to the understanding of the behavior of hydrologic systems to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.\nTransport.\nWater movement is a significant means by which other materials, such as soil, gravel, boulders or pollutants, are transported from place to place. Initial input to receiving waters may arise from a point source discharge or a line source or area source, such as surface runoff. Since the 1960s rather complex mathematical models have been developed, facilitated by the availability of high-speed computers. The most common pollutant classes analyzed are nutrients, pesticides, total dissolved solids and sediment.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13436", "revid": "41407496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13436", "title": "Heinrich Himmler", "text": "German Nazi leader of the SS (1900\u20131945)\nHeinrich Luitpold Himmler (; 7 October 1900\u00a0\u2013 23 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician and military leader. He was the 4th of the (Protection Squadron; SS), a leading member of the Nazi Party, and one of the most powerful figures in Nazi Germany. He was also one of the main architects of the Holocaust.\nAfter serving in a reserve battalion during World War I without seeing combat, Himmler went on to join the Nazi Party in 1923. In 1925, he joined the SS, which was initially a small paramilitary arm of the Nazi Party that served as a bodyguard unit for Adolf Hitler. Himmler rose steadily through the SS's ranks to become by 1929. Under Himmler's leadership, the SS grew from a 290-man battalion into one of the most powerful institutions in Nazi Germany. Over the course of his career, Himmler acquired a reputation for good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of the \"Kriminalpolizei\" (Criminal Police) and Minister of the Interior, which gave him oversight of all police and security forces (including the Gestapo). He also controlled the \"Waffen-SS\", a branch of the SS that served in combat alongside the \"Wehrmacht\" (Germany's armed forces) in World War II.\nAs the principal enforcer of the Nazis' racial policies, Himmler was responsible for operating concentration and extermination camps as well as forming the \"Einsatzgruppen\" death squads in German-occupied Europe. In this capacity, he played a central role in the genocide of an estimated 5.5\u20136\u00a0million Jews and the deaths of millions of other victims during the Holocaust. A day before the launch of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, Himmler commissioned the drafting of \"Generalplan Ost\", which was approved by Hitler in May 1942 and implemented by the Nazi regime, resulting in the deaths of approximately 14 million people in Eastern Europe.\nIn the last years of World War II, Hitler appointed Himmler as Commander of the Replacement Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the Third Reich (\"Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr die Verwaltung\"). He was later given command of the Army Group Upper Rhine and the Army Group Vistula. He failed to achieve his assigned objectives, and Hitler replaced him in these posts. Realising the war was lost, Himmler attempted, without Hitler's knowledge, to open peace talks with the western Allies in March 1945. When Hitler learned of this on 28 April, he dismissed Himmler from all his posts and ordered his arrest. Himmler attempted to go into hiding but was captured by British forces. He died by suicide in British custody on 23 May 1945.\nEarly life.\nHeinrich Luitpold Himmler was born in Munich on 7 October 1900 into a conservative middle-class Catholic family. His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (1865\u20131936), a teacher, and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (n\u00e9e Heyder; 1866\u20131941). Heinrich had two brothers: Gebhard Ludwig (1898\u20131982) and Ernst Hermann (1905\u20131945).\nHimmler's first name, Heinrich, was that of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, a member of the royal family of Bavaria who had been tutored by Himmler's father. He attended a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. He did well in his schoolwork, but struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.\nHimmler's diary, which he kept intermittently from the age of 10, shows that he took a keen interest in current events, duelling, and \"the serious discussion of religion and sex\". In 1915, he began training with the Landshut Cadet Corps. His father used his connections with the royal family to get Himmler accepted as an officer candidate, and he enlisted with the reserve battalion of the 11th Bavarian Regiment in December 1917. His brother, Gebhard, served on the western front and saw combat, receiving the Iron Cross and being promoted to lieutenant. In November 1918, while Himmler was still in training, the war ended with Germany's defeat, denying him the opportunity to become an officer or see combat. After his discharge on 18 December, he returned to Landshut. After the war, Himmler completed his grammar school education. From 1919 to 1922, he studied agriculture at the Munich (now Technical University Munich) following a brief apprenticeship on a farm and a subsequent illness.\nAlthough many regulations that discriminated against non-Christians\u2014including Jews and other minority groups\u2014had been eliminated during the unification of Germany in 1871, antisemitism continued to exist and thrive in Germany and other parts of Europe. Himmler was antisemitic by the time he went to university, but not exceptionally so; students at his school would avoid their Jewish classmates. He remained a Catholic while a student and spent most of his leisure time with members of his fencing fraternity, the \"League of Apollo\", the president of which was Jewish. Himmler maintained a polite demeanour with him and with other Jewish members of the fraternity, in spite of his growing antisemitism. During his second year at university, Himmler redoubled his attempts to pursue a military career. Although he was not successful, he was able to extend his involvement in the paramilitary scene in Munich. It was at this time that he first met Ernst R\u00f6hm, an early member of the Nazi Party and co-founder of the (\"Storm Battalion\"; SA). Himmler admired R\u00f6hm because he was a decorated combat soldier, and at his suggestion Himmler joined his antisemitic nationalist group, the (Imperial War Flag Society).\nIn 1922, Himmler became more interested in the \"Jewish question\", with his diary entries containing an increasing number of antisemitic remarks and recording discussions about Jews with his classmates. His reading lists, as recorded in his diary, were dominated by antisemitic pamphlets, German myths, and occult tracts. After the murder of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau on 24 June, Himmler's political views veered towards the radical right, and he took part in demonstrations against the Treaty of Versailles. Hyperinflation was raging, and his parents could no longer afford to educate all three sons. Disappointed by his failure to make a career in the military and his parents' inability to finance his doctoral studies, he was forced to take a low-paying office job after obtaining his agricultural diploma. He remained in this position until September 1923.\nNazi activist.\nHimmler joined the Nazi Party on 1 August 1923, receiving party number 14303. As a member of R\u00f6hm's paramilitary unit, Himmler was involved in the Beer Hall Putsch\u2014an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the Nazi Party to seize power in Munich. This event set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as a farm manager, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.\nIn 1923\u201324, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. Himmler found the Nazi Party appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views. Initially, he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of F\u00fchrer worship, but as he learned more about Hitler through his reading, he began to regard him as a useful face of the party, and he later admired and even worshipped him. To consolidate and advance his own position in the Nazi Party, Himmler took advantage of the disarray in the party following Hitler's arrest after the Beer Hall Putsch. From mid-1924 he worked under Gregor Strasser as a party secretary and propaganda assistant. Travelling all over Bavaria agitating for the party, he gave speeches and distributed literature. Placed in charge of the party office in Lower Bavaria by Strasser from late 1924, he was responsible for integrating the area's membership with the Nazi Party under Hitler when the party was re-founded in February 1925.\nThat same year, he joined the (SS) as an (SS-Leader); his SS number was 168. The SS, initially part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA. Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the Nazi Party, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics on the number of Jews, Freemasons, and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy. In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit. Convinced that Himmler was the man for the job, Hitler appointed him Deputy , with the rank of .\nAround this time, Himmler joined the Artaman League, a youth group. There he met Rudolf H\u00f6ss, who was later commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp, and Walther Darr\u00e9, whose book \"The Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race\" caught Hitler's attention, leading to his later appointment as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture. Darr\u00e9 was a firm believer in the superiority of the Nordic race, and his philosophy was a major influence on Himmler.\nRise in the SS.\nUpon the resignation of SS commander Erhard Heiden in January 1929, Himmler assumed the position of \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" with Hitler's approval; he still carried out his duties at propaganda headquarters. One of his first responsibilities was to organise SS participants at the Nuremberg Rally that September. Over the next year, Himmler grew the SS from a force of about 290 men to about 3,000. By 1930 Himmler had persuaded Hitler to run the SS as a separate organisation, although it was officially still subordinate to the SA.\nTo gain political power, the Nazi Party took advantage of the economic downturn during the Great Depression. The coalition government of the Weimar Republic was unable to improve the economy, so many voters turned to the political extreme, which included the Nazi Party. Hitler used populist rhetoric, including blaming scapegoats\u2014particularly the Jews\u2014for the economic hardships. In September 1930, Himmler was first elected as a deputy to the \"Reichstag\". In the 1932 election, the Nazis won 37.3 percent of the vote and 230 seats in the Reichstag. Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933, heading a short-lived coalition of his Nazis and the German National People's Party. The new cabinet initially included only three members of the Nazi Party: Hitler, Hermann G\u00f6ring as minister without portfolio and Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Wilhelm Frick as Reich Interior Minister. Less than a month later, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Hitler took advantage of this event, forcing Hindenburg to sign the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The Enabling Act, passed by the Reichstag on 23 March 1933, gave the Cabinet\u2014in practice, Hitler\u2014full legislative powers, and the country became a de facto dictatorship. On 1 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law which stipulated that upon Hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Hindenburg died the next morning, and Hitler became both head of state and head of government under the title \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" (leader and chancellor).\nThe Nazi Party's rise to power provided Himmler and the SS an unfettered opportunity to thrive. By 1933, the SS numbered 52,000 members. Strict membership requirements ensured that all members were of Hitler's Aryan \"Herrenvolk\" (\"Aryan master race\"). Applicants were vetted for Nordic qualities\u2014in Himmler's words, \"like a nursery gardener trying to reproduce a good old strain which has been adulterated and debased; we started from the principles of plant selection and then proceeded quite unashamedly to weed out the men whom we did not think we could use for the build-up of the SS.\" Few dared mention that by his own standards, Himmler did not meet his own ideals.\nHimmler's organised, bookish intellect served him well as he began setting up different SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect. In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by G\u00f6ring. Effective 1 January 1933, Hitler promoted Himmler to the rank of SS-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\", equal in rank to the senior SA commanders. On 2 June Himmler, along with the heads of the other two Nazi paramilitary organisations, the SA and the Hitler Youth, was named a \"Reichsleiter\", the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. On 10 July, he was named to the Prussian State Council. On 2 October 1933, he became a founding member of Hans Frank's Academy for German Law at its inaugural meeting.\nHimmler further established the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (\"Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt\" or RuSHA). He appointed Darr\u00e9 as its first chief, with the rank of SS-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\". The department implemented racial policies and monitored the \"racial integrity\" of the SS membership. SS men were carefully vetted for their racial background. On 31 December 1931, Himmler introduced the \"marriage order\", which required SS men wishing to marry to produce family trees proving that both families were of Aryan descent to 1800. If any non-Aryan forebears were found in either family tree during the racial investigation, the person concerned was excluded from the SS. Each man was issued a \"Sippenbuch\", a genealogical record detailing his genetic history. Himmler expected that each SS marriage should produce at least four children, thus creating a pool of genetically superior prospective SS members. The programme had disappointing results; less than 40 per cent of SS men married and each produced only about one child.\nIn March 1933, less than three months after the Nazis came to power, Himmler set up the first official concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated that he did not want it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards; the guards' uniforms had a special \"Totenkopf\" insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\".\nInitially the camps housed political opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society\u2014criminals, vagrants and deviants\u2014were placed in the camps as well. In 1936 Himmler wrote in the pamphlet \"The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organisation\" that the SS were to fight against the \"Jewish-Bolshevik revolution of subhumans\". A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society. This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be \"Untermensch\" (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.\nConsolidation of power.\nIn early 1934, Hitler and other Nazi leaders became concerned that R\u00f6hm was planning a coup d'\u00e9tat. R\u00f6hm had socialist and populist views and believed that the real revolution had not yet begun. He felt that the SA\u2014now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army\u2014should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. R\u00f6hm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.\nG\u00f6ring had created a Prussian secret police force, the \"Geheime Staatspolizei\" or Gestapo in 1933 and appointed Rudolf Diels as its head. G\u00f6ring, concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934. Also on that date, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. This was a radical departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter. Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SD.\nHitler decided on 21 June that R\u00f6hm and the SA leadership had to be eliminated. He sent G\u00f6ring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with Himmler and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where R\u00f6hm was arrested; he gave R\u00f6hm the choice to die by suicide or be shot. When R\u00f6hm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the Night of the Long Knives. With the SA neutralised, the SS became an independent organisation answerable only to Hitler on 20 July 1934. Himmler's title of \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" became the highest formal SS rank, equivalent to a field marshal in the army. The SA was converted into a sports and training organisation.\nOn 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws\u2014known as the Nuremberg Laws\u2014to the Reichstag. The laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households. The laws also deprived so-called \"non-Aryans\" of the benefits of German citizenship. These laws were among the first race-based measures instituted by the Third Reich.\nHimmler and Heydrich wanted to extend the power of the SS; thus, they urged Hitler to form a national police force overseen by the SS, to guard Nazi Germany against its many enemies at the time\u2014real and imagined. Interior Minister Frick also wanted a national police force, but one controlled by him, with Kurt Daluege as his police chief. Hitler left it to Himmler and Heydrich to work out the arrangements with Frick. Himmler and Heydrich had greater bargaining power, as they were allied with Frick's old enemy G\u00f6ring. Heydrich drew up a set of proposals and Himmler sent him to meet with Frick. An angry Frick then consulted with Hitler, who told him to agree to the proposals. Frick acquiesced, and on 17 June 1936 Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in the Reich and named Himmler Chief of German Police and a State Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior. In this role, Himmler was still nominally subordinate to Frick but in practice the police were now effectively a division of the SS, and hence independent of Frick's control. This move gave Himmler operational control over Germany's entire detective force. He also gained authority over all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies, which were amalgamated into the new \"Ordnungspolizei\" (Orpo: \"order police\"), which became a branch of the SS under Daluege.\nShortly thereafter, Himmler created the \"Kriminalpolizei\" (Kripo: criminal police) as an umbrella organisation for all criminal investigation agencies in Germany. The Kripo was merged with the Gestapo into the \"Sicherheitspolizei\" (SiPo: security police), under Heydrich's command. In September 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, Himmler formed the \"SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt\" (RSHA: Reich Security Main Office) to bring the SiPo (which included the Gestapo and Kripo) and the SD together under one umbrella. He again placed Heydrich in command.\nUnder Himmler's leadership, the SS developed its own military branch, the \"SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe\" (SS-VT), which later evolved into the Waffen-SS. Nominally under the authority of Himmler, the Waffen-SS developed a fully militarised structure of command and operations. It grew from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, serving alongside the \"Heer\" (army), but never being formally part of it.\nIn addition to his military ambitions, Himmler established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the umbrella of the SS. To this end, administrator Oswald Pohl set up the \"Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe\" (German Economic Enterprise) in 1940. Under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, this holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses. Pohl was unscrupulous and quickly exploited the companies for personal gain. In contrast, Himmler was honest in matters of money and business.\nIn 1938, as part of his preparations for war, Hitler ended the German alliance with China and entered into an agreement with the more modern Empire of Japan. That same year, Austria was annexed into Nazi Germany in the Anschluss, and the Munich Agreement gave Nazi Germany control over the Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia. Hitler's primary motivations for war included obtaining additional \"Lebensraum\" (\"living space\") for the Germanic peoples, who were considered racially superior according to Nazi ideology. A second goal was the elimination of those considered racially inferior, particularly the Jews and Slavs, from territories controlled by the Reich. From 1933 to 1938, hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Some converted to Christianity.\nAnti-church struggle.\nAccording to Himmler's biographer Peter Longerich, Himmler believed that a major task of the SS should be \"acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living\" as part of preparations for the coming conflict between \"humans and subhumans\". Longerich wrote that, while the Nazi movement as a whole launched itself against Jews and Communists, \"by linking de-Christianisation with re-Germanization, Himmler had provided the SS with a goal and purpose all of its own\". Himmler was vehemently opposed to Christian sexual morality and the \"principle of Christian mercy\", both of which he saw as dangerous obstacles to his planned battle with \"subhumans\". In 1937, Himmler declared:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We live in an era of the ultimate conflict with Christianity. It is part of the mission of the SS to give the German people in the next half century the non-Christian ideological foundations on which to lead and shape their lives. This task does not consist solely in overcoming an ideological opponent but must be accompanied at every step by a positive impetus: in this case that means the reconstruction of the German heritage in the widest and most comprehensive sense.\nIn early 1937, Himmler had his personal staff work with academics to create a framework to replace Christianity within the Germanic cultural heritage. The project gave rise to the Deutschrechtliches Institut, headed by Professor Karl Eckhardt, at the University of Bonn.\nWorld War II.\nWhen Hitler and his army chiefs asked for a pretext for the invasion of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich M\u00fcller masterminded and carried out a false flag project code-named Operation Himmler. German soldiers dressed in Polish uniforms undertook border skirmishes which deceptively suggested Polish aggression against Germany. The incidents were then used in Nazi propaganda to justify the invasion of Poland, the opening event of World War II. At the beginning of the war against Poland, Hitler authorised the killing of Polish civilians, including Jews and ethnic Poles. The \"Einsatzgruppen\" (SS task forces) had originally been formed by Heydrich to secure government papers and offices in areas taken over by Germany before World War II. Authorised by Hitler and under the direction of Himmler and Heydrich, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" units\u2014now repurposed as death squads\u2014followed the \"Heer\" (army) into Poland, and by the end of 1939 they had murdered some 65,000 intellectuals and other civilians. Militias and \"Heer\" units also took part in these killings. Under Himmler's orders via the RSHA, these squads were also tasked with rounding up Jews and others for placement in ghettos and concentration camps.\nGermany subsequently invaded Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, and France, and began bombing Great Britain in preparation for Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of the United Kingdom. On 21 June 1941, the day before invasion of the Soviet Union, Himmler commissioned the preparation of the \"Generalplan Ost\" (General Plan for the East); the plan was approved by Hitler in May 1942. It called for the Baltic States, Poland, Western Ukraine, and Byelorussia to be conquered and resettled by ten million German citizens. The current residents\u2014some 31\u00a0million people\u2014would be expelled further east, starved, or used for forced labour. The plan would have extended the borders of Germany to the east by . Himmler expected that it would take twenty to thirty years to complete the plan, at a cost of 67\u00a0billion\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01. Himmler stated openly: \"It is a question of existence, thus it will be a racial struggle of pitiless severity, in the course of which 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply.\"\nHimmler declared that the war in the east was a pan-European crusade to defend the traditional values of old Europe from the \"Godless Bolshevik hordes\". Constantly struggling with the Wehrmacht for recruits, Himmler solved this problem through the creation of Waffen-SS units composed of Germanic folk groups taken from the Balkans and eastern Europe. Equally vital were recruits from among the Germanic considered peoples of northern and western Europe, in the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. Spain and Italy also provided men for Waffen-SS units. Among western countries, the number of volunteers varied from a high of 25,000 from the Netherlands to 300 each from Sweden and Switzerland. From the east, the highest number of men came from Lithuania (50,000) and the lowest from Bulgaria (600). After 1943 most men from the east were conscripts. The performance of the eastern Waffen-SS units was, as a whole, sub-standard.\nIn late 1941, Hitler named Heydrich as Deputy Reich Protector of the newly established Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Heydrich began to racially classify the Czechs, deporting many to concentration camps. Members of a swelling resistance were shot, earning Heydrich the nickname \"the Butcher of Prague\". This appointment strengthened the collaboration between Himmler and Heydrich, and Himmler was proud to have SS control over a state. Despite having direct access to Hitler, Heydrich's loyalty to Himmler remained firm.\nWith Hitler's approval, Himmler re-established the \"Einsatzgruppen\" in the lead-up to the planned invasion of the Soviet Union. In March 1941, Hitler addressed his army leaders, detailing his intention to smash the Soviet Empire and destroy the Bolshevik intelligentsia and leadership. His special directive, the \"Guidelines in Special Spheres re Directive No. 21 (Operation Barbarossa)\", read: \"In the operations area of the army, the \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" has been given special tasks on the orders of the \"F\u00fchrer\", in order to prepare the political administration. These tasks arise from the forthcoming final struggle of two opposing political systems. Within the framework of these tasks, the \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" acts independently and on his own responsibility.\" Hitler thus intended to prevent internal friction like that occurring earlier in Poland in 1939, when several German Army generals (including Johannes Blaskowitz) had attempted to bring \"Einsatzgruppen\" leaders to trial for the murders they had committed.\nFollowing the army into the Soviet Union, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" rounded up and killed Jews and others deemed undesirable by the Nazi state. Hitler was sent frequent reports. In addition, 2.8\u00a0million Soviet prisoners of war died of starvation, mistreatment or executions in just eight months of 1941\u201342. As many as 500,000 Soviet prisoners of war died or were executed in Nazi concentration camps over the course of the war; most of them were shot or gassed. By early 1941, following Himmler's orders, ten concentration camps had been constructed in which inmates were subjected to forced labour. Jews from all over Germany and the occupied territories were deported to the camps or confined to ghettos. As the Germans were pushed back from Moscow in December 1941, signalling that the expected quick defeat of the Soviet Union had failed to materialise, Hitler and other Nazi officials realised that mass deportations to the east would no longer be possible. As a result, instead of deportation, many Jews in Europe were destined for death.\nFinal Solution, the Holocaust, racial policy, and eugenics.\nNazi racial policies, including the notion that people who were racially inferior had no right to live, date back to the earliest days of the party; Hitler discusses this in . Around the time of the German declaration of war on the United States in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be \"exterminated\". Heydrich arranged a meeting, held on 20 January 1942 at Wannsee, a suburb of Berlin. Attended by top Nazi officials, it was used to outline the plans for the \"final solution to the Jewish question\". Heydrich detailed how those Jews able to work would be worked to death; those unable to work would be killed outright. Heydrich calculated the number of Jews to be killed at 11\u00a0million and told the attendees that Hitler had placed Himmler in charge of the plan.\nIn June 1942, Heydrich was assassinated in Prague in Operation Anthropoid, led by Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk and Jan Kubi\u0161, members of Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile. Both men had been trained by the British Special Operations Executive for the mission to kill Heydrich. During the two funeral services, Himmler\u2014the chief mourner\u2014took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults in the village of Le\u017e\u00e1ky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing of Jews in (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the camps\u2014three extermination camps\u2014to be constructed at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka.\nInitially the victims were killed with gas vans or by firing squad, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. In August 1941, Himmler attended the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk. This was the first time he had heard a shot fired in anger or seen dead people and, while looking into the open grave, his coat and perhaps his face were splashed by the brains of a victim. He went very green and pale and swayed. Karl Wolff jumped forward, held him steady and led him away from the grave. Nauseated and shaken by the experience, he was concerned about the impact such actions would have on the mental health of his SS men.\nHe decided that other methods of killing should be found. On his orders, by early 1942 the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded, including the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B. Himmler visited the camp on 17 and 18 July 1942. He was given a demonstration of a mass killing using the gas chamber in Bunker\u00a02 and toured the building site of the new IG Farben plant being constructed at the nearby town of Monowitz. By the end of the war, at least 5.5\u00a0million Jews had been killed by the Nazi regime; most estimates range closer to 6\u00a0million. Himmler visited the camp at Sobib\u00f3r in early 1943, by which time 250,000 people had been killed at that location alone. After witnessing a gassing, he gave 28 people promotions and ordered the operation of the camp to be wound down. In a prisoner revolt that October, the remaining prisoners killed most of the guards and SS personnel. Several hundred prisoners escaped; about a hundred were immediately re-captured and killed. Some of the escapees joined partisan units operating in the area. The camp was dismantled by December 1943.\nThe Nazis also targeted Romani (Gypsies) as \"asocial\" and \"criminals\". By 1935, they were confined into special camps away from ethnic Germans. In 1938, Himmler issued an order in which he said that the \"Gypsy question\" would be determined by \"race\". Himmler believed that the Romani were originally Aryan but had become a mixed race; only the \"racially pure\" were to be allowed to live. In 1939, Himmler ordered thousands of Gypsies to be sent to the Dachau concentration camp and by 1942, ordered all Romani sent to Auschwitz concentration camp.\nHimmler was one of the main architects of the Holocaust, using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. Longerich surmises that Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich designed the Holocaust during a period of intensive meetings and exchanges in April\u2013May 1942. The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education. They wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As a student of agriculture and a farmer, Himmler was acquainted with the principles of selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades of the end of the war.\nPosen speeches.\nOn 4 October 1943, during a secret meeting with top SS officials in the city of Pozna\u0144 (Posen), and on 6 October 1943, in a speech to the party elite\u2014the \"Gauleiters\" and \"Reichsleiters\"\u2014Himmler referred explicitly to the \"extermination\" () of the Jewish people.\nA translated excerpt from the speech of 4 October reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI also want to refer here very frankly to a very difficult matter. We can now very openly talk about this among ourselves, and yet we will never discuss this publicly. Just as we did not hesitate on 30 June 1934, to perform our duty as ordered and put comrades who had failed up against the wall and execute them, we also never spoke about it, nor will we ever speak about it. Let us thank God that we had within us enough self-evident fortitude never to discuss it among us, and we never talked about it. Every one of us was horrified, and yet every one clearly understood that we would do it next time, when the order is given and when it becomes necessary.\nI am talking about the \"Jewish evacuation\": the extermination of the Jewish people. It is one of those things that is easily said. \"The Jewish people is being exterminated\", every Party member will tell you, \"perfectly clear, it's part of our plans, we're eliminating the Jews, exterminating them, ha!, a small matter.\" And then they turn up, the upstanding 80\u00a0million Germans, and each one has his decent Jew. They say the others are all swines, but this particular one is a splendid Jew. But none has observed it, endured it. Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person\u2014with exceptions due to human weaknesses\u2014has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of. Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had Jews as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble-rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war. If the Jews were still part of the German nation, we would most likely arrive now at the state we were at in 1916 and '17\u00a0...\nBecause the Allies had indicated that they were going to pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the ongoing genocide. Hitler therefore authorised Himmler's speeches to ensure that all party leaders were complicit in the crimes and could not later deny knowledge of the killings.\nGermanisation policies and \"Generalplan Ost\".\nAs Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) with the incorporated VoMi, Himmler was deeply involved in the Germanisation programme for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in \"Generalplan Ost\", the aim was to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make (\"living space\") for (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort. Approximately 11 million Slavic and 3.4\u00a0million Jewish inhabitants of Eastern Europe were killed in Nazi Germany's extermination campaigns during the implementation of \"Generalplan Ost\".\nHimmler's racial groupings began with the , the classification of people deemed of German blood. These included Germans who had collaborated with Germany before the war, but also those who considered themselves German but had been neutral; those who were partially \"Polonised\" but \"Germanisable\"; and Germans of Polish nationality. Himmler ordered that those who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour. Himmler's belief that \"it is in the nature of German blood to resist\" led to his conclusion that Balts or Slavs who resisted Germanisation were racially superior to more compliant ones. He declared that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind to mingle with an \"alien race\".\nThe plan also included the kidnapping of Eastern European children by Nazi Germany. Himmler urged:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Obviously in such a mixture of peoples, there will always be some racially good types. Therefore, I think that it is our duty to take their children with us, to remove them from their environment, if necessary by robbing, or stealing them. Either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves and give it a place in our people,\u00a0... or we destroy that blood.\nThe \"racially valuable\" children were to be removed from all contact with Poles and raised as Germans, with German names. Himmler declared: \"We have faith above all in this our own blood, which has flowed into a foreign nationality through the vicissitudes of German history. We are convinced that our own philosophy and ideals will reverberate in the spirit of these children who racially belong to us.\" The children were to be adopted by German families. Children who passed muster at first but were later rejected were taken to in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto, where most of them eventually died.\nBy January 1943, Himmler reported that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled in Polish territory; however, most resettled Germans did not live in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, as well as from Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour. Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as (race defilement).\n20 July plot.\nOn 20 July 1944, a group of German army officers led by Claus von Stauffenberg and including some of the highest-ranked members of the German armed forces attempted to assassinate Hitler, but failed to do so. The next day, Himmler formed a special commission that arrested over 5,000 suspected and known opponents of the regime. Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people. Though Himmler was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot, it led to an increase in his powers and authority.\nGeneral Friedrich Fromm, commander-in-chief of the Replacement Army (\"Ersatzheer\") and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one of those implicated in the conspiracy. Hitler removed Fromm from his post and named Himmler as his successor. Since the Replacement Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS. He appointed Hans J\u00fcttner, director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy, and began to fill top Replacement Army posts with SS men. By November 1944, Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.\nBy this time, Hitler had appointed Himmler as \"Reichsminister\" of the Interior, succeeding Frick, and General Plenipotentiary for Administration (\"Generalbevollm\u00e4chtigter f\u00fcr die Verwaltung\"). At the same time (24 August 1943) he also joined the six-member Council of Ministers for the Defence of the Reich, which operated as the war cabinet. In August 1944 Hitler authorised him to restructure the organisation and administration of the Waffen-SS, the army, and the police services. As head of the Replacement Army, Himmler was now responsible for prisoners of war. He was also in charge of the Wehrmacht penal system, and controlled the development of Wehrmacht armaments until January 1945.\nCommand of army group.\nOn 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France during Operation Overlord. In response, Army Group Upper Rhine (\"Heeresgruppe Oberrhein\") group was formed to engage the advancing US 7th Army (under command of General Alexander Patch) and French 1st Army (led by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny) in the Alsace region along the west bank of the Rhine. In late 1944, Hitler appointed Himmler commander-in-chief of Army Group Upper Rhine.\nOn 26 September 1944, Hitler ordered Himmler to create special army units, the \"Volkssturm\" (\"People's Storm\" or \"People's Army\"). All males aged sixteen to sixty were eligible for conscription into this militia, over the protests of Armaments Minister Albert Speer, who noted that irreplaceable skilled workers were being removed from armaments production. Hitler confidently believed six million men could be raised, and the new units would \"initiate a people's war against the invader\". These hopes were wildly optimistic. In October 1944, children as young as fourteen were being enlisted. Because of severe shortages in weapons and equipment and lack of training, members of the \"Volkssturm\" were poorly prepared for combat, and about 175,000 of them died in the final months of the war.\nOn 1 January 1945, Hitler and his generals launched Operation North Wind. The goal was to break through the lines of the US 7th Army and French 1st Army to support the southern thrust in the Battle of the Bulge (Ardennes offensive), the final major German offensive of the war. After limited initial gains by the Germans, the Americans halted the offensive. By 25 January, Operation North Wind had officially ended.\nOn 25 January 1945, despite Himmler's lack of military experience, Hitler appointed him as commander of the hastily formed Army Group Vistula (\"Heeresgruppe Weichsel\") to halt the Soviet Red Army's Vistula\u2013Oder offensive into Pomerania \u2013 a decision that appalled the German General Staff. Himmler established his command centre at Schneidem\u00fchl, using his special train, \"Sonderzug Steiermark\", as his headquarters. The train had only one telephone line, inadequate maps, and no signal detachment or radios with which to establish communication and relay military orders. Himmler seldom left the train, only worked about four hours per day, and insisted on a daily massage before commencing work and a lengthy nap after lunch.\nGeneral Heinz Guderian talked to Himmler on 9 February and demanded that Operation Solstice, an attack from Pomerania against the northern flank of Marshal Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front, should be in progress by the 16th. Himmler argued that he was not ready to commit himself to a specific date. Given Himmler's lack of qualifications as an army group commander, Guderian convinced himself that Himmler tried to conceal his incompetence. On 13 February Guderian met Hitler and demanded that General Walther Wenck be given a special mandate to command the offensive by Army Group Vistula. Hitler sent Wenck with a \"special mandate\", but without specifying Wenck's authority. The offensive was launched on 16 February 1945, but soon stuck in rain and mud, facing mine fields and strong antitank defences. That night Wenck was severely injured in a car accident, but it is doubtful that he could have salvaged the operation, as Guderian later claimed. Himmler ordered the offensive to stop on the 18th by a \"directive for regrouping\". Hitler officially ended Operation Solstice on 21 February and ordered Himmler to transfer a corps headquarter and three divisions to Army Group Center.\nHimmler was unable to devise any viable plans for completion of his military objectives. Under pressure from Hitler over the worsening military situation, Himmler became anxious and unable to give him coherent reports. When the counter-attack failed to stop the Soviet advance, Hitler held Himmler personally liable and accused him of not following orders. Himmler's military command ended on 20 March, when Hitler replaced him with General Gotthard Heinrici as Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula. By this time Himmler, who had been under the care of his doctor since 18 February, had fled to the Hohenlychen Sanatorium. Hitler sent Guderian on a forced medical leave of absence, and he reassigned his post as chief of staff to Hans Krebs on 29 March. \nHimmler's failure and Hitler's response marked a serious deterioration in the relationship between the two men. By that time, the inner circle of people Hitler trusted was rapidly shrinking.\nPeace negotiations.\nIn March 1945, the German war effort was on the verge of collapse and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.\nAlso in March 1945, Himmler issued a directive that Jews were to be marched from the South-east wall (\"S\u00fcdostwall\") fortifications construction project on the Austro-Hungarian border, to Mauthausen. He desired hostages for potential peace negotiations. Thousands died on the marches.\nHimmler and Hitler met for the last time on 20 April 1945\u2014Hitler's birthday\u2014in Berlin, and Himmler swore unswerving loyalty to Hitler. At a military briefing on that day, Hitler stated that he would not leave Berlin, in spite of Soviet advances. Along with G\u00f6ring, Himmler quickly left the city after the briefing. On 21 April, Himmler met with Norbert Masur, a Swedish representative of the World Jewish Congress, to discuss the release of Jewish concentration camp inmates. As a result of these negotiations, about 20,000 people were released in the White Buses operation. Himmler falsely claimed in the meeting that the crematoria at camps had been built to deal with the bodies of prisoners who had died in a typhus epidemic. He also claimed very high survival rates for the camps at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, even as these sites were liberated and it became obvious that his figures were false.\nOn 23 April, Himmler met directly with Bernadotte at the Swedish consulate in L\u00fcbeck. Representing himself as the provisional leader of Germany, he claimed that Hitler would be dead within the next few days. Hoping that the British and Americans would fight the Soviets alongside what remained of the Wehrmacht, Himmler asked Bernadotte to inform General Dwight Eisenhower that Germany wished to surrender to the Western Allies, and not to the Soviet Union. Bernadotte asked Himmler to put his proposal in writing, and Himmler obliged.\nMeanwhile, G\u00f6ring had sent a telegram, a few hours earlier, asking Hitler for permission to assume leadership of the \"Reich\" in his capacity as Hitler's designated deputy\u2014an act that Hitler, under the prodding of Martin Bormann, interpreted as a demand to step down or face a coup. On 27 April, Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in Berlin, Hermann Fegelein, was caught in civilian clothes preparing to desert; he was arrested and brought back to the \"F\u00fchrerbunker\". On the evening of 28 April, the BBC broadcast a Reuters news report about Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies. Hitler had long considered Himmler to be second only to Joseph Goebbels in loyalty; he called Himmler \"the loyal Heinrich\" (). Hitler flew into a rage at this betrayal, and told those still with him in the bunker complex that Himmler's secret negotiations were the worst treachery he had ever known. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest, and Fegelein was court-martialled and shot.\nBy this time, the Soviets had advanced to the Potsdamer Platz, only from the Reich Chancellery, and were preparing to storm the Chancellery. This report, combined with Himmler's treachery, prompted Hitler to write his last will and testament. In the testament, completed on 29 April\u2014one day before his suicide\u2014Hitler declared both Himmler and G\u00f6ring to be traitors. He stripped Himmler of all of his party and state offices and expelled him from the Nazi Party.\nHitler named Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz as his successor. Himmler met D\u00f6nitz in Flensburg and offered himself as second-in-command. He maintained that he was entitled to a position in D\u00f6nitz's interim government as \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\", believing the SS would be in a good position to restore and maintain order after the war. D\u00f6nitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. He wrote a letter on 6 May\u2014two days before the German Instrument of Surrender\u2014dismissing Himmler from all his posts.\nCapture and death.\nRejected by his former comrades and hunted by the Allies, Himmler attempted to go into hiding. He had not made extensive preparations for this, but he carried a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hizinger. On 11 May 1945, with a small band of companions, he headed south to Friedrichskoog, without a final destination in mind. They continued to Neuhaus, where the group split up. On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were stopped and detained at a checkpoint in Bremerv\u00f6rde set up by former Soviet POWs. Over the following two days, he was moved around to several camps and was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near L\u00fcneburg, on 23 May. The officials noticed that Himmler's identity papers bore a stamp that British military intelligence had seen being used by fleeing members of the SS.\nThe duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began a routine interrogation. Himmler admitted who he was, and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler was taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army in L\u00fcneburg, where a doctor conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden potassium cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes, despite efforts to expel the poison from his system. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near L\u00fcneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.\nMysticism and symbolism.\nHimmler was interested in mysticism and the occult from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly among members of the SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation. Viewing the SS as an \"order\" along the lines of the Teutonic Knights, he had them take over the Church of the Teutonic Order in Vienna in 1939. He began the process of replacing Christianity with a new moral code that rejected humanitarianism and challenged the Christian concept of marriage. The Ahnenerbe, a research society founded by Himmler in 1935, searched the globe for proof of the superiority and ancient origins of the Germanic race.\nAll regalia and uniforms of Nazi Germany, particularly those of the SS, used symbolism in their designs. The stylised lightning bolt logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of runes from a set of 18 Armanen runes created by Guido von List in 1906. The ancient Sowil\u014d rune originally symbolised the sun, but was renamed \"Sieg\" (victory) in List's iconography. Himmler modified a variety of existing customs to emphasise the elitism and central role of the SS; an SS naming ceremony was to replace baptism, marriage ceremonies were to be altered, a separate SS funeral ceremony was to be held in addition to Christian ceremonies, and SS-centric celebrations of the summer and winter solstices were instituted. The \"Totenkopf\" (death's head) symbol, used by German military units for hundreds of years, had been chosen for the SS by Julius Schreck. Himmler placed particular importance on the death's-head rings; they were never to be sold, and were to be returned to him upon the death of the owner. He interpreted the death's-head symbol to mean solidarity to the cause and a commitment unto death.\nRelationship with Hitler.\nAs second in command of the SS and then Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not involved with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.\nHitler promoted and practised the \"F\u00fchrerprinzip\". The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself\u2014the infallible leader\u2014at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed himself in a position of subservience to Hitler, and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he\u2014like other top Nazi officials\u2014had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor to Hitler.\nHitler called Himmler's mystical and pseudoreligious interests \"nonsense\". Himmler was not a member of Hitler's inner circle; the two men were not very close, and rarely saw each other socially. Himmler socialised almost exclusively with other members of the SS. His unconditional loyalty and efforts to please Hitler earned him the nickname of \"der treue Heinrich\" (\"the faithful Heinrich\"). However, in the last days of the war, when it became clear that Hitler planned to die in Berlin, Himmler left his long-time superior to try to save himself.\nMarriage and family.\nHimmler met his future wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, she was a nurse who shared his interest in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ah\u00e9, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of the clinic and used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts\u2014mostly unsuccessful\u2014to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, T\u00f6hle.\nAfter the Nazis came to power the family moved first to M\u00f6hlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Tegernsee, where they bought a house. Himmler also later obtained a large house in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem, free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as Himmler became totally absorbed by work. The relationship was strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.\nHedwig Potthast, Himmler's young secretary starting in 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left her job in 1941. He arranged accommodation for her, first in Mecklenburg and later at Berchtesgaden. He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942, Mecklenburg) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in Gmund with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship for the sake of her daughter. Working as a nurse for the German Red Cross during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in one of Germany's military districts, Wehrkreis III (Berlin-Brandenburg). Himmler was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed \"P\u00fcppi\" (\"dolly\"); he phoned her every few days and visited as often as he could.\nMargarete's diaries record that Gerhard left the National Political Educational Institute in Berlin due to poor examination results. At 16 he joined the SS in Brno and fought on the Eastern Front. He was captured by the Russians but was later returned to Germany.\nHedwig and Margarete both remained loyal to Himmler. Writing to Gebhard in February 1945, Margarete said, \"How wonderful that he has been called to great tasks and is equal to them. The whole of Germany is looking to him.\" Hedwig expressed similar sentiments in a letter to Himmler in January. Margarete and Gudrun left Gmund as Allied troops advanced into the area. They were arrested by American troops in Bolzano, Italy, and held in various internment camps in Italy, France, and Germany. They were brought to Nuremberg to testify at the trials and were released in November 1946. Gudrun emerged from the experience embittered by her alleged mistreatment and remained devoted to her father's memory. She later worked for the West German spy agency \"Bundesnachrichtendienst\" (BND) from 1961 to 1963.\nHistorical assessment.\nPeter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system under the auspices of the SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich. Historian Wolfgang Sauer says that \"although he was pedantic, dogmatic, and dull, Himmler emerged under Hitler as second in actual power. His strength lay in a combination of unusual shrewdness, burning ambition, and servile loyalty to Hitler.\" In 2008, the German news magazine described Himmler as one of the most brutal mass murderers in history and the architect of the Holocaust.\nHistorian John Toland relates a story by G\u00fcnter Syrup, a subordinate of Heydrich. Heydrich showed Syrup a picture of Himmler and said: \"The top half is the teacher, but the lower half is the sadist.\" Historian Adrian Weale comments that Himmler and the SS followed Hitler's policies without question or ethical considerations. Himmler accepted Hitler and Nazi ideology and saw the SS as a chivalric Teutonic order of new Germans. Himmler adopted the doctrine of (\"mission command\"), whereby orders were given as broad directives, with authority delegated downward to the appropriate level to carry them out in a timely and efficient manner. Weale states that the SS ideology gave the men a doctrinal framework, and the mission command tactics allowed the junior officers leeway to act on their own initiative to obtain the desired results.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nPrinted\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOnline\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "13443", "revid": "11104410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13443", "title": "HTTP", "text": "Application layer protocol\nHTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.\nHTTP is a request\u2013response protocol in the client\u2013server model. A transaction starts with a client submitting a request to the server, the server attempts to satisfy the request and returns a response to the client that describes the disposition of the request and optionally contains a requested resource such as an HTML document or other content.\nIn a common scenario, a web browser acts as the client and a web server, hosting one or more websites, is the server. A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and other software that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.\nHTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, whenever possible, to reduce network traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.\nTo allow intermediate HTTP nodes (proxy servers, web caches, etc.) to accomplish their functions, some of the HTTP headers (found in HTTP requests/responses) are managed hop-by-hop whereas other HTTP headers are managed end-to-end (managed only by the source client and by the target web server).\nA web resource is located by a uniform resource locator (URL), using the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes \"http\" and \"https\". URIs are encoded as hyperlinks in HTML documents, so as to form interlinked hypertext documents.\nVersions.\nThe protocol has been revised over time. A version is identified as HTTP/# where # is the version number. This article covers aspects of all versions but provides primary coverage for HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1. Separate articles cover HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 in detail.\nIn HTTP/1.0, a separate TCP connection to the same server is made for every resource request.\nIn HTTP/1.1, instead a TCP connection can be reused to make multiple resource requests (i.e. of HTML pages, frames, images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.). HTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less latency as the establishment of TCP connections presents considerable overhead, especially under high traffic conditions.\nEnhancements added with HTTP/2 allow for less latency and, in most cases, higher speeds than HTTP/1.1 communications. HTTP/2 adds support:\nHTTP/3 uses QUIC + UDP transport protocols instead of TCP. Only the IP layer is used (which UDP, like TCP, builds on). This slightly improves the average speed of communications and avoids the occasional problem of TCP connection congestion that can temporarily block or slow down the data flow of all its streams (another form of \"head of line blocking\").\nUse.\nHTTP/2 is supported by 66.2% of websites (35.3% HTTP/2 + 30.9% HTTP/3 with backwards compatibility) and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users). It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.\nHTTP/3 is used on 30.9% of websites and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users. HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. In 2019, support for HTTP/3 was first added to Cloudflare and Chrome and also enabled in Firefox. HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages and loads faster than HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1, which is still commonly the only protocol enabled.\nHTTPS, the secure variant of HTTP, is used by more than 85% of websites.\nHistory.\nThe term hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 in the Xanadu Project, which was in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's 1930s vision of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management \"memex\" system described in his 1945 essay \"As We May Think\". \nTim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN are credited with inventing HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a client user interface called web browser. Berners-Lee designed HTTP in order to help with the adoption of his other idea: the \"WorldWideWeb\" project, which was first proposed in 1989, now known as the World Wide Web. Development of HTTP was initiated in 1989 and summarized in a simple document describing the behavior of a client and a server using the first HTTP version, named 0.9.&lt;ref name=\"HTTP/0.9-specifications\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That version was subsequently developed, eventually becoming the public 1.0.&lt;ref name=\"HTTP/1.0-first-unofficial-draft\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Development of early HTTP Request for Comments (RFC) documents started a few years later in a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.\nThe first web server went live in 1990. The protocol used had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.\nHTTP/0.9.\nIn 1991, the first documented official version of HTTP was written as a plain document, less than 700 words long, and this version was named HTTP/0.9, which supported only GET method, allowing clients to only retrieve HTML documents from the server, but not supporting any other file formats or information upload.\nHTTP/1.0-draft.\nSince 1992, a new document was written to specify the evolution of the basic protocol towards its next full version. It supported both the simple request method of the 0.9 version and the full GET request that included the client HTTP version. This was the first of the many unofficial HTTP/1.0 drafts that preceded the final work on HTTP/1.0.\nW3C HTTP Working Group.\nAfter having decided that new features of HTTP protocol were required and that they had to be fully documented as official RFC documents, in early 1995, the HTTP Working Group (HTTP\u00a0WG, led by Dave Raggett) was constituted with the aim to standardize and expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields.\nThe HTTP WG planned to revise and publish new versions of the protocol as HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 within 1995, but, because of the many revisions, that timeline lasted much more than one year.\nThe HTTP WG planned also to specify a far future version of HTTP called HTTP-NG (HTTP Next Generation) that would have solved all remaining problems, of previous versions, related to performances, low latency responses, etc. but this work started only a few years later and it was never completed.\nHTTP/1.0.\nIn May 1996, was published as a final HTTP/1.0 revision of what had been used in previous 4 years as a pre-standard HTTP/1.0-draft which was already used by many web browsers and web servers.\nIn early 1996 developers started to even include unofficial extensions of the HTTP/1.0 protocol (i.e. keep-alive connections, etc.) into their products by using drafts of the upcoming HTTP/1.1 specifications.\nHTTP/1.1.\nSince early 1996, major web browsers and web server developers also started to implement new features specified by pre-standard HTTP/1.1 drafts specifications. End-user adoption of the new versions of browsers and servers was rapid. In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of browsers in use on the Internet used the new HTTP/1.1 header \"Host\" to enable virtual hosting, and that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers accessing their servers were pre-standard HTTP/1.1 compliant.\nIn January 1997, was officially released as HTTP/1.1 specifications.\nIn June 1999, was released to include all improvements and updates based on previous (obsolete) HTTP/1.1 specifications.\nW3C HTTP-NG Working Group.\nResuming the old 1995 plan of previous HTTP Working Group, in 1997 an \"HTTP-NG Working Group\" was formed to develop a new HTTP protocol named HTTP-NG (HTTP New Generation). A few proposals / drafts were produced for the new protocol to use multiplexing of HTTP transactions inside a single TCP/IP connection, but in 1999, the group stopped its activity passing the technical problems to IETF.\nIETF HTTP Working Group restarted.\nIn 2007, the IETF https:// (HTTP WG bis or HTTPbis) was restarted firstly to revise and clarify previous HTTP/1.1 specifications and secondly to write and refine future HTTP/2 specifications (named httpbis).\nSPDY.\nIn 2009, Google announced SPDY \u2013 a binary protocol they developed to speed up web traffic between browsers and servers. In many tests, using SPDY was indeed faster than using HTTP/1.1. SPDY was integrated into Google's Chromium and then into other major web browsers.&lt;ref name=\"SPDY-vs-HTTP/1.1\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ideas about multiplexing HTTP streams over a single TCP connection were taken from various sources, including the work of W3C HTTP-NG Working Group.\nHTTP/2.\nIn 2012, HTTP Working Group (HTTPbis) announced the need for a new protocol; initially considering aspects of SPDY and eventually deciding to derive the new protocol from SPDY.&lt;ref name=\"HTTP/2-introduction\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, HTTP/2 was published as . The protocol was quickly adopted by web browsers already supporting SPDY and more slowly by web servers.\n2014 updates to HTTP/1.1.\nIn June 2014, the HTTP Working Group released an updated six-part HTTP/1.1 specification obsoleting :\nHTTP/0.9 Deprecation.\nIn 2014, HTTP/0.9 was deprecated for servers supporting version HTTP/1.1 (and higher):&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Since HTTP/0.9 did not support header fields in a request, there is no mechanism for it to support name-based virtual hosts (selection of resource by inspection of the Host header field). Any server that implements name-based virtual hosts ought to disable support for HTTP/0.9. Most requests that appear to be HTTP/0.9 are, in fact, badly constructed HTTP/1.x requests caused by a client failing to properly encode the request-target.\nSince 2016 many product managers and developers of user agents (browsers, etc.) and web servers have begun planning to gradually deprecate and dismiss support for HTTP/0.9 protocol, mainly for the following reasons:&lt;ref name=\"HTTP/0.9-chrome-deprecated\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAs of 2022, HTTP/0.9 support has not been officially, completely deprecated and is still present in many web servers and browsers (for server responses only), even if usually disabled. It is unclear how long it will take to decommission HTTP/0.9.\nHTTP/3.\nIn 2020, the first drafts of HTTP/3 were published and major web browsers and web servers started to adopt it. On 6 June 2022, IETF standardized HTTP/3 as .\nUpdates and refactoring in 2022.\nIn June 2022, RFC documents were published that deprecated many of the previous documents and introducing a few minor changes and a refactoring of HTTP semantics description into a separate document.\nTransport layer.\nHTTP presumes an underlying and reliable transport layer protocol. The standard choice of the underlying protocol prior to HTTP/3 is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). HTTP/3 uses a different transport layer called QUIC, which provides reliability on top of the unreliable User Datagram Protocol (UDP). HTTP/1.1 and earlier have been adapted to be used over plain unreliable UDP in multicast and unicast situations, forming HTTPMU and HTTPU. They are used in UPnP and Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), two protocols usually run on a local area network.\nData exchange.\nHTTP is a stateless application-level protocol and it requires a reliable network transport connection to exchange data between client and server. In HTTP implementations, TCP/IP connections are used using well-known ports (typically port 80 if the connection is unencrypted or port 443 if the connection is encrypted, see also List of TCP and UDP port numbers). In HTTP/2, a TCP/IP connection plus multiple protocol channels are used. In HTTP/3, the application transport protocol QUIC over UDP is used.\nRequest and response messages through connections.\nData is exchanged through a sequence of request\u2013response messages which are exchanged by a session layer transport connection. An HTTP client initially tries to establish a connection, real or virtual, with a server. An HTTP server listening on the port accepts the connection and then waits for a client's request message. The client sends its HTTP request message. Upon receiving the request the server sends back an HTTP response message, which includes header(s) plus a body if it is required. The body of this response message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned. At any time and for many reasons either the client or server can close the connection. Closing a connection is usually advertised by one or more HTTP headers in the last request or response.\nPersistent connections.\nIn HTTP/0.9, the TCP/IP connection is always closed after server response has been sent, so it is never persistent.\nIn HTTP/1.0, the TCP/IP connection should always be closed by server after a response has been sent.\nIn HTTP/1.1, a keep-alive-mechanism was officially introduced so that a connection could be reused for more than one request/response. Such persistent connections reduce request latency perceptibly because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that, in general, the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP's slow-start-mechanism.\nHTTP/1.1 added also HTTP pipelining in order to further reduce lag time when using persistent connections by allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response. This optimization was never considered really safe because a few web servers and many proxy servers, specially transparent proxy servers placed in Internet / Intranets between clients and servers, did not handle pipelined requests properly (they served only the first request discarding the others, they closed the connection because they saw more data after the first request or some proxies even returned responses out of order etc.). Because of this, only HEAD and some GET requests (i.e. limited to real file requests and so with URLs without query string used as a command, etc.) could be pipelined in a safe and idempotent mode. After many years of struggling with the problems introduced by enabling pipelining, this feature was first disabled and then removed from most browsers also because of the announced adoption of HTTP/2.\nHTTP/2 extended the usage of persistent connections by multiplexing many concurrent requests/responses through a single TCP/IP connection.\nHTTP/3 does not use TCP/IP connections but QUIC + UDP.\nContent retrieval optimizations.\nIn HTTP/0.9, a requested resource was always sent in its entirety.\nHTTP/1.0 added headers to manage resources cached by a client in order to allow conditional GET requests. \nHTTP/1.1 introduced and later versions provide:\nApplication session.\nAs a stateless protocol, HTTP does not require the web server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. If a web application needs an application session, it implements it via HTTP cookies, hidden variables in a web form or another mechanism.\nTypically, to start a session, an interactive login is performed, and to end a session, a logout is requested by the user. These kind of operations use a custom authentication mechanism; not HTTP authentication.\nAuthentication.\nHTTP provides multiple authentication schemes such as basic access authentication and digest access authentication which operate via a challenge\u2013response mechanism whereby the server identifies and issues a challenge before serving the requested content.\nHTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication, via an extensible set of challenge\u2013response authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.\nThe authentication mechanisms described above belong to the HTTP protocol and are managed by client and server HTTP software (if configured to require authentication before allowing client access to one or more web resources), and not by the web applications using an application session.\nThe HTTP authentication specification includes realms that provide an arbitrary, implementation-specific construct for further dividing resources common to a given root URI. The realm value string, if present, is combined with the canonical root URI to form the protection space component of the challenge. This in effect allows the server to define separate authentication scopes under one root URI.\nEncrypted connection.\nThe most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTPS. Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist: Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and using the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header to specify an upgrade to TLS. Browser support for these two is, however, nearly non-existent.\nMessage format.\nThis section describes messages for HTTP/1.1. Later versions, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, use a binary protocol, where headers are encoded in a single codice_2 and zero or more codice_3 frames using HPACK (HTTP/2) or QPACK (HTTP/3), which both provide efficient header compression. The request or response line from HTTP/1 has also been replaced by several pseudo-header fields, each beginning with a colon (codice_4).\nAt the highest level, a message consists of a header followed by a body.\nHeader.\nA header consists of lines of ASCII text; each terminated with a carriage return and line feed sequence. The layout for both a request and a response header is:\nBody.\nA body consists of data in any format; not limited to ASCII. The format must match that specified by the header field if the message contains one. A body is optional or, in other words, can be blank.\nEntity.\nBefore HTTP/2, the term \"entity\" was used to mean the body plus header fields that describe the body. In particular, not all headers were considered part of the entity. The term \"entity header\" referred to a header that was considered part of the entity, and sometimes the body was called the \"entity body\". Modern documentation uses \"body\" and \"header\" without using \"entity\".\nHeader field.\nA header field represents metadata about its containing message such as how the body is encoded (via Content-Encoding), the session verification and identification of the client (as in browser cookies, IP address, user-agent) or their anonymity thereof (VPN or proxy masking, user-agent spoofing), how the server should handle data (as in Do-Not-Track or Global Privacy Control), the age (the time it has resided in a shared cache) of the document being downloaded, and much more. Generally, the information of a header field is used by software and not shown to the user.\nA header field line is formatted as a name-value pair with a colon separator. Whitespace is not allowed around the name, but leading and trailing whitespace is ignored for the value part. Unlike a method name that must match exactly (case-sensitive), a header field name is matched ignoring case although often shown with each word capitalized. For example, the following are header fields for and .\n Host: www.example.com\n Accept-Language: en\nThe standards do not limit the size of a header field or the number of fields in a message. However, most servers, clients, and proxy software impose limits for practical and security reasons. For example, the Apache 2.3 server by default limits the size of each field to 8190 bytes, and there can be at most 100 header fields in a single request.\nAlthough deprecated by RFC 7230, in the past, long lines could be split into multiple lines with a continuation line starting with a space or tab character.\nRequest.\nA request is sent by a client to a server. The start line includes a method name, a request URI and the protocol version with a single space between each field. The following request start line specifies method , URI and protocol version :\n GET /customer/123 HTTP/1.1\nRequest header fields allow the client to pass additional information beyond the request line, acting as request modifiers (similarly to the parameters of a procedure). They give information about the client, about the target resource, or about the expected handling of the request. In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all header fields except codice_5 are optional.\nA request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP/1.0 specification in .\nResource.\nThe protocol structures transaction as operating on resources. What a resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable running on the server.\nMethod.\nA request identifies a method (sometimes informally called \"verb\") to classify the desired action to be performed on a resource. The HTTP/1.0 specification defined the GET, HEAD, and POST methods as well as listing the PUT, DELETE, LINK and UNLINK methods under additional methods. However, the HTTP/1.1 specification added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and non-idempotent method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined, which allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, WebDAV defined seven new methods and specified the PATCH method. A general-purpose web server is required to implement at least GET and HEAD, and all other methods are considered optional by the specification.\nMethod names are case sensitive. This is in contrast to HTTP header field names which are case-insensitive.\nSafe method.\nA request method is \"safe\" if a request with that method has no intended effect on the server. The methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are defined as safe. In other words, safe methods are intended to be read-only. Safe methods can still have side effects not seen by the client, such as appending request information to a log file or charging an advertising account.\nIn contrast, the methods POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, and PATCH are not safe. They may modify the state of the server or have other effects such as sending an email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.\nDespite the prescribed safety of GET requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Careless or deliberately irregular programming can allow GET requests to cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged because of the problems which can occur when web caching, search engines, and other automated agents make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as \"https://example.com/article/1234/delete\", which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using GET, would simply delete the article. A properly coded website would require a DELETE or POST method for this action, which non-malicious bots would not make.\nOne example of this occurring in practice was during the short-lived Google Web Accelerator beta, which prefetched arbitrary URLs on the page a user was viewing, causing records to be automatically altered or deleted \"en masse\". The beta was suspended only weeks after its first release, following widespread criticism.\nIdempotent method.\nA request method is \"idempotent\" if multiple identical requests with that method have the same effect as a single such request. The methods PUT and DELETE, and safe methods are defined as idempotent. Safe methods are trivially idempotent, since they are intended to have no effect on the server whatsoever; the PUT and DELETE methods, meanwhile, are idempotent since successive identical requests will be ignored. A website might, for instance, set up a PUT endpoint to modify a user's recorded email address. If this endpoint is configured correctly, any requests which ask to change a user's email address to the same email address which is already recorded\u2014e.g. duplicate requests following a successful request\u2014will have no effect. Similarly, a request to DELETE a certain user will have no effect if that user has already been deleted.\nIn contrast, the methods POST, CONNECT, and PATCH are not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further modify the state of the server or have further effects, such as sending multiple emails. In some cases this is the desired effect, but in other cases it may occur accidentally. A user might, for example, inadvertently send multiple POST requests by clicking a button again if they were not given clear feedback that the first click was being processed. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.\nNote that whether or not a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. To do so against recommendations, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.\nCacheable method.\nA request method is \"cacheable\" if responses to requests with that method may be stored for future reuse. The methods GET, HEAD, and POST are defined as cacheable.\nIn contrast, the methods PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, and PATCH are not cacheable.\nResponse.\nA response is sent to the client by the server. The start line of a response consists of the protocol version, a status code and optionally a reason phrase with fields separated by a single space character. The following response start line specifies protocol version , status code and reason phrase .\n HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nResponse header fields allow the server to pass additional information beyond the status line, acting as response modifiers. They give information about the server or about further access to the target resource or related resources. Each response header field has a defined meaning which can be further refined by the semantics of the request method or response status code.\nStatus code.\nThe status code is a three-digit, decimal, integer value that represents the disposition of the server's attempt to satisfy the client's request. Generally, a client handles a response primarily based on the status code and secondarily on response header fields. A client may not understand each status code that a server reports but it must understand the class as indicated by the first digit and treat an unrecognized code as equivalent to the x00 code of that class. The classes are as follows:\nReason phrase.\nThe standard reason phrases are only recommendations. A web server is allowed to use a localized equivalent. If a status code indicates a problem, the user agent might display the reason phrase to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the reason phrase, though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and reason phrases are human-readable.\nExample.\nThe following demonstrates an HTTP/1.1 request-response transaction for a server at www.example.com, port 80. HTTP/1.0 would use the same messages except for a few missing headers. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 would use the same request-response mechanism but with different representations for HTTP headers.\nThe following is a request with no body. It consists of a start line, 6 header fields and a blank line \u2013 each terminated with a carriage return and line feed sequence. The codice_5 header field distinguishes between various DNS names sharing a single IP address, allowing name-based virtual hosting. While optional in HTTP/1.0, it is mandatory in HTTP/1.1.\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nConnection: keep-alive\nAlthough not clear in the representation above (due to limitations of this wiki), the blank line at the end results in ending in two line terminator sequences. Represented as a stream of characters, a shorted version of above shows this more clearly with codice_8 representing a line terminator sequence: codice_9.\nIn the following response, the ETag (entity tag) header field is used to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server. The codice_10 header field specifies the Internet media type of the data conveyed by the HTTP message, and codice_1 indicates its length in bytes. The HTTP/1.1 webserver publishes its ability to respond to requests for a byte range of the resource by including codice_12. This is useful, if the client needs to have only certain portions of a resource sent by the server, which is called byte serving. When codice_13 is sent, it means that the web server will close the TCP connection immediately after the end of the transfer of this response.\nMost of the header fields are optional but some are mandatory. When header codice_1 is missing from a response with a body, then this should be considered an error in HTTP/1.0 but it may not be an error in HTTP/1.1 if header codice_15 is present. Chunked transfer encoding uses a chunk size of 0 to mark the end of the content. Some old implementations of HTTP/1.0 omitted the header codice_1 when the length of the body was not known at the beginning of the response and so the transfer of data to client continued until server closed the socket.\ncodice_17 informs the client that the body is compressed per the gzip algorithm.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 23 May 2005 22:38:34 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 155\nLast-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 23:11:55 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)\nETag: \"3f80f-1b6-3e1cb03b\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nConnection: close\n&lt;html&gt;\n &lt;head&gt;\n &lt;title&gt;An Example Page&lt;/title&gt;\n &lt;/head&gt;\n &lt;body&gt;\n &lt;p&gt;Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13445", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13445", "title": "Heinrich Hertz", "text": "German physicist (1857\u20131894)\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz ( ; ; 22 February 1857 \u2013 1 January 1894) was a German physicist who first conclusively proved the existence of the electromagnetic waves proposed by James Clerk Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.\nBiography.\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz was born on 22 February 1857 in Hamburg, the son of Gustav Ferdinand Hertz, a lawyer and politician, and Anna Elisabeth Pfefferkorn.\nWhile studying at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg, Hertz showed an aptitude for sciences as well as languages, learning Arabic. He studied sciences and engineering in the German cities of Dresden, Munich, and Berlin, where he studied under Gustav Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz. In 1880, Hertz obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Berlin, and for the next three years remained for post-doctoral study under Helmholtz, serving as his assistant. In 1883, Hertz took a post as a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Kiel. In 1885, Hertz became a full professor at the University of Karlsruhe.\nIn 1886, Hertz married Elisabeth Doll, the daughter of Max Doll, a lecturer in geometry at Karlsruhe. They had two daughters: Johanna, born on 20 October 1887 and Mathilde, born on 14 January 1891, who went on to become a notable biologist. During this time Hertz conducted his landmark research into electromagnetic waves.\nHertz took a position of Professor of Physics and Director of the Physics Institute at the University of Bonn on 3 April 1889, a position he held until his death. During this time he worked on theoretical mechanics with his work published in the book \"Die Prinzipien der Mechanik in neuem Zusammenhange dargestellt\" (\"The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form\"), published posthumously in 1894.\nDeath.\nIn 1892, Hertz was diagnosed with an infection (after a bout of severe migraines) and underwent operations to treat the illness. He died due to complications after surgery which had attempted to cure his condition. Some consider his ailment to have been caused by a malignant bone condition. He died on 1 January 1894 in Bonn, aged 36, and is buried in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.\nHertz's wife, Elisabeth Hertz (\"n\u00e9e\" Doll; 1864\u20131941), did not remarry. He was survived by his daughters, Johanna (1887\u20131967) and Mathilde (1891\u20131975). Neither ever married or had children, hence Hertz has no living descendants.\nScientific work.\nElectromagnetic waves.\nIn 1864 Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell proposed a comprehensive theory of electromagnetism, now called Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's theory predicted that coupled electric and magnetic fields could travel through space as an \"electromagnetic wave\". Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, but no one had been able to prove this, or generate or detect electromagnetic waves of other wavelengths.\nDuring Hertz's studies in 1879 Helmholtz suggested that Hertz's doctoral dissertation be on testing Maxwell's theory. Helmholtz had also proposed the \"Berlin Prize\" problem that year at the Prussian Academy of Sciences for anyone who could experimentally prove an electromagnetic effect in the polarization and depolarization of insulators, something predicted by Maxwell's theory. Helmholtz was sure Hertz was the most likely candidate to win it. Not seeing any way to build an apparatus to experimentally test this, Hertz thought it was too difficult, and worked on electromagnetic induction instead. Hertz did produce an analysis of Maxwell's equations during his time at Kiel, showing they did have more validity than the then prevalent \"action at a distance\" theories.\nIn the autumn of 1886, after Hertz received his professorship at Karlsruhe, he was experimenting with a pair of Riess spirals when he noticed that discharging a Leyden jar into one of these coils produced a spark in the other coil. With an idea on how to build an apparatus, Hertz now had a way to proceed with the \"Berlin Prize\" problem of 1879 on proving Maxwell's theory (although the actual prize had expired uncollected in 1882). He used a dipole antenna consisting of two collinear one-meter wires with a spark gap between their inner ends, and zinc spheres attached to the outer ends for capacitance, as a radiator. The antenna was excited by pulses of high voltage of about 30 kilovolts applied between the two sides from a Ruhmkorff coil. He received the waves with a resonant single-loop antenna with a micrometer spark gap between the ends. This experiment produced and received what are now called radio waves in the very high frequency range.\nBetween 1886 and 1889 Hertz conducted a series of experiments that would prove the effects he was observing were results of Maxwell's predicted electromagnetic waves. Starting in November 1887 with his paper \"On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators\", Hertz sent a series of papers to Helmholtz at the Berlin Academy, including papers in 1888 that showed transverse free space electromagnetic waves traveling at a finite speed over a distance. In the apparatus Hertz used, the electric and magnetic fields radiated away from the wires as transverse waves. Hertz had positioned the oscillator about 12 meters from a zinc reflecting plate to produce standing waves. Each wave was about 4 meters long. Using the ring detector, he recorded how the wave's magnitude and component direction varied. Hertz measured Maxwell's waves and demonstrated that the velocity of these waves was equal to the velocity of light. The electric field intensity, polarization and reflection of the waves were also measured by Hertz. These experiments established that light and these waves were both a form of electromagnetic radiation obeying the Maxwell equations.\nHertz did not realize the practical importance of his radio wave experiments. He stated that,\nIt's of no use whatsoever ... this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right\u2014we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there.\nAsked about the applications of his discoveries, Hertz replied,\nNothing, I guess.\nHertz's proof of the existence of airborne electromagnetic waves led to an explosion of experimentation with this new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was called \"Hertzian waves\" until around 1910 when the term \"radio waves\" became current. Within 6 years Guglielmo Marconi began developing a radio wave based wireless telegraphy system, leading to the wide use of radio communication.\nCathode rays.\nIn 1883, he tried to prove that the cathode rays are electrically neutral and got what he interpreted as a confident absence of deflection in electrostatic field. However, as J. J. Thomson explained in 1897, Hertz placed the deflecting electrodes in a highly-conductive area of the tube, resulting in a strong screening effect close to their surface.\nNine years later Hertz began experimenting and demonstrated that cathode rays could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as aluminium). Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this \"ray effect\". He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration by X-rays of various materials. However, Lenard did not realize that he was producing X-rays. Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before R\u00f6ntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (\"Wiedmann's Annalen\", Vol. XLVIII). However, he did not work with actual X-rays.\nPhotoelectric effect.\nHertz helped establish the photoelectric effect (which was later explained by Albert Einstein) when he noticed that a charged object loses its charge more readily when illuminated by ultraviolet radiation (UV). In 1887, he made observations of the photoelectric effect and of the production and reception of electromagnetic (EM) waves, published in the journal \"Annalen der Physik\". His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, whereby a spark would be seen upon detection of EM waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. He observed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of EM waves and the receiver absorbed UV that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he substituted quartz for glass, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect, nor did he make any attempt at explaining how the observed phenomenon was brought about.\nContact mechanics.\nIn 1881 and 1882, Hertz published two articles on what was to become known as the field of contact mechanics, which proved to be an important basis for later theories in the field. Joseph Valentin Boussinesq published some critically important observations on Hertz's work, nevertheless establishing this work on contact mechanics to be of immense importance. His work basically summarises how two axi-symmetric objects placed in contact will behave under loading, he obtained results based upon the classical theory of elasticity and continuum mechanics. The most significant flaw of his theory was the neglect of any nature of adhesion between the two solids, which proves to be important as the materials composing the solids start to assume high elasticity. It was natural to neglect adhesion at the time, however, as there were no experimental methods of testing for it.\nTo develop his theory Hertz used his observation of elliptical Newton's rings formed upon placing a glass sphere upon a lens as the basis of assuming that the pressure exerted by the sphere follows an elliptical distribution. He used the formation of Newton's rings again while validating his theory with experiments in calculating the displacement which the sphere has into the lens. Kenneth L. Johnson, K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts (JKR) used this theory as a basis while calculating the theoretical displacement or \"indentation depth\" in the presence of adhesion in 1971. Hertz's theory is recovered from their formulation if the adhesion of the materials is assumed to be zero. Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, B. V. Derjaguin, V. M. Muller and Y. P. Toporov published another theory in 1975, which came to be known as the DMT theory in the research community, which also recovered Hertz's formulations under the assumption of zero adhesion. This DMT theory proved to be premature and needed several revisions before it came to be accepted as another material contact theory in addition to the JKR theory. Both the DMT and the JKR theories form the basis of contact mechanics upon which all transition contact models are based and used in material parameter prediction in nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. These models are central to the field of tribology and he was named as one of the 23 \"Men of Tribology\" by Duncan Dowson. Despite preceding his great work on electromagnetism (which he himself considered with his characteristic soberness to be trivial), Hertz's research on contact mechanics has facilitated the age of nanotechnology.\nHertz also described the \"Hertzian cone\", a type of fracture mode in brittle solids caused by the transmission of stress waves.\nMeteorology.\nHertz always had a deep interest in meteorology, probably derived from his contacts with Wilhelm von Bezold (who was his professor in a laboratory course at the Munich Polytechnic in the summer of 1878). As an assistant to Helmholtz in Berlin, he contributed a few minor articles in the field, including research on the evaporation of liquids, a new kind of hygrometer, and a graphical means of determining the properties of moist air when subjected to adiabatic changes.\nPhilosophy of science.\nIn the introduction of his 1894 book \"Principles of Mechanics\", Hertz discusses the different \"pictures\" used to represent physics in his time including the picture of Newtonian mechanics (based on mass and forces), a second picture (based on conservation of energy and Hamilton's principle) and his own picture (based uniquely on space, time, mass and the Hertz principle), comparing them in terms of 'permissibility', 'correctness' and 'appropriateness'. Hertz wanted to remove \"empty assumptions\" and argue against the Newtonian concept of force and against action at a distance. Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein inspired by Hertz's work, extended his picture theory into a picture theory of language in his 1921 \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" which influenced logical positivism\".\" Wittgenstein also quotes him in the \"Blue and Brown Books\".\nThird Reich treatment.\nBecause Hertz's family converted from Judaism to Lutheranism two decades before his birth, his legacy ran afoul of the Nazi government in the 1930s, a regime that classified people by \"race\" instead of religious affiliation.\nHertz's name was removed from streets and institutions and there was even a movement to rename the frequency unit named in his honor (hertz) after Hermann von Helmholtz instead, keeping the symbol (Hz) unchanged.\nHis family was also persecuted for their non-Aryan status. Hertz's youngest daughter, Mathilde, lost a lectureship at Berlin University after the Nazis came to power and within a few years she, her sister, and their mother left Germany and settled in England.\nLegacy and honors.\nHeinrich Hertz's nephew, Gustav Ludwig Hertz was a Nobel Prize winner, and Gustav's son Carl Helmut Hertz invented medical ultrasonography. His daughter Mathilde Carmen Hertz was a well-known biologist and comparative psychologist. Hertz's grandnephew Hermann Gerhard Hertz, professor at the University of Karlsruhe, was a pioneer of NMR-spectroscopy and in 1995 published Hertz's laboratory notes.\nThe SI unit \"hertz\" (Hz) was established in his honor by the International Electrotechnical Commission in 1930 for frequency, an expression of the number of times that a repeated event occurs per second. It was adopted by the CGPM (Conf\u00e9rence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des poids et mesures) in 1960, officially replacing the previous name, \"cycles per second\" (cps).\nIn 1928 the Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was founded in Berlin. Today known as the \"Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI\".\nIn 1969, in East Germany, a Heinrich Hertz memorial medal was cast.\nThe IEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal, established in 1987, is \"\"for outstanding achievements in Hertzian waves \"[...]\" presented annually to an individual for achievements which are theoretical or experimental in nature\"\".\nThe Submillimeter Radio Telescope at Mt. Graham, Arizona, constructed in 1992 is named after him.\nA crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just behind the eastern limb, is the Hertz crater, named in his honor.\nOn his birthday in 2012, Google honored Hertz with a Google doodle, inspired by his life's work, on its home page.\nWorks.\nArticles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\nLists and histories\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nElectromagnetic radiation\nOther\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13446", "revid": "46685118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13446", "title": "Hebrew alphabet", "text": "Alphabet of the Hebrew language \nThe Hebrew alphabet (,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a] ), known variously by scholars as the Ktav Ashuri, Jewish script, square script and block script, is a unicameral abjad script used in the writing of the Hebrew language. Alphabets based on the Hebrew script are used to write other Jewish languages, most notably Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Arabic, and Judeo-Persian. In modern Hebrew, vowels are increasingly introduced. Hebrew script is used informally in Israel to write Levantine Arabic, especially among Druze. The script is an offshoot of the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, which flourished during the Achaemenid Empire, and which itself derives from the Phoenician alphabet.\nHistorically, a different abjad script was used to write Hebrew: the original, old Hebrew script, now known as the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, has been largely preserved in a variant form as the Samaritan alphabet, and is still used by the Samaritans. The present \"Jewish script\" or \"square script\", on the contrary, is a stylized form of the Aramaic alphabet and was technically known by Jewish sages as Ashurit (lit.\u2009'Assyrian script'), since its origins were known to be from Assyria (Mesopotamia).\nVarious \"styles\" (in current terms, \"fonts\") of representation of the Jewish script letters described in this article also exist, including a variety of cursive Hebrew styles. In the remainder of this article, the term \"Hebrew alphabet\" refers to the square script unless otherwise indicated.\nThe Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. It does not have case. Five letters have different forms when used at the end of a word. Hebrew is written from right to left. Originally, the alphabet was an abjad consisting only of consonants, but is now considered an impure abjad. As with other abjads, such as the Arabic alphabet, during its centuries-long use scribes devised means of indicating vowel sounds by separate vowel points, known in Hebrew as \"niqqud.\" In both biblical and rabbinic Hebrew, the letters can also function as \"matres lectionis\", which is when certain consonants are used to indicate vowels. There is a trend in Modern Hebrew towards the use of \"matres lectionis\" to indicate vowels that have traditionally gone unwritten, a practice known as \"full spelling\".\nThe Yiddish alphabet, a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet used to write Yiddish, is a true alphabet, with all vowels rendered in the spelling, except in the case of inherited Hebrew words, which typically retain their Hebrew consonant-only spellings.\nThe Arabic and Hebrew alphabets have similarities in acrophony because it is said that they are both derived from the Aramaic alphabet, which in turn derives from the Phoenician alphabet, both being slight regional variations of the Proto-Canaanite alphabet used in ancient times to write the various Canaanite languages (including Hebrew, Moabite, Phoenician, Punic, et cetera).\nHistory.\nThe Canaanite dialects were largely indistinguishable before around 1000 BCE. An example of related early Semitic inscriptions from the area include the tenth-century Gezer calendar over which scholars are divided as to whether its language is Hebrew or Phoenician and whether the script is Proto-Canaanite or Paleo-Hebrew.\nA Hebrew variant of the Proto-Canaanite alphabet, called the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet by scholars, began to emerge around 800 BCE. An example is the Siloam inscription (c.\u2009700 BCE).\nThe Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was used in the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Following the Babylonian exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE, Jews began using a form of the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, another offshoot of the same family of scripts, which flourished during the Achaemenid Empire (and which in turn had been adopted from the Assyrians). The Samaritans, who remained in the Land of Israel, continued to use the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. During the 3rd century BCE (after the end of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BCE), Jews began to use a stylized, \"square\" form of the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, while the Samaritans continued to use a form of the Paleo-Hebrew script called the Samaritan alphabet. For a few centuries, Jews used both scripts (although use of Paleo-Hebrew was limited then) before eventually, after the 1st century BCE, settling on the square Assyrian form.\nThe square Hebrew alphabet was later adapted and used for writing languages of the Jewish diaspora\u00a0\u2013 such as Karaim, the Judeo-Arabic languages, Judaeo-Spanish, and Yiddish. The Hebrew alphabet continued in use for scholarly writing in Hebrew and came again into everyday use with the rebirth of the Hebrew language as a spoken language in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in Israel.\nDescription.\nGeneral.\nIn the traditional form, the Hebrew alphabet is an abjad consisting only of consonants, written from right to left. It has 22 letters, five of which use different forms at the end of a word.\nVowels.\nIn the traditional form, vowels are indicated by the weak consonants Aleph (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u200e), He (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d4\u200e), Waw/Vav (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d5\u200e), or Yodh (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u200e) serving as vowel letters, or \"matres lectionis\": the letter is combined with a previous vowel and becomes silent, or by imitation of such cases in the spelling of other forms. Also, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called niqqud, was developed. In modern forms of the alphabet, as in the case of Yiddish and to some extent Modern Hebrew, vowels may be indicated. Today, the trend is toward full spelling with the weak letters acting as true vowels.\nWhen used to write Yiddish, vowels are indicated, using certain letters, either with niqqud diacritics (e.g. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u05b8\u200e or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u05b4\u200e) or without (e.g. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u200e or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u200e), except for Hebrew words, which in Yiddish are written in their Hebrew spelling.\nTo preserve the proper vowel sounds, scholars developed several different sets of vocalization and diacritical symbols called \"nequdot\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e0\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea\u200e\u200e, literally \"points\"). One of these, the Tiberian system, eventually prevailed. Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, and his family for several generations, are credited for refining and maintaining the system. These points are normally used only for special purposes, such as Biblical books intended for study, in poetry or when teaching the language to children. The Tiberian system also includes a set of cantillation marks, called \"trope\" or , used to indicate how scriptural passages should be chanted in synagogue recitations of scripture (although these marks do not appear in the scrolls). In everyday writing of modern Hebrew, \"niqqud\" are absent; however, patterns of how words are derived from Hebrew roots (called \"shorashim\" or \"triliterals\") allow Hebrew speakers to determine the vowel-structure of a given word from its consonants based on the word's context and part of speech.\nAlphabet.\nUnlike the Paleo-Hebrew writing script, the modern Hebrew script has five letters that have special final forms,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[c] called sofit (, meaning in this context \"final\" or \"ending\") form, used only at the end of a word, somewhat as in the Greek or in the Arabic and Mandaic alphabets.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b] These are shown below the normal form in the following table (letter names are Unicode standard). Although Hebrew is read and written from right to left, the following table shows the letters in order from left to right:\nOrder.\nAs far back as the 13th century BCE, ancient Hebrew abecedaries indicate a slightly different ordering of the alphabet. The Zayit Stone, Izbet Sartah ostracon, and one inscription from Kuntillet Ajrud each contain a number of reverse letter orders; such as -, -, -, etc.\nA reversal to can be clearly seen in the Book of Lamentations, whose first four chapters are ordered as alphabetical acrostics. In the Masoretic Text, the first chapter has the now-usual ordering, and the second, third and fourth chapters exhibit . In the Dead Sea Scrolls version (4QLam/4Q111), reversed ordering also appears in the first chapter (i.e. in all the first four chapters). The fact that these chapters follow the pre-exilic order is evidence for them being written shortly after the events described, rather than being later, post-exilic compositions.\nPronunciation.\nAlphabet.\nThe descriptions that follow are based on the pronunciation of modern standard Israeli Hebrew.\nShin and sin.\nHistorically, \"left-dot-sin\" corresponds to Proto-Semitic *, which in biblical-Judaic-Hebrew corresponded to the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (or /\u015b/).\nDagesh.\nHistorically, the consonants &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u200e \"bet\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d2\u200e \"gimmel\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d3\u200e \"daleth\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05db\u200e \"kaf\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u200e \"pe\" and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05ea\u200e \"tav\" each had two sounds: one hard (plosive), and one soft (fricative), depending on the position of the letter and other factors. When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called \"dagesh\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d3\u05d2\u05e9\u200e), while the soft sounds lack a \"dagesh\". In modern Hebrew, however, the \"dagesh\" only changes the pronunciation of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u200e \"bet\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05db\u200e \"kaf\", and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u200e \"pe\", and does not affect the name of the letter. The differences are as follows:\nIn other dialects (mainly liturgical) there are variations from this pattern.\nSounds represented with diacritic geresh.\nThe sounds , , , written \u27e8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e6\u05f3\u200e\u27e9, \u27e8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d2\u05f3\u200e\u27e9, \u27e8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d6\u05f3\u200e\u27e9, and , non-standardly sometimes transliterated \u27e8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d5\u05d5\u200e\u27e9, are often found in slang and loanwords that are part of the everyday Hebrew colloquial vocabulary. The symbol resembling an apostrophe after the Hebrew letter modifies the pronunciation of the letter and is called a \"geresh\".\nThe pronunciation of the following letters can also be modified with the geresh diacritic. The represented sounds are however foreign to Hebrew phonology, i.e., these symbols mainly represent sounds in foreign words or names when transliterated with the Hebrew alphabet, and not loanwords.\n\"Geresh\" is also used to denote an abbreviation consisting of a single Hebrew letter, while \"gershayim\" (a doubled \"geresh\") are used to denote acronyms pronounced as a string of letters; \"geresh\" and \"gershayim\" are also used to denote Hebrew numerals consisting of a single Hebrew letter or of multiple Hebrew letters, respectively. Geresh is also the name of a cantillation mark used for Torah recitation, though its visual appearance and function are different in that context.\nIdentical pronunciation.\nIn much of Israel's general population, especially where Ashkenazic pronunciation is prevalent, many letters have the same pronunciation. They are as follows:\nAncient Hebrew pronunciation.\nSome of the variations in sound mentioned above are due to a systematic feature of Ancient Hebrew. The six consonants were pronounced differently depending on their position. These letters were also called \"BeGeD KeFeT\" letters . The full details are very complex; this summary omits some points. They were pronounced as plosives at the beginning of a syllable, or when doubled. They were pronounced as fricatives when preceded by a vowel (sometimes indicated with a macron, \u1e07 \u1e21 \u1e0f \u1e35 p\u0304 \u1e6f). The plosive and double pronunciations were indicated by the \"dagesh\". In Modern Hebrew the sounds \u1e0f and \u1e21 have reverted to and , respectively, and \u1e6f has become , so only the remaining three consonants show variation. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e8\u200e \"resh\" may have also been a \"doubled\" letter, making the list \"BeGeD KePoReT\". (Sefer Yetzirah, 4:1)\nRegional and historical variation.\nThe following table contains the pronunciation of the Hebrew letters in reconstructed historical forms and dialects using the . The apostrophe-looking symbol after some letters is not a yud but a geresh. It is used for loanwords with non-native Hebrew sounds. The dot in the middle of some of the letters, called a \"dagesh kal\", also modifies the sounds of the letters &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05db\u200e and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u200e in modern Hebrew (in some forms of Hebrew it modifies also the sounds of the letters &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d2\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d3\u200e and/or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05ea\u200e; the \"dagesh chazak\"\u00a0\u2013 orthographically indistinguishable from the \"dagesh kal\"\u00a0\u2013 designates gemination, which today is realized only rarely\u00a0\u2013 e.g. in biblical recitations or when using Arabic loanwords).\nVowels.\nMatres lectionis.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u200e \"alef\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u200e \"ayin\", &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d5\u200e \"waw/vav\" and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u200e \"yod\" are letters that can sometimes indicate a vowel instead of a consonant (which would be, respectively, ). When they do, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d5\u200e and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u200e are considered to constitute part of the vowel designation in combination with a niqqud symbol\u00a0\u2013 a vowel diacritic (whether or not the diacritic is marked), whereas &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u200e and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u200e are considered to be mute, their role being purely indicative of the non-marked vowel.\nVowel points.\n\"Niqqud\" is the system of dots that help determine vowels and consonants. In Hebrew, all forms of \"niqqud\" are often omitted in writing, except for children's books, prayer books, poetry, foreign words, and words which would be ambiguous to pronounce. Israeli Hebrew has five vowel phonemes, , but many more written symbols for them:\nMeteg.\nBy adding a vertical line (called \"Meteg\") underneath the letter and to the left of the vowel point, the vowel is made long. The \"meteg\" is only used in Biblical Hebrew, not Modern Hebrew.\nSh'va.\nBy adding two vertical dots (called \"sh'va\") underneath the letter, the vowel is made very short. When sh'va is placed on the first letter of the word, mostly it is \"\u00e8\" (but in some instances, it makes the first letter silent without a vowel (vowel-less): e.g. \u05d5\u05b0 \"w\u00e8\" to \"w\").\nGershayim.\nThe symbol &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05f4\u200e is called a \"gershayim\" and is a punctuation mark used in the Hebrew language to denote acronyms. It is written before the last letter in the acronym, e.g. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e8\u05f4\u05ea\u200e. \"Gershayim\" is also the name of a cantillation mark in the reading of the Torah, printed above the accented letter, e.g. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u059e\u200e.\nStylistic variants.\nThe following table displays typographic and chirographic variants of each letter. For the letters that have different forms in word-final position, the final forms are displayed beneath the regular forms.\nThe block (\"square\", or \"print\" form) and cursive (\"handwritten\" form) are the only variants in widespread contemporary use. Rashi is also used, for historical reasons, in a handful of standard texts. \n \" Hebrew alphabet (135 CE \u2013 present): Variants\" \nNumeric values of letters.\nFollowing the adoption of Greek Hellenistic alphabetic numeration practice, Hebrew letters started being used to denote numbers in the late 2nd century BCE, and performed this arithmetic function for about a thousand years. \nTransliterations and transcriptions.\nThe following table lists transliterations and transcriptions of Hebrew letters used in Modern Hebrew.\nClarifications:\nNote: SBL's transliteration system, recommended in its \"Handbook of Style\", differs slightly from the 2006 \"precise\" transliteration system of the Academy of the Hebrew Language; for \u27e8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e6\u200e\u27e9 SBL uses \u27e8\u1e63\u27e9 (\u2260 AHL \u27e8\u1e93\u27e9), and for with no dagesh, SBL uses the same symbols as for with dagesh (i.e. \u27e8b\u27e9, \u27e8g\u27e9, \u27e8d\u27e9, \u27e8k\u27e9, \u27e8f\u27e9, \u27e8t\u27e9).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt; &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt; &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt; &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt; A1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ 4&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ In transliterations of modern Israeli Hebrew, initial and final &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u200e (in regular transliteration), silent or initial &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u200e, and silent &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d4\u200e are \"not\" transliterated.

Since the Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d0\u200e in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop \u00a0\u02be\u00a0 is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in \"im\", \"em\" and \"om\", respectively.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt; &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt; &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt; B1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The diacritic geresh \u27e8&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05f3\u200e\u27e9 is used with some other letters as well (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d3\u05f3\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d7\u05f3\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d8\u05f3\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u05f3\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e8\u05f3\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05ea\u05f3\u200e), but only to transliterate \"from\" other languages \"to\" Hebrew\u00a0\u2013 never to spell Hebrew words; therefore they were not included in this table (correctly translating a Hebrew text with these letters would require using the spelling in the language from which the transliteration to Hebrew was originally made).

Some sources in classical rabbinical literature seem to acknowledge the historical provenance of the currently used Hebrew alphabet and deal with them as a mundane subject (the Jerusalem Talmud, for example, records that \"the Israelites took for themselves square calligraphy\", and that the letters \"came with the Israelites from Ashur [Assyria]\"); others attribute mystical significance to the letters, connecting them with the process of creation or the redemption. In mystical conceptions, the alphabet is considered eternal, pre-existent to the Earth, and the letters themselves are seen as having holiness and power, sometimes to such an extent that several stories from the Talmud illustrate the idea that they cannot be destroyed.\nThe idea of the letters' creative power finds its greatest vehicle in the Sefer Yezirah, or \"Book of Creation\", a mystical text of uncertain origin which describes a story of creation highly divergent from that in the Book of Genesis, largely through exposition on the powers of the letters of the alphabet: the letters are connected with the planets of universe, the astrology, with all parts of human-body and their \"cause-effect reactions\", the Sefirot and the ways of spiritual and material life; so Bereshit Rabbah, the Midrash of Genesis, teaches that God did the world with his wisdom, that is the Torah with the letters of Hebrew. In Kabbalah all letters had the symbolic value that could be studied with trascendent exegesis, i.e. the \"sod\" of Pardes; the created things (mineral, vegetal, animal and human levels of this world) have hebrew names which conceal their essential nature, like the first man Adam who was knowing all names of all animals. The supposed creative powers of the letters are also referenced in the Talmud and Zohar.\nAnother book, the 13th-century Kabbalistic text Sefer HaTemunah, holds that a single letter of unknown pronunciation, held by some to be the four-pronged shin on one side of the teffilin box, is missing from the current alphabet. The world's flaws, the book teaches, are related to the absence of this letter, the eventual revelation of which will repair the universe. Another example of messianic significance attached to the letters is the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer that the five letters of the alphabet with distinct final forms hold the \"secret of redemption\".\nIn addition, the letters occasionally feature in aggadic portions of non-mystical rabbinic literature. In such aggada the letters are often given anthropomorphic qualities and depicted as speaking to God. Commonly their shapes are used in parables to illustrate points of ethics or theology. An example from the Babylonian Talmud (a parable intended to discourage speculation about the universe before creation); there is a discussion about this in \"Kabbalah-texts\": this Creation was created at first time only with Genesis, not before. So great Rabbanim explain that God has to create the universe in a moment that we don\u2019t know why\u2026 before or after. God has not time, that is a category of material world, so we cannot explain what is the reason of Creation not but for Glory of God. In any case God creates \"Homer Hayiul\u00ec\" before this Creation as part of all things, that is the Hyle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Why does the story of creation begin with bet?... In the same manner that the letter bet is closed on all sides and only open in front, similarly you are not permitted to inquire into what is before or what was behind, but only from the actual time of Creation.\"\nBabylonian Talmud, Tractate Hagigah, 77c\nExtensive instructions about the proper methods of forming the letters are found in Mishnat Soferim, within Mishna Berura of Yisrael Meir Kagan.\nMathematical use.\nIn set theory, formula_1, pronounced aleph-naught, aleph-zero, or aleph-null, is used to mark the cardinal number of an infinite countable set, such as formula_2, the set of all integers. More generally, the formula_3 aleph number notation marks the ordered sequence of all distinct infinite cardinal numbers.\nLess frequently used, the formula_4 beth number notation is used for the iterated power sets of formula_1. The second element formula_6 is the cardinality of the continuum. Very occasionally, a gimel function is used in cardinal notation.\nUnicode and HTML.\nThe Unicode Hebrew block extends from U+0590 to U+05FF and from U+FB1D to U+FB4F. It includes letters, ligatures, combining diacritical marks (\"Niqqud\" and cantillation marks) and punctuation. The Numeric Character References is included for HTML. These can be used in many markup languages, and they are often used in Wiki to create the Hebrew glyphs compatible with the majority of web browsers.\nStandard Hebrew keyboards have a 101-key layout. Like the standard QWERTY layout, the Hebrew layout was derived from the order of letters on Hebrew typewriters.\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;\na\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ \"Alef-bet\" is commonly written in Israeli Hebrew without the \"\" (, \"[Hebrew] hyphen\"), , as opposed to with the hyphen, .\nb\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The letters of the Arabic and Mandaic alphabets generally have four forms each, according to their position within the word (initial, medial, final, or isolate). (There are exceptions in both alphabets: in the Arabic, six of the 28 letters have only two forms each; in the Mandaic, three of the 22 have only a single form.) \nc\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ In forms of Hebrew older than Modern Hebrew, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u05d9\u05f4\u05ea\u200e, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05db\u05f4\u05e3\u200e, and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u05f4\u05d0\u200e can only be read \"b\", \"k\" and \"p\", respectively, at the beginning of a word, while they will have the sole value of \"v\", \"kh\" and \"f\" in a \"sofit\" (final) position; there are few exceptions. (In medial positions, both pronunciations are possible.) \nIn Modern Hebrew the restriction is much less absolute, e.g. and never (= \"physicist\"), and never (= \"snob\"). A \"dagesh\" may be inserted to unambiguously denote the plosive (\"b\"/\"k\"/\"p\") variant: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u05bc\u200e = , &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05db\u05bc\u200e = , &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u05bc\u200e =; similarly (though today very rare in Hebrew, common only in Yiddish) a raf\u00e9 placed above the letter unambiguously denotes the fricative (\"v\"/\"kh\"/\"f\") variant: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d1\u05bf\u200e = , &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05db\u05bf\u200e = and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u05bf\u200e = . \nIn Modern Hebrew orthography, the sound at the end of a word is denoted by the regular form &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e4\u200e, as opposed to the final form &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e3\u200e, which always denotes (see table of transliterations and transcriptions, comment&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[D]).\nd\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ A pair of separate vavs, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d5\u05d5\u200e, sometimes occurs in Ktiv male: this is different from the \"Yiddish ligature\" &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05f0\u200e. \ne1\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ e2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ e3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ e4&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ e5&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The Academy of the Hebrew Language states that both and should be indistinguishably represented in Hebrew using the letter vav.

His literary reputation rests on the first Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto\" (1764), and his \"Letters\", which are of significant social and political interest. They have been published by Yale University Press in 48 volumes. In 2017, a volume of Walpole's selected letters was published.\nThe youngest son of the first British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, he became the 4th and last Earl of Orford of the second creation on his nephew's death in 1791.\nEarly life: 1717\u20131739.\nWalpole was born in London, the youngest son of British Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole and his wife, Catherine. Like his father, he received early education in Bexley; in part under Edward Weston. He was also educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge.\nWalpole's first friends were probably his cousins Francis and Henry Conway, to whom he became strongly attached, especially Henry. At Eton he formed a schoolboy confederacy, the \"Triumvirate\", with Charles Lyttelton (later an antiquary and bishop) and George Montagu (later a member of parliament and Private Secretary to Lord North). More important were another group of friends dubbed the \"Quadruple Alliance\": Walpole, Thomas Gray, Richard West, and Thomas Ashton.\nAt Cambridge, Walpole came under the influence of Conyers Middleton, an unorthodox theologian. Walpole came to accept the sceptical nature of Middleton's attitude to some essential Christian doctrines for the rest of his life, including a hatred of superstition and bigotry even though he was a nominal Anglican. Ceasing to reside at Cambridge at the end of 1738, Walpole left without taking a degree.\nIn 1737, Walpole's mother died. According to one biographer, his love for his mother \"was the most powerful emotion of his entire life ... the whole of his psychological history was dominated by it\". Walpole did not have any serious relationships with women; he has been called \"a natural celibate\".\nHis sexual orientation has been the subject of speculation. He never married, engaging in a succession of unconsummated flirtations with unmarriageable women, and counted among his close friends a number of women such as Anne Seymour Damer and Mary Berry named by a number of sources as lesbian.\nMany contemporaries described him as effeminate (one political opponent called him \"a hermaphrodite horse\"). Biographers, such as W. S. Lewis, Brian Fothergill, and Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, interpreted Walpole as asexual.\nWalpole's father secured for him three sinecures which afforded him an income: in 1737 he was appointed Inspector of the Imports and Exports in the Custom House, which he resigned to become Usher of the Exchequer, which gave him at first \u00a33900 per annum but this increased over the years. Upon coming of age he became Comptroller of the Pipe and Clerk of the Estreats which gave him an income of \u00a3300 per annum. Walpole decided to go travelling with Thomas Gray and wrote a will in which he left Gray all his belongings.\nIn 1744, he wrote in a letter to Conway that these offices gave him nearly \u00a32,000 per annum; after 1745 when he was appointed Collectorship of Customs, his total income from these offices was around \u00a33,400 per annum.\nGrand Tour: 1739\u20131741.\nWalpole went on the Grand Tour with Gray, but as Walpole recalled in later life: \"We had not got to Calais before Gray was dissatisfied, for I was a boy, and he, though infinitely more a man, was not enough to make allowances\".\nThey left Dover on 29 March and arrived at Calais later that day. They then travelled through Boulogne, Amiens and Saint-Denis, arriving at Paris on 4 April. Here they met many aristocratic Englishmen. In early June they left Paris for Reims, then in September going to Dijon, Lyon, Dauphin\u00e9, Savoy, Aix-les-Bains, Geneva, and then back to Lyon.\nIn October they left for Italy, arriving in Turin in November, then going to Genoa, Piacenza, Parma, Reggio, Modena, Bologna, and in December arriving at Florence. Here he struck up a friendship with Horace Mann, an assistant to the British Minister at the Court of Tuscany. In Florence he also wrote \"Epistle from Florence to Thomas Ashton, Esq., Tutor to the Earl of Plymouth\", a mixture of Whig history and Middleton's teachings. In February 1740, Walpole and Gray left for Rome with the intention of witnessing the papal conclave upon the death of Pope Clement XII but never saw it. Walpole wanted to attend fashionable parties and Gray wanted to visit antiquities. At social occasions in Rome, he saw the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, and his two sons, Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Stuart, although there is no record of them conversing.\nWalpole and Gray returned to Florence in July. However, Gray disliked the idleness of Florence as compared to the educational pursuits in Rome, and animosity grew between them, eventually leading to an end to their friendship. On their way back to England they had a furious argument, although it is unknown what it was about. Gray went to Venice, leaving Walpole at Reggio. In later life Walpole admitted that the fault lay primarily with himself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was too young, too fond of my own diversions, nay, I do not doubt, too much intoxicated by indulgence, vanity, and the insolence of my situation, as a Prime Minister's son, not to have been inattentive and insensible to the feelings of one I thought below me; of one, I blush to say it, that I knew was obliged to me; of one whom presumption and folly perhaps made me deem not my superior \"then\" in parts, though I have since felt my infinite inferiority to him.\nWalpole then visited Venice, Genoa, Antibes, Toulon, Marseille, Aix, Montpellier, Toulouse, Orl\u00e9ans and Paris. He returned to England on 12 September 1741, reaching London on the 14th.\nEarly parliamentary career: 1741\u20131754.\nBy 1735, Walpole was a student at King's College, Cambridge. He had long periods of absence from the college, often returning to Norwich to live at Houghton Hall, in Norfolk. Interested in local politics, he and the \"wealthy\" Mayor of Norwich, Philip Meadows, encouraged local merchant Thomas Vere to run for a seat in Parliament \"in the Whig interest\" with Vere becoming the MP for Norwich in 1735.\nAt the 1741 general election Walpole was elected as a Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Callington, Cornwall. He held this seat for thirteen years although he never visited Callington. Walpole entered Parliament shortly before his father's fall from power. In December 1741 the Opposition won its first majority vote in the Commons for twenty years. In January 1742 Walpole's government was still struggling in Parliament although by the end of the month Horace and other family members had successfully urged the Prime Minister to resign after a parliamentary defeat. Walpole's philosophy mirrored that of Edmund Burke, who was his contemporary. He was a classical liberal on issues such as slavery and the American Revolution.\nWalpole delivered his maiden speech on 19 March against the successful motion that a Secret Committee be set up to enquire into Sir Robert Walpole's last ten years as prime minister. For the next three years, Walpole spent most of his time with his father at his country house Houghton Hall in Norfolk. His father died in 1745 and left Walpole the remainder of the lease of his house in Arlington Street, London; \u00a35,000 in cash; and the office of Collector of the Customs (worth \u00a31,000 per annum). However, he had died in debt, the total of which was in between \u00a340,000 and \u00a350,000.\nIn late 1745 Walpole and Gray resumed their friendship. Also that year the Jacobite Rising began. The position of Walpole was the fruit of his father's support for the Hanoverian dynasty and he knew that he was in danger: \n\"Now comes the Pretender's boy, and promises all my comfortable apartments in the Exchequer and Custom House to some forlorn Irish peer, who chooses to remove his pride and poverty out of some large old unfurnished gallery at St. Germain's. Why really, Mr. Montagu, this is not pleasant! I shall wonderfully dislike being a loyal sufferer in a threadbare coat, and shivering in an antechamber at Hanover, or reduced to teach Latin and English to the young princes at Copenhagen\".\nStrawberry Hill.\nWalpole's lasting architectural creation is Strawberry Hill, the home he built from 1749 onward in Twickenham, southwest of London, which at the time overlooked the Thames. Here he revived the Gothic style many decades before his Victorian successors. Derided thereafter by his friends as \"The Abbot of Strawberry\", this fanciful neo-Gothic concoction began a new architectural trend. Long-connected with the Blue Stockings Society, Walpole played host to its members and associates at Strawberry Hill, including Anna Laetitia Barbauld in 1774.\nLater parliamentary career: 1754\u20131768.\nIn the House of Commons, Walpole represented one of the many rotten boroughs, Castle Rising, which consisted of underlying freeholds in four villages near Kings Lynn, Norfolk, from 1754 until 1757. At his home, he hung a copy of the warrant for the execution of King Charles I with the inscription \"Major Charta\" and wrote of \"the least bad of all murders, that of a King\". In 1756 he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am sensible that from the prostitution of patriotism, from the art of ministers who have had the address to exalt the semblance while they depressed the reality of royalty, and from the bent of the education of the young nobility, which verges to French maxims and to a military spirit, nay, from the ascendant which the nobility itself acquires each day in this country, from all these reflections, I am sensible, that prerogative and power have been exceedingly fortified of late within the circle of the palace; and though fluctuating ministers by turns exercise the deposit, yet there it is; and whenever a prince of design and spirit shall sit in the regal chair, he will find a bank, a hoard of power, which he may lay off most fatally against this constitution. [I am] a quiet republican, who does not dislike to see the shadow of monarchy, like Banquo's ghost, fill the empty chair of state, that the ambitious, the murderer, the tyrant, may not aspire to it; in short, who approves the name of a King, when it excludes the essence.\nWalpole worried that while his fellow Whigs fought amongst themselves, the Tories were gaining power, the result of which would be England delivered to an unlimited, absolute monarchy, \"that authority, that torrent which I should in vain extend a feeble arm to stem\".\nIn 1757, he wrote the anonymous pamphlet \"A Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher at London, to his Friend Lien Chi at Peking\", the first of his works to be widely reviewed.\nIn early 1757, old Horace Walpole of Wolterton died and was succeeded in the peerage by his son, who was then an MP for King's Lynn, thereby creating a vacancy. The electors of King's Lynn did not wish to be represented by a stranger and instead wanted someone with a connection to the Walpole family. The new Lord Walpole, therefore, wrote to his cousin requesting that he stand for the seat, saying his friends \"were all unanimously of opinion that you were the only person who from your near affinity to my grandfather, whose name is still in the greatest veneration, and your own known personal abilities and qualifications, could stand in the gap on this occasion and prevent opposition and expense and perhaps disgrace to the family\".\nIn early 1757, Walpole was out of Parliament after vacating Castle Rising until his election that year to King's Lynn, a seat he would hold until his retirement from the Commons in 1768.\nWalpole became a prominent opponent of the 1757 decision to execute Admiral John Byng.\nLater life: 1768\u20131788.\nWithout a seat in Parliament, Walpole recognised his limitations as to political influence.\nHe wrote to Mann critical of the activities of the East India Company on 13 July 1773: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is England now? \u2013 A sink of Indian wealth, filled by nabobs and emptied by Maccaronis! A senate sold and despised! A country overrun by horse-races! A gaming, robbing, wrangling, railing nation without principles, genius, character or allies.\u2014\u200a\nHe opposed the recent Catholic accommodative measures, writing to Mann in 1784: \"You know I have ever been averse to toleration of an intolerant religion\". He wrote to the same correspondent in 1785 that \"as there are continually allusions to parliamentary speeches and events, they are often obscure to me till I get them explained; and besides, I do not know several of the satirized heroes even by sight\". His political sympathies were with the Foxite Whigs, the successors of the Rockingham Whigs, who were themselves the successors of the Whig Party as revived by Walpole's father. He wrote to William Mason, expounding his political philosophy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI have for five and forty years acted upon the principles of the constitution as it was settled at the Revolution, the best form of government that I know of in the world, and which made us a free people, a rich people, and a victorious people, by diffusing liberty, protecting property and encouraging commerce; and by the combination of all, empowering us to resist the ambition of the House of Bourbon, and to place ourselves on a level with that formidable neighbour. The narrow plan of royalty, which had so often preferred the aggrandizement of the Crown to the dignity of presiding over a great and puissant free kingdom, threw away one predominant source of our potency by aspiring to enslave America\u2014and would now compensate for that blunder and its consequence by assuming a despotic tone at home. It has found a tool in the light and juvenile son of the great minister who carried our glory to its highest pitch\u2014but it shall never have the insignificant approbation of an old and worn out son of another minister, who though less brilliant, maintained this country in the enjoyment of the twenty happiest years that England ever enjoyed.\nLast years: 1788\u20131797.\nWalpole was horrified by the French Revolution and commended Edmund Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\": \"Every page shows how sincerely he is in earnest \u2014 a wondrous merit in a political pamphlet\u2014All other party writers \"act\" zeal for the public, but it never seems to flow from the heart\". He admired the purple passage in the book on Marie Antoinette: \"I know the tirade on the Queen of France is condemned and yet I must avow I admire it much. It paints her exactly as she appeared to me the first time I saw her when Dauphiness. She...shot through the room like an aerial being, all brightness and grace and without seeming to touch earth\".\nAfter he heard of the execution of King Louis XVI he wrote to Lady Ossory on 29 January 1793:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Indeed, Madam, I write unwillingly; there is not a word left in my Dictionary that can express what I feel. \"Savages, barbarians\", &amp;c., were terms for poor ignorant Indians and Blacks and Hyaenas, or, with some superlative epithets, for Spaniards in Peru and Mexico, for Inquisitors, or for Enthusiasts of every breed in religious wars. It remained for the enlightened eighteenth century to baffle language and invent horrors that can be found in no vocabulary. What tongue could be prepared to paint a Nation that should avow Atheism, profess Assassination, and practice Massacres on Massacres for four years together: and who, as if they had destroyed God as well as their King, and established Incredulity by law, give no symptoms of repentance! These Monsters talk of settling a Constitution\u2014it may be a brief one, and couched in one Law, \"Thou shalt reverse every Precept of Morality and Justice, and do all the Wrong thou canst to all Mankind\".\nHe was not impressed with Thomas Paine's reply to Burke, \"Rights of Man\", writing that it was \"so coarse, that you would think he means to degrade the language as much as the government\".\nHis father was created Earl of Orford in 1742. Horace's elder brother, Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford (c.\u20091701\u20131751), passed the title on to his son, George Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford (1730\u20131791). When the 3rd Earl died unmarried, Horace Walpole became, at the age of 74, the 4th Earl of Orford, and the title died with him in 1797. The massive amount of correspondence he left behind has been published in many volumes, starting in 1798. Likewise, a large collection of his works, including historical writings, was published immediately after his death.\nHorace Walpole was buried in the same location as his father Sir Robert Walpole, at the Church of St Martin at Tours on the Houghton Hall estate.\nRumours of paternity.\nAfter Walpole's death, Lady Louisa Stuart, in the introduction to the letters of her grandmother, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1837), wrote of rumours that Horace's biological father was not Sir Robert Walpole but Carr, Lord Hervey (1691\u20131723), elder half-brother of the more famous John Hervey. T. H. White writes: \"Catherine Shorter, Sir Robert Walpole's first wife, had five children. Four of them were born in a sequence after the marriage; the fifth, Horace, was born eleven years later, at a time when she was known to be on bad terms with Sir Robert, and known to be on romantic terms with Carr, Lord Hervey.\" The lack of physical resemblance between Horace and Sir Robert, and his close resemblance to members of the Hervey family, encouraged these rumours. Peter Cunningham, in his introduction to the letters of Horace Walpole (1857), vol. 1, p. x, wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"[Lady Louisa Stuart] has related it in print in the Introductory Anecdotes to Lady Mary's Works; and there is too much reason to believe that what she tells is true. Horace was born eleven years after the birth of any other child that Sir Robert had by his wife; in every respect he was unlike a Walpole, and in every respect, figure and formation of mind, very like a Hervey. Lady Mary Wortley divided mankind into men, women, and Herveys, and the division has been generally accepted. Walpole was certainly of the Hervey class. Lord Hervey's Memoirs and Horace Walpole's Memoires are most remarkably alike, yet Walpole never saw them. [Yet] we have no evidence whatever that a suspicion of spurious parentage ever crossed the mind of Horace Walpole. His writings, from youth to age, breathe the most affectionate love for his mother, and the most unbounded filial regard for Sir Robert Walpole.\"\nPersonal characteristics.\nWalpole had formed a number of lifelong friendships with a number of men and women notable for their looks, wit or social standing. Principal amongst those in his inner circle was arguably Conway, who he had looked up to since his Eton days and corresponded with for the rest of his life. He entertained himself with others who were like himself, and who possessed notoriety and wit, such as such as Etheldreda Townshend, and George Selwyn with whom he jousted and derided with streams of invective. The \"Abbot of Strawberry\" immortalised himself in his own words, and also inspired the characters of \"Sir Benjamin Backbite\" in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The School for Scandal\" and \"Monsieur Le Sage\" in the satire \"Ranelagh House: a Satire in prose after the manner of Monsieur Le Sage\".\nThe novelist Laetitia Matilda Hawkins, a younger contemporary of Walpole, wrote of him as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His entrance into a room was in that style of affected delicacy, which fashion had made almost natural, \"chapeau bras\" between his hands as if he wished to compress it, or under his arm; knees bent, and feet on tip-toe, as if afraid of a wet floor. His summer dress of ceremony was usually a lavender suit, the waistcoat embroidered with a little silver, or of white silk worked in the tambour, partridge silk stockings, gold buckles, ruffles and lace frill. In the winter he wore powder ... His appearance at the breakfast table was proclaimed, and attended, by a fat and favourite little dog, the legacy of Madame du Deffand; the dog and favourite squirrel partook of his breakfast. He generally dined at four ... His dinner when at home was of chicken, pheasant, or any light food, of which he ate sparingly. Pastry he disliked, as difficult of digestion, though he would taste a morsel of venison pie. Iced water, then a London dislike, was his favourite drink. The scent of dinner was removed by a censer or pot of frankincense. The wine that was drunk during dinner. After his coffee he would take pinch of snuff, and nothing more that night.\nIn his old age, according to G. G. Cunningham, he \"was afflicted with fits of an hereditary gout which a rigid temperance failed to remove\".\nWritings.\nStrawberry Hill had its own printing press, the Strawberry Hill Press, which supported Horace Walpole's intensive literary activity.\nIn 1764, not using his own press, he anonymously published his Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto\", claiming on its title page that it was a translation \"from the Original Italian of Onuphrio Muralto\". The second edition's preface, according to James Watt, \"has often been regarded as a manifesto for the modern Gothic romance, stating that his work, now subtitled 'A Gothic Story', sought to restore the qualities of imagination and invention to contemporary fiction\". However, there is a playfulness in the prefaces to both editions and in the narration within the text itself. The novel opens with the son of Manfred (the Prince of Otranto) being crushed under a massive helmet that appears as a result of supernatural causes. However, that moment, along with the rest of the unfolding plot, includes a mixture of both ridiculous and sublime supernatural elements. The plot finally reveals how Manfred's family is tainted in a way that served as a model for successive Gothic plots.\nFrom 1762 on, Walpole published his \"Anecdotes of Painting in England\", based on George Vertue's manuscript notes. His memoirs of the Georgian social and political scene, though heavily biased, are a useful primary source for historians.\nSmith, noting that Walpole never did any work for his well-paid government sinecures, turns to the letters and argues that:\nWalpole served his country, not by drudgery in the Exchequer and Customs, which paid him, but by transmitting to posterity an incomparable vision of England as it was in his day \u2013 London and Westminster with all their festivities and riots, the machinations of politicians and the turmoil of elections.\nWalpole's numerous letters are often used as a historical resource. In one, dating from 28 January 1754, he coined the word serendipity which he said was derived from a \"silly fairy tale\" he had read, \"The Three Princes of Serendip\". The oft-quoted epigram, \"This world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel\", is from a letter of Walpole's to Anne, Countess of Upper Ossory, on 16 August 1776. The original, fuller version appeared in a letter to Sir Horace Mann on 31 December 1769: \"I have often said, and oftener think, that this world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel \u2013 a solution of why Democritus laughed and Heraclitus wept.\"\nIn \"Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard III\" (1768), Walpole defended Richard III against the common belief that he murdered the Princes in the Tower. In this he has been followed by other writers, such as Josephine Tey and Valerie Anand. This work, according to Emile Legouis, shows that Walpole was \"capable of critical initiative\". However, Walpole later changed his views following The Terror and declared that Richard could have committed the crimes of which he was accused.\nWalpole Society.\nThe Walpole Society was formed in 1911 to promote the study of the history of British art. Its headquarters is located in the Department of Prints and Drawings at The British Museum and its director is Simon Swynfen Jervis.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13450", "revid": "46538450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13450", "title": "Hebrew language", "text": "Northwest Semitic language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nHebrew is a Northwest Semitic language within the Afroasiatic language family. A regional dialect of the Canaanite languages, it was natively spoken by the Israelites and remained in regular use as a first language until after 200 CE and as the liturgical language of Judaism (since the Second Temple period) and Samaritanism. The language was revived as a spoken language in the 19th century, and is the only successful large-scale example of linguistic revival. It is the only Canaanite language, as well as one of only two Northwest Semitic languages, with the other being Aramaic, still spoken today.\nThe earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date to the 10th century BCE. Nearly all of the Hebrew Bible is written in Biblical Hebrew, with much of its present form in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, during the time of the Babylonian captivity. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews as \"Lashon Hakodesh\" (, lit.\u2009'the holy tongue' or 'the tongue [of] holiness') since ancient times. The language was not referred to by the name \"Hebrew\" in the Bible, but as \"Yehudit\" (transl.\u2009'Judean') or \"S\u0259pa\u1e6f K\u0259na'an\" (transl.\u2009\"the language of Canaan\"). Mishnah Gittin 9:8 refers to the language as \"Ivrit\", meaning Hebrew; however, Mishnah Megillah refers to the language as \"Ashurit\", meaning Assyrian, which is derived from the name of the alphabet used, in contrast to \"Ivrit\", meaning the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.\nHebrew ceased to be a regular spoken language sometime between 200 and 400 CE, as it declined in the aftermath of the unsuccessful Bar Kokhba revolt, which was carried out against the Roman Empire by the Jews of Judaea. Aramaic and, to a lesser extent, Greek were already in use as international languages, especially among societal elites and immigrants. Hebrew survived into the medieval period as the language of Jewish liturgy, rabbinic literature, intra-Jewish commerce, and Jewish poetic literature. The first dated book printed in Hebrew was published by Abraham Garton in Reggio (Calabria, Italy) in 1475. With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century, the Hebrew language experienced a full-scale revival as a spoken and literary language. The creation of a modern version of the ancient language was led by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. Modern Hebrew (\"Ivrit\") became the main language of the Yishuv in Palestine, and subsequently the official language of the State of Israel.\nEstimates of worldwide usage include five million speakers in 1998, and over nine million people in 2013. After Israel, the United States has the largest Hebrew-speaking population, with approximately 220,000 fluent speakers (see Israeli Americans and Jewish Americans). Pre-revival forms of Hebrew are used for prayer or study in Jewish and Samaritan communities around the world today; the latter group utilizes the Samaritan dialect as their liturgical tongue. As a non-first language, it is studied mostly by non-Israeli Jews and students in Israel, by archaeologists and linguists specializing in the Middle East and its civilizations, and by theologians in Christian seminaries.\nEtymology.\nThe modern English word \"Hebrew\" is derived from Old French via Latin, from the Ancient Greek () and Aramaic , all ultimately derived from Biblical Hebrew (), one of several names for the Israelite (Jewish and Samaritan) people\u00a0\u2013 or the Hebrews. It is traditionally understood to be an adjective based on the name of Abraham's ancestor, Eber, mentioned in Genesis 10:21. The name is believed to be based on the Semitic root \"\u0295-b-r\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u05be\u05d1\u05be\u05e8\u200e), meaning 'beyond', 'other side', 'across'; interpretations of the term \"Hebrew\" generally render its meaning as roughly \"from the other side [of the river/desert]\"\u2014i.e., an exonym for the inhabitants of the land of Israel and Judah, perhaps from the perspective of Mesopotamia, Phoenicia or Transjordan (with the river referred to being perhaps the Euphrates, Jordan or Litani; or maybe the northern Arabian Desert between Babylonia and Canaan). Compare the word \"Habiru\" or cognate Assyrian , of identical meaning.\nOne of the earliest references to the language's name as is found in the prologue to the Book of Sirach, from the 2nd century\u00a0BCE. The Hebrew Bible does not use the term \"Hebrew\" in reference to the language of the Hebrew people; its later historiography, in the Book of Kings, it is referred to as (, lit.\u2009'Judahite').\nHistory.\nHebrew belongs to the Canaanite languages, a branch of the Northwest Semitic family.\nHebrew was the spoken language in the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah during the period from about 1200 to 586 BCE. Epigraphic evidence from this period confirms the widely accepted view that the earlier layers of biblical literature reflect the language used in these kingdoms. Furthermore, the content of Hebrew inscriptions suggests that the written texts closely mirror the spoken language of that time.\nScholars debate the degree to which Hebrew was a spoken vernacular in ancient times following the Babylonian exile when the predominant international language in the region was Old Aramaic.\nHebrew was extinct as a colloquial language by late antiquity, but it continued to be used as a literary language, especially in Spain, as the language of commerce between Jews of different native languages, and as the liturgical language of Judaism, evolving various dialects of literary Medieval Hebrew, until its revival as a spoken language in the late 19th century. \nOldest Hebrew inscriptions.\nIn May 2023, Scott Stripling published the finding of what he claims to be the oldest known Hebrew inscription, a curse tablet found at Mount Ebal, dated from around 3200 years ago. The presence of the Hebrew name of god, Yahweh, as three letters, \"Yod-Heh-Vav\" (YHV), according to the author and his team meant that the tablet is Hebrew and not Canaanite. However, practically all professional archeologists and epigraphers apart from Stripling's team claim that there is no text on this object.\nIn July 2008, Israeli archaeologist Yossi Garfinkel discovered a ceramic shard at Khirbet Qeiyafa that he claimed may be the earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered, dating from around 3,000 years ago. Hebrew University archaeologist Amihai Mazar said that the inscription was \"proto-Canaanite\" but cautioned that \"[t]he differentiation between the scripts, and between the languages themselves in that period, remains unclear\", and suggested that calling the text Hebrew might be going too far.\nThe Gezer calendar also dates back to the 10th century BCE at the beginning of the Monarchic period, the traditional time of the reign of David and Solomon. Classified as Archaic Biblical Hebrew, the calendar presents a list of seasons and related agricultural activities. The Gezer calendar (named after the city in whose proximity it was found) is written in an old Semitic script, akin to the Phoenician one that, through the Greeks and Etruscans, later became the Latin alphabet of ancient Rome. The Gezer calendar is written without any vowels, and it does not use consonants to imply vowels even in the places in which later Hebrew spelling requires them.\nNumerous older tablets have been found in the region with similar scripts written in other Semitic languages, for example, Proto-Sinaitic. It is believed that the original shapes of the script go back to Egyptian hieroglyphs, though the phonetic values are instead inspired by the acrophonic principle. The common ancestor of Hebrew and Phoenician is called Canaanite, and was the first to use a Semitic alphabet distinct from that of Egyptian. One ancient document is the famous Moabite Stone, written in the Moabite dialect; the Siloam inscription, found near Jerusalem, is an early example of Hebrew. Less ancient samples of Archaic Hebrew include the ostraca found near Lachish, which describe events preceding the final capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian captivity of 586 BCE.\nClassical Hebrew.\nBiblical Hebrew.\nIn its widest sense, Biblical Hebrew refers to the spoken language of ancient Israel flourishing between c.\u20091000 BCE and c.\u2009400 CE. It comprises several evolving and overlapping dialects. The phases of Classical Hebrew are often named after important literary works associated with them.\nEarly post-Biblical Hebrew.\nSometimes the above phases of spoken Classical Hebrew are simplified into \"Biblical Hebrew\" (including several dialects from the 10th century BCE to 2nd century BCE and extant in certain Dead Sea Scrolls) and \"Mishnaic Hebrew\" (including several dialects from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE and extant in certain other Dead Sea Scrolls). However, today most Hebrew linguists classify Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew as a set of dialects evolving out of Late Biblical Hebrew and into Mishnaic Hebrew, thus including elements from both but remaining distinct from either.\nBy the start of the Byzantine Period in the 4th century CE, Classical Hebrew ceased as a regularly spoken language, roughly a century after the publication of the Mishnah, apparently declining since the aftermath of the catastrophic Bar Kokhba revolt around 135 CE.\nDisplacement by Aramaic.\nIn the early 6th century BCE, the Neo-Babylonian Empire conquered the ancient Kingdom of Judah, destroying much of Jerusalem and exiling its population far to the east in Babylon. During the Babylonian captivity, many Israelites learned Aramaic, the closely related Semitic language of their captors. Thus, for a significant period, the Jewish elite became influenced by Aramaic.\nAfter Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon, he allowed the Jewish people to return from captivity. In time, a local version of Aramaic came to be spoken in Israel alongside Hebrew. By the beginning of the Common Era, Aramaic was the primary colloquial language of Samarian, Babylonian and Galileean Jews, and western and intellectual Jews spoke Greek, but a form of so-called Rabbinic Hebrew continued to be used as a vernacular in Judea until it was displaced by Aramaic, probably in the 3rd century CE. Certain Sadducee, Pharisee, Scribe, Hermit, Zealot and Priest classes maintained an insistence on Hebrew, and all Jews maintained their identity with Hebrew songs and simple quotations from Hebrew texts.\nWhile there is no doubt that at a certain point, Hebrew was displaced as the everyday spoken language of most Jews, and that its chief successor in the Middle East was the closely related Aramaic language, then Greek, scholarly opinions on the exact dating of that shift have changed very much. In the first half of the 20th century, most scholars followed Abraham Geiger and Gustaf Dalman in thinking that Aramaic became a spoken language in the land of Israel as early as the beginning of Israel's Hellenistic period in the 4th century BCE, and that as a corollary Hebrew ceased to function as a spoken language around the same time. Moshe Zvi Segal, Joseph Klausner and Ben Yehuda are notable exceptions to this view. During the latter half of the 20th century, accumulating archaeological evidence and especially linguistic analysis of the Dead Sea Scrolls has disproven that view. The Dead Sea Scrolls, uncovered in 1946\u20131948 near Qumran revealed ancient Jewish texts overwhelmingly in Hebrew, not Aramaic.\nThe Qumran scrolls indicate that Hebrew texts were readily understandable to the average Jew, and that the language had evolved since Biblical times as spoken languages do. Recent scholarship recognizes that reports of Jews speaking in Aramaic indicate a multilingual society, not necessarily the primary language spoken. Alongside Aramaic, Hebrew co-existed within Israel as a spoken language. Most scholars now date the demise of Hebrew as a spoken language to the end of the Roman period, or about 200 CE. It continued on as a literary language down through the Byzantine period from the 4th century CE.\nThe exact roles of Aramaic and Hebrew remain hotly debated. A trilingual scenario has been proposed for the land of Israel. Hebrew functioned as the local mother tongue with powerful ties to Israel's history, origins and golden age and as the language of Israel's religion; Aramaic functioned as the international language with the rest of the Middle East; and eventually Greek functioned as another international language with the eastern areas of the Roman Empire. William Schniedewind argues that after waning in the Persian period, the religious importance of Hebrew grew in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, and cites epigraphical evidence that Hebrew survived as a vernacular language \u2013 though both its grammar and its writing system had been substantially influenced by Aramaic. According to another summary, Greek was the language of government, Hebrew the language of prayer, study and religious texts, and Aramaic was the language of legal contracts and trade. There was also a geographic pattern: according to Bernard Spolsky, by the beginning of the Common Era, \"Judeo-Aramaic was mainly used in Galilee in the north, Greek was concentrated in the former colonies and around governmental centers, and Hebrew monolingualism continued mainly in the southern villages of Judea.\" In other words, \"in terms of dialect geography, at the time of the tannaim Palestine could be divided into the Aramaic-speaking regions of Galilee and Samaria and a smaller area, Judaea, in which Rabbinic Hebrew was used among the descendants of returning exiles.\" In addition, it has been surmised that Koine Greek was the primary vehicle of communication in coastal cities and among the upper class of Jerusalem, while Aramaic was prevalent in the lower class of Jerusalem, but not in the surrounding countryside. After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century CE, Judaeans were forced to disperse. Many relocated to Galilee, so most remaining native speakers of Hebrew at that last stage would have been found in the north.\nMany scholars have pointed out that Hebrew continued to be used alongside Aramaic during Second Temple times, not only for religious purposes but also for nationalistic reasons, especially during revolts such as the Maccabean Revolt (167\u2013160 BCE) and the emergence of the Hasmonean kingdom, the Great Jewish Revolt (66\u201373 CE), and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132\u2013135 CE). The nationalist significance of Hebrew manifested in various ways throughout this period. Michael Owen Wise notes that \"Beginning with the time of the Hasmonean revolt [...] Hebrew came to the fore in an expression akin to modern nationalism. A form of classical Hebrew was now a more significant written language than Aramaic within Judaea.\" This nationalist aspect was further emphasized during periods of conflict, as Hannah Cotton observing in her analysis of legal documents during the Jewish revolts against Rome that \"Hebrew became the symbol of Jewish nationalism, of the independent Jewish State.\" The nationalist use of Hebrew is evidenced in several historical documents and artefacts, including the composition of 1 Maccabees in archaizing Hebrew, Hasmonean coinage under John Hyrcanus (134-104 BCE), and coins from both the Great Revolt and Bar Kokhba Revolt featuring exclusively Hebrew and Palaeo-Hebrew script inscriptions. This deliberate use of Hebrew and Paleo-Hebrew script in official contexts, despite limited literacy, served as a symbol of Jewish nationalism and political independence.\nThe Christian New Testament contains some Semitic place names and quotes. The language of such Semitic glosses (and in general the language spoken by Jews in scenes from the New Testament) is often referred to as \"Hebrew\" in the text, although this term is often re-interpreted as referring to Aramaic instead and is rendered accordingly in recent translations. Nonetheless, these glosses can be interpreted as Hebrew as well.\nMishnah and Talmud.\nThe term \"Mishnaic Hebrew\" generally refers to the Hebrew dialects found in the Talmud, excepting quotations from the Hebrew Bible. The dialects organize into Mishnaic Hebrew (also called Tannaitic Hebrew, Early Rabbinic Hebrew, or Mishnaic Hebrew I), which was a spoken language, and Amoraic Hebrew (also called Late Rabbinic Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew II), which was a literary language. The earlier section of the Talmud is the Mishnah that was published around 200 CE, although many of the stories take place much earlier, and were written in the earlier Mishnaic dialect. The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah. These include the halachic Midrashim (Sifra, Sifre, Mekhilta etc.) and the expanded collection of Mishnah-related material known as the Tosefta. The Talmud contains excerpts from these works, as well as further Tannaitic material not attested elsewhere; the generic term for these passages is \"Baraitot\". The dialect of all these works is very similar to Mishnaic Hebrew.\nAbout a century after the publication of the Mishnah, Mishnaic Hebrew fell into disuse as a spoken language. By the third century CE, sages could no longer identify the Hebrew names of many plants mentioned in the Mishnah. Only a few sages, primarily in the southern regions, retained the ability to speak the language and attempted to promote its use. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 1:9: \"Rebbi Jonathan from Bet Guvrrin said, four languages are appropriate that the world should use them, and they are these: The Foreign Language (Greek) for song, Latin for war, Syriac for elegies, Hebrew for speech. Some are saying, also Assyrian (Hebrew script) for writing.\"\nThe later section of the Talmud, the Gemara, generally comments on the Mishnah and Baraitot in two forms of Aramaic. Nevertheless, Hebrew survived as a liturgical and literary language in the form of later Amoraic Hebrew, which occasionally appears in the text of the Gemara, particularly in the Jerusalem Talmud and the classical aggadah midrashes.\nHebrew was always regarded as the language of Israel's religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued to be used as a \"lingua franca\" among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries. After the 2nd century CE when the Roman Empire exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the Bar Kokhba revolt, they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.\nMedieval Hebrew.\nAfter the Talmud, various regional literary dialects of Medieval Hebrew evolved. The most important is Tiberian Hebrew or Masoretic Hebrew, a local dialect of Tiberias in Galilee that became the standard for vocalizing the Hebrew Bible and thus still influences all other regional dialects of Hebrew. This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called \"Biblical Hebrew\" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however, properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the scholarship of the Masoretes (from \"masoret\" meaning \"tradition\"), who added vowel points and grammar points to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible. The Masoretes inherited a biblical text whose letters were considered too sacred to be altered, so their markings were in the form of pointing in and around the letters. The Syriac alphabet, precursor to the Arabic alphabet, also developed vowel pointing systems around this time. The Aleppo Codex, a Hebrew Bible with the Masoretic pointing, was written in the 10th century, likely in Tiberias, and survives into the present day. It is perhaps the most important Hebrew manuscript in existence.\nDuring the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain, important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the grammarians of Classical Arabic. Important Hebrew grammarians were , Jonah ibn Janah, Abraham ibn Ezra and later (in Provence), . A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as , Solomon ibn Gabirol, Judah ha-Levi, Moses ibn Ezra and Abraham ibn Ezra, in a \"purified\" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative or strophic meters. This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets.\nThe need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from Classical Greek and Medieval Arabic motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. This is used in the translations made by the family. (Original Jewish philosophical works were usually written in Arabic.) Another important influence was Maimonides, who developed a simple style based on Mishnaic Hebrew for use in his law code, the . Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud.\nHebrew persevered through the ages as the main language for written purposes by all Jewish communities around the world for a large range of uses\u2014not only liturgy, but also poetry, philosophy, science and medicine, commerce, daily correspondence and contracts. There have been many deviations from this generalization such as Bar Kokhba's letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in Aramaic, and Maimonides' writings, which were mostly in Arabic; but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. For example, the first Middle East printing press, in Safed (modern Israel), produced a small number of books in Hebrew in 1577, which were then sold to the nearby Jewish world. This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin. For example, Rabbi Avraham Danzig wrote the ' in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish, as a guide to \"Halacha\" for the \"\"average\" 17-year-old\" (Ibid. Introduction 1). Similarly, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan's purpose in writing the ' was to \"produce a work that could be studied daily so that Jews might know the proper procedures to follow minute by minute\". The work was nevertheless written in Talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic, since, \"the ordinary Jew [of Eastern Europe] of a century ago, was fluent enough in this idiom to be able to follow the Mishna Berurah without any trouble.\"\nRevival.\nHebrew has been revived several times as a literary language, most significantly by the Haskalah (Enlightenment) movement of early and mid-19th-century Germany. In the early 19th century, a form of spoken Hebrew had emerged in the markets of Jerusalem between Jews of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate for commercial purposes. This Hebrew dialect was to a certain extent a pidgin. Near the end of that century the Jewish activist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, owing to the ideology of the national revival (, , later Zionism), began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the Second Aliyah, it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including Judaeo-Spanish (also called \"Judezmo\" and \"Ladino\"), Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic and Bukhori (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the Jewish diaspora such as Russian, Persian and Arabic.\nThe major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as neologisms from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French. Modern Hebrew became an official language in British-ruled Palestine in 1921 (along with English and Arabic), and then in 1948 became an official language of the newly declared State of Israel. Hebrew is the most widely spoken language in Israel today.\nIn the Modern Period, from the 19th century onward, the literary Hebrew tradition revived as the spoken language of modern Israel, called variously \"Israeli Hebrew\", \"Modern Israeli Hebrew\", \"Modern Hebrew\", \"New Hebrew\", \"Israeli Standard Hebrew\", \"Standard Hebrew\" and so on. Israeli Hebrew exhibits some features of Sephardic Hebrew from its local Jerusalemite tradition but adapts it with numerous neologisms, borrowed terms (often technical) from European languages and adopted terms (often colloquial) from Arabic.\nThe literary and narrative use of Hebrew was revived beginning with the Haskalah movement. The first secular periodical in Hebrew, (The Gatherer), was published by maskilim in K\u00f6nigsberg (today's Kaliningrad) from 1783 onwards. In the mid-19th century, publications of several Eastern European Hebrew-language newspapers (e.g. , founded in E\u0142k in 1856) multiplied. Prominent poets were Hayim Nahman Bialik and Shaul Tchernichovsky; there were also novels written in the language.\nThe revival of the Hebrew language as a mother tongue was initiated in the late 19th century by the efforts of Ben-Yehuda. He joined the Jewish national movement and in 1881 immigrated to Palestine, then a part of the Ottoman Empire. Motivated by the surrounding ideals of renovation and rejection of the diaspora \"shtetl\" lifestyle, Ben-Yehuda set out to develop tools for making the literary and liturgical language into everyday spoken language. However, his brand of Hebrew followed norms that had been replaced in Eastern Europe by different grammar and style, in the writings of people like Ahad Ha'am and others. His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the vernacularization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904\u20131914 Second Aliyah that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the British Mandate of Palestine recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in phonology, was to take its place among the current languages of the nations.\nWhile many saw his work as fanciful or even blasphemous (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the Academy of the Hebrew Language. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (\"The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew\", Ben-Yehuda Dictionary). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine. At the time, members of the Old Yishuv and a very few Hasidic sects, most notably those under the auspices of Satmar, refused to speak Hebrew and spoke only Yiddish.\nIn the Soviet Union, the use of Hebrew, along with other Jewish cultural and religious activities, was suppressed. Soviet authorities considered the use of Hebrew \"reactionary\" since it was associated with Zionism, and the teaching of Hebrew at primary and secondary schools was officially banned by the People's Commissariat for Education as early as 1919, as part of an overall agenda aiming to secularize education (the language itself did not cease to be studied at universities for historical and linguistic purposes). The official ordinance stated that Yiddish, being the spoken language of the Russian Jews, should be treated as their only national language, while Hebrew was to be treated as a foreign language. Hebrew books and periodicals ceased to be published and were seized from the libraries, although liturgical texts were still published until the 1930s. Despite numerous protests, a policy of suppression of the teaching of Hebrew operated from the 1930s on. Later in the 1980s in the USSR, Hebrew studies reappeared due to people struggling for permission to go to Israel (refuseniks). Several of the teachers were imprisoned, e.g. Yosef Begun, Ephraim Kholmyansky, Yevgeny Korostyshevsky and others responsible for a Hebrew learning network connecting many cities of the USSR.\nModern Hebrew.\nStandard Hebrew, as developed by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, was based on Mishnaic spelling and Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation. However, the earliest speakers of Modern Hebrew had Yiddish as their native language and often introduced calques from Yiddish and phono-semantic matchings of international words.\nDespite using Sephardic Hebrew pronunciation as its primary basis, modern Israeli Hebrew has adapted to Ashkenazi Hebrew phonology in some respects, mainly the following:\nThe vocabulary of Israeli Hebrew is much larger than that of earlier periods. According to Ghil'ad Zuckermann:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn Israel, Modern Hebrew is currently taught in institutions called Ulpanim (singular: Ulpan). There are government-owned, as well as private, Ulpanim offering online courses and face-to-face programs.\nCurrent status.\nModern Hebrew is the primary official language of the State of Israel. As of 2013[ [update]], there are about 9 million Hebrew speakers worldwide, of whom 7 million speak it fluently.\nCurrently, 90% of Israeli Jews are proficient in Hebrew, and 70% are highly proficient. Some 60% of Israeli Arabs are also proficient in Hebrew, and 30% report having a higher proficiency in Hebrew than in Arabic. In total, about 53% of the Israeli population speaks Hebrew as a native language, while most of the rest speak it fluently. In 2013 Hebrew was the native language of 49% of Israelis over the age of 20, with Russian, Arabic, French, English, Yiddish and Ladino being the native tongues of most of the rest. Some 26% of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and 12% of Arabs reported speaking Hebrew poorly or not at all.\nSteps have been taken to keep Hebrew the primary language of use, and to prevent large-scale incorporation of English words into the Hebrew vocabulary. The Academy of the Hebrew Language of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem currently invents about 2,000 new Hebrew words each year for modern words by finding an original Hebrew word that captures the meaning, as an alternative to incorporating more English words into Hebrew vocabulary. The Haifa municipality has banned officials from using English words in official documents, and is fighting to stop businesses from using only English signs to market their services. In 2012, a Knesset bill for the preservation of the Hebrew language was proposed, which includes the stipulation that all signage in Israel must first and foremost be in Hebrew, as with all speeches by Israeli officials abroad. The bill's author, MK Akram Hasson, stated that the bill was proposed as a response to Hebrew \"losing its prestige\" and children incorporating more English words into their vocabulary.\nHebrew is one of several languages for which the constitution of South Africa calls to be respected in their use for religious purposes. Also, Hebrew is an official national minority language in Poland, since 6 January 2005. Hamas has made Hebrew a compulsory language taught in schools in the Gaza Strip.\nPhonology.\nBiblical Hebrew had a typical Semitic consonant inventory, with pharyngeal , a series of \"emphatic\" consonants (possibly ejective, but this is debated), lateral fricative , and in its older stages also uvular . merged into in later Biblical Hebrew, and underwent allophonic spirantization to (known as begadkefat). The earliest Biblical Hebrew vowel system contained the Proto-Semitic vowels as well as , but this system changed dramatically over time.\nBy the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, had shifted to in the Jewish traditions, though for the Samaritans it merged with instead. The Tiberian reading tradition of the Middle Ages had the vowel system , though other Medieval reading traditions had fewer vowels.\nA number of reading traditions have been preserved in liturgical use. In Oriental (Sephardi and Mizrahi) Jewish reading traditions, the emphatic consonants are realized as pharyngealized, while the Ashkenazi (northern and eastern European) traditions have lost emphatics and pharyngeals (although according to Ashkenazi law, pharyngeal articulation is preferred over uvular or glottal articulation when representing the community in religious service such as prayer and Torah reading), and show the shift of to . The Samaritan tradition has a complex vowel system that does not correspond closely to the Tiberian systems.\nModern Hebrew pronunciation developed from a mixture of the different Jewish reading traditions, generally tending towards simplification. In line with Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation, emphatic consonants have shifted to their ordinary counterparts, to , and are not present. Most Israelis today also merge with , do not have contrastive gemination, and pronounce as a uvular fricative or a voiced velar fricative rather than an alveolar trill, because of Ashkenazi Hebrew influences. The consonants and have become phonemic due to loan words, and has similarly been re-introduced.\nConsonants.\nNotes:\nGrammar.\nHebrew grammar is partly analytic, expressing such forms as dative, ablative and accusative using prepositional particles rather than grammatical cases. However, inflection plays a decisive role in the formation of verbs and nouns. For example, nouns have a construct state, called \"smikhut\", to denote the relationship of \"belonging to\": this is the converse of the genitive case of more inflected languages. Words in \"smikhut\" are often combined with hyphens. In modern speech, the use of the construct is sometimes interchangeable with the preposition \"shel\", meaning \"of\". There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and \"person\"-enclitics are widely used to \"decline\" prepositions.\nMorphology.\nLike all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of \"triliteral\", or 3-consonant consonantal roots, from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels and/or adding prefixes, suffixes or infixes. 4-consonant roots also exist and became more frequent in the modern language due to a process of coining verbs from nouns that are themselves constructed from 3-consonant verbs. Some triliteral roots lose one of their consonants in most forms and are called \"Nakhim\" (Resting).\nHebrew uses a number of one-letter prefixes that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or \"Letters of Use\" (). Such items include: the definite article \"ha-\" () (=\u00a0\"the\"); prepositions \"be-\" () (=\u00a0\"in\"), \"le-\" () (=\u00a0\"to\"; a shortened version of the preposition \"el\"), \"mi-\" () (=\u00a0\"from\"; a shortened version of the preposition \"min\"); conjunctions \"ve-\" () (=\u00a0\"and\"), \"she-\" () (=\u00a0\"that\"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction \"asher\"), \"ke-\" () (=\u00a0\"as\", \"like\"; a shortened version of the conjunction \"kmo\").\nThe vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes are hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form. However, they may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word that begins with a moving Shva, then the preposition takes the vowel (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial \"be-kfar\" (=\u00a0\"in a village\") corresponds to the more formal \"bi-khfar\".\nThe definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like \"m\u00e9-ha-kfar\" (=\u00a0\"from the village\"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of \"mi-\". With \"be\", \"le\" and \"ke\", the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes \"ba\", \"la\" or \"ka\". Thus *\"be-ha-matos\" becomes \"ba-matos\" (=\u00a0\"in the plane\"). This does not happen to \"m\u00e9\" (the form of \"min\" or \"mi-\" used before the letter \"he\"), therefore \"m\u00e9-ha-matos\" is a valid form, which means \"from the airplane\".\n\"* indicates that the given example is grammatically non-standard\".\nSyntax.\nLike most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject and so on.\nWriting system.\nUsers of the language write Modern Hebrew from right to left using the Hebrew alphabet \u2013 an \"impure\" abjad, or consonant-only script, of 22 letters. The ancient Paleo-Hebrew alphabet resembles those used for Canaanite and Phoenician. Modern scripts derive from the \"square\" letter form, known as \"Ashurit\" (Assyrian), which developed from the Aramaic script. A cursive Hebrew script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to appear more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents. The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as Rashi script. When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of \"matres lectionis\", which are consonantal letters used as vowels. Further diacritics may serve to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. \"bet\"/\"vet\", \"shin\"/\"sin\"); and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see Hebrew cantillation).\nLiturgical use in Judaism.\nHebrew has always been used as the language of prayer and study, and the following pronunciation systems are found.\nAshkenazi Hebrew, originating in Central and Eastern Europe, is still widely used in Ashkenazi Jewish religious services and studies in Israel and abroad, particularly in the Haredi and other Orthodox communities. It was influenced by Yiddish pronunciation.\nSephardi Hebrew is the traditional pronunciation of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews and Sephardi Jews in the countries of the former Ottoman Empire, with the exception of Yemenite Hebrew. This pronunciation, in the form used by the Jerusalem Sephardic community, is the basis of the Hebrew phonology of Israeli native speakers. It was influenced by Ladino pronunciation.\nMizrahi (Oriental) Hebrew is actually a collection of dialects spoken liturgically by Jews in various parts of the Arab and Islamic world. It was derived from the old Arabic language, and in some cases influenced by Sephardi Hebrew. Yemenite Hebrew or \"Temanit\" differs from other Mizrahi dialects by having a radically different vowel system, and distinguishing between different diacritically marked consonants that are pronounced identically in other dialects (for example gimel and \"ghimel\".)\nThese pronunciations are still used in synagogue ritual and religious study in Israel and elsewhere, mostly by people who are not native speakers of Hebrew. However, some traditionalist Israelis use liturgical pronunciations in prayer.\nMany synagogues in the diaspora, even though Ashkenazi by rite and by ethnic composition, have adopted the \"Sephardic\" pronunciation in deference to Israeli Hebrew. However, in many British and American schools and synagogues, this pronunciation retains several elements of its Ashkenazi substrate, especially the distinction between tsere and segol.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13451", "revid": "33582079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13451", "title": "Horror film", "text": "Film genre\nHorror is a film genre that seeks to elicit physical or psychological fear in its viewers. Horror films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Broad elements of the genre include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk beliefs.\nHorror films have existed since the early 20th century. Early inspirations predating film include folklore; the religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures; and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From its origins in silent films and German Expressionism, horror became a codified genre only after the release of \"Dracula\" (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, erotic horror, slasher films, splatter films, supernatural horror, and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan, Korea, and Thailand, among other countries.\nDespite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society, and generated popular culture icons.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacteristics.\nThe book \"The Film Experience: An Introduction\" (2021) defines the horror film as a genre with origins in Gothic literature that seeks to frighten the viewer. The authors highlight the fundamental elements of the horror film as \"characters with physical, psychological, or spiritual deformities\"; \"narratives built on suspense, surprise, and shock\"; and \"visual compositions that move between the dread of not seeing and the horror of seeing\". \nAlternatively\", The Dictionary of Film Studies\" (2012) defines the horror film as representing \"disturbing and dark subject matter, seeking to elicit responses of fear, terror, disgust, shock, suspense, and (of course) horror from their viewers.\" In his chapter \"The American Nightmare: Horror in the 70s\" from the book \"Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan\" (2002), film critic Robin Wood declared that the commonality between horror films is that \u201cnormality is threatened by the monster.\u201d This idea was further expanded on by No\u00ebl Carroll in his book \"The Philosophy of Horror, or Paradoxes of the Heart\" (1990); he noted that \"repulsion must be pleasurable, as evidenced by the genre's popularity.\"\nBefore the release of \"Dracula\" (1931), as historian Gary D. Rhodes explained, the ideas and terminology of horror films did not yet exist as a codified genre, although critics had used the term \"horror\" to describe films in reviews prior to \"Dracula\"'s release. \"Horror\" was a term used with a variety of meanings. In 1913, the magazine \"Moving Picture World\" defined \"horrors\" as showcasing \"striped convicts, murderous Indians, grinning 'black-handers', homicidal drunkards\". Some titles directly suggested horror, such as \"The Hand of Horror\" (1914), a melodrama about a thief who steals from his own sister. During the silent era, the term \"horror\" was used to describe everything from battle scenes in war films to stories of drug addiction. Rhodes concluded that the term \"horror film\" (or \"horror movie\") was not used in early cinema.\nThe mystery film genre was then in vogue, and early information commonly promoted \"Dracula\" as a mystery film, despite the novel, the play, and the film relying on the supernatural. Kim Newman discussed the genre in British Film Institute's book \"Companion to Horror\", where he noted that horror films in the 1930s were easy to identify, but after that decade, \u201cthe more blurred distinctions become, and horror becomes less like a discrete genre than an effect which can be deployed within any number of narrative settings or narrative patterns\u201d. In the 1940s, the horror film was viewed in different terms. Critic Siegfried Kracauer included \"The Lost Weekend\" among films described as \u201cterror films,\u201d along with \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943), \"The Dark Corner\" (1946), \"Gaslight\" (1944), \"Shock\" (1946), \"The Spiral Staircase\" (1946), \"The Stranger\" (1946), and \"Spellbound\" (1945). Two years earlier, the \"New York Times\" described a new cycle of \u201chorror\u201d productions included \"Gaslight\", \"The Woman in the Window\" (1944), \"Dark Waters\" (1944), \"Laura (1944),\" and \"Phantom Lady\" (1944). Mark Jancovich wrote in the book \"The Shifting Definitions of Genre: Essays on Labeling Films, Television Shows and Media\" (2008) that \"horror\" was virtually synonymous with mystery as a generic term, not being limited to films concerned with the strange, eerie, and uncanny.\nVarious writings on genre from Altman, Lawrence Alloway (\"Violent America: The Movies 1946-1964\" (1971)) and Peter Hutchings (\"Approaches to Popular Film\" (1995)) implied that it is easier to view films as cycles rather than genres, suggesting that viewing the slasher film as a cycle would locate it in terms of several factors: the film industry's economy and production, the personnel involved in particular eras, and the manner of film marketing, distribution, and exhibition.\nIn an essay, Mark Jancovich declared that \"there is no simple 'collective belief' as to what constitutes the horror genre\" among fans and critics of the genre. Jancovich found that disagreements existed between audiences who wanted to distinguish themselves. Such disagreement included fans of other genres who may view a film such as \"Alien\" (1979) as belonging to science fiction, as well as horror fans dismissing it as inauthentic for either genre. Further debates exist among genre fans having personal definitions of \u201ctrue\u201d horror films: some fans embrace cult figures such as Freddy Krueger of the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series, while other fans disassociate themselves from characters and series and focus instead on genre \"auteur\" directors such as Dario Argento, while still other fans would deem Argento's films too mainstream, preferring more underground films. Andrew Tudor wrote in his book \"Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie\" that \"Genre is what we collectively believe it to be.\"\nCinematic techniques.\nJacob Shelton investigated in detail the many ways that horror films manipulate audience members. Shelton notes that negative space can draw viewers' eyes to anything in the frame\u2014for example, a wall or the empty blackness in the shadows.\nAnna Powell explores how horror directors use cinematography to induce certain viewer reactions. Powell observes that lighting extremes, whether bright or dark, can prevent viewers from seeing every detail in a scene, which provokes unease. Bright lighting might also trick viewers into feeling safe.\nPowell also points out how distorting space and time can confuse and disorient horror film viewers. To confound viewers' senses, directors might use tilted camera angles and shots in slow-motion or reverse.\nPowell notes that directors also use colour, through costuming, setting, and lens filters, to communicate mood and evoke certain connotations. Red, for example, might convey blood, passion, or disease. Contrasting colours bring viewers\u2019 attention to certain places in the frame.\nThe jump scare is a horror film trope where an abrupt change in image accompanied by a loud sound aims to surprise the viewer. This trope can also be subverted to create tension, as audiences may feel increased unease and discomfort in anticipating jump scares.\nMirrors are often used in horror films to create visual depth and build tension. Shelton argues that mirrors have been used so often in horror films that audiences have been conditioned to fear them, and subverting audience expectations of a jump scare in a mirror can further build tension. Tight framing and close-ups are also commonly used; these can build tension and induce anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see beyond what is near the protagonist.\nThe interaction between horror films and their audiences is another significant issue discussed by Rhodes. He notes that horror films often serve as a safe space for viewers to confront and process their fears. This cathartic experience can provide psychological relief and a sense of empowerment, as viewers face and overcome their anxieties in a controlled environment. The communal experience of watching horror films in theaters or discussing them in fan communities also plays a crucial role in the genre's impact and popularity.[6]\nMusic.\nMusic is a key element of horror films. In his book \"Music in the Horror Film\" (2010), Lerner writes that \"music in horror film frequently makes us feel threatened and uncomfortable\" and intends to intensify the atmosphere created by imagery and themes. Music helps to set the tense or chilling mood that horror movies often aim to achieve; it can even cause physiological effects that override learned reactions and behaviors. Dissonance, atonality and experiments with timbre are typical techniques used by composers in horror film music. \nThemes.\nIn his book \"Dark Dreams\", author Charles Derry conceived horror films as focusing on three broad themes: the horror of personality, the horror of Armageddon, and the horror of the demonic. First, the horror of personality derives from monsters being at the centre of the plot, such as Frankenstein's monster, whose psychology makes them perform horrific acts including rapes, mutilations, and sadistic killings. Other key works with this theme include Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho,\" which feature psychotic murderers without monster make-up. Second, the Armageddon theme explores the fear of large-scale destruction, which includes science fiction works but also natural events, such as Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" (1963). Finally, the theme of the demonic features graphic accounts of satanic rites, witchcraft, and exorcisms outside traditional forms of worship, as seen in films such as \"The Exorcist\" (1973) and \"The Omen\" (1976).\nSome critics have suggested that horror films can be vessels for exploring contemporary cultural, political and social trends. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, supports the use of horror films to ease the process of understanding issues by making use of their visual elements. The use of horror films can help audiences to understand prior historical events, for example, the Vietnam War, the Holocaust, the worldwide AIDS epidemic or post-9/11 pessimism. \nAnxieties surrounding race and racism have historically and continuously informed the horror genre. A good example is the history of the zombie apocalypse subgenre. The first zombie horror films, such as \"White Zombie\" (1932), were inspired by stories brought back to Europe by colonizers, and these stories explicitly presented Afro-Haitian religious and spiritual practices as evil and perverse. The film which later revived the subgenre, \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968), incidentally presented themes surrounding race in America by casting Duane Jones, a Black actor, as the lead. Whether accidentally or actively, horror films demonstrate societal issues by who or what is chosen to incite fear, and how this choice is represented visually and narratively. \nHistory.\nIn discussing narrative trends in horror, scholar Isabel Pinedo draws on the book \"Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie\" (1989) to map the development of the Anglo-American horror genre. She points out that early synchronized sound, as well as post-war period films, present threats to social order as external, while human agency (largely male) prevails. The focus is on the monster's acts of violence and the characters' failed attempts at resistance, ending with male experts using violence or knowledge to defeat the monster and restore social order.\nPinedo presents the category of postmodern horror. She summarizes the narrative structure as indicating the prevalence of internal threats to social order by using a combination of monstrous violence and ineffectual human resistance with open endings. These open endings may be as follows: the monster triumphs as in \"\" (1990); the monster is defeated but only temporarily as in \"Halloween\" (1978); or there is an ambiguous outcome as in \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968), \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974), \"The Thing\" (1982), and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984).\nSub-genres of horror film.\nHorror is a malleable genre, and it can often be altered to accommodate other genres such as science fiction, which makes some films difficult to categorize.\nLovecraftian horror.\nNamed after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890\u20131937), this sub-genre of horror films include themes of cosmic dread, forbidden and dangerous knowledge, madness, non-human influences on humanity, religion and superstition, fate and inevitability, and the risks associated with scientific discoveries.\nBody horror.\nA genre that emerged in the 1970s, body horror films focus on the process of a bodily transformation. In these films, the body is either engulfed by some larger process or heading towards fragmentation and collapse. The focus can be on apocalyptic implication of an entire society being overtaken, but the focus is generally upon an individual and their sense of identity, primarily them watching their own body change. The earliest appearance of the sub-genre was the work of director David Cronenberg, specifically with early films like \"Shivers\" (1975). Mark Jancovich of the University of Manchester declared that the transformation scenes in the genre provoke fear and repulsion, but also pleasure and excitement such as in \"The Thing\" (1982) and \"The Fly\" (1986).\nChristmas horror.\nChristmas horror is a film subgenre that emerged in the 1970s with films such as \"Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?\" (1971) and \"Silent Night, Bloody Night\" (1972), which were soon followed by the influential \"Black Christmas\" (1974). Defining the Christmas horror genre has been described as challenging, as it has generally been regarded as a sub-genre of the slasher film. Adam Rockoff, in \"Rue Morgue\", noted that the sub-genre sits within a trend of holiday-themed slasher films, alongside films such as \"My Bloody Valentine\" (1981) and \"April Fool's Day\" (1986). Others take a broader view that Christmas horror is not limited to the slasher genre, noting how it evolved from the English Christmas tradition of telling ghost stories. Christmas in literature has historically included elements of \"darkness\"\u2014fright, misery, death and decay\u2014tracing its literary antecedents as far back as the biblical account of the Massacre of the Innocents and more recently in works such as E. T. A. Hoffmann's \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" (1816) and Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" (1843). Although ghosts have largely been replaced by serial killers, Christmas horror creates an outlet through which to explore \"a modern reinvention of the Christmas ghost story\".\nErotic horror.\nErotic horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that blends sensual and sexual imagery with horrific themes for the sake of sexual arousal. Erotic horror has had influences on French and American horror cinema. The works of Jean Rollin, such as \"Le Viol du Vampire\" and \"Fascination\", are considered quintessential erotic horror films, blending deeply sexual imagery with gore. American cinema has also featured notable erotic horror film franchises, such as \"Candyman.\" An example of a British erotic horror film series is \"Hellraiser\". \"Alien\" features heavy erotic imagery, with the design of the Xenomorph by H. R. Giger featuring both phallic and vaginal imagery, intended to symbolize patriarchal guilt as well as sex, rape, and pregnancy.\nExtreme Horror.\nExtreme horror is a subgenre of horror that emerged from early twentieth century theater through shocking performances from Paris, France's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Grand\u2011Guignol. The transition from theater to cinema allowed transgressive acts of uncensored sex, torture, mutilation, and taboo exploitation to reach a wider audience. Notably, the 1970s herald in extreme horror that is frequently cited as the beginning of the film subgenre including \"Last House on the Left\" (1972), \"Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom\" (1975)\",\" and \"I Spit on Your Grave\" (1978)\".\" Extreme horror film series, such as \"Saw\" (2004) and \"Hostel\" (2005), have reached mainstream media with character(s) appearances in video games namely \"Dead by Daylight\" and the subject of musical lyrics for the band Ice Nine Kills. \nFolk horror.\nFolk horror uses elements of folklore or other religious and cultural beliefs to instill fear in audiences. Folk horror films have featured rural settings and themes of isolation, religion and nature. Frequently cited examples are \"Witchfinder General\" (1968), \"The Blood on Satan's Claw\" (1971), \"The Wicker Man\" (1973), \"The Witch\" (2015), and \"Midsommar\" (2019). Local folklore and beliefs have been noted as being prevalent in horror films from the Southeast Asia region, including Thailand and Indonesia.\nFound footage horror.\nThe found footage horror film \"technique\" gives the audience a first person view of the events on screen, and presents the footage as being discovered after. Horror films which are framed as being made up of \"found-footage\" merge the experiences of the audience and characters, which may induce suspense, shock, and bafflement. Alexandra Heller-Nicholas noted that the popularity of sites like YouTube in 2006 sparked a taste for amateur media, leading to the production of further films in the found footage horror genre later in the 2000s including the particularly financially successful \"Paranormal Activity\" (2007).\nGothic horror.\nIn their book \"Gothic film\", Richard J. McRoy and Richard J. Hand stated that \"Gothic\" can be argued as a very loose subgenre of horror, but argued that \"Gothic\" as a whole was a style like \"film noir\" and not bound to certain cinematic elements like the Western or science fiction film. The term \"gothic\" is frequently used to describe a stylized approach to showcasing location, desire, and action in film. Contemporary views of the genre associate it with imagery of castles at hilltops and labyrinth like ancestral mansions that are in various states of disrepair. Narratives in these films often focus on an audience's fear and attraction to social change and rebellion. The genre can be applied to films as early as \"The Haunted Castle\" (1896), \"Frankenstein\" (1910) as well as to more complex iterations such as Park Chan-wook's \"Stoker\" (2013) and Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" (2017).\nThe gothic style is applied to several films throughout the history of the horror film. This includes Universal Pictures' horror films of the 1930s, the revival of gothic horror in the 1950s and 1960s with films from Hammer, Roger Corman's Poe-cycle, and several Italian productions. By the 1970s American and British productions often had vampire films set in a contemporary setting, such as Hammer Films had their \"Dracula\" stories set in a modern setting and made other horror material which pushed the erotic content of their vampire films that was initiated by \"Black Sunday\". In the 1980s, the older horror characters of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster rarely appeared, with vampire themed films continued often in the tradition of authors like Anne Rice where vampirism becomes a lifestyle choice rather than plague or curse. Following the release of Francis Ford Coppola's \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992), a small wave of high-budgeted gothic horror romance films were released in the 1990s.\nNatural horror.\nAlso described as \"eco-horror\", the natural horror film is a subgenre \"featuring nature running amok in the form of mutated beasts, carnivorous insects, and normally harmless animals or plants turned into cold-blooded killers.\" In 1963, Alfred Hitchcock defined a new genre nature taking revenge on humanity with \"The Birds\" (1963) that was expanded into a trend into the 1970s. Following the success of \"Willard\" (1971), a film about killer rats, 1972 had similar films with \"Stanley\" (1972) and an official sequel \"Ben\" (1972). Other films followed in suit such as \"Night of the Lepus\" (1972), \"Frogs\" (1972), \"Bug\" (1975), \"Squirm\" (1976) and what Muir described as the \"turning point\" in the genre with \"Jaws\" (1975), which became the highest-grossing film at that point and moved the animal attacks genres \"towards a less-fantastic route\" with less giant animals and more real-life creatures such as \"Grizzly\" (1976) and \"Night Creature\" (1977), \"Orca\" (1977), and \"Jaws 2\" (1978). The film is linked with the environmental movements that became more mainstream in the 1970s and early 1980s such vegetarianism, animal rights movements, and organizations such as Greenpeace. Following \"Jaws\", sharks became the most popular animal of the genre, ranging from similar such as \"\" (1976) and \"Great White\" (1981) to the \"Sharknado\" film series. James Marriott found that the genre had \"lost momentum\" since the 1970s while the films would still be made towards the turn of the millennium.\nPsychological horror.\nBill Gibron of PopMatters declared a mixed definition of the psychological horror film, ranging from definitions of anything that created a sense of disquiet or apprehension to a film where an audience's mind makes up what was not directly displayed visually. Gibron concluded it as a \"clouded gray area between all out splatter and a trip through a cinematic dark ride.\"\nReligious horror.\nReligious horror is a subgenre of horror film whose common themes are based on religion and focus heavily on supernatural beings, often with demons as the main antagonists that bring a sense of threat. Such films commonly use religious elements, including the crucifix or cross, holy water, the Bible, the rosary, the sign of the cross, the church, and prayer, which are forms of religious symbols and rituals used to depict the use of faith to defeat evil.\nSlasher film.\nThe slasher film is a horror subgenre which involves a killer murdering a group of people (often teenagers), usually by use of bladed tools. In his book on the genre, author Adam Rockoff wrote that these villains represented a \"rogue genre\" of films that are \"tough, problematic, and fiercely individualistic.\" Following the financial success of \"Friday the 13th\" (1980), at least 20 other slasher films appeared in 1980 alone. These films usually revolved around three properties: unique social settings (campgrounds, schools, holidays) and a crime from the past committed (an accidental drowning, infidelity, a scorned lover) and a ready made group of victims (camp counselors, students, wedding parties). The genre was derided by several contemporary film critics of the era such as Ebert, and often were highly profitable in the box office. The release of \"Scream\" (1996), led to a brief revival of the slasher films for the 1990s. Other countries imitated the American slasher film revival, such as South Korea's early 2000s cycle with \"Bloody Beach\" (2000), \"Nightmare\" (2000) and \"The Record\" (2000).\nSplatter film.\nSplatter is a subgenre that depends on violence and gore to display and accentuate a fascination with the theatricality of mutilation and the vulnerability of the human body.\nSupernatural horror.\nSupernatural horror films, sometimes referred to as paranormal horror films, integrate supernatural elements, such as the afterlife, spirit possession and religion into the horror genre. Since they often focus on undead or non-physical beings, they may create unease in viewers without a visible presence on screen. This may include characters feeling a touch or chill in the air, furniture moving on its own, mysterious sounds, or lights flickering with no apparent cause. Prominent supernatural horror films include \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"The Conjuring\".\nSuburban gothic.\nSuburban gothic is a subgenre of Gothic fiction, art, film and television, focused on anxieties associated with the creation of suburban communities, particularly in the United States and the Western world, from the 1950s and 1960s onwards.\nThis genre often explores themes of paranoia, conformity, and hidden dangers. Suburban horror films include \"Halloween\" (1978), \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (1984), and \"The Stepford Wives\" (1975), all of which use the suburban setting to heighten the tension and fear.\nTeen horror.\nTeen horror is a horror subgenre that victimizes teenagers while usually promoting strong, anti-conformity teenage leads, appealing to young generations. This subgenre often depicts themes of sex, under-aged drinking, and gore. Horror films aimed a young audience featuring teenage monsters grew popular in the 1950s with several productions from American International Pictures (AIP) and productions of Herman Cohen with \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\" (1957) and \"I Was a Teenage Frankenstein\" (1957). This led to later productions like \"Daughter of Dr. Jekyll\" (1957) and \"Frankenstein's Daughter\" (1958). Teen horror cycle in the 1980s often showcased explicit gore and nudity, with John Kenneth Muir described as cautionary conservative tales where most of the films stated if you partook in such vices such as drugs or sex, your punishment of death would be handed out.\nPrior to \"Scream\", there were no popular teen horror films in the early 1990s. After the financial success of \"Scream\", teen horror films became increasingly reflexive and self-aware until the end of the 1990s with films like \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1997) and non-slasher \"The Faculty\" (1998). The genre lost prominence as teen films dealt with threats with more realism in films like \"Donnie Darko\" (2001) and \"Crazy/Beautiful\" (2001). In her book on the 1990s teen horror cycle, Alexandra West described the general trend of these films is often looked down upon by critics, journals, and fans as being too glossy, trendy, and sleek to be considered worthwhile horror films.\nRegional horror films.\nAsian horror films.\nHorror films in Asia have been noted as being inspired by national, cultural or religious folklore, particularly beliefs in ghosts or spirits. In \"Asian Horror\", Andy Richards writes that there is a \"widespread and engrained acceptance of supernatural forces\" in many Asian cultures, and suggests this is related to animist, pantheist and karmic religious traditions, as in Buddhism and Shintoism. Although Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Korean horror has arguably received the most international attention, horror also makes up a considerable proportion of Cambodian and Malaysian cinema.\nEuropean horror films.\nIan Olney described the horror films of Europe were often more erotic and \"just plain stranger\" than their British and American counter-parts. European horror films (generally referred to as Euro Horror) draw from distinctly European cultural sources, including surrealism, romanticism, decadent tradition, early 20th century pulp-literature, film serials, and erotic comics. In comparison to the narrative logic in American genre films, these films focused on imagery, excessiveness, and the irrational.\nBetween the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s, European horror films emerged from countries like Italy, Spain and France, and were shown in the United States predominantly at drive-in theatre and grindhouse theaters. As producers and distributors all over the world were interested in horror films, regardless of their origin, changes started occurring in European low-budget filmmaking that allowed for productions in the 1960s and 1970s for horror films from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain, as well as co-productions between these countries. Several productions, such as those in Italy, were co-productions due to the lack of international stars within the country. European horror films began developing strong cult following since the late 1990s.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIt is unknown when Australia's cinema first horror title may have been, with thoughts ranging from \"The Strangler's Grip\" (1912) to \"The Face at the Window\" (1919) while stories featuring ghosts would appear in \"Guyra Ghost Mystery\" (1921). By 1913, the more prolific era of Australian cinema ended with production not returning with heavy input of government finance in the 1970s. It took until the 1970s for Australia to develop sound film with television films that eventually received theatrical release with \"Dead Easy\" (1970) and \"Night of Fear\" (1973). \"The Cars That Ate Paris\" (1974) was the first Australian horror production made for theatrical release. 1970s Australian art cinema was funded by state film corporations, who considered them more culturally acceptable than local exploitation films (Ozploitation), which was part of the Australian phenomenon called the cultural cringe. The greater success of genre films like \"Mad Max\" (1979), \"The Last Wave\" (1977) and \"Patrick\" (1978) led to the Australian Film Commission to change its focus to being a more commercial operation. This closed in 1980 as its funding was abused by investors using them as tax avoiding measures. A new development known as the 10BA tax shelter scheme was developed ushering a slew of productions, leading to what Peter Shelley, author of \"Australian Horror Films\", suggested meant \"making a profit was more important than making a good film.\" Shelley called these films derivative of \"American films and presenting generic American material\". These films included the horror film productions of Antony I. Ginnane. While Australia would have success with international films between the mid-1980s and the 2000s, less than five horror films were produced in the country between 1993 and 2000. It was only after the success of \"Wolf Creek\" (2005) that a new generation of filmmakers would continuously make horror genre films in Australia that continued into the 2010s.\nNew Zealand.\nBy 2005, New Zealand has produced around 190 feature films, with about 88% of them being made after 1976. New Zealand horror film history was described by Philip Matthews of Stuff as making \"po-faced gothic and now we do horror for laughs.\" Among the earliest known New Zealand horror films productions are \"Strange Behavior\" (1981), a co-production with Australia and \"Death Warmed Up\" (1984) a single production. Early features such as Melanie Read's \"Trial Run\" (1984) where a mother is sent to remote cottage to photograph penguins and finds it habitat to haunted spirits, and Gaylene Preston's \"Mr. Wrong\" (1984) purchases a car that is haunted by its previous owner. Other films imitate American slasher and splatter films with \"Bridge to Nowhere\" (1986), and the early films of Peter Jackson who combined splatter films with comedy with \"Bad Taste\" (1988) and \"Braindead\" (1992) which has the largest following of the mentioned films. Film producer Ant Timpson had an influence curating New Zealand horror films, creating the Incredibly Strange Film Festival in the 1990s and producing his own horror films over the 2010s including \"The ABCs of Death\" (2012), \"Deathgasm\" (2015), and \"Housebound\" (2014). Timpson noted the latter horror entries from New Zealand are all humorous films like \"What We Do in the Shadows\" (2014) with Jonathan King, director of \"Black Sheep\" (2006) and \"The Tattooist\" (2007) stating \"I'd love to see a genuinely scary New Zealand film but I don't know if New Zealand audiences \u2013 or the funding bodies \u2013 are keen.\"\nNorth America.\nMexico.\nAfter the 1931 release of an American-produced Spanish-language version of \"Dracula\" by George Melford for the Latin-American market employing Mexican actors, Mexican horror films were produced throughout the 1930s and 1940s, often reflecting on the overarching theme of science vs. religion conflict. Ushered by the release of \"El vampiro\", the Mexploitation horror film era started in 1957, with films characterised by their low production values and camp appeal, often featuring vampires, wrestlers, and Aztec mummies. A key figure in the Mexican horror scene (particularly in Germ\u00e1n Robles-starred vampire films) was producer Abel Salazar. The late 1960s saw the advent of the prominence of Carlos Enrique Taboada as an standout Mexican horror filmmaker, with films such as \"Hasta el viento tiene miedo\" (1967), \"El libro de piedra\" (1968), \"M\u00e1s negro que la noche\" (1975) or \"Veneno para las hadas\" (1984). Mexican horror cinema has been noted for the mashup of classic gothic and romantic themes and characters with autochthonous features of the Mexican culture such as the Rancher\u00eda setting, the colonial past or the myth of La Llorona (shared with other Hispanic-American nations).\nHorror has proven to be a dependable genre at the Mexican box office in the 21st-century, with Mexico ranking as having the world's largest relative popularity of the genre among viewers (ahead of South Korea), according to a 2016 research.\nEffects on audiences.\nPsychological effects.\nIn a study done by Uri Hasson et al., brain waves were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study used the inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) method of determining results. It was shown that audience members tend to focus on certain facets in a particular scene simultaneously and tend to sit as still as possible while watching horror films.\nIn another study done by John Greene and Glenn Sparks, it was found that the audience tends to experience the excitation transfer process (ETP) which causes a physiological arousal in audience members. The ETP refers to the feelings experienced immediately after an emotion-arousing experience, such as watching a horror film. In this case, audience members' heart rate, blood pressure and respiration all increased while watching films with violence. Audience members with positive feedback regarding the horror film have feelings similar to happiness or joy felt with friends, but intensified. Alternatively, audience members with negative feedback regarding the film would typically feel emotions they would normally associate with negative experiences in their life.\nOnly about 10% of the American population enjoy the physiological rush felt immediately after watching horror films. The population that does not enjoy horror films could experience emotional fallout similar to that of PTSD if the environment reminds them of particular scenes.\nA 2021 study suggested horror films that explore grief can provide psychological benefits to the bereaved, with the genre well suited to representing grief through its genre conventions.\nPhysical effects.\nIn a study by Medes et al., prolonged exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noise (&lt;500\u00a0Hz) in long durations has an effect on vocal range (i.e. longer exposure tends to form a lower phonation frequency range). Another study by Baliatsas et al. observed that there is a correlation between exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noises and sleep-related problems. Though most horror films keep the audio around 20\u201330\u00a0Hz, the noise can still be unsettling in long durations.\nAnother technique used in horror films to provoke a response from the audience is cognitive dissonance, which is when someone experiences tension in themselves and is urged to relieve that tension. Dissonance is the clashing of unpleasant or harsh sounds. A study by Prete et al. identified that the ability to recognize dissonance relied on the left hemisphere of the brain, while consonance relied on the right half. There is a stronger preference for consonance; this difference is noticeable even in early stages of life. Previous musical experience also can influence a dislike for dissonance.\nSkin conductance responses (SCRs), heart rate (HR), and electromyographic (EMG) responses vary in response to emotional stimuli, showing higher for negative emotions in what is known as the \"negative bias.\" When applied to dissonant music, HR decreases (as a bodily form of adaptation to harsh stimulation), SCR increases, and EMG responses in the face are higher. The typical reactions go through a two-step process of first orienting to the problem (the slowing of HR), then a defensive process (a stronger increase in SCR and an increase in HR). This initial response can sometimes result in a fight-or-flight response, which is the characteristic of dissonance that horror films rely on to frighten and unsettle viewers.\nReception.\nIn film criticism.\nCritic Robin Wood was not the first film critic to take the horror film seriously, but his article \"Return of the Repressed\" in 1978 helped inaugurate the horror film into academic study as a genre. Wood later stated that he was surprised that his work, as well as the writing of Richard Lippe and Andrew Britton would receive \"historic importance\" intellectual views of the film genre. William Paul in his book \"Laughing Screaming\" comments that \"the negative definition of the lower works would have it that they are less subtle than higher genres. More positively, it could be said that they are more direct. Where lower forms are explicit, higher forms tend to operate more by indirection. Because of this indirection the higher forms are often regarded as being more metaphorical, and consequently more resonant, more open to the exegetical analyses of the academic industry.\"\nSteffen Hantke noted that academic criticism about horror cinema had \"always operated under duress\" noting that challenges in legitimizing its subject, finding \"career-minded academics might have always suspected that they were studying something that was ultimately too frivolous, garish, and sensationalistic to warrant serious critical attention\".\nSome commentary has suggested that horror films have been underrepresented or underappreciated as serious works worthy of film criticism and major films awards. As of 2025, only seven horror films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, with \"The Silence of the Lambs\" being the sole winner. However, horror films have still won major awards.\nCritics have also commented on the representation of women and disability in horror films, as well as the prevalence of racial stereotypes.\nCensorship.\nMany horror films have been the subject of moral panic, censorship and legal controversy.\nIn the United Kingdom, film censorship has frequently been applied to horror films. A moral panic over several slasher films in the 1980s led to many of them being banned but released on videotape; the phenomenon became popularly termed \"video nasties\". Constraints on permitted subject matter in Indonesian films has also influenced Indonesian horror films. In March 2008, China banned all horror films from its market.\nIn the U.S., the Motion Picture Production Code which was implemented in 1930, set moral guidelines for film content, restraining movies containing controversial themes, graphic violence, explicit sexuality and/or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and its eventual formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the MPAA film rating system) offered more freedom to the movie industry.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The group consisted of DJ Lethal, Danny Boy, and Everlast. They are best known for their 1992 hit single \"Jump Around\", which reached number 3 in the United States, number 6 in Ireland and number 8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996.\nLead rapper Everlast went on to pursue a solo career and was a member of the supergroup La Coka Nostra which also featured DJ Lethal. DJ Lethal would later join and find commercial success with the band Limp Bizkit. House of Pain reunited briefly in 2010 for a world tour.\nBand history.\n1990\u20131992: Formation and breakthrough.\nIn 1990, Daniel O'Connor (Danny Boy O'Connor) got together with fellow rapper Erik Schrody (Everlast) who had just released a rap album called \"Forever Everlasting\" (1990), that did not have much success. O'Connor knew Schrody when he went to William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills, California (1984\u20131986), and various hip hop events they attended in their teens. Both of Irish American descent, they decided to make a hip hop group with this identity. While hanging out at O'Connor's home, Schrody noticed a cassette with the title \"House of Pain\", which was a demo of a Punk group O'Connor tried to put together. Schrody really liked the name and felt they should re-use as their name. Schrody brought in his former DJ Leor Dimant (DJ Lethal), who is of Latvian descent, and House of Pain was created. Schrody would become the lead rapper, while O'Connor acted as the hype man, second emcee, art director and the graphic artist of the group. After they recorded a demo, for which O'Connor designed the cover, that created a bidding war among labels. The label they chose was Tommy Boy Records, who credited O'Connor's artwork with having initially caught their attention.\nIn 1992, they released their debut album \"House of Pain\", subtitled \"Fine Malt Lyrics.\" Their first single \"Jump Around\" was a major hit. In the United States, it peaked at number 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, while reaching number 5 on the Hot Rap Songs, 13 on Rhythmic Top 40, 1 on Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales, number 17 on the \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs, and is certified platinum. The song was produced by Lawrence Muggerud (DJ Muggs) and performed by Schrody. Both Muggerud and Schrody knew each other since Rhyme Syndicate. Muggerud, who had a beat he had submitted to various artists, eventually invited Schrody to give it a try. Schrody wrote lyrics in his driveway; being influenced by dance hall singer Shabba Ranks, part of the lyrics were \"Jump around, if you love freedom. Jump around, if you love culture\", which Muggerud suggested they trim down to \"Jump Around\". While re-working his lyrics, Muggerud came up with the iconic horn that accompanies the song. Their second single \"Shamrocks and Shenanigans (Boom Shalock Lock Boom)\" peaked at 65 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, 75 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, 14 on the Dance Club Songs, and 74 on Radio Songs. The album peaked at 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200, 14 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Current Albums, 16 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, 14 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Album Sales, and is certified platinum.\n1993\u20131996: Subsequent success and group's breakup.\nIn 1993, they were among the rap artists who had cameo roles in Ted Demme's film \"Who's the Man?\". For this project they provided a theme song by the same name, which was also used as a single for the soundtrack and their subsequent album. It rose to number 97 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, 77 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, and 10 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales. Also that year, they participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the 1993 rap rock collaborative \"Judgment Night\" film soundtrack.\nIn 1994, they released \"Same as It Ever Was\". The album peaked at 12 equally on the \"Billboard\" 200, the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Current Albums, the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Album Sales, and is certified gold. \"AllMusic\" gave it four out five stars. Matt Carlson of \"The Michigan Daily\" found the album quite good and noted \"the music is laid back with some heavy driving forces underlying and strengthening it\". J.D. Constantine of \"The Baltimore Sun\" did not like album and found it monotonous and unimaginative. Roger Catlin of the \"Hartford Courant\" said that while finding the continuity monotonous it's \"hard and compelling\" as well as a \"strong outing\". Andrew Love of \"The Ocala Star-Banner\" gave it four stars saying \"this is a band that has definitely progressed over the course of one album\". Music critic Robert Christgau, who did not like their previous and subsequent album, gave it an A\u2212 and described it as \"the hardest hip hop of the year\".\nIn 1996, they released \"Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again\". The album peaked at 47 on the \"Billboard\" 200, 47 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Current Albums, 31 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and 47 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top Album Sales. At the release party, Schrody decided to disband the group. Sputnikmusic wrote that \"the trio\u2019s most rounded, consistent &amp; memorable LP is grossly under-appreciated.\" Dave Ferman of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" gave it one star and a half, calling it a \"woeful mess\". Steve Juon of \"RapReviews\" gave it a seven out of ten. \"AllMusic\" music gave it two point five stars out of five.\n1997\u2013present day: solo projects and reunions.\nFrom then on, the members continued their separate careers. Schrody achieved multi-platinum solo fame in 1998 with his album \"Whitey Ford Sings the Blues,\" where he developed a style that blended rap with acoustic guitar, as well as singing.\nDimant became the DJ of multi-platinum nu metal band Limp Bizkit.\nO'Connor did some freelance work designing clothes, and was involved in several music projects.\nIn late 2004, the creation of the rap supergroup La Coka Nostra started when O'Connor was mentoring young artists. He took notice of two up and comers which included George Carroll (Slaine) and brought them to meet his former DJ from House of Pain, Leor Dimant, who at the time was working on a compilation album and championing a new artist as well. They decided to make a group and asked O'Connor to become a member as a hype man and art director. After accepting, O'Connor felt that there was a void and asked experienced rapper William Braunstein (Ill Bill) to join. The group's name came about, when O'Connor teased Carroll and Braunstein with that nickname, after they both had a night out. The group started releasing music on MySpace, and went viral. Eventually, O'Connor received a letter from former House of Pain colleague Erik Schrody, who asked if he could join. By 2006, the group consisted of O'Connor, Carroll, Dimant, Braunstein, and Schrody.\nIn 2009, La Coka Nostra released \"A Brand You Can Trust\" was released on July 14, 2009, on Suburban Noize Records. It sold over 500,000 units. \"AllMusic\" gave four out of five stars. Andrew Kameka of \"HipHopDX\" wrote that \"the album is a mostly solid effort and exactly what someone would expect from a supergroup of like-minded members known for high-energy music\". Adam Kennedy of the \"BBC\" while praising some the moments of the album said \"it\u2019s a tantalising parting taste of potential capabilities, yet until they improve a customer satisfaction hit rate that barely troubles one in three tunes here\". Steve Juon of \"RapReviews\" gave it a seven out of ten. \"Sputnikmusic\" described it as \"a disjointed effort, but still pretty decent in and of itself and gave it three point five out of five. Thomas Quinlan of \"Exclaim!\" said \"La Coka Nostra are an interesting collection of collaborators that live up to the hype\".\nOn March 2, 2012, it was announced that Schrody would be leaving La Coka Nostra due to his daughter's medical issues, while O'Connor and Dimant pursued two more project with the group \"Masters of the Dark Arts\" (2012) and \"To Thine Own Self Be True\" (2016).\nHouse of Pain reunited at a private event held by UFC president Dana White in Boston on St. Patrick's Day 2009. It was officially announced on August 10, 2010, that House of Pain had reunited and performed their first \"official\" show in a decade at the second annual Epicenter music festival in Fontana, California, on September 25, 2010. Though Dimant is still a member of the group, he did not join them on their 2011 reunion tour due to prior obligations with Limp Bizkit. In April\u2013May 2011 House of Pain attended the Groovin' the Moo touring festival in Australia, and also performed at Scotland's T in the Park festival on July 9, 2011, as well as Sonisphere UK Festival on July 12 of the same year.\nHouse of Pain reunited in 2017 for a 25th Anniversary Tour. The tour included shows in DC, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and California.\nBetween reunions and projects together, Schrody continues with his solo career, while Dimant still works with Limp Bizkit, and in 2019 O'Connor opened The Outsiders House Museum dedicated to both the novel and the film \"The Outsiders\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name given to the office of head of state depends on the country's form of government and any separation of powers; the powers of the office in each country range from being also the head of government to being little more than a ceremonial figurehead.\nIn a parliamentary system, such as India or the United Kingdom, the head of state usually has mostly ceremonial powers, with a separate head of government. However, in some parliamentary systems, like South Africa, there is an executive president that is both head of state and head of government. Likewise, in some parliamentary systems the head of state is not the head of government, but still has significant powers, for example Morocco. In contrast, a semi-presidential system, such as France, has both heads of state and government as the \"de facto\" leaders of the nation (in practice, they divide the leadership of the nation between themselves).\nMeanwhile, in presidential systems, the head of state is also the head of government. In one-party ruling communist states, the position of president has no tangible powers by itself; however, since such a head of state, as a matter of custom, simultaneously holds the post of General Secretary of the Communist Party, they are the executive leader with their powers deriving from their status of being the party leader, rather than the office of president.\nFormer French president Charles de Gaulle, while developing the current Constitution of France (1958), said that the head of state should embody \"\" (\"the spirit of the nation\").\nConstitutional models.\nSome academic writers discuss states and governments in terms of \"models\".\nAn independent nation state normally has a head of state, and determines the extent of its head's executive powers of government or formal representational functions. In terms of protocol: the head of a sovereign, independent state is usually identified as the person who, according to that state's constitution, is the reigning monarch, in the case of a monarchy; or the president, in the case of a republic.\nAmong the state constitutions (fundamental laws) that establish different political systems, four major types of heads of state can be distinguished:\nIn a federal constituent or a dependent territory, the same role is fulfilled by the holder of an office corresponding to that of a head of state. For example, in each Canadian province the role is fulfilled by the lieutenant governor, whereas in most British Overseas Territories the powers and duties are performed by the governor. The same applies to Australian states, Indian states, etc. Hong Kong's constitutional document, the Basic Law, for example, specifies the chief executive as the head of the special administrative region, in addition to their role as the head of government. These non-sovereign-state heads, nevertheless, have a restricted or negligible role in diplomatic affairs, depending on the status and the norms and practices of the territories concerned.\nParliamentary system.\nStandard model.\nIn parliamentary systems the head of state may be merely the nominal chief executive officer, heading the executive branch of the state, and possessing limited executive power. In reality, however, following a process of constitutional evolution, powers are usually only exercised by direction of a cabinet, presided over by a head of government who is answerable to the legislature. This accountability and legitimacy requires that someone be chosen who has a majority support in the legislature (or, at least, not a majority opposition \u2013 a subtle but important difference). It also gives the legislature the right to vote down the head of government and their cabinet, forcing it either to resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution. The executive branch is thus said to be responsible (or answerable) to the legislature, with the head of government and cabinet in turn accepting constitutional responsibility for offering constitutional advice to the head of state.\nIn parliamentary constitutional monarchies, the legitimacy of the unelected head of state typically derives from the tacit approval of the people via the elected representatives. Accordingly, at the time of the Glorious Revolution, the English parliament acted of its own authority to name a new king and queen (the joint monarchs Mary II and William III); likewise, Edward VIII's abdication required the approval of each of the six independent realms of which he was monarch. In monarchies with a written constitution, the position of monarch is created under the constitution and could be abolished through a democratic procedure of constitutional amendment. In many cases there are significant procedural hurdles imposed on such a procedure (as in the Constitution of Spain).\nIn republics with a parliamentary system (such as India, Germany, Austria, Italy and Israel), the head of state is usually titled \"president\" and the principal functions of such presidents are mainly ceremonial and symbolic, as opposed to the presidents in a presidential or semi-presidential system.\nIn reality, numerous variants exist to the position of a head of state within a parliamentary system. The older the constitution, the more constitutional leeway tends to exist for a head of state to exercise greater powers over government, as many older parliamentary system constitutions in fact give heads of state powers and functions akin to presidential or semi-presidential systems, in some cases without containing reference to modern democratic principles of accountability to parliament or even to modern governmental offices. Usually, the king had the power of declaring war without previous consent of the parliament.\nFor example, under the 1848 constitution of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and then the Kingdom of Italy, the \"Statuto Albertino\"\u2014the parliamentary approval to the government appointed by the king\u2014was customary, but not required by law.\nExamples of heads of state in parliamentary systems using greater powers than usual, either because of ambiguous constitutions or unprecedented national emergencies, include the decision by King Leopold III of the Belgians to surrender on behalf of his state to the invading German army in 1940, against the will of his government. Judging that his responsibility to the nation by virtue of his coronation oath required him to act, he believed that his government's decision to fight rather than surrender was mistaken and would damage Belgium. (Leopold's decision proved highly controversial. After World War II, Belgium voted in a referendum to allow him to resume his monarchical powers and duties, but because of the ongoing controversy he ultimately abdicated.) The Belgian constitutional crisis in 1990, when the head of state refused to sign into law a bill permitting abortion, was resolved by the cabinet assuming the power to promulgate the law while he was treated as \"unable to reign\" for twenty-four hours.\nNon-executive model.\nThese officials are excluded completely from the executive: they do not possess even theoretical executive powers or any role, even formal, within the government. Hence their states' governments are not referred to by the traditional parliamentary model head of state styles of \"His/Her Majesty's Government\" or \"His/Her Excellency's Government\". Within this general category, variants in terms of powers and functions may exist.\nThe was drawn up under the Allied occupation that followed World War II and was intended to replace the previous militaristic and quasi-absolute monarchy system with a form of liberal democracy parliamentary system. The constitution explicitly vests all executive power in the Cabinet, who is chaired by the prime minister (articles 65 and 66) and responsible to the Diet (articles 67 and 69). The emperor is defined in the constitution as \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\" (article 1), and is generally recognised throughout the world as the Japanese head of state. Although the emperor formally appoints the prime minister to office, article 6 of the constitution requires him to appoint the candidate \"as designated by the Diet\", without any right to decline appointment. He is a ceremonial figurehead with no independent discretionary powers related to the governance of Japan.\nSince the passage in Sweden of the 1974 Instrument of Government, the Swedish monarch no longer has many of the standard parliamentary system head of state functions that had previously belonged to him or her, as was the case in the preceding 1809 Instrument of Government. Today, the speaker of the Riksdag appoints (following a vote in the Riksdag) the prime minister and terminates their commission following a vote of no confidence or voluntary resignation. Cabinet members are appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the prime minister. Laws and ordinances are promulgated by two Cabinet members in unison signing \"On Behalf of the Government\" and the government\u2014not the monarch\u2014is the high contracting party with respect to international treaties. The remaining official functions of the sovereign, by constitutional mandate or by unwritten convention, are to open the annual session of the Riksdag, receive foreign ambassadors and sign the letters of credence for Swedish ambassadors, chair the foreign advisory committee, preside at the special Cabinet council when a new prime minister takes office, and to be kept informed by the prime minister on matters of state.\nIn contrast, the only contact the president of Ireland has with the Irish government is through a formal briefing session given by the taoiseach (head of government) to the president. However, the president has no access to documentation and all access to ministers goes through the Department of the Taoiseach. The president does, however, hold limited reserve powers, such as referring a bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality, which are used under the president's discretion.\nThe most extreme non-executive republican head of state is the president of Israel, which holds no reserve powers whatsoever. The least ceremonial powers held by the president are to provide a mandate to attempt to form a government, to approve the dissolution of the Knesset made by the prime minister, and to pardon criminals or to commute their sentence.\nExecutive model.\nSome parliamentary republics (like South Africa, Botswana and Kiribati) have fused the roles of the head of state with the head of government (like in a presidential system), while having the sole executive officer, often called a president, being dependent on the Parliament's confidence to rule (like in a parliamentary system). While also being the leading symbol of the nation, the president in this system acts mostly as a prime minister since the incumbent must be a member of the legislature at the time of the election, answer question sessions in Parliament, avoid motions of no confidence, etc.\nSemi-presidential systems.\nSemi-presidential systems combine features of presidential and parliamentary systems, notably (in the president-parliamentary subtype) a requirement that the government be answerable to both the president and the legislature. The constitution of the Fifth French Republic provides for a prime minister who is chosen by the president, but who nevertheless must be able to gain support in the National Assembly. Should a president be of one side of the political spectrum and the opposition be in control of the legislature, the president is usually obliged to select someone from the opposition to become prime minister, a process known as Cohabitation. President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, a Socialist, for example, was forced to cohabit with the neo-Gaullist (right wing) Jacques Chirac, who became his prime minister from 1986 to 1988. In the French system, in the event of cohabitation, the president is often allowed to set the policy agenda in security and foreign affairs and the prime minister runs the domestic and economic agenda.\nOther countries evolve into something akin to a semi-presidential system or indeed a full presidential system.The constitution of the Weimar Republic, for example, provided for a popularly elected president with theoretically dominant executive powers that were intended to be exercised only in emergencies, and a cabinet appointed by him from the Reichstag, which was expected, in normal circumstances, to be answerable to the Reichstag. Initially, the president was merely a symbolic figure with the Reichstag dominant; however, persistent political instability, in which governments often lasted only a few months, led to a change in the power structure of the republic, with the president's emergency powers called increasingly into use to prop up governments challenged by critical or even hostile Reichstag votes. By 1932, power had shifted to such an extent that the German president, Paul von Hindenburg, was able to dismiss a chancellor and select his own person for the job, even though the outgoing chancellor possessed the confidence of the Reichstag while the new chancellor did not. Subsequently, President von Hindenburg used his power to appoint Adolf Hitler as Chancellor without consulting the Reichstag.\nPresidential system.\n\"Note: The head of state in a \"presidential\" system may not actually hold the title of \"president\" - the name of the system refers to any head of state who actually governs and is not directly dependent on the legislature to remain in office.\"\nSome constitutions or fundamental laws provide for a head of state who is not only in theory but in practice chief executive, operating separately from, and independent from, the legislature. This system is known as a \"presidential system\" and sometimes called the \"imperial model\", because the executive officials of the government are answerable solely and exclusively to a presiding, acting head of state, and is selected by and on occasion dismissed by the head of state without reference to the legislature. It is notable that some presidential systems, while not providing for collective executive accountability to the legislature, may require legislative approval for individuals prior to their assumption of cabinet office and empower the legislature to remove a president from office (for example, in the United States of America). In this case the debate centers on confirming them into office, not removing them from office, and does not involve the power to reject or approve proposed cabinet members \"en bloc\", so accountability does not operate in the same sense understood as a parliamentary system.\nPresidential systems are a notable feature of constitutions in the Americas, including those of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico and Venezuela; this is generally attributed to the strong influence of the United States in the region, and as the United States Constitution served as an inspiration and model for the Latin American wars of independence of the early 19th century. Most presidents in such countries are selected by democratic means (popular direct or indirect election); however, like all other systems, the presidential model also encompasses people who become head of state by other means, notably through military dictatorship or \"coup d'\u00e9tat\", as often seen in Latin American, Middle Eastern and other presidential regimes. Some of the characteristics of a presidential system, such as a strong dominant political figure with an executive answerable to them, not the legislature can also be found among absolute monarchies, parliamentary monarchies and single party (e.g., Communist) regimes, but in most cases of dictatorship, their stated constitutional models are applied in name only and not in political theory or practice.\nSingle-party states.\nIn certain states under Marxist\u2013Leninist constitutions of the constitutionally socialist state type inspired by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and its constitutive Soviet republics, real political power belonged to the sole legal party. In these states, there was no formal office of head of state, but rather the leader of the legislative branch was considered to be the closest common equivalent of a head of state as a natural person. In the Soviet Union this position carried such titles as \"Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR\"; \"Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet\"; and in the case of the Soviet Russia \"Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets\" (pre-1922), and \"Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian SFSR\" (1956\u20131966). This position may or may not have been held by the de facto Soviet leader at the moment. For example, Nikita Khrushchev never headed the Supreme Soviet but was First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (party leader) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of government).\nThis may even lead to an institutional variability, as in North Korea, where, after the presidency of party leader Kim Il Sung, the office was vacant for years. The late president was granted the posthumous title (akin to some ancient Far Eastern traditions to give posthumous names and titles to royalty) of \"Eternal President\". All substantive power, as party leader, itself not formally created for four years, was inherited by his son Kim Jong Il. The post of president was formally replaced on 5 September 1998, for ceremonial purposes, by the office of President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, while the party leader's post as chairman of the National Defense Commission was simultaneously declared \"the highest post of the state\", not unlike Deng Xiaoping earlier in the People's Republic of China.\nIn China, under the current country's constitution, the Chinese president is a largely ceremonial office with limited power. However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the top leader in the one party system. The presidency is officially regarded as an institution of the state rather than an administrative post; theoretically, the president serves at the pleasure of the National People's Congress, the legislature, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own prerogative. Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, rejected that the president of China functioned as China's head of state, arguing instead that the major differences between the Soviet system and the Chinese was that the presidency acted as a representative of the state collective leadership.\nComplications with categorisation.\nWhile clear categories do exist, it is sometimes difficult to choose which category some individual heads of state belong to. In reality, the category to which each head of state belongs is assessed not by theory but by practice.\nConstitutional change in Liechtenstein in 2003 gave its head of state, the Reigning Prince, constitutional powers that included a veto over legislation and power to dismiss the head of government and cabinet. It could be argued that the strengthening of the Prince's powers, vis-a-vis the Landtag (legislature), has moved Liechtenstein into the semi-presidential category. Similarly the original powers given to the Greek President under the 1974 Hellenic Republic constitution moved Greece closer to the French semi-presidential model.\nAnother complication exists with South Africa, in which the president is in fact elected by the National Assembly (legislature) and is thus similar, in principle, to a head of government in a parliamentary system but is also, in addition, recognised as the head of state. The offices of president of Nauru and president of Botswana are similar in this respect to the South African presidency.\nPanama, during the military dictatorships of Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega, was nominally a presidential republic. However, the elected civilian presidents were effectively figureheads with real political power being exercised by the chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces.\nHistorically, at the time of the League of Nations (1920\u20131946) and the founding of the United Nations (1945), India's head of state was the monarch of the United Kingdom, ruling directly or indirectly as Emperor of India through the Viceroy and Governor-General of India.\nRoles.\nHead of state is the highest-ranking constitutional position in a sovereign state. A head of state has some or all of the roles listed below, often depending on the constitutional category (above), and does not necessarily regularly exercise the most power or influence of governance. There is usually a formal public ceremony when a person becomes head of state, or some time after. This may be the swearing in at the inauguration of a president of a republic, or the coronation of a monarch.\nSymbolic role.\nOne of the most important roles of the modern head of state is being a living national symbol of the state; in hereditary monarchies this extends to the monarch being a symbol of the unbroken continuity of the state. For instance, the Canadian monarch is described by the government as being the personification of the Canadian state and is described by the Department of Canadian Heritage as the \"personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians\".\nIn many countries, official portraits of the head of state can be found in government offices, courts of law, or other public buildings. The idea, sometimes regulated by law, is to use these portraits to make the public aware of the symbolic connection to the government, a practice that dates back to medieval times. Sometimes this practice is taken to excess, and the head of state becomes the principal symbol of the nation, resulting in the emergence of a personality cult where the image of the head of state is the only visual representation of the country, surpassing other symbols such as the flag.\nOther common representations are on coins, postage and other stamps and banknotes, sometimes by no more than a mention or signature; and public places, streets, monuments and institutions such as schools are named for current or previous heads of state. In monarchies (e.g., Belgium) there can even be a practice to attribute the adjective \"royal\" on demand based on existence for a given number of years. However, such political techniques can also be used by leaders without the formal rank of head of state, even party - and other revolutionary leaders without formal state mandate.\nHeads of state often greet important foreign visitors, particularly visiting heads of state. They assume a host role during a state visit, and the programme may feature playing of the national anthems by a military band, inspection of military troops, official exchange of gifts, and attending a state dinner at the official residence of the host.\nAt home, heads of state are expected to render lustre to various occasions by their presence, such as by attending artistic or sports performances or competitions (often in a theatrical honour box, on a platform, on the front row, at the honours table), expositions, national day celebrations, dedication events, military parades and war remembrances, prominent funerals, visiting different parts of the country and people from different walks of life, and at times performing symbolic acts such as cutting a ribbon, groundbreaking, ship christening, laying the first stone. Some parts of national life receive their regular attention, often on an annual basis, or even in the form of official patronage.\nThe Olympic Charter (rule 55.3) of the International Olympic Committee states that the Olympic summer and winter games shall be opened by the head of state of the host nation, by uttering a single formulaic phrase as determined by the charter.\nAs such invitations may be very numerous, such duties are often in part delegated to such persons as a spouse, a head of government or a cabinet minister or in other cases (possibly as a message, for instance, to distance themselves without rendering offence) just a military officer or civil servant.\nFor non-executive heads of state there is often a degree of censorship by the politically responsible government (such as the head of government). This means that the government discreetly approves agenda and speeches, especially where the constitution (or customary law) assumes all political responsibility by granting the crown inviolability (in fact also imposing political emasculation) as in the Kingdom of Belgium from its very beginning; in a monarchy this may even be extended to some degree to other members of the dynasty, especially the heir to the throne.\nBelow follows a list of examples from different countries of general provisions in law, which either designate an office as head of state or define its general purpose.\nExecutive role.\nIn the majority of states, whether republics or monarchies, executive authority is vested, at least notionally, in the head of state. In presidential systems the head of state is the actual, de facto chief executive officer. Under parliamentary systems the executive authority is exercised by the head of state, but in practice is done so on the advice of the cabinet of ministers. This produces such terms as \"Her Majesty's Government\" and \"His Excellency's Government.\" Examples of parliamentary systems in which the head of state is notional chief executive include Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, India, Italy, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom.\nThe few exceptions where the head of state is not even the nominal chief executive - and where supreme executive authority is according to the constitution explicitly vested in a cabinet - include Czechia, Ireland, Israel, Japan and Sweden.\nAppointment of senior officials.\nThe head of state usually appoints most or all the key officials in the government, including the head of government and other cabinet ministers, key judicial figures; and all major office holders in the civil service, foreign service and commissioned officers in the military. In many parliamentary systems, the head of government is appointed with the consent (in practice often decisive) of the legislature, and other figures are appointed on the head of government's advice.\nIn practice, these decisions are often a formality. The last time the prime minister of the United Kingdom was unilaterally selected by the monarch was in 1963, when Queen Elizabeth II appointed Alec Douglas-Home on the advice of outgoing Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.\nIn presidential systems, such as that of the United States, appointments are nominated by the president's sole discretion, but this nomination is often subject to confirmation by the legislature; and specifically in the US, the Senate has to approve senior executive branch and judicial appointments by a simple majority vote.\nThe head of state may also dismiss office-holders. There are many variants on how this can be done. For example, members of the Irish Cabinet are dismissed by the president on the advice of the taoiseach; in other instances, the head of state may be able to dismiss an office holder unilaterally; other heads of state, or their representatives, have the theoretical power to dismiss any office-holder, while it is exceptionally rarely used. In France, while the president cannot force the prime minister to tender the resignation of the government, he can, in practice, request it if the prime minister is from his own majority. In presidential systems, the president often has the power to fire ministers at his sole discretion. In the United States, the unwritten convention calls for the heads of the executive departments to resign on their own initiative when called to do so.\nSome countries have alternative provisions for senior appointments: In Sweden, under the Instrument of Government of 1974, the Speaker of the Riksdag has the role of formally appointing the prime minister, following a vote in the Riksdag, and the prime minister in turn appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers at his/her sole discretion.\nDiplomatic role.\nAlthough many constitutions, particularly from the 19th century and earlier, make no explicit mention of a head of state in the generic sense of several present day international treaties, the officeholders corresponding to this position are recognised as such by other countries. In a monarchy, the monarch is generally understood to be the head of state.\nThe Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which codified longstanding custom, operates under the presumption that the head of a diplomatic mission (i.e. ambassador or nuncio) of the sending state is accredited to the head of state of the receiving state. The head of state accredits (i.e. formally validates) their country's ambassadors (or rarer equivalent diplomatic mission chiefs, such as high commissioner or papal nuncio) through sending formal a letter of credence (and a Letter of Recall at the end of a tenure) to other heads of state and, conversely, receives the letters of their foreign counterparts. Without that accreditation, the chief of the diplomatic mission cannot take up their role and receive the highest diplomatic status. The role of a head of state in this regard, is codified in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations from 1961, which (as of 2017) 191 sovereign states has ratified.\nHowever, there are provisions in the Vienna Convention that a diplomatic agent of lesser rank, such as a charg\u00e9 d'affaires, is accredited to the minister of foreign affairs (or equivalent).\nThe head of state is often designated the high contracting party in international treaties on behalf of the state; signs them either personally or has them signed in his/her name by ministers (government members or diplomats); subsequent ratification, when necessary, may rest with the legislature. The treaties constituting the European Union and the European Communities are noteworthy contemporary cases of multilateral treaties cast in this traditional format, as are the accession agreements of new member states. However, rather than being invariably concluded between two heads of state, it has become common that bilateral treaties are in present times cast in an intergovernmental format, e.g., between the \"Government of X and the Government of Y\", rather than between \"His Majesty the King of X and His Excellency the President of Y\".\nIn Canada, these head of state powers belong to the monarch as part of the royal prerogative, but the Governor General has been permitted to exercise them since 1947 and has done so since the 1970s.\nMilitary role.\nA head of state is often, by virtue of holding the highest executive powers, explicitly designated as the commander-in-chief of that nation's armed forces, holding the highest office in all military chains of command.\nIn a constitutional monarchy or non-executive presidency, the head of state may de jure hold ultimate authority over the armed forces but will only normally, as per either written law or unwritten convention, exercise their authority on the advice of their responsible ministers: meaning that the de facto ultimate decision making on military manoeuvres is made elsewhere. The head of state will, regardless of actual authority, perform ceremonial duties related to the country's armed forces, and will sometimes appear in military uniform for these purposes; particularly in monarchies where also the monarch's consort and other members of a royal family may also appear in military garb. This is generally the only time a head of state of a stable, democratic country will appear dressed in such a manner, as statesmen and public are eager to assert the primacy of (civilian, elected) politics over the armed forces.\nIn military dictatorships, or governments which have arisen from coups d'\u00e9tat, the position of commander-in-chief is obvious, as all authority in such a government derives from the application of military force; occasionally a power vacuum created by war is filled by a head of state stepping beyond the normal constitutional role, as King Albert I of Belgium did during World War I. In these and in revolutionary regimes, the head of state, and often executive ministers whose offices are legally civilian, will frequently appear in military uniform.\nSome countries with a parliamentary system designate officials other than the head of state with command-in-chief powers.\nThe armed forces of the Communist states are under the absolute control of the Communist party.\nLegislative roles.\nIt is usual that the head of state, particularly in parliamentary systems as part of the symbolic role, is the one who opens the annual sessions of the legislature, e.g. the annual State Opening of Parliament with the Speech from the Throne in Britain. Even in presidential systems the head of state often formally reports to the legislature on the present national status, e.g. the State of the Union address in the United States of America, or the State of the Nation Address in South Africa.\nMost countries require that all bills passed by the house or houses of the legislature be signed into law by the head of state. In some states, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland, the head of state is, in fact, formally considered a tier of the legislature. However, in most parliamentary systems, the head of state cannot refuse to sign a bill, and, in granting a bill their assent, indicate that it was passed in accordance with the correct procedures. The signing of a bill into law is formally known as \"promulgation\". Some monarchical states call this procedure \"royal assent\".\nIn some parliamentary systems, the head of state retains certain discretionary powers in relation to bills to be exercised. They may have authority to veto a bill until the houses of the legislature have reconsidered it, and approved it a second time; reserve a bill to be signed later, or suspend it indefinitely (generally in states with royal prerogative; this power is rarely used); refer a bill to the courts to test its constitutionality; refer a bill to the people in a referendum.\nIf the head of state also serves as the chief executive, the head of state can politically control the necessary executive measures without which a proclaimed law can remain dead letter, sometimes for years or even forever.\nSummoning and dissolving the legislature.\nA head of state is often empowered to summon and dissolve the country's legislature. In most parliamentary systems, this is often done on the advice of the head of government. In some parliamentary systems, and in some presidential systems, however, the head of state may do so on their own initiative. Some states have fixed term legislatures, with no option of bringing forward elections (e.g., Article II, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution). In other systems there are usually fixed terms, but the head of state retains authority to dissolve the legislature in certain circumstances. Where a head of government has lost support in the legislature, some heads of state may refuse a dissolution, where one is requested, thereby forcing the head of government's resignation.\nOfficial title.\nIn a republic, the head of state nowadays usually bears the title of President, but some have or have had other titles. Titles commonly used by monarchs are King/Queen or Emperor/Empress, but also many others: e.g., Grand Duke, Prince, Emir and Sultan.\nThough president and various monarchical titles are most commonly used for heads of state, in some nationalistic regimes the leader adopts, formally or de facto, a unique style simply meaning leader in the national language; e.g., Germany's single national socialist party chief and combined head of state and government, Adolf Hitler, as the \"F\u00fchrer\" between 1934 and 1945.\nIn 1959, when former British crown colony Singapore gained self-government, it adopted the Malay style \"Yang di-Pertuan Negara\" (\"head of state\" in Malay) for its governor (the actual head of state remained the British monarch). The second and last incumbent of the office, Yusof bin Ishak, kept the style at 31 August 1963 unilateral declaration of independence and after 16 September 1963 accession to Malaysia as a state (so now as a constituent part of the federation, a non-sovereign level). After its expulsion from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, Singapore became a sovereign Commonwealth republic and installed Yusof bin Ishak as its first president.\nIn 1959 after the resignation of Vice President Mohammad Hatta, President Sukarno abolished the position and title of vice-president, assuming the positions of Prime Minister and Head of Cabinet. He also proclaimed himself president for life (Indonesian: \"Presiden Seumur Hidup Panglima Tertinggi\"; \"panglima\" meaning \"commander or martial figurehead\", \"tertinggi\" meaning \"highest\"; roughly translated to English as \"Supreme Commander of the Revolution\"). He was praised as \"Paduka Yang Mulia\", a Malay honorific originally given to kings; Sukarno awarded himself titles in that fashion due to his noble ancestry.\nThere are also a few nations in which the exact title and definition of the office of head of state have been vague. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, following the downfall of Chinese President Liu Shaoqi, no successor was named, so the duties of the head of state were transferred collectively to the vice presidents Soong Ching-ling and Dong Biwu, then to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, but Chairman Mao Zedong was still the paramount leader. This situation was later changed: the president of the People's Republic of China is now the state representative but not the head of state. Although the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited power, the symbolic role of a head of state is now generally performed by Xi Jinping, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party (Communist Party leader) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (Supreme Military Command), making him the most powerful person in China.\nIn North Korea, the late Kim Il Sung was named \"Eternal President\" four years after his death and the presidency was abolished. As a result, some of the duties previously held by the president were constitutionally delegated to the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, who performs some of the roles of a head of state, such as accrediting foreign ambassadors and undertaking overseas visits. However, the \"de jure\" role of head of state lies within the President of the State Affairs Commission, currently Kim Jong Un, who as the General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of North Korea, is the most powerful person in North Korea.\nThere is debate as to whether Samoa was an elective monarchy or an aristocratic republic, given the comparative ambiguity of the title \"O le Ao o le Malo\" and the nature of the head of state's office.\nIn some states the office of head of state is not expressed in a specific title reflecting that role, but constitutionally awarded to a post of another formal nature. Colonel Muammar Gaddafi initially ruled as combined head of state and briefly head of government of the Libyan Arab Republic, styled as Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. In 1977, the Libyan \"Jamahiriya\" (\"state of the masses\") replaced the previous republic, and in March 1979 the role of head of state was transferred to the Secretary-General of the General People's Congress (comparable to a Speaker); in practice however Gaddafi remained the \"de facto\" leader as \"Guide of the Revolution\" until his overthrow in 2011.\nSometimes a head of state assumes office as a state becomes legal and political reality, before a formal title for the highest office is determined; thus in the since 1 January 1960 independent republic Cameroon (\"Cameroun\", a former French colony), the first president, Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo, was at first not styled but 'merely' known as (French for \"head of state\") until 5 May 1960. In Uganda, Idi Amin the military leader after the coup of 25 January 1971 was formally styled \"military head of state\" till 21 February 1971, only from then on as regular (but unconstitutional, unelected) president.\nIn certain cases a special style is needed to accommodate imperfect statehood, e.g., the title \"Sadr-i-Riyasat\" was used in Kashmir after its accession to India, and the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasser Arafat, was styled the first \"President of the Palestinian National Authority\" in 1994. In 2008, the same office was restyled as \"President of the State of Palestine\".\nHistorical European perspectives.\nIn medieval Catholic Europe, it was universally accepted that the Pope ranked first among all rulers and was followed by the Holy Roman Emperor. The Pope also had the sole right to determine the precedence of all others. This principle was first challenged by a Protestant ruler, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and was later maintained by his country at the Congress of Westphalia. Great Britain would later claim a break of the old principle for the Quadruple Alliance in 1718. However, it was not until the 1815 Congress of Vienna, when it was decided (due to the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and the weak position of France and other catholic states to assert themselves) and remains so to this day, that all sovereign states are treated as equals, whether monarchies or republics. On occasions when multiple heads of state or their representatives meet, precedence is by the host usually determined in alphabetical order (in whatever language the host determines, although French has for much of the 19th and 20th centuries been the \"lingua franca\" of diplomacy) or by date of accession. Contemporary international law on precedence, built upon the universally admitted principles since 1815, derives from the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (in particular, articles 13, 16.1 and Appendix iii).\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli used \"Prince\" () as a generic term for the ruler, similar to contemporary usage of \"head of state\", in his classical treatise \"The Prince\", originally published in 1532: in fact that particular literary genre it belongs to is known as Mirrors for princes. Thomas Hobbes in his \"Leviathan\" (1651) used the term \"Sovereign\". In Europe the role of a monarchs has gradually transitioned from that of a sovereign ruler\u2014in the sense of Divine Right of Kings as articulated by Jean Bodin, Absolutism and the \"L'etat c'est moi\"\u2014to that of a constitutional monarch; parallel with the conceptual evolution of sovereignty from merely the personal rule of a single person, to Westphalian sovereignty (Peace of Westphalia ending both the Thirty Years' War &amp; Eighty Years' War) and popular sovereignty as in consent of the governed; as shown in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England &amp; Scotland, the French Revolution in 1789, and the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919. The monarchies who survived through this era were the ones who were willing to subject themselves to constitutional limitations.\nInterim and exceptional cases.\nWhenever a head of state is not available for any reason, constitutional provisions may allow the role to fall temporarily to an assigned person or collective body. In a republic, this is - depending on provisions outlined by the constitution or improvised - a vice-president, the chief of government, the legislature or its presiding officer. In a monarchy, this is usually a regent or collegial regency (council). For example, in the United States the vice-president acts when the president is incapacitated, and in the United Kingdom the monarch's powers may be delegated to counselors of state when they are abroad or unavailable. Neither of the two co-princes of Andorra is resident in Andorra; each is represented in Andorra by a delegate, though these persons hold no formal title.\nThere are also several methods of head of state succession in the event of the removal, disability or death of an incumbent head of state.\nIn exceptional situations, such as war, occupation, revolution or a coup d'\u00e9tat, constitutional institutions, including the symbolically crucial head of state, may be reduced to a figurehead or be suspended in favour of an emergency office (such as the original Roman dictator) or eliminated by a new \"provisionary\" regime, such as a collective of the junta type, or removed by an occupying force, such as a military governor (an early example being the Spartan Harmost).\nShared head of multiple states.\nIn early modern Europe, a single person was often monarch simultaneously of separate states. A composite monarchy is a retrospective label for those cases where the states were governed entirely separately. Of contemporary terms, a personal union had less government co-ordination than a real union. One of the two co-princes of Andorra is the president of France.\nSuch arrangements are not to be confused with supranational entities which are not states and are not defined by a common monarchy but may (or not) have a symbolic, essentially protocollary, titled highest office, e.g., Head of the Commonwealth (held by the British monarch, but not legally reserved for it) or 'Head of the Arab Union' (14 February \u2013 14 July 1958, held by the King of Iraq, during its short-lived Hashemite federation with Jordan).\nCommonwealth realms.\nThe Commonwealth realms share a monarch, currently Charles III. In the realms other than the United Kingdom, a governor-general (\"governor general\" in Canada) is appointed by the sovereign, usually on the advice of the relevant prime minister (although sometimes it is based on the result of a vote in the relevant parliament, which is the case for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands), as a representative and to exercise almost all the royal prerogative according to established constitutional authority. Governors-general are frequently treated as heads of state on state and official visits; at the United Nations, they are accorded the status of head of state in addition to the sovereign.\nAn example of a governor-general departing from constitutional convention by acting unilaterally (that is, without direction from ministers, parliament, or the monarch) occurred in 1926, when Canada's governor general refused the head of government's formal advice requesting a dissolution of parliament and a general election. In a letter informing the monarch after the event, the Governor General said: \"I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision.\"\nAnother example occurred when, in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the governor-general unexpectedly dismissed the prime minister in order to break a stalemate between the House of Representatives and Senate over money bills. The governor-general issued a public statement saying he felt it was the only solution consistent with the constitution, his oath of office, and his responsibilities, authority, and duty as governor-general. A letter from the queen's private secretary at the time, Martin Charteris, confirmed that the only person competent to commission an Australian prime minister was the governor-general and it would not be proper for the monarch to personally intervene in matters that the Constitution Act so clearly places within the governor-general's jurisdiction.\nOther Commonwealth realms that are now constituted with a governor-general as the viceregal representative of Charles III are: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nReligious heads of state.\nSince antiquity, various dynasties or individual rulers have claimed the right to rule by divine authority, such as the Mandate of Heaven and the divine right of kings. Some monarchs even claimed divine ancestry, such as Egyptian pharaohs and Sapa Incas, who claimed descent from their respective sun gods and often sought to maintain this bloodline by practising incestuous marriage. In Ancient Rome, during the Principate, the title ('divine') was conferred (notably posthumously) on the emperor, a symbolic, legitimating element in establishing a de facto dynasty.\nChristianity.\nIn Roman Catholicism, the pope was the sovereign pontiff and temporal head of state of the politically important Papal States before Italian unification. The Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy created the state of Vatican City, of which the pope remains head of state. Furthermore, the bishop of Urgell is \"ex officio\" one of the two co-princes of Andorra. The monarch of the United Kingdom is also styled Defender of the Faith and holds the position of Supreme Governor of the Church of England, although this is purely a symbolic role.\nIslam.\nDuring the early period of Islam, caliphs were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of Muhammad. Various political Muslim leaders since have styled themselves \"Caliph\" and served as dynastic heads of state, sometimes in addition to another title, such as the Ottoman Sultan. Historically, some theocratic Islamic states known as \"imamates\" have been led by imams as head of state, such as in what is now Oman, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. The present king of Morocco also claims the title of \"Amir al-Mu'minin\" ('Commander of the Faithful').\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Supreme Leader, at present Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, serves as head of state. The Aga Khans, a unique dynasty of temporal/religious leadership, leading the Nizari offshoot of Shia Islam in Central and South Asia, once ranking among British India's princely states, continue to the present day.\nHinduism.\nIn Hinduism, certain dynasties adopted a title expressing their positions as \"servant\" of a patron deity of the state, but in the sense of a viceroy under an absentee god-king, ruling \"in the name of\" the patron god or goddess, such as Padmanabha Dasa (servant of Vishnu) in the case of the Maharaja of Travancore.\nBuddhism.\nFrom the time of the 5th Dalai Lama until the retirement of the 14th Dalai Lama from political decision-making in 2011, Dalai Lamas were both political and spiritual leaders (\"god-king\") of Tibet.\nOuter Mongolia, the former homeland of the imperial dynasty of Genghis Khan, was another lamaist theocracy from 1585, using various styles, such as tulku. The establishment of the Communist Mongolian People's Republic replaced this regime in 1924.\nMultiple or collective heads of state.\nSometimes multiple individuals are co-equal heads of state, or a corporate person embodies the functions of head of state. In some cases precedence rotates among the members of the collective as the term of office progresses. Diarchy, in which two rulers is the constitutional norm, may be distinguished from a coregency, in which a monarchy is temporarily held by a pair of co-rulers. \nExamples of collective republican systems include nominal triumvirates; the French Directory of the 1790s; the seven-member Swiss Federal Council, where each member acts in turn as President for one year; the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with members from three nations; the two Captains Regent of San Marino, which maintains the tradition of Italian medieval republics that had always had an even number of consuls. Collective heads of state may also be created as part of provisional governments, such as the Transitional Sovereignty Council of Sudan.\nMany pre-modern republics did not have a single chief executive, insofar as such a person might be in a place to make himself tyrant (or worse, king). The Roman Republic's top magistrates were two Consuls who had equal powers and could veto each other's actions. Similarly, Carthage's chief executives were two Shophets. Both the Consuls and the Shophets served one-year terms. Other ancient states had no clear head of state at all; Classical Athens divided its executive power across nine Archons and later many minor offices; this was typical of Greek \"poleis\", which (with the exception of Sparta) were universally republics on a spectrum from oligarchy to Athenian-style direct democracy.\nIn the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (between 1938 and 1989) and the earlier Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Congress of Soviets (between 1922 and 1938) served as the collective head of state. After World War II the Soviet model was subsequently adopted by almost all countries belonged to its sphere of influence. Czechoslovakia remained the only country among them that retained an office of president as a form of a single head of state throughout this period; Poland and Hungary, which initially had western-style constitutions (and therefore, western-style presidencies), switched to the presidium model with the adoption of new Soviet-influenced constitutions; Romania, which was a monarchy before the Soviet takeover, was the only country to move to a unitary presidency from a collective head of state, a move done by dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1974.\nThe National Government of the Republic of China, established in 1928, had a panel of about 40 people as collective head of state. Though beginning that year, a provisional constitution made the Kuomintang the sole government party and the National Government bound to the instructions of the Central Executive Committee of that party.\nLegitimacy.\nThe position of head of state can be established in different ways, and with different sources of legitimacy.\nBy fiction or fiat.\nPower can come from force, but formal legitimacy is often established, even if only by fictitious claims of continuity (e.g., a forged claim of descent from a previous dynasty). There have been cases of sovereignty granted by deliberate act, even when accompanied by orders of succession (as may be the case in a dynastic split). Such grants of sovereignty are usually forced, as is common with self-determination granted after nationalist revolts. This occurred with the last Attalid king of Hellenistic Pergamon, who by testament left his realm to Rome to avoid a disastrous conquest.\nBy divine appointment.\nUnder a theocracy, perceived divine status translated into earthly authority under divine law. This can take the form of supreme divine authority above the state's, granting a tool for political influence to a priesthood. In this way, the Amun priesthood reversed the reforms of Pharaoh Akhenaten after his death. The division of theocratic power can be disputed, as happened between the Pope and Holy Roman Emperor in the investiture conflict when the temporal power sought to control key clergy nominations in order to guarantee popular support, and thereby his own legitimacy, by incorporating the formal ceremony of unction during coronation.\nBy social contract.\nThe notion of a social contract holds that the nation\u2014either the whole people or the electorate\u2014gives a mandate, through acclamation or election.\nBy constitution.\nIndividual heads of state may acquire their position by virtue of a constitution, typically as a transitional measure as part of establishing the new form of government that the constitution decrees: For example, transitional provision 1 of the Constitution of Italy states that once the constitution enters into force, the Provisional Head of State would automatically become President of Italy under it. An extreme example of this approach is Seychelles, where the 1976 Independence Constitution's Article 31 stated that James Mancham would be the first President of Seychelles by name, rather than by the fact he was the prime minister of colonial Seychelles immediately before independence.\nBy hereditary succession.\nThe position of a monarch is usually hereditary, but in constitutional monarchies, there are usually restrictions on the incumbent's exercise of powers and prohibitions on the possibility of choosing a successor by other means than by birth. In a hereditary monarchy, the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary order of succession, usually within one royal family tracing its origin through a historical dynasty or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession. However, many cases of uncertain succession in European history have often led to wars of succession.\nPrimogeniture, in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically \"agnatic primogeniture\" or \"patrilineal primogeniture\" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or head of family, with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their male issue, to the total exclusion of females and descendants through females from succession. This complete exclusion of females from dynastic succession is commonly referred to as application of the Salic law. Another variation on agnatic primogeniture was the so-called semi-Salic law, or \"agnatic-cognatic primogeniture\", which allowed women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line of the particular legislator.\nBefore primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in coregency \u2013 a senior king and a junior king. Examples include Henry the Young King of England and the early Direct Capetians in France.\nSometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line. In some systems a female may rule as monarch only when the male line dating back to a common ancestor is exhausted. In 1980, Sweden, by rewriting its 1810 Act of Succession, became the first monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne. Other European monarchies (such as the Netherlands in 1983, Norway in 1990 and Belgium in 1991) have since followed suit. Similar reforms were proposed in 2011 for the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, which came into effect in 2015 after having been approved by all of the affected nations. Sometimes religion is affected; under the Act of Settlement 1701 all Roman Catholics and all persons who have married Roman Catholics are ineligible to be the British monarch and are skipped in the order of succession.\nIn some monarchies there may be liberty for the incumbent, or some body convening after the death of the monarch, to choose from eligible members of the ruling house, often limited to legitimate descendants of the dynasty's founder. Rules of succession may be further limited by state religion, residency, equal marriage or even permission from the legislature.\nOther hereditary systems of succession included tanistry, which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and Agnatic seniority. In some monarchies, such as Saudi Arabia, succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority).\nBy election.\nElection usually is the constitutional way to choose the head of state of a republic, and some monarchies: either direct election or indirect election by members of the legislature or another elected body (such as the Electoral College in the United States). Two-round systems or instant-runoff voting can reduce votes that could be wasted with the first-past-the-post system.\nBy prerogative.\nExclusive prerogative allows the heads of states of constituent monarchies of a federation to choose the head of state for the federation among themselves, as in the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. The pope, head of state of Vatican City, is chosen by previously appointed cardinals under 80 years of age from among themselves in a conclave. \nBy appointment.\nA head of state can be empowered to designate his successor, such as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth Oliver Cromwell, who was succeeded by his son Richard.\nBy force or revolution.\nA head of state may seize power by force or revolution. This is not the same as the use of force to \"maintain\" power, as is practised by authoritarian or totalitarian rulers. Dictators often use democratic titles, though some proclaim themselves monarchs. Examples of the latter include Emperor Napoleon I of France and King Zog of Albania. In Spain, general Francisco Franco adopted the formal title \"Jefe del Estado\", or Chief of State, and established himself as regent for a vacant monarchy. In some cases, a head of state may be designated or declare themselves president for life, such as Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.\nBy foreign imposition.\nA foreign power can establishing a branch of their own dynasty, or one friendly to their interests. This was often the outcome of the wars fought between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire over control of Armenia, a vital buffer state between the two realms.\nThe Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363 ended with a compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would henceforth sit on the Armenian throne, but his nomination had to be approved by the Roman emperor.\nLoss.\nApart from violent overthrow, a head of state's position can be lost in several ways, including death, another by expiration of the constitutional term of office, abdication, or resignation. In some cases, an abdication cannot occur unilaterally, but comes into effect only when approved by an act of parliament, as in the case of British King Edward VIII. The post can also be abolished by constitutional change; in such cases, an incumbent may be allowed to finish their term. A head of state position may also cease to exist if the state to which it is subservient does.\nHeads of state generally enjoy widest inviolability, although some states allow impeachment, or a similar constitutional procedure by which the highest legislative or judicial authorities are empowered to revoke the head of state's mandate on exceptional grounds. This may be a common crime, a political sin, or an act by which the head of state violates such provisions as an established religion mandatory for the monarch. By similar procedure, an original mandate may be declared invalid.\nFormer heads of state.\nEffigies, memorials and monuments of former heads of state can be designed to represent the history or aspirations of a state or its people, such as the equestrian bronze sculpture of Kaiser Wilhelm I, first Emperor of a unified Germany erected in Berlin at the end of the nineteenth century; or the Victoria Memorial erected in front of Buckingham Palace London, commemorating Queen Victoria and her reign (1837\u20131901), and unveiled in 1911 by her grandson, King George V; or the monument, placed in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata (Calcutta) (1921), commemorating Queen Victoria's reign as Empress of India from 1876. Another, twentieth century, example is the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, a group sculpture constructed (1927\u20131941) on a conspicuous skyline in the Black Hills of South Dakota (40th state of the Union, 1889), in the midwestern United States, representing the territorial expansion of the United States in the first 130 years from its founding, which is promoted as the \"Shrine of Democracy\".\nPersonal influence or privileges.\nFormer presidents of the United States, while holding no political powers per se, sometimes continue to exert influence in national and world affairs.\nA monarch may retain his style and certain prerogatives after abdication, as did King Leopold III of Belgium, who left the throne to his son after winning a referendum which allowed him to retain a full royal household deprived him of a constitutional or representative role. Napoleon transformed the Italian principality of Elba, where he was imprisoned, into a miniature version of his First Empire, with most trappings of a sovereign monarchy, until his \"Cent Jours\" escape and reseizure of power in France convinced his opponents, reconvening the Vienna Congress in 1815, to revoke his gratuitous privileges and send him to die in exile on barren Saint Helena.\nBy tradition, deposed monarchs who have not freely abdicated continue to use their monarchical titles as a courtesy for the rest of their lives. Hence, even after Constantine II ceased to be \"King of the Hellenes\", it is still common to refer to the deposed king and his family as if Constantine II were still on the throne, as many European royal courts and households do in guest lists at royal weddings, as in Sweden in 2010, Britain in 2011 and Luxembourg in 2012. The current Hellenic Republic opposes the right of their deposed monarch and former royal family members to be referred to by their former titles or bearing a surname indicating royal status, and has enacted legislation which hinders acquisition of Greek citizenship unless those terms are met. The former king brought this issue, along with property ownership issues, before the European Court of Human Rights for alleged violations of the European Convention on Human Rights, but lost with respect to the name issue.\nHowever, some other states have no problem with deposed monarchs being referred to by their former title, and even allow them to travel internationally on the state's diplomatic passport.\nThe Italian constitution provides that a former president of the Republic takes the title President Emeritus of the Italian Republic and becomes a senator for life, and enjoys immunity, flight status, official residences and certain privileges.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLists.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;!-- required, or"}
{"id": "13457", "revid": "48296011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13457", "title": "Heredity", "text": "Passing of traits to offspring from the species' parents or ancestor\nHeredity, also called inheritance or biological inheritance, is the passing on of traits from parents to their offspring; either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction, the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information of their parents. Through heredity, variations between individuals can accumulate and cause species to evolve by natural selection. The study of heredity in biology is genetics.\nOverview.\nIn humans, eye color is an example of an inherited characteristic: an individual might inherit the \"brown-eye trait\" from one of the parents. Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype.\nThe complete set of observable traits of the structure and behavior of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits arise from the interaction of the organism's genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin derives from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype: a striking example is people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.\nHeritable traits are known to be passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long polymer that incorporates four types of bases, which are interchangeable. The Nucleic acid sequence (the sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule) specifies the genetic information: this is comparable to a sequence of letters spelling out a passage of text. Before a cell divides through mitosis, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. A portion of a DNA molecule that specifies a single functional unit is called a gene; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. Organisms inherit genetic material from their parents in the form of homologous chromosomes, containing a unique combination of DNA sequences that code for genes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a particular locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.\nHowever, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by multiple interacting genes within and among organisms. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlie some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalization.\nRecent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by direct agency of the DNA molecule. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems that are causally or independently evolving over genes. Research into modes and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance is still in its scientific infancy, but this area of research has attracted much recent activity as it broadens the scope of heritability and evolutionary biology in general. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference, and the three dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance through the process of niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effect that modifies and feeds back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits, group heritability, and symbiogenesis. These examples of heritability that operate above the gene are covered broadly under the title of multilevel or hierarchical selection, which has been a subject of intense debate in the history of evolutionary science.\nRelation to theory of evolution.\nWhen Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution in 1859, one of its major problems was the lack of an underlying mechanism for heredity. Darwin believed in a mix of blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired traits (pangenesis). Blending inheritance would lead to uniformity across populations in only a few generations and then would remove variation from a population on which natural selection could act. This led to Darwin adopting some Lamarckian ideas in later editions of \"On the Origin of Species\" and his later biological works. Darwin's primary approach to heredity was to outline how it appeared to work (noticing that traits that were not expressed explicitly in the parent at the time of reproduction could be inherited, that certain traits could be sex-linked, etc.) rather than suggesting mechanisms.\nDarwin's initial model of heredity was adopted by, and then heavily modified by, his cousin Francis Galton, who laid the framework for the biometric school of heredity. Galton found no evidence to support the aspects of Darwin's pangenesis model, which relied on acquired traits.\nThe inheritance of acquired traits was shown to have little basis in the 1880s when August Weismann cut the tails off many generations of mice and found that their offspring continued to develop tails.\nHistory.\nScientists in Antiquity had a variety of ideas about heredity: Theophrastus proposed that male flowers caused female flowers to ripen; Hippocrates speculated that \"seeds\" were produced by various body parts and transmitted to offspring at the time of conception; and Aristotle thought that male and female fluids mixed at conception. Aeschylus, in 458 BC, proposed the male as the parent, with the female as a \"nurse for the young life sown within her\".\nAncient understandings of heredity transitioned to two debated doctrines in the 18th century. The Doctrine of Epigenesis and the Doctrine of Preformation were two distinct views of the understanding of heredity. The Doctrine of Epigenesis, originated by Aristotle, claimed that an embryo continually develops. The modifications of the parent's traits are passed off to an embryo during its lifetime. The foundation of this doctrine was based on the theory of inheritance of acquired traits. In direct opposition, the Doctrine of Preformation claimed that \"like generates like\" where the germ would evolve to yield offspring similar to the parents. The Preformationist view believed procreation was an act of revealing what had been created long before. However, this was disputed by the creation of the cell theory in the 19th century, where the fundamental unit of life is the cell, and not some preformed parts of an organism. Various hereditary mechanisms, including blending inheritance were also envisaged without being properly tested or quantified, and were later disputed. Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through artificial selection. The inheritance of acquired traits also formed a part of early Lamarckian ideas on evolution.\nDuring the 18th century, Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u20131723) discovered \"animalcules\" in the sperm of humans and other animals. Some scientists speculated they saw a \"little man\" (homunculus) inside each sperm. These scientists formed a school of thought known as the \"spermists\". They contended the only contributions of the female to the next generation were the womb in which the homunculus grew, and prenatal influences of the womb. An opposing school of thought, the ovists, believed that the future human was in the egg, and that sperm merely stimulated the growth of the egg. Ovists thought women carried eggs containing boy and girl children, and that the gender of the offspring was determined well before conception.\nAn early research initiative emerged in 1878 when Alpheus Hyatt led an investigation to study the laws of heredity through compiling data on family phenotypes (nose size, ear shape, etc.) and expression of pathological conditions and abnormal characteristics, particularly with respect to the age of appearance. One of the projects aims was to tabulate data to better understand why certain traits are consistently expressed while others are highly irregular.\nGregor Mendel: father of genetics.\nThe idea of particulate inheritance of genes can be attributed to the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel who published his work on pea plants in 1865. However, his work was not widely known and was rediscovered in 1900. It was initially assumed that Mendelian inheritance only accounted for large (qualitative) differences, such as those seen by Mendel in his pea plants\u00a0\u2013 and the idea of additive effect of (quantitative) genes was not realised until R.A. Fisher's (1918) paper, \"The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance\" Mendel's overall contribution gave scientists a useful overview that traits were inheritable. His pea plant demonstration became the foundation of the study of Mendelian Traits. These traits can be traced on a single locus.\nModern development of genetics and heredity.\nIn the 1930s, work by Fisher and others resulted in a combination of Mendelian and biometric schools into the modern evolutionary synthesis. The modern synthesis bridged the gap between experimental geneticists and naturalists; and between both and palaeontologists, stating that:\nThe idea that speciation occurs after populations are reproductively isolated has been much debated. In plants, polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation. Formulations such as 'evolution consists primarily of changes in the frequencies of alleles between one generation and another' were proposed rather later. The traditional view is that developmental biology ('evo-devo') played little part in the synthesis, but an account of Gavin de Beer's work by Stephen Jay Gould suggests he may be an exception.\nAlmost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times, with varying degrees of success. There is no doubt, however, that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology. It cleared up many confusions, and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research in the post-World War II era.\nTrofim Lysenko however caused a backlash of what is now called Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union when he emphasised Lamarckian ideas on the inheritance of acquired traits. This movement affected agricultural research and led to food shortages in the 1960s and seriously affected the USSR.\nThere is growing evidence that there is transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic changes in humans and other animals.\n*Fragile X syndrome\n*Sickle cell disease\n*Phenylketonuria (PKU)\n*Haemophilia\nTypes.\nThe description of a mode of biological inheritance consists of three main categories:\n1. Number of involved loci\n*Monogenetic (also called \"simple\") \u2013 one locus\n*Oligogenic \u2013 few loci\n*Polygenetic \u2013 many loci\n2. Involved chromosomes\n*Autosomal \u2013 loci are not situated on a sex chromosome\n*Gonosomal \u2013 loci are situated on a sex chromosome\n**X-chromosomal \u2013 loci are situated on the X-chromosome (the more common case)\n**Y-chromosomal \u2013 loci are situated on the Y-chromosome\n*Mitochondrial \u2013 loci are situated on the mitochondrial DNA\n3. Correlation genotype\u2013phenotype\n*Dominant\n*Intermediate (also called \"codominant\")\n*Recessive\n*Overdominant\n*Underdominant\nThese three categories are part of every exact description of a mode of inheritance in the above order. In addition, more specifications may be added as follows:\n4. Coincidental and environmental interactions\n*Penetrance\n**Complete\n**Incomplete (percentual number)\n*Expressivity\n**Invariable\n**Variable\n*Heritability (in polygenetic and sometimes also in oligogenetic modes of inheritance)\n*Maternal or paternal imprinting phenomena (also see epigenetics)\n5. Sex-linked interactions\n*Sex-linked inheritance (gonosomal loci)\n*Sex-limited phenotype expression (e.g., cryptorchism)\n*Inheritance through the maternal line (in case of mitochondrial DNA loci)\n*Inheritance through the paternal line (in case of Y-chromosomal loci)\n6. Locus\u2013locus interactions\n*Epistasis with other loci (e.g., overdominance)\n*Gene coupling with other loci (also see crossing over)\n*Homozygotous lethal factors\n*Semi-lethal factors\nDetermination and description of a mode of inheritance is also achieved primarily through statistical analysis of pedigree data. In case the involved loci are known, methods of molecular genetics can also be employed.\nDominant and recessive alleles.\nAn allele is said to be dominant if it is always expressed in the appearance of an organism (phenotype) provided that at least one copy of it is present. For example, in peas the allele for green pods, \"G\", is dominant to that for yellow pods, \"g\". Thus pea plants with the pair of alleles either \"GG\" (homozygote) or \"Gg\" (heterozygote) will have green pods. The allele for yellow pods is recessive. The effects of this allele are only seen when it is present in both chromosomes, \"gg\" (homozygote). This derives from Zygosity, the degree to which both copies of a chromosome or gene have the same genetic sequence, in other words, the degree of similarity of the alleles in an organism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13459", "revid": "38758555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13459", "title": "H. G. Wells", "text": "English writer (1866\u20131946)\nHerbert George Wells (21 September 1866 \u2013 13 August 1946) was an English writer, prolific in many genres. He wrote more than forty novels and dozens of short stories. His non-fiction output included works of social commentary, politics, history, popular science, satire, biography, and autobiography. Wells is most known today for his groundbreaking science fiction novels; he has sometimes been called the \"father of\u00a0science fiction\", a title that has also been given to\u00a0Jules Verne\u00a0and\u00a0Hugo Gernsback.\nIn addition to his fame as a writer, he was prominent in his lifetime as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. As a futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web. His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering before these subjects were common in the genre. Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the \"Shakespeare of science fiction\", while Charles Fort called him a \"wild talent\".7\nWells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption per work\u00a0\u2013 dubbed \"Wells's law\"\u00a0\u2013 leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 with \"O Realist of the Fantastic!\". His most notable science fiction works include \"The Time Machine\" (1895), which was his first novella, \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\" (1896), \"The Invisible Man\" (1897), \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898), the military science fiction \"The War in the Air\" (1907), and the dystopian \"When the Sleeper Wakes\" (1910). Novels of social realism such as \"Kipps\" (1905) and \"The History of Mr Polly\" (1910), which describe lower-middle-class English life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens,99 but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in \"Tono-Bungay\" (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.\nWells's earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a Darwinian context. He was also an outspoken socialist from a young age, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. In his later years, he wrote less fiction and more works expounding his political and social views, sometimes giving his profession as that of journalist. Wells was a diabetic and co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (Diabetes UK) in 1934.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nHerbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in Bromley, Kent, on 21 September 1866. Called \"Bertie\" by his family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells, a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer and Sarah Neal, a former domestic servant. An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper in part because the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the Kent county team.\nA defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg. To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, and the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his femur. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.\nNo longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations. From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at Hyde's Drapery Emporium in Southsea. His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices, later inspired his novels \"The Wheels of Chance\", \"The History of Mr Polly\", and \"Kipps\", which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.2\nWells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother being a Protestant and his father being a freethinker. When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at Uppark, a country house in West Sussex), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they remained faithful to each other and never divorced. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. However, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including Plato's \"Republic\", Thomas More's \"Utopia\", and the works of Daniel Defoe. When he became the first doyen of science fiction as a distinct genre of fiction, Wells referenced Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" in relation to his works, writing, \"they belong to a class of writing which includes the story of \"Frankenstein\".\"\nTeacher.\nIn October 1879, Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the National School at Wookey in Somerset as a pupil\u2013teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children. In December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby Midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at Midhurst Grammar School, he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883, Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil\u2013teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.\nThe years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point, but his good fortune in securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest. The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, which became part of Imperial College London) in London, studying biology under Thomas Henry Huxley.164 As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887, with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings (a guinea) thanks to his scholarship. This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many working class families had \"round about a pound a week\" as their entire household income), yet in his \"Experiment in Autobiography\" Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.\nHe soon entered the debating society of the school. These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At first approaching the subject through Plato's \"Republic\", he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed Fabian Society and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House, the home of William Morris. He was also among the founders of \"The Science School Journal\", a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel \"The Time Machine\" was published in the journal under the title \"The Chronic Argonauts\". The school year 1886\u201387 was the last year of his studies.164\nDuring 1888, Wells stayed in Stoke-on-Trent, living in Basford. The unique environment of The Potteries was certainly an inspiration. He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that \"the district made an immense impression on me\". The inspiration for some of his descriptions in \"The War of the Worlds\" is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies. His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story \"The Cone\" (1895, contemporaneous with his famous \"The Time Machine\"), set in the north of the city.90\nAfter teaching for some time\u2014he was briefly on the staff of Holt Academy in Wales\u2014Wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors (College of Teachers). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship FCP diplomas from the college. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of London External Programme. In 1889\u201390, he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School in London, where he taught A. A. Milne (whose father ran the school). His first published work was a \"Text-Book of Biology\" in two volumes (1893).\nUpon leaving the Normal School of Science, Wells was left without a source of income. His aunt Mary\u2014his father's sister-in-law\u2014invited him to stay with her for a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel, whom he later courted and married. To earn money, he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as \"The Pall Mall Gazette\", later collecting these in \"Select Conversations with an Uncle\" (1895) and \"Certain Personal Matters\" (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C. Smith, Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so\u00a0. ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It is obvious that many early Wells items have been lost. His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, \"The Time Machine\", in 1895.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1891, Wells married his cousin Isabel Mary Wells (1865\u20131931; from 1902 Isabel Mary Smith). The couple agreed to separate in 1894, when he had fallen in love with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (1872\u20131927; later known as Jane), with whom he moved to Woking, Surrey, in May 1895. They lived in a rented house, 'Lynton' (now No. 141), Maybury Road, in the town centre for just under 18 months and married at St Pancras register office in October 1895.165 His short period in Woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career; while there, he planned and wrote \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"The Time Machine\", completed \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", wrote and published \"The Wonderful Visit\" and \"The Wheels of Chance\", and began writing two other early books, \"When the Sleeper Wakes\" and \"Love and Mr Lewisham\".\nIn late summer 1896, Wells and Jane moved to a larger house in Worcester Park, near Kingston upon Thames, for two years; this lasted until his poor health took them to Sandgate, near Folkestone, where he constructed a large family home, Spade House, in 1901. He had two sons with Jane: George Philip (known as \"Gip\"; 1901\u20131985) and Frank Richard (1903\u20131982)295 (grandfather of film director Simon Wells). Jane died on 6 October 1927, in Dunmow, at the age of 55, which left Wells devastated. She was cremated at Golders Green, with friends of the couple present including George Bernard Shaw.64\nWells had multiple love affairs. Dorothy Richardson was a friend with whom he had a brief affair which led to a pregnancy and miscarriage, in 1907. Wells's wife had been a schoolmate of Richardson. In December 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves, whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society. Amber had married the barrister G. R. Blanco White in July of that year, as co-arranged by Wells. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells's \"sordid intrigue\" with Amber, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel \"The New Machiavelli\" as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. Between 1910 and 1913, novelist Elizabeth von Arnim was one of his mistresses. In 1914, he had a son, Anthony West (1914\u20131987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior. In 1920\u201321, and intermittently until his death, he had a love affair with the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger.\nBetween 1924 and 1933, he partnered with the 22-year-younger Dutch adventurer and writer Odette Keun, with whom he lived in \"Lou Pidou\", a house they built together in Grasse, France. Wells dedicated his longest book to her (\"The World of William Clissold\", 1926). When visiting Maxim Gorky in Russia 1920, he had slept with Gorky's mistress Moura Budberg, then still Countess Benckendorf and 27 years his junior. In 1933, when she left Gorky and emigrated to London, their relationship renewed and she cared for him through his final illness. Wells repeatedly asked her to marry him, but Budberg strongly rejected his proposals.\nIn \"Experiment in Autobiography\" (1934), Wells wrote: \"I was never a great amorist, though I have loved several people very deeply\". David Lodge's novel \"A Man of Parts\" (2011)\u00a0\u2013 a 'narrative based on factual sources' (author's note)\u00a0\u2013 gives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of Wells's relations with the women mentioned above, and others.\nArtist.\nOne of the ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches. One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures \"picshuas\". These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wells scholars for many years, and in 2006, a book was published on the subject.\nWriter.\nSome of his early novels, called \"scientific romances\", invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as \"The Time Machine\", \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"The War of the Worlds\", \"When the Sleeper Wakes\", and \"The First Men in the Moon\". He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including \"Kipps\" and a critique of English culture during the Edwardian period, \"Tono-Bungay\". Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, including, \"The Flowering of the Strange Orchid\", which helped bring the full impact of Darwin's revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public, and was followed by many later successes such as \"The Country of the Blind\" (1904).\nWriter James E. Gunn contended that one of Wells's major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, referring to it as his \"new system of ideas\". Gunn opined that an author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as \"the plausible impossible\" and \"suspension of disbelief\". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle. He explained that while writing \"The Time Machine\", he realized that \"the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts.\" In \"Wells's Law\", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Therefore, as justifications for the impossible, he employed scientific ideas and theories. Wells's best-known statement of the \"law\" appears in his introduction to a collection of his works published in 1934:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDr. Griffin / The Invisible Man is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility, but finds himself unable to reverse the process. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction. \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\" sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. The earliest depiction of uplift, the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature. In \"The First Men in the Moon\" Wells used the idea of radio communication between astronomical objects, a plot point inspired by Nikola Tesla's claim that he had received radio signals from Mars. In addition to science fiction, Wells produced work dealing with mythological beings like an angel in \"The Wonderful Visit\" (1895) and a mermaid in \"The Sea Lady\" (1902).\nThough \"Tono-Bungay\" is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in \"The World Set Free\" (1914), a book dedicated to Frederick Soddy who would receive a Nobel for proving the existence of radioactive isotopes. This book contains what is surely Wells's biggest prophetic \"hit\", with the first description of a nuclear weapon (which he termed \"atomic bombs\"). Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The \"rate\" of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the \"total amount\" released is huge. Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives\u2014but which \"continue to explode\" for days on end. \"Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century, than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible\u00a0... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands\". In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd read \"The World Set Free\" (the same year Sir James Chadwick discovered the neutron), a book which he wrote in his memoirs had made \"a very great impression on me\". In 1934, Szil\u00e1rd took his ideas for a chain reaction to the British War Office and later the Admiralty, assigning his patent to the Admiralty to keep the news from reaching the notice of the wider scientific community. He wrote, \"Knowing what this [a chain reaction] would mean\u2014and I knew it because I had read H.G. Wells\u2014I did not want this patent to become public.\"\nWells also wrote non-fiction. His first non-fiction bestseller was \"Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought\" (1901). When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled \"An Experiment in Prophecy\", and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German militarism, and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950, and averred that \"my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea\").\nHis bestselling two-volume work, \"The Outline of History\" (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received a mixed critical response from professional historians. However, it was very popular amongst the general population and made Wells a rich man. Many other authors followed with \"Outlines\" of their own in other subjects. He reprised his \"Outline\" in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, \"A Short History of the World\", a history book praised by Albert Einstein, and two long efforts, \"The Science of Life\" (1930)\u2014written with his son G. P. Wells and evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley, and \"The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind\" (1931). The \"Outlines\" became sufficiently common for James Thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay, \"An Outline of Scientists\"\u2014indeed, Wells's \"Outline of History\" remains in print with a new 2005 edition, while \"A Short History of the World\" has been re-edited (2006).\nFrom quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of Utopian novels. The first of these was \"A Modern Utopia\" (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with \"no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all\"; two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (\"In the Days of the Comet\" (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in \"The Shape of Things to Come\" (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 Alexander Korda film, \"Things to Come\"). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending World War, with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in \"The Autocracy of Mr Parham\" (1930) and \"The Holy Terror\" (1939). \"Men Like Gods\" (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the literary critic Malcolm Cowley stated: \"by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer\".\nWells contemplates the ideas of nature and nurture and questions humanity in books such as \"The First Men in the Moon\", where nature is completely suppressed by nurture, and \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", where the strong presence of nature represents a threat to a civilized society. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a dystopian novel, \"When the Sleeper Wakes\" (1899, rewritten as \"The Sleeper Awakes\", 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers. \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\" is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.\nWells also wrote the preface for the first edition of W. N. P. Barbellion's diaries, \"The Journal of a Disappointed Man\", published in 1919. Since \"Barbellion\" was the real author's pen name, many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the \"Journal\"; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries.\nIn 1927, a Canadian teacher and writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of \"The Outline of History\" had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript, \"The Web of the World's Romance\", which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada. However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone seen it. The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources. The case went on appeal from the Canadian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court of appeal for the British Empire, which dismissed the appeal in Deeks v Wells. In 2000, A. B. McKillop, a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, \"The Spinster &amp; The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H.G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past\". According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case. In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, professor emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on \"Deeks v. Wells\". This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).\nIn 1933, Wells predicted in \"The Shape of Things to Come\" that the world war he feared would begin in January 1940, a prediction which ultimately came true four months early, in September 1939, with the outbreak of World War II.209 In 1936, before the Royal Institution, Wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopaedia, to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. He also presented on his conception of a world encyclopedia at the World Congress of Universal Documentation in Paris in 1937.\nIn 1938, he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education, \"World Brain\", including the essay \"The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia\".\nPrior to 1933, Wells's books were widely read in Germany and Austria, and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication. By 1933, he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells's books were burned by the Nazi youth in Berlin's Opernplatz, and his works were banned from libraries and book stores. Wells, as president of PEN International (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the Nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-Aryan writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in Ragusa, Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author Ernst Toller be prevented from speaking. Near the end of World War II, Allied forces discovered that the SS had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned Operation Sea Lion, with Wells included in the alphabetical list of \"The Black Book\".\nWartime works.\nSeeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells wrote \"Floor Games\" (1911) followed by \"Little Wars\" (1913), which set out rules for fighting battles with toy soldiers (miniatures). A pacifist prior to the First World War, Wells stated \"how much better is this amiable miniature [war] than the real thing\". According to Wells, the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend Jerome K. Jerome. After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete.\nDuring August 1914, immediately after the outbreak of the First World War, Wells published a number of articles in London newspapers that subsequently appeared as a book entitled \"The War That Will End War\".147 He coined the expression with the idealistic belief that the result of the war would make a future conflict impossible. Wells blamed the Central Powers for the coming of the war and argued that only the defeat of German militarism could bring about an end to war. Wells used the shorter form of the phrase, \"the war to end war\", in \"In the Fourth Year\" (1918), in which he noted that the phrase \"got into circulation\" in the second half of 1914. In fact, it had become one of the most common catchphrases of the war.\nIn 1918, Wells worked for the British War Propaganda Bureau, also called Wellington House. Wells was also one of fifty-three leading British authors \u2014 a number that included Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle \u2014 who signed their names to the \"Authors' Declaration.\" This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain \"could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war\".\nTravels to Russia and the Soviet Union.\nWells visited Russia three times: 1914, 1920 and 1934. After his visits to Petrograd and Moscow, in January 1914, he came back to England, \"a staunch Russophile\". His views were recorded in a newspaper article, \"Russia and England: A Study on Contrasts\", published in \"The Daily News\" on 1 February 1941, and in his novel \"Joan and Peter\" (1918). During his second visit, he saw his old friend Maxim Gorky and with Gorky's help, met Vladimir Lenin. In his book \"Russia in the Shadows\", Wells portrayed Russia as recovering from a total social collapse, \"the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation\". On 23 July 1934, after visiting U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wells went to the Soviet Union and interviewed Joseph Stalin for three hours for the \"New Statesman\" magazine, which was extremely rare at that time. He told Stalin how he had seen 'the happy faces of healthy people' in contrast with his previous visit to Moscow in 1920. However, he also criticised the lawlessness, class discrimination, state violence, and absence of free expression. Stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly. As the chairman of the London-based PEN International, which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated, Wells hoped by his trip to USSR, he could win Stalin over by force of argument. Before he left, he realised that no reform was to happen in the near future.\nFinal years.\nWells's greatest literary output occurred before the First World War, which was lamented by younger authors whom he had influenced. In this connection, George Orwell described Wells as \"too sane to understand the modern world\", and \"since 1920 he has squandered his talents in slaying paper dragons.\" G. K. Chesterton quipped: \"Mr Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message\".\nWells had diabetes, and was a co-founder in 1934 of The Diabetic Association (now Diabetes UK, the leading charity for people with diabetes in the UK).\nOn 28 October 1940, on the radio station KTSA in San Antonio, Texas, Wells took part in a radio interview with Orson Welles, who two years previously had performed a famous radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\". During the interview, by Charles C Shaw, a KTSA radio host, Wells admitted his surprise at the sensation that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his \"more obscure\" titles.\nDeath.\nWells died on 13 August 1946, aged 79, at his home at 13 Hanover Terrace, overlooking Regent's Park, London. In his preface to the 1941 edition of \"The War in the Air\", Wells had stated that his epitaph should be: \"I told you so. You \"damned\" fools.\" Wells's body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 16 August 1946; his ashes were subsequently scattered into the English Channel at Old Harry Rocks, the most eastern point of the Jurassic Coast and about 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) from Swanage in Dorset.\nA commemorative blue plaque in his honour was installed by the Greater London Council at his home in Regent's Park in 1966.\nFuturist.\nA futurist and \"visionary\", Wells foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television, and something resembling the World Wide Web. Asserting that \"Wells's visions of the future remain unsurpassed\", John Higgs, author of \"Stranger Than We Can Imagine: Making Sense of the Twentieth Century\", states that in the late 19th century Wells \"saw the coming century clearer than anyone else. He anticipated wars in the air, the sexual revolution, motorised transport causing the growth of suburbs and a proto-Wikipedia he called the \"world brain\". In his novel \"The World Set Free\", he imagined an \"atomic bomb\" of terrifying power that would be dropped from aeroplanes. This was an extraordinary insight for an author writing in 1913, and it made a deep impression on Winston Churchill.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Author as Cultural Hero: H.G. Wells and George Orwell\".\nIn 2011, Wells was among a group of science fiction writers featured in the \"Prophets of Science Fiction\" series, a show produced and hosted by film director Sir Ridley Scott, which depicts how predictions influenced the development of scientific advancements by inspiring many readers to assist in transforming those futuristic visions into everyday reality. In a 2013 review of \"The Time Machine\" for the \"New Yorker\" magazine, Brad Leithauser writes, \"At the base of Wells's great visionary exploit is this rational, ultimately scientific attempt to tease out the potential future consequences of present conditions\u2014not as they might arise in a few years, or even decades, but millennia hence, epochs hence. He is world literature's Great Extrapolator. Like no other fiction writer before him, he embraced \"deep time\".\nPolitical views.\nWells was a socialist and a member of the Fabian Society. He stood as a Labour Party candidate for London University in the 1922 and 1923 general elections. Wells was a member of The Other Club, a London dining club co-founded by Winston Churchill who was an avid reader of his books; after they first met in 1902, they kept in touch until Wells died in 1946. As a junior minister, Churchill borrowed lines from Wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906; as Prime Minister, the phrase \"the gathering storm\"\u2014used by Churchill to describe the rise of Nazi Germany\u2014had been written by Wells in \"The War of the Worlds\", which depicts an attack on Britain by Martians. Wells's extensive writings on equality and human rights, most notably his most influential work, \"The Rights of Man\" (1940), laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations shortly after his death.\nHis efforts regarding the League of Nations, on which he collaborated on the project with Leonard Woolf with the booklets \"The Idea of a League of Nations\", \"Prolegomena to the Study of World Organization\", and \"The Way of the League of Nations\", became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature. In his last book \"Mind at the End of Its Tether\" (1945), he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He referred to the era between the two World Wars as \"The Age of Frustration\". Wells was initially an opponent of Zionism. In \"In the Days of the Comet\", Jews are described as parasites on European society; however, Wells later became a strong supporter of the establishment of a Jewish state in response to the Holocaust and initiated a correspondence with Chaim Weizmann, the first president of Israel.\nReligious views.\nWells's views on God and religion changed over his lifetime. Early in his life, he distanced himself from Christianity, and later from theism; finally, late in life, he was essentially atheistic. Martin Gardner summarises this progression:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[The younger Wells]\u00a0... did not object to using the word \"God\" provided it did not imply anything resembling human personality. In his middle years Wells went through a phase of defending the concept of a \"finite God,\" similar to the god of such process theologians as Samuel Alexander, Edgar Brightman, and Charles Hartshorne. (He even wrote a book about it called \"God the Invisible King\".) Later Wells decided he was really an atheist.\nIn \"God the Invisible King\" (1917), Wells wrote that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God.\u00a0... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is contradictory to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer suggested that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus. Later in the work, he aligns himself with a \"renascent or modern religion\u00a0... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian\u00a0... [that] he has found growing up in himself\".\nOf Christianity, he said: \"it is not now true for me.\u00a0... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother\u00a0... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie\". Of other world religions, he writes: \"All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.\u00a0... They do not work for me\". In \"The Fate of Homo Sapiens\" (1939), Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating \"there is no creed, no way of living left in the world at all, that really meets the needs of the time... When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.\"\nWells's opposition to organised religion reached a fever pitch in 1943 with publication of his book \"Crux Ansata\", subtitled \"An Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church\" in which he attacked Catholicism, Pope Pius XII and called for the bombing of the city of Rome.\nLiterary influence and legacy.\nThe science fiction historian John Clute describes Wells as \"the most important writer the genre has yet seen\", and notes his work has been central to both British and American science fiction. Science fiction author and critic Algis Budrys said Wells \"remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope, and the despair, which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world\". He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1921, 1932, 1935, and 1946. Wells so influenced real exploration of space that impact craters on Mars and the Moon were named after him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wells's genius was his ability to create a stream of brand new, wholly original stories out of thin air. Originality was Wells's calling card. In a six-year stretch from 1895 to 1901, he produced a stream of what he called \"scientific romance\" novels, which included \"The Time Machine\", \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"The First Men in the Moon\". This was a dazzling display of new thought, endlessly copied since. A book like \"The War of the Worlds\" inspired every one of the thousands of alien invasion stories that followed. It burned its way into the psyche of mankind and changed us all forever.\u2014\u200a\nIn the United Kingdom, Wells's work was a key model for the British \"scientific romance\", and other writers in that mode, such as Olaf Stapledon, J. D. Beresford, S. Fowler Wright, and Naomi Mitchison, all drew on Wells's example. Wells was also an important influence on British science fiction of the period after the Second World War, with Arthur C. Clarke and Brian Aldiss expressing strong admiration for Wells's work. A self-declared fan of Wells, John Wyndham, author of \"The Day of the Triffids\" and \"The Midwich Cuckoos\", echoes Wells's obsession with catastrophe and its aftermath. His early work (pre 1920) made Wells the literary hero of dystopian novelist George Orwell. Among contemporary British science fiction writers, Stephen Baxter, Christopher Priest and Adam Roberts have all acknowledged Wells's influence on their writing; all three are vice-presidents of the H. G. Wells Society. He also had a strong influence on British scientist J. B. S. Haldane, who wrote \"Daedalus; or, Science and the Future\" (1924), \"The Last Judgement\" and \"On Being the Right Size\" from the essay collection \"Possible Worlds\" (1927), and \"Biological Possibilities for the Human Species in the Next Ten Thousand Years\" (1963), which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets. Haldane gave several lectures about these topics which in turn influenced other science fiction writers.\nIn the United States, Hugo Gernsback reprinted most of Wells's work in the pulp magazine \"Amazing Stories\", regarding Wells's work as \"texts of central importance to the self-conscious new genre\". Later American writers such as Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Frank Herbert, Carl Sagan, and Ursula K. Le Guin all recalled being influenced by Wells.\nSinclair Lewis's early novels were strongly influenced by Wells's realistic social novels, such as \"The History of Mr Polly\"; Lewis also named his first son Wells after the author. Lewis nominated H.G. Wells for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932.\nIn an interview with \"The Paris Review\", Vladimir Nabokov described Wells as his favourite writer when he was a boy and \"a great artist\". He went on to cite \"The Passionate Friends\", \"Ann Veronica\", \"The Time Machine\", and \"The Country of the Blind\" as superior to anything else written by Wells's British contemporaries. Nabokov said: \"His sociological cogitations can be safely ignored, of course, but his romances and fantasies are superb.\"\nJorge Luis Borges wrote many short pieces on Wells in which he demonstrates a deep familiarity with much of Wells's work. While Borges wrote several critical reviews, including a mostly negative review of Wells's film \"Things to Come\", he regularly treated Wells as a canonical figure of fantastic literature. Late in his life, Borges included \"The Invisible Man\" and \"The Time Machine\" in his \"Prologue to a Personal Library\", a curated list of 100 great works of literature that he undertook at the behest of the Argentine publishing house Emec\u00e9. Wells also inspired writers of continental European speculative fiction such as Karel \u010capek, Mikhail Bulgakov and Yevgeny Zamyatin.\nIn 2021, Wells was one of six British writers commemorated on a series of UK postage stamps issued by Royal Mail to celebrate British science fiction. Six classic science fiction novels were depicted, one from each author, with \"The Time Machine\" chosen to represent Wells.\nFilm adaptations.\nThe novels and short stories of H.G. Wells have been adapted for cinema. These include \"Island of Lost Souls\" (1932), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933), \"Things to Come\" (1936), \"The Man Who Could Work Miracles\" (1937), \"The War of the Worlds\" (1953), \"The Time Machine\" (1960), \"First Men in the Moon\" (1964), \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" (1977), \" Time After Time \" (1979), \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" (1996), \"The Time Machine\" (2002), \"War of the Worlds\" (2005) and \"War of the Worlds\" (2025).\nLiterary papers.\nIn 1954, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign purchased the H.G. Wells literary papers and correspondence collection. The university's Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library holds the largest collection of Wells manuscripts, correspondence, first editions and publications in the United States. Among these is unpublished material and the manuscripts of such works as \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"The Time Machine\". The collection includes first editions, revisions and translations. The letters contain general family correspondence, communications from publishers, material regarding the Fabian Society, and letters from politicians and public figures, most notably George Bernard Shaw and Joseph Conrad."}

Instead they use the strange term \"interactive multimedia\": this is four syllables longer, and does not express the idea of extending hypertext.\u2014\u200a\nTypes and uses of hypertext.\nHypertext documents can either be static (prepared and stored in advance) or dynamic (continually changing in response to user input, such as dynamic web pages). Static hypertext can be used to cross-reference collections of data in documents, software applications, or books on CDs. A well-constructed system can also incorporate other user-interface conventions, such as menus and command lines. Links used in a hypertext document usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination document. A lesser known feature is StretchText, which expands or contracts the content in place, thereby giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document. Some implementations support transclusion, where text or other content is included by reference and automatically rendered in place.\nHypertext can be used to support very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross-referencing. The most famous implementation of hypertext is the World Wide Web, written in the final months of 1990 and released on the Internet in 1991.\nHistory.\nIn 1941, Jorge Luis Borges published \"The Garden of Forking Paths\", a short story that is often considered an inspiration for the concept of hypertext.\nIn 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote an article in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" called \"As We May Think\", about a futuristic proto-hypertext device he called a Memex. A Memex would hypothetically store \u2014 and record \u2014 content on reels of microfilm, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, and stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the Memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails. Because the Memex was never implemented and could only link content in a relatively crude fashion \u2014 by creating chains of entire microfilm frames \u2014 the Memex is regarded only as a proto-hypertext device, but it is fundamental to the history of hypertext because it directly inspired the invention of hypertext by Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart.\nIn 1965, Ted Nelson coined the terms 'hypertext' and 'hypermedia' as part of a model he developed for creating and using linked content (first published reference 1965). He later worked with Andries van Dam to develop the Hypertext Editing System (text editing) in 1967 at Brown University. It was implemented using the terminal IBM 2250 with a light pen which was provided as a pointing device. By 1976, its successor FRESS was used in a poetry class in which students could browse a hyperlinked set of poems and discussion by experts, faculty and other students, in what was arguably the world's first online scholarly community which van Dam says \"foreshadowed wikis, blogs and communal documents of all kinds\". Ted Nelson said in the 1960s that he began implementation of a hypertext system he theorized, which was named Project Xanadu, but his first and incomplete public release was finished much later, in 1998. During this period, Nelson also proposed using Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s 1962 novel \"Pale Fire\" as part of a demonstration to IBM, intending to show how hypertext could support complex, non-linear forms of literary analysis. The novel, structured as a long poem with an extensive, self-referential commentary and index, embodied the principles of associative linking and user-directed navigation that Nelson believed defined hypertext. Its layered design enabled readers to follow multiple interpretive paths through the text, resembling the branching structures later implemented in digital hypertext systems. However, IBM chose a more technically conventional presentation, and the literary demonstration was never realized.\nDouglas Engelbart independently began working on his NLS system in 1962 at Stanford Research Institute, although delays in obtaining funding, personnel, and equipment meant that its key features were not completed until 1968. In December of that year, Engelbart demonstrated a 'hypertext' (meaning editing) interface to the public for the first time, in what has come to be known as \"The Mother of All Demos\".\nIn 1971 a system called Scrapbook, produced by David Yates and his team at the UK's National Physical Laboratory, went live. It was an information storage and retrieval system that included what would now be called word processing, e-mail and hypertext.\nZOG, an early hypertext system, was developed at Carnegie Mellon University during the 1970s, used for documents on Nimitz class aircraft carriers, and later evolving as KMS (Knowledge Management System).\nThe first hypermedia application is generally considered to be the Aspen Movie Map, implemented in 1978. The Movie Map allowed users to arbitrarily choose which way they wished to drive in a virtual cityscape, in two seasons (from actual photographs) as well as 3-D polygons.\nIn France, the launch of the Minitel system in 1982 provided widespread public access to interactive digital content via telephone lines and videotex terminals. Minitel allowed users to search directories, make purchases, read news, and access databases using a system of on-screen menus and numbered links. Although it was based on videotex rather than the dynamic linking protocols of later hypertext systems, Minitel introduced many users to the practice of navigating non-linear networks of information. Its use of branching menus and user-selected paths anticipated key aspects of hypertext interaction, particularly the idea of browsing through interconnected data by following associative or logical links. As one of the earliest large-scale deployments of an online information service, Minitel helped familiarize the public with interactive computing and laid cultural groundwork for the broader adoption of hypertext and web technologies in the 1990s.\nBetween 1984 and 1987 Frank Halasz, Randall Trigg, and Thomas Moran developed NoteCards at Xerox PARC. This early hypertext system was designed to support information analysis and idea processing, employing a central metaphor of \"notecards\" which operated as discrete units of information that could contain text or graphics. These notecards could be interconnected through typed, directional links, enabling users to create semantically distinct relationships. A key component of NoteCards was the \"Browser card,\" which provided a graphical overview of the structure of linked notecards, facilitating navigation within complex information networks.\nOperating on Xerox Lisp machines, NoteCards' primary impact was within the research community rather than as a commercial product. Its most significant contribution to the field of hypertext is often attributed to the insights gained from its use, Halasz identified critical challenges such as search and query in large hypertexts, composite structures, versioning, and collaborative work.\nIn 1980, Tim Berners-Lee created ENQUIRE, an early hypertext database system somewhat like a wiki but without hypertext punctuation, which was not invented until 1987. The early 1980s also saw a number of experimental \"hyperediting\" functions in word processors and hypermedia programs, many of whose features and terminology were later analogous to the World Wide Web. Guide, the first significant hypertext system for personal computers, was developed by Peter J. Brown at the University of Kent in 1982.\nIn 1980, Roberto Busa, an Italian Jesuit priest and one of the pioneers in the usage of computers for linguistic and literary analysis, published the \"Index Thomisticus\", as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. Sponsored by the founder of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, the project lasted about 30 years (1949\u20131980), and eventually produced the 56 printed volumes of the \"Index Thomisticus\" the first important hypertext work about Saint Thomas Aquinas books and of a few related authors.\nIn 1983, Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland Human - Computer Interaction Lab led a group that developed the HyperTies system that was commercialized by Cognetics Corporation. They studied many designs before adopting the https://. Hyperties was used to create the July 1988 issue of the Communications of the ACM as a hypertext document and then the first commercial electronic book \"Hypertext Hands-On!\".\nIn August 1987, Apple Computer released HyperCard for the Macintosh line at the MacWorld convention. Its impact, combined with interest in Peter J. Brown's GUIDE (marketed by OWL and released earlier that year) and Brown University's Intermedia, led to broad interest in and enthusiasm for hypertext, hypermedia, databases, and new media in general. The first ACM Hypertext (hyperediting and databases) academic conference took place in November 1987, in Chapel Hill NC, where many other applications, including the branched literature writing software Storyspace, were also demonstrated.\nMeanwhile, Nelson (who had been working on and advocating his Xanadu system for over two decades) convinced Autodesk to invest in his revolutionary ideas. The project continued at Autodesk for four years, but no product was released.\nIn 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, then a scientist at CERN, proposed and later prototyped a new hypertext project in response to a request for a simple, immediate, information-sharing facility, to be used among physicists working at CERN and other academic institutions. He called the project \"WorldWideWeb\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1992, Lynx was born as an early Internet web browser. Its ability to provide hypertext links within documents that could reach into documents anywhere on the Internet began the creation of the Web on the Internet.\nAs new web browsers were released, traffic on the World Wide Web quickly exploded from only 500 known web servers in 1993 to over 10,000 in 1994. As a result, all previous hypertext systems were overshadowed by the success of the Web, even though it lacked many features of those earlier systems, such as integrated browsers/editors (a feature of the original WorldWideWeb browser, which was not carried over into most of the other early Web browsers).\nImplementations.\nBesides the already mentioned Project Xanadu, Hypertext Editing System, NLS, HyperCard, and World Wide Web, there are other noteworthy early implementations of hypertext, with different feature sets:\nAcademic conferences.\nAmong the top academic conferences for new research in hypertext is the annual ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media. The Electronic Literature Organization hosts annual conferences discussing hypertext fiction, poetry and other forms of electronic literature. Although not exclusively about hypertext, the World Wide Web series of conferences, organized by IW3C2, also include many papers of interest. There is a list on the Web with links to all conferences in the series.\nHypertext fiction.\nHypertext writing has developed its own style of fiction, coinciding with the growth and proliferation of hypertext development software and the emergence of electronic networks. Hypertext fiction is one of earliest genres of electronic literature, or literary works that are designed to be read in digital media. Two software programs specifically designed for literary hypertext, \"Storyspace\" and Intermedia, became available in the 1990s. Judy Malloy's \"Uncle Roger\" (1986) and Michael Joyce's \"afternoon, a story\" (1987) are generally considered the first works of hypertext fiction.\nAn advantage of writing a narrative using hypertext technology is that the meaning of the story can be conveyed through a sense of spatiality and perspective that is arguably unique to digitally networked environments. An author's creative use of nodes, the self-contained units of meaning in a hypertextual narrative, can play with the reader's orientation and add meaning to the text.\nOne of the most successful computer games, \"Myst\", was first written in HyperCard. The game was constructed as a series of Ages, each Age consisting of a separate HyperCard stack. The full stack of the game consists of over 2500 cards. In some ways, \"Myst\" redefined interactive fiction, using puzzles and exploration as a replacement for hypertextual narrative.\nCritics of hypertext claim that it inhibits the old, linear, reader experience by creating several different tracks to read on. This can also been seen as contributing to a postmodernist fragmentation of worlds. In some cases, hypertext may be detrimental to the development of appealing stories (in the case of hypertext Gamebooks), where ease of linking fragments may lead to non-cohesive or incomprehensible narratives. However, they do see value in its ability to present several different views on the same subject in a simple way. This echoes the arguments of 'medium theorists' like Marshall McLuhan who look at the social and psychological impacts of the media. New media can become so dominant in public culture that they effectively create a \"paradigm shift\" as people have shifted their perceptions, understanding of the world, and ways of interacting with the world and each other in relation to new technologies and media. So hypertext signifies a change from linear, structured and hierarchical forms of representing and understanding the world into fractured, decentralized and changeable media based on the technological concept of hypertext links.\nIn the 1990s, women and feminist artists took advantage of hypertext and produced dozens of works. Linda Dement's \"Cyberflesh Girlmonster\" a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women's body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes. Caitlin Fisher's award-winning online hypertext novella These Waves of Girls (2001) is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. Adrienne Eisen (pen name for Penelope Trunk) wrote hypertexts that were subversive narrative journeys into the mind of a woman whose erotic encounters were charged with a post-feminist satirical edge that cuts deep into the American psyche.\nForms.\nThere are various forms of hypertext fiction, each of which is structured differently.

His published works include more than 1,700 short stories, novellas, screenplays, comic-book scripts, teleplays, essays, and a wide range of criticism covering literature, film, television, and print media.\nSome of his best-known works include the 1967 \"\" episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\", which is regarded as one of the best episodes in the \"Star Trek\" franchise (he subsequently wrote a book about the experience that includes his original teleplay), his \"A Boy and His Dog\" cycle (which was made into a film), and his short stories \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" (later adapted by Ellison into a video game) and \"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\". He was also editor and anthologist for \"Dangerous Visions\" (1967) and \"Again, Dangerous Visions\" (1972). Ellison won numerous awards, including multiple Hugos, Nebulas, and Edgars.\nBiography.\nEarly life and career.\nEllison was born to a Jewish family in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 27, 1934, the son of Serita (n\u00e9e Rosenthal) and Louis Laverne Ellison, a dentist and jeweler. His older sister Beverly was born in 1926. She died in 2010 without having spoken to him since their mother's funeral in 1976. Some time after Beverly's birth, his family moved to Painesville, Ohio, but returned to Cleveland in 1949, following his father's death. Ellison frequently ran away from home. In an interview with Tom Snyder, he would later claim it was due to discrimination by his high school peers. According to Ellison, by age 18 he had completed a series of odd jobs as a \"tuna fisherman off the coast of Galveston, itinerant crop-picker down in New Orleans, hired gun for a wealthy neurotic, nitroglycerine truck driver in North Carolina, short-order cook, cab driver, lithographer, book salesman, floorwalker in a department store, door-to-door brush salesman, and as a youngster, an actor in several productions at the Cleveland Play House\". In 1947, a fan letter he wrote to \"Real Fact Comics\" became his first published writing.\nEllison attended Ohio State University for 18 months (1951\u201353) before being expelled for verbally abusing a creative writing professor. Over the next 20 or so years he claimed to have sent the professor a copy of every story he published.\nEllison published two serialized stories in the \"Cleveland News\" during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. During this period, Ellison was an active member of science fiction fandom. He published his own science fiction fanzines, such as \"Dimensions,\" which had previously been the \"Bulletin of the Cleveland Science Fantasy Society\" and later \"Science Fantasy Bulletin\". Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 and lived with Robert Silverberg as they both pursued writing careers. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. The short stories collected as \"Sex Gang\" \u2014 which Ellison described in a 2012 interview as \"mainstream erotica\"\u2014date from this period.\nHe served in the U.S. Army from 1957 to 1959. His first novel, \"Web of the City\", was published during his military service in 1958, and he said that he had written the bulk of it while undergoing basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. He served in the Public Information Office at Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he wrote articles and reviews for the post's weekly newspaper.\nAfter leaving the army, he relocated to Chicago, where he edited \"Rogue\" magazine.\nHollywood and beyond.\nEllison moved to California in 1962 and began selling his writing to Hollywood. Ellison sold scripts to many television shows: \"Burke's Law\" (4 episodes), \"Route 66,\" \"The Outer Limits\", \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\", \"\", \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" (2 episodes), \"Cimarron Strip\" and \"The Flying Nun\".\nEllison's screenplay for the \"Star Trek\" episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" is often considered the best of the 79 episodes in the series.\nHe co-wrote the screenplay for \"The Oscar\" (1966), starring Stephen Boyd and Tony Bennett.\nIn 1965, he participated in the second and third Selma to Montgomery marches, led by Martin Luther King Jr.\nIn 1966, in an article that \"Esquire\" magazine later named as the best magazine piece ever written, the journalist Gay Talese wrote a profile of Frank Sinatra. The article, entitled \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\", briefly describes a verbal clash between Sinatra and Ellison, in which the crooner took exception to Ellison's boots during a billiards game Ellison was playing with Omar Sharif, Leo Durocher and Peter Falk.\nEllison was hired as a writer for Walt Disney Studios, but was fired on his first day after Roy O. Disney overheard him in the studio commissary joking about making a pornographic animated film featuring Disney characters.\nEllison continued to publish short fiction and nonfiction pieces in various publications, including some of his best known stories. \"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\" (1965) is a celebration of civil disobedience against repressive authority. \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" (1967) is a story where five humans are tormented by an all-knowing computer throughout eternity. The story was the basis of a 1995 computer game; Ellison participated in the game's design and provided the voice of the god-computer AM. Another story, \"A Boy and His Dog\", examines the nature of friendship and love in a violent, post-apocalyptic world and was made into the 1975 film of the same name, starring Don Johnson.\nIn 1967, Ellison edited the \"Dangerous Visions\" collection, which attracted a \"special citation at the 26th World SF Convention for editing 'the most significant and controversial SF book published in 1967.'\" In his introduction Isaac Asimov described it as epitomising a \"second revolution\" in science fiction as \"science receded and modern fictional techniques came to the fore.\" \nFrom 1968 to 1970, Ellison wrote a regular column on television for the \"Los Angeles Free Press\". Titled \"The Glass Teat\", Ellison's column examined television's impact on the politics and culture of the time, including its presentations of sex, politics, race, the Vietnam War, and violence. The essays were collected in two anthologies, \"The Glass Teat: Essays of Opinion on Television\" followed by \"The Other Glass Teat\".\nEllison served as creative consultant to the 1980s version of \"The Twilight Zone\" science fiction TV series and \"Babylon 5\". As a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), he had voice-over credits for shows, including \"The Pirates of Dark Water\", \"Mother Goose and Grimm\", \"Space Cases\", \"Phantom 2040\", and \"Babylon 5\", and made an onscreen appearance in the \"Babylon 5\" episode \"The Face of the Enemy\".\nA frequent guest on the Los Angeles science fiction/fantasy culture radio show \"Hour 25,\" hosted by Mike Hodel, Ellison took over as host when Hodel died. Ellison's tenure was from May 1986 to June 1987.\nEllison's short story \"The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore\" (1992) was selected for inclusion in the 1993 edition of \"The Best American Short Stories\".\nEllison, as an audio actor/reader, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children twice and won several Audie Awards.\nIn 2014, Ellison made a guest appearance on the album \"Finding Love in Hell\" by the stoner rock band Leaving Babylon, reading his piece \"The Silence\" (originally published in \"Mind Fields\") as an introduction to the song \"Dead to Me.\"\nEllison's official website, harlanellison.com, was launched in 1995 as a fan page; for several years, Ellison was a regular poster in its discussion forum.\nEllison's voice is one of 80 used in the NPRmageddon podcast (which is unrelated to National Public Radio), which appeared after his death.\nPersonal life and death.\nEllison married five times; each relationship ended within a few years, except the last. His first wife was Charlotte Stein, whom he married in 1956. They divorced in 1960, and he later described the marriage as \"four years of hell as sustained as the whine of a generator.\" Later that year he married Billie Joyce Sanders; they divorced in 1963. His 1966 marriage to Loretta Patrick lasted only seven weeks. In 1976, he married Lori Horowitz. He was 41 and she was 19, and he later said of the marriage, \"I was desperately in love with her, but it was a stupid marriage on my part.\" They were divorced after eight months. He briefly had a relationship with actress Grace Lee Whitney, allegedly ending it when he caught her smoking cannabis in his house. He and Susan Toth married in 1986, and they remained together, living in Sherman Oaks, until his death 32 years later. He referred to his home as \"The Lost Aztec Temple of Mars\". Susan died in August 2020, age 60.\nEllison was a longtime friend of actor Robert Culp, who he had in mind when writing the script for the \"The Outer Limits\" episode \"Demon with a Glass Hand\".\nEllison described himself as a Jewish atheist.\nIn 1994, he had a heart attack and was hospitalized for quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery. From 2010, he received treatment for clinical depression.\nIn September 2007, Ellison attended the Midwestern debut of the documentary about his life, \"Dreams with Sharp Teeth\", at the Cleveland Public Library in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. This would be Ellison's last public appearance in his hometown.\nOn about October 10, 2014, Ellison had a stroke. Although his speech and cognition were unimpaired, he suffered paralysis on his right side, for which he was expected to spend several weeks in physical therapy before being released from the hospital.\nEllison died in his sleep at his home in Los Angeles on the morning of June 28, 2018. His literary estate is currently executed by \"Babylon 5\" creator J. Michael Straczynski.\nPseudonyms.\nEllison on occasion used the pseudonym Cordwainer Bird to alert members of the public to situations in which he felt his creative contribution to a project had been mangled by others, beyond repair, typically Hollywood producers or studios (see also Alan Smithee). The first such work to which he signed the name was \"The Price of Doom\", an episode of \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" (though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits). An episode of \"Burke's Law\" (\"Who Killed Alex Debbs?\") credited to Ellison contains a \"character\" given this name, played by Sammy Davis Jr.\nThe \"Cordwainer Bird\" moniker is a tribute to fellow science fiction writer Paul M. A. Linebarger, better known by his pen name, Cordwainer Smith. The origin of the word \"cordwainer\" is \"shoemaker\" (from working with shell cordovan leather for shoes). The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the pulp author. Ellison said, in interviews and in his writing, that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean \"a shoemaker for birds\". Since he used the pseudonym mainly for works from which he wanted to distance himself, it may be understood to mean that \"this work is for the birds\" or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird. Stephen King once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of \"the bird\" (given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled \"Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto\", describing his experience with the \"Starlost\" television series).\nThe Bird moniker became a character in one of Ellison's own stories. In his 1978 book \"Strange Wine\", Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer wrote Cordwainer into the Wold Newton family that the latter writer had developed. The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage, The Shadow, Tarzan, and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept, resulting in \"The New York Review of Bird\", in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York literary establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of the same.\nOther pseudonyms Ellison used during his career include Jay Charby, Sley Harson, Ellis Hart, John Magnus, Paul Merchant, Pat Roeder, Ivar Jorgenson, Derry Tiger, Harlan Ellis and Jay Solo.\nControversies and disputes.\nTemperament.\nEllison had a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative. He generally agreed with this assessment, and a dust jacket from one of his books described him as \"possibly the most contentious person on Earth.\" Ellison filed numerous grievances and attempted lawsuits; during a contract dispute with Signet/NAL Books over binding cigarette ads into one of his paperbacks, he sent them dozens of bricks postage due, followed by a dead gopher. In an October 2017 piece in \"Wired\", Ellison was dubbed \"Sci-Fi's Most Controversial Figure.\"\nAccording to Ellison, his impending trip to Israel was cancelled by its sponsor, the US Information Agency, after his irreverent comment on the Palestine-Israel situation to \"The Jerusalem Post\".\nAt Stephen King's request, Ellison provided a description of himself and his writing in \"Danse Macabre\" (1981): \"My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. Gadfly is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrator or critic with umbrage will say of my work, 'He only wrote that to shock.' I smile and nod. Precisely.\"\nHealth issues.\nEllison suffered health issues regularly through his life, including severe depression toward the end, some of which he believed was Epstein-Barr virus and chronic fatigue syndrome, the latter two of which he believed he had had for 40-50 years. A few years before his death, Straczynski convinced him to seek psychiatric diagnosis for the depression, resulting in a diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder; he commented, \"Once you know he was bipolar, a lot of things that don't make sense suddenly make sense.\" The treatment \"had a salutary effect for a while, until the stroke hit\". Straczynski wrote a more detailed account of Ellison's struggles with mental illness, published in the posthumous \"Last Dangerous Visions\".\n\"Star Trek\".\nEllison repeatedly criticized how \"Star Trek\" creator and producer Gene Roddenberry (and others) rewrote his original script for the 1967 episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". Despite his objections, Ellison kept his own name on the shooting script instead of using \"Cordwainer Bird\" to indicate displeasure (see above).\nEllison's original script was first published in the 1976 anthology \"Six Science Fiction Plays\", edited by Roger Elwood. The aired version was adapted for the \"Star Trek\" Fotonovel series in 1977.\nAt the start of an interview with Ellison entitled \"Encounter with an Ellison\", Sandra Cawson was interrupted when she said \"Mr Ellison\", and was told to address him as \"Harlan\". The interviewee stated \"Mr Ellison was my father. He died in 1949\". Cawson described the interviewee's home as a \"calculated fall down a rabbit hole\" and the author himself as \"outgoing, charming, hospitable\". In the course of the interview Cawson was given a long explanation about the process of television in omitting \"small touches\" and \"special scenes\" in favour of \"straight action sequences\" which \"diminished the value of the script\"\nIn 1995, Borderlands Press published \"The City on the Edge of Forever\", with nearly 300 pages comprising an essay by Ellison, four versions of the teleplay, and eight \"Afterwords\" contributed by other parties. He greatly expanded the introduction for the paperback edition, in which he explained what he called a \"fatally inept\" treatment.\nBoth versions of the script won awards: Ellison's original script won the 1968 Writers Guild Award for best episodic drama in television, while the shooting script won the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.\nOn March 13, 2009, Ellison sued CBS Paramount Television, seeking payment of 25 percent of net receipts from merchandising, publishing, and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also names the Writers Guild of America for allegedly failing to act on Ellison's behalf. On October 23, 2009, \"Variety\" magazine reported that a settlement had been reached.\nVietnam War opposition and AggieCon I.\nEllison was among those who in 1968 signed an anti-Vietnam War advertisement in \"Galaxy Science Fiction\". In 1969, Ellison was Guest of Honor at Texas A&amp;M University's first science fiction convention, AggieCon, where he reportedly referred to the university's Corps of Cadets as \"America's next generation of Nazis\", inspired in part by the Vietnam War. Although the university was no longer solely a military school (from 1965), the student body was predominantly made up of cadet members. Between Ellison's anti-military remarks and a food fight that broke out in the ballroom of the hotel where the gathering was held (although, according to Ellison in 2000, the food fight actually started in a Denny's because the staff disappeared and they could not get their check), the school's administration almost refused to approve the science fiction convention the next year and no guest of honor was invited for the next two AggieCons. Ellison was subsequently invited back as Guest of Honor for AggieCon V (1974).\n\"The Last Dangerous Visions\".\n\"The Last Dangerous Visions\" (TLDV), the third volume of Ellison's anthology series, was originally announced for publication in 1973, but not published until October 2024, six years after Ellison died. Nearly 150 writers, many now also dead, had submitted works for the volume. In 1993, Ellison threatened to sue the New England Science Fiction Association (NESFA) for publishing \"Himself in Anachron\", a short story written by Cordwainer Smith and originally sold by his widow to Ellison for the anthology. The NESFA later reached an amicable settlement after it was revealed that the story contract had expired, allowing them to legally acquire it for publication.\nBritish science fiction author Christopher Priest criticized Ellison's editorial practices in an article entitled \"The Book on the Edge of Forever\", later expanded into a book. Priest documented a half-dozen unfulfilled promises by Ellison to publish \"TLDV\" within a year of the statement. Priest claims that he submitted a story at Ellison's request, which Ellison retained for several months until Priest withdrew the story and demanded that Ellison return the manuscript. Ellison was incensed by \"The Book on the Edge of Forever\" and, personally or by proxy, threatened Priest on numerous occasions after its publication.\nIn November 2020, the executor of the Harlan Ellison estate, J. Michael Straczynski, announced on Patreon that he was proceeding with the final preparations for the publication of TLDV with the proceeds to go to the Harlan and Susan Ellison Trust. The book was expected to be published in April 2021, as significant publisher interest was expressed.\nChristopher Priest was unimpressed, saying that Straczynski was \"in the same sort of unenviable position as Trump's caddie\", but as an experienced professional would possibly work something out. He added, \"I kind of lost interest in all that years ago. Ellison clearly did too, along with everyone else. (Although I gather he went on with his magical thinking if anyone asked when he was going to deliver.) Many of the stories were withdrawn, because Ellison acted like a dick. Of the ones that remain, most of them are by writers who are now deceased, so the rights have expired and the estates would have to be traced. A lot of the writers have disowned their stories as juvenilia, or outdated, or simply because Ellison was acting like a dick.\"\nDespite early hopes of a 2021 release for TLDV, 2021 came and went with no book. An October 2021 'progress report' from Straczynski revealed that the book was still in preparation. On May 2, 2022, Straczynski announced that the book would be published in 2023. On July 10, 2022, Straczynski announced on Twitter that \"The Last Dangerous Visions\" would be published on September 1, 2024, by Blackstone Publishers. The book was finally published on October 1, 2024, after half a century.\n\"I, Robot\".\nShortly after the release of \"Star Wars\" (1977), Ben Roberts contacted Ellison to develop a script based on Isaac Asimov's \"I, Robot\" short story collection for Warner Bros.; Ellison and Asimov had been long-time friends, so Ellison may be presumed to have attached particular significance to the project. In a meeting with the Head of Production at Warner Bros., Robert Shapiro, Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it and accused him of having the \"intellectual and cranial capacity of an artichoke\". Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors. After a change in studio heads, Warner allowed Ellison's script to be serialized in \"Asimov's Science Fiction\" magazine and published in book form. The 2004 film \"I, Robot\", starring Will Smith, has no connection to Ellison's script.\nAllegations of assault on Charles Platt.\nIn 1985, Ellison allegedly publicly assaulted author, journalist and computer programmer Charles Platt at the Nebula Awards banquet. Platt did not pursue legal action against Ellison and the two men later signed a \"non-aggression pact\", promising never to discuss the incident again nor to have any contact with one another. Platt claims that Ellison often publicly boasted about the incident.\nSupport of Ed Kramer.\nEllison voiced strong support for Ed Kramer, founder of Dragon Con, after Kramer was accused of sexual abuse of children in 2000. Ellison and others disputed the evidence against Kramer, and also alleged Kramer was being held in jail in violation of his right to a speedy trial.\nWhen writer Nancy A. Collins spoke up against Kramer, Ellison led a long-standing feud against her before Kramer entered an Alford plea in 2013.\n2006 Hugo Awards ceremony.\nEllison was presented with a special committee award at the 2006 Hugo Awards ceremony. When Ellison got to the podium, presenter Connie Willis asked him \"Are you going to be good?\" When she asked the question a second time, Ellison put the microphone in his mouth, to the crowd's laughter. He then placed his hand on her breast during an embrace. Ellison subsequently complained that Willis refused to acknowledge his apology.\nLawsuit against Fantagraphics.\nOn September 20, 2006, Ellison sued comic book and magazine publisher Fantagraphics, stating they had defamed him in their book \"Comics As Art (We Told You So)\". The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics' industry news magazine, \"The Comics Journal\". In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer Michael Fleisher, calling him \"bugfuck\" and \"derange-o\". Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9, 1986.\nEllison, after reading unpublished drafts of the book on Fantagraphics's website, believed that he had been defamed by several anecdotes related to this incident. He sued in the Superior Court for the State of California, in Santa Monica. Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed. In their motion to dismiss, Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes. On February 12, 2007, the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics' anti-SLAPP motion for dismissal. On June 29, 2007, Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved pending Fantagraphics' removal of all references to the case from their website. No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17, 2007.\nCopyright suits.\nIn a 1980 lawsuit against ABC and Paramount Pictures, Ellison and Ben Bova claimed that the TV series \"Future Cop\" was based on their short story \"Brillo\", winning a $337,000 judgement.\nEllison alleged that James Cameron's film \"The Terminator\" drew from material from an episode of the original \"Outer Limits\" which Ellison had scripted, \"Soldier\" (1964). Hemdale, the production company and the distributor Orion Pictures, settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and added a credit to the film which acknowledged Ellison's work. Cameron objected to this acknowledgement and has since labeled Ellison's claim a \"nuisance suit\". Some accounts of the settlement state that another \"Outer Limits\" episode written by Ellison, \"Demon with a Glass Hand\" (1964), was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison stated that \"\"Terminator\" was not stolen from 'Demon with a Glass Hand', it was a ripoff of my OTHER \"Outer Limits\" script, 'Soldier'.\"\nIn 1983, Marvel Comics released \"The Incredible Hulk\" #286, entitled \"Hero\", written by Bill Mantlo. Three issues later, Marvel announced that Mantlo had adapted \"Soldier\" for use as a Hulk story, but that they had forgotten to credit Ellison until this was pointed out by readers. In actuality, then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter signed off on the story, not having seen the \"Outer Limits\" episode it was based on and not realizing Mantlo copied it wholesale. The day the issue went on sale, he was contacted by an angry Ellison, who calmed down after Shooter admitted the error. Although he could have claimed hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages, Ellison requested only the same payment Mantlo had received for the story, proper credit as writer, and a lifetime subscription to everything Marvel published.\nOn April 24, 2000, Ellison sued Stephen Robertson for posting four stories to the usenet newsgroup \"alt.binaries.e-book\" without authorization. The other defendants were AOL and RemarQ, an internet service provider who owned servers hosting the newsgroup. Ellison alleged they had failed to halt copyright infringement in accordance with the \"Notice and Takedown Procedure\" outlined in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Robertson and RemarQ first settled with Ellison, and then AOL likewise settled with Ellison in June 2004, under conditions that were not made public. Since those settlements Ellison initiated legal action or takedown notices against more than 240 people who have allegedly distributed his writings on the Internet, saying, \"If you put your hand in my pocket, you'll drag back six inches of bloody stump\".\nAwards.\nEllison won eight Hugo Awards, a shared award for the screenplay of \"A Boy and his Dog\" that he counted as \"half a Hugo\", and two special awards from annual World SF Conventions; four Nebula Awards of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); five Bram Stoker Awards of the Horror Writers Association (HWA); two Edgar Awards of the Mystery Writers of America; two World Fantasy Awards from annual conventions; and two Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s fantasy film awards. In 1987, Ellison was awarded the Inkpot Award.\nIn his 1981 book about the horror genre, \"Danse Macabre\", Stephen King reviewed Ellison's collection \"Strange Wine\" and considered it one of the best horror books published between 1950 and 1980.\nEllison won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1993. HWA gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 and the World Horror Convention named him Grand Master in 2000. He was awarded the Gallun Award for Lifetime Achievement in Science Fiction from I-CON in 1997.\nSFWA named him its 23rd Grand Master of fantasy and science fiction in 2006 and the Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2011. That year he also received the fourth J. Lloyd Eaton Lifetime Achievement Award in Science Fiction, presented by the UCR Libraries at the 2011 Eaton SF Conference, \"Global Science Fiction\".\nAs of 2013[ [update]], Ellison is the only three-time winner of the Nebula Award for Best Short Story. He won his other Nebula in the novella category.\nHe was awarded the Silver Pen for Journalism by International PEN, the international writers' union, in 1982. In 1990, Ellison was honored by International PEN for continuing commitment to artistic freedom and the battle against censorship. In 1998, he was awarded the \"Defender of Liberty\" award by the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.\nIn March 1998, the National Women's Committee of Brandeis University honored him with their 1998 Words, Wit, Wisdom award.\nEllison was named 2002's winner of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal's \"Distinguished Skeptic Award\", in recognition of his contributions to science and critical thinking. Ellison was presented with the award at the Skeptics Convention in Burbank, California, on June 22, 2002.\nIn December 2009, Ellison was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Spoken Word Album For Children for his reading of \"Through the Looking-Glass And What Alice Found There\" for Blackstone Audio, Inc.\nParodies and pastiches of Ellison.\nIn the 1970s, artist and cartoonist Gordon Carleton wrote and drew a scripted slideshow called \"City on the Edge of Whatever\", a spoof of \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". Occasionally performed at \"Star Trek\" conventions, it features an irate writer named \"Arlan Hellison\" who screams at his producers, \"Art defilers! Script assassins!\"\n\"Justice League of America\" #89 (\"The Most Dangerous Dreams Of All\") 1971, written by Mike Friedrich, is centered around a character named Harlequin Ellis. The character is smitten with Black Canary, and injects himself into Justice League adventures, taking on the role of different heroes in his attempts to woo her. Ellison himself had written several comic book scripts.\nBen Bova's novel \"The Starcrossed\" (1975), a \"roman \u00e0 clef\" about Bova and Ellison's experience on \"The Starlost\" TV series, features a character, \"Ron Gabriel\", who is a pastiche of Ellison. Bova's novel is dedicated to Ellison's pseudonym \"Cordwainer Bird\", who was credited as series creator on \"The Starlost\" per Ellison's demand. In the novel, \"Ron Gabriel\" requires the fictional series producers to credit him under the pseudonym \"Victor Lawrence Talbot Frankenstein\".\nIn \"Murder at the ABA\" (1976) by Isaac Asimov, the protagonist, Darius Just, was based on Ellison, as stated by Asimov in footnotes to the book itself and in his autobiographical volume \"In Joy Still Felt\".\nRobert Silverberg named a character in his first novel, \"Revolt on Alpha C\" (1955), for Ellison, who was Silverberg's neighbor in New York City at the time he was writing the book. This was confirmed in a special edition on the occasion of Silverberg's 35th year in the business.\nSharyn McCrumb's mystery novel \"Bimbos of the Death Sun\" (1987) features a cantankerous antagonist-turned-murder victim based on Ellison. Fans of Ellison sent him copies of the book, and upon their meeting later that year at the Edgar Awards, Ellison told McCrumb he had read the book and thought it was good.\nEllison is a recurring minor character in the animated television series \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" (2010\u20132013), voicing a fictionalized version of himself modeled on his appearance in the 1970s.\nEllison appeared as himself in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" (\"Married to the Blob\", 2014) in which he meets Bart and Milhouse, and parodies his contention that the film \"The Terminator\" used ideas from his stories.\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although he is typically credited as the physician to first describe the Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, this has been disputed. He was born in Harburg an der Elbe and died in Munich.\nBiography.\nCreutzfeldt was born into a medical family, on June 2, 1885, at Harburg an der Elbe, Germany, which was incorporated into Hamburg in 1937. In 1903, at the age of 18, he was drafted into the German army and spent his service stationed in Kiel.\nAfterwards, he attended the School of Medicine of the University of Jena and the University of Rostock, receiving his doctorate at the latter in 1909. Part of his practical training was undertaken at \"St. Georg\" \u2013 Hospital in Hamburg. After qualification he sought adventure as a ship's surgeon, voyaging the Pacific Ocean, taking the opportunity to study local crafts, linguistics, and tropical plants.\nAfter returning to Germany in 1912, Creutzfeldt worked at the Neurological Institute in Frankfurt am Main, at the psychiatric-neurological clinics in Breslau, Kiel and Berlin, and at the \"Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Psychiatrie\" in Munich. \nDuring the First World War, Creutzfeldt was deployed as a reserve medical officer and survived the sinking of the auxiliary cruiser SMS Greif, on which he was embarked. After being captured on February 29, 1916, he was repatriated as a doctor in May of that year and served in the Imperial German Navy until the end of the war in 1918.\nCreutzfeldt was habilitated at Kiel in 1920, and in 1925 became \"Extraordinarius\" of psychiatry and neurology. In 1938 he was appointed professor and director of the university psychiatric and neurological division in Kiel. He helped to recognize a neurodegenerative disease, with Alfons Maria Jakob, Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in which the brain tissue develops holes and takes on a sponge-like texture. It is now known it is due to a type of infectious protein called a prion. Prions are misfolded proteins which replicate by converting their properly folded counterparts.\nIn Nazi Germany, Creutzfeldt became a Patron Member of Heinrich Himmler's SS from 1932 to 1933.\nLater life.\nCreutzfeldt was 54 years old when the Second World War broke out. He was unmoved by the Nazi regime and was able to save some people from death in concentration camps and also managed to save almost all of his patients from being murdered under the Nazi \"Aktion T4\" involuntary euthanasia program, while most mental patients identified by T4 personnel were gassed or poisoned at separate euthanasia clinics such as Hadamar Euthanasia Centre. During the war, bombing raids destroyed his home and clinic.\nAfter the war he was director of the University of Kiel for six months, before being dismissed by the British occupation forces. His efforts to rebuild the university caused a series of conflicts with the British because he wanted to allow more former army officers to study there. Creutzfeldt resigned from his work at Kiel in 1953 in order to pursue life as professor emeritus in Munich.\nPersonal life.\nHe was married to Clara Sombart, a daughter of economist Werner Sombart. They had five children, among them neurologist Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt and Werner Creutzfeldt (1924\u20132006), a German internist. He died in December 1964 in Munich. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13465", "revid": "14940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13465", "title": "Holmium", "text": "element with atomic number 67 (Ho)\nHolmium is a chemical element; it has symbol Ho and atomic number 67. It is a rare-earth element and the eleventh member of the lanthanide series of elements. It is a relatively soft, silvery, fairly corrosion-resistant and malleable metal. Like many other lanthanides, holmium is too reactive to be found in native form, as pure holmium slowly forms a yellowish oxide coating when exposed to air. When isolated, holmium is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature. However, it reacts with water and corrodes readily, and also burns in air when heated.\nIn nature, holmium occurs together with the other rare-earth metals (like thulium). It is a relatively rare lanthanide, making up 1.4 parts per million of the Earth's crust, an abundance similar to tungsten. Holmium was discovered through isolation by Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve. It was also independently discovered by Jacques-Louis Soret and Marc Delafontaine, who together observed it spectroscopically in 1878. Its oxide was first isolated from rare-earth ores by Cleve in 1878. The element's name comes from \"Holmia\", the Latin name for the city of Stockholm.\nLike many other lanthanides, holmium is found in the minerals monazite and gadolinite and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using ion-exchange techniques. Its compounds in nature and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry are trivalently oxidized, containing Ho(III) ions. Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare-earth ions (while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines), and thus are used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass-colorant applications.\nHolmium has the highest magnetic permeability and magnetic saturation of any element and is thus used for the pole pieces of the strongest static magnets. Because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons, it is also used as a burnable poison in nuclear reactors.\nProperties.\nHolmium is the eleventh member of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears in period 6, between the lanthanides dysprosium to its left and erbium to its right, and above the actinide einsteinium.\nPhysical properties.\nWith a boiling point of , holmium is the sixth most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium, europium, samarium, thulium and dysprosium. At standard temperature and pressure, holmium, like many of the second half of the lanthanides, normally assumes a hexagonally close-packed (hcp) structure. Its 67 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Xe] 4f11 6s2, so that it has thirteen valence electrons filling the 4f and 6s subshells.\nHolmium, like all of the lanthanides, is paramagnetic at standard temperature and pressure. However, holmium is ferromagnetic at temperatures below . It has the highest magnetic moment () of any naturally occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties. When combined with yttrium, it forms highly magnetic compounds.\nChemical properties.\nHolmium metal tarnishes slowly in air, forming a yellowish oxide layer that has an appearance similar to that of iron rust. It burns readily to form holmium(III) oxide:\n4 Ho + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Ho2O3\nIt is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly corrosion-resistant and chemically stable in dry air at standard temperature and pressure. In moist air and at higher temperatures, however, it quickly oxidizes, forming a yellowish oxide. In pure form, holmium possesses a metallic, bright silvery luster.\nHolmium is quite electropositive: on the Pauling electronegativity scale, it has an electronegativity of 1.23. It is generally trivalent. It reacts slowly with cold water and quickly with hot water to form holmium(III) hydroxide:\n2 Ho (s) + 6 H2O (l) \u2192 2 Ho(OH)3 (aq) + 3 H2 (g)\nHolmium metal reacts with all the stable halogens:\n2 Ho (s) + 3 F2 (g) \u2192 2 HoF3 (s) [pink]\n2 Ho (s) + 3 Cl2 (g) \u2192 2 HoCl3 (s) [yellow]\n2 Ho (s) + 3 Br2 (g) \u2192 2 HoBr3 (s) [yellow]\n2 Ho (s) + 3 I2 (g) \u2192 2 HoI3 (s) [yellow]\nHolmium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow Ho(III) ions, which exist as a [Ho(OH2)9]3+ complexes:\n2 Ho (s) + 3 H2SO4 (aq) \u2192 2 Ho3+ (aq) + 3 SO42- (aq) + 3 H2 (g)\nOxidation states.\nAs with many lanthanides, holmium is usually found in the +3 oxidation state, forming compounds such as holmium(III) fluoride (HoF3) and holmium(III) chloride (HoCl3). Holmium in solution is in the form of Ho3+ surrounded by nine molecules of water. Holmium dissolves in acids. However, holmium is also found to exist in +2, +1 and 0 oxidation states.\nIsotopes.\nNatural holmium consists of one primordial isotope, holmium-165. It is observationally stable, though theoretically should undergo alpha decay to terbium-161 with a very long half-life.\nThe known isotopes of holmium range from 140Ho to 175Ho. The primary decay mode before the stable 165Ho, is beta plus decay to dysprosium isotopes, and the primary mode after is beta minus decay to erbium isotopes. Of the 35 synthetic radioactive isotopes among these, the most stable one is holmium-163 (163Ho), with a half-life of 4570 years. The next most stable is holmium-166 (166Ho) having a half-life of 26.812 hours, and others have half-lives under 4 hours.\nThe metastable isomer 166m1Ho has the unusually long half-life of 1133 years. With a very low excitation energy, it does not decay to the ground state but beta-decays directly, having a particularly rich spectrum of gamma rays, making this isotope useful as a means for calibrating gamma ray spectrometers.\nHolmium-166 (ground state) has been studied for medical application.\nCompounds.\nOxides and chalcogenides.\nHolmium(III) oxide is the only oxide of holmium. It changes its color depending on the lighting conditions. In daylight, it has a yellowish color. Under trichromatic light, it appears orange red, almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under the same lighting conditions. The color change is related to the sharp emission lines of trivalent holmium ions acting as red phosphors. Holmium(III) oxide appears pink under a cold-cathode fluorescent lamp.\nOther chalcogenides are known for holmium. Holmium(III) sulfide has orange-yellow crystals in the monoclinic crystal system, with the space group \"P\"21/\"m\" (No. 11). Under high pressure, holmium(III) sulfide can form in the cubic and orthorhombic crystal systems. It can be obtained by the reaction of holmium(III) oxide and hydrogen sulfide at . Holmium(III) selenide is also known. It is antiferromagnetic below 6\u00a0K.\nHalides.\nAll four trihalides of holmium are known. Holmium(III) fluoride is a yellowish powder that can be produced by reacting holmium(III) oxide and ammonium fluoride, then crystallising it from the ammonium salt formed in solution. Holmium(III) chloride can be prepared in a similar way, with ammonium chloride instead of ammonium fluoride. It has the YCl3 layer structure in the solid state. These compounds, as well as holmium(III) bromide and holmium(III) iodide, can be obtained by the direct reaction of the elements:\n2 Ho + 3 X2 \u2192 2 HoX3\nIn addition, holmium(III) iodide can be obtained by the direct reaction of holmium and mercury(II) iodide, then removing the mercury by distillation.\nOrganoholmium compounds.\nOrganoholmium compounds are very similar to those of the other lanthanides, as they all share an inability to undergo \u03c0 backbonding. They are thus mostly restricted to the mostly ionic cyclopentadienides (isostructural with those of lanthanum) and the \u03c3-bonded simple alkyls and aryls, some of which may be polymeric.\nHistory.\nHolmium (, Latin name for Stockholm) was discovered by the Swiss chemists Jacques-Louis Soret and Marc Delafontaine in 1878 who noticed the aberrant spectrographic emission spectrum of the then-unknown element (they called it \"Element X\").\nThe Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve also independently discovered the element while he was working on erbia earth (erbium oxide). He was the first to isolate impure oxide of the new element. Using the method developed by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, Cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance \"holmia\" (after the Latin name for Cleve's home town, Stockholm) and the green one \"thulia\". \"Holmia\" was later found to be the holmium oxide, and \"thulia\" was thulium oxide. The pure oxide was only isolated in 1911 and the metal in 1939 by Heinrich Bommer.\nIn the English physicist Henry Moseley's classic paper on atomic numbers, holmium was assigned the value 66. The holmium preparation he had been given to investigate had been impure, dominated by neighboring dysprosium. He would have seen x-ray emission lines for both elements, but assumed that the dominant ones belonged to holmium, instead of the dysprosium impurity.\nOccurrence and production.\nLike all the other rare-earth elements, holmium is not naturally found as a free element. It occurs combined with other elements in gadolinite, monazite and other rare-earth minerals. No holmium-dominant mineral has yet been found. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia with reserves of holmium estimated as 400,000 tonnes. The annual production of holmium metal is of about 10 tonnes per year.\nHolmium makes up 1.3 parts per million of the Earth's crust by mass. Holmium makes up 1 part per million of the soils, 400 parts per quadrillion of seawater, and almost none of Earth's atmosphere, which is very rare for a lanthanide. It makes up 500 parts per trillion of the universe by mass.\nHolmium is commercially extracted by ion exchange from monazite sand (0.05% holmium), but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths. The element has been isolated through the reduction of its anhydrous chloride or fluoride with metallic calcium. Its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 1.3\u00a0mg/kg. Holmium obeys the Oddo\u2013Harkins rule: as an odd-numbered element, it is less abundant than both dysprosium and erbium. However, it is the most abundant of the odd-numbered heavy lanthanides. Of the lanthanides, only promethium, thulium, lutetium and terbium are less abundant on Earth. The principal current source are some of the ion-adsorption clays of southern China. Some of these have a rare-earth composition similar to that found in xenotime or gadolinite. Yttrium makes up about two-thirds of the total by mass; holmium is around 1.5%. Holmium is relatively inexpensive for a rare-earth metal with the price about 1000\u00a0USD/kg.\nApplications.\nGlass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions (usually in perchloric acid) have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200 to 900\u00a0nm. They are therefore used as a calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers. The radioactive but long-lived 166m1Ho is used in calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers.\nHolmium is used to create the strongest artificially generated magnetic fields, when placed within high-strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece (also called a magnetic flux concentrator). Holmium is also used in the manufacture of some permanent magnets.\nHolmium can act as a sensitizer in sodium yttrium fluoride which takes advantage of its absorption in the NIR-II window. Holmium allows for lanthanide nanomaterials to have tunable emission and excitation in the NIR-II. Under 1143 nm excitation the interfacial energy transfer to other lanthanides allows a redshift in emission for biological applications. This allows deeper penetration than typically used 980 nm and 808 nm lasers.\nHolmium-doped yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and yttrium lithium fluoride have applications in solid-state lasers, and Ho-YIG has applications in optical isolators and in microwave equipment (e.g., YIG spheres). Holmium lasers emit at 2.1 micrometres. They are used in medical, dental, and fiber-optical applications. It is also used in the enucleation of the prostate.\nSince holmium can absorb nuclear fission-bred neutrons, it is used as a burnable poison to regulate nuclear reactors. It is used as a colorant for cubic zirconia, providing pink coloring, and for glass, providing yellow-orange coloring. In March 2017, IBM announced that they had developed a technique to store one bit of data on a single holmium atom set on a bed of magnesium oxide. With sufficient quantum and classical control techniques, holmium may be a good candidate to make quantum computers.\nHolmium is used in the medical field, particularly in laser surgery for procedures such as kidney stone removal and prostate treatment, due to its precision and minimal tissue damage. Its isotope, holmium-166, is applied in targeted cancer therapies, especially for liver cancer, and it also enhances MRI imaging as a contrast agent.\nBiological role and precautions.\nHolmium plays no biological role in humans, but its salts are able to stimulate metabolism. Humans typically consume about a milligram of holmium a year. Plants do not readily take up holmium from the soil. Some vegetables have had their holmium content measured, and it amounted to 100 parts per trillion. Holmium and its soluble salts are slightly toxic if ingested, but insoluble holmium salts are nontoxic. Metallic holmium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard. Large amounts of holmium salts can cause severe damage if inhaled, consumed orally, or injected. The biological effects of holmium over a long period of time are not known. Holmium has a low level of acute toxicity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, though it was not identified until 1922 by Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy. Hafnium is named after , the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. The element is obtained only by separation from zirconium, with most of the world's hafnium production coming from processes that also produce zirconium. These processes make use of heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which include the minerals zircon, rutile, and ilmenite, among others.\nHafnium is most often used in alloys with nickel, and was used in larger quantities to produce the control rods used in nuclear reactors. Hafnium's large neutron capture cross section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants, but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors. It is ductile, and is also used in filaments and electrodes. Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at and smaller, and superalloys used for special applications can contain hafnium in combination with niobium, titanium, or tungsten.\nPure hafnium is not toxic, but is extremely flammable to the point of being pyrophoric\u2014capable of spontaneous combustion in air. Several industrial processes involved in the production of hafnium have by-products that can be hazardous when released into the environment, and several hafnium compounds have hazards of their own. One nuclear isomer of hafnium, 178m2Hf, was the source of a controversy for its potential use as a weapon, but it has never been successfully produced for practical use.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical characteristics.\n&lt;section begin=properties /&gt;\nHafnium is a shiny, silvery, ductile metal that is corrosion-resistant and chemically similar to zirconium in that they have the same number of valence electrons and are in the same group. Also, their relativistic effects are similar: The expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly canceled out by the lanthanide contraction. Hafnium changes from its alpha form, a hexagonal close-packed lattice, to its beta form, a body-centered cubic lattice, at . The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.&lt;section end=properties /&gt;\nA notable physical difference between these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron capture cross section, roughly three orders of magnitude greater than that of zirconium, and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. Because zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, it is commonly used for the metal components of nuclear reactors\u2014especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.\nChemical characteristics.\nHafnium reacts in air to form a protective film of hafnium oxide in the monoclinic phase that inhibits further corrosion. Despite this, the metal is attacked by hydrofluoric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid, and can be oxidized with halogens or burnt in air. Like its sister metal zirconium, finely divided hafnium can ignite spontaneously in air. The metal is resistant to concentrated alkalis.\nAs a consequence of lanthanide contraction, the chemistry of hafnium and zirconium is so similar that the two cannot be separated based on differing chemical reactions. The melting and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the chemistry of these twin elements.\nIsotopes.\nAt least 40 isotopes of hafnium have been observed, ranging in mass number from 153 to 192. The five stable isotopes have mass numbers from 176 to 180 inclusive; the primordial 174Hf has a very long half-life of years.\nThe extinct radionuclide 182Hf has a half-life of , and is an important tracker isotope for the formation of planetary cores. No other radioisotope has a half-life over 1.87 years.\nThe longest-lived nuclear isomer 178m2Hf (31 years) was at the center of a controversy for several years regarding its potential use as a weapon. Because of its high energy compared to the ground state 178Hf, the isomer was put under scrutiny as being capable of induced gamma emission, which could be weaponized to produce large amounts of gamma radiation all at once. Applications of the isomer have been frustrated due to the difficulty of producing it without the product being immediately destroyed as well as its extremely high cost.\nOccurrence.\nHafnium is estimated to make up about between 3.0 and 4.8 ppm of the Earth's upper crust by mass. It does not exist as a free element on Earth, but is found combined in solid solution with zirconium in natural zirconium compounds such as zircon, ZrSiO4, which usually has about 1\u20134% of the Zr replaced by Hf. Rarely, the Hf/Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral hafnon , with atomic Hf &gt; Zr. An obsolete name for a variety of zircon containing unusually high Hf content is \"alvite\".\nA major source of zircon (and hence hafnium) ores is heavy mineral sands ore deposits, pegmatites, particularly in Brazil and Malawi, and carbonatite intrusions, particularly the Crown Polymetallic Deposit at Mount Weld, Western Australia. A potential source of hafnium is trachyte tuffs containing rare zircon-hafnium silicates eudialyte or armstrongite, at Dubbo in New South Wales, Australia.\nProduction.\nThe heavy mineral sands ore deposits of the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile yield most of the mined zirconium, and therefore also most of the hafnium. Zirconium is a good nuclear fuel-rod cladding metal, with the desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source of hafnium.\nThe chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical, which makes the two difficult to separate. The methods first used\u2014fractional crystallization of ammonium fluoride salts or the fractional distillation of the chloride\u2014did not prove suitable for an industrial-scale production. After zirconium was chosen as a material for nuclear reactor programs in the 1940s, a separation method had to be developed. Liquid\u2013liquid extraction processes with a wide variety of solvents were developed and are still used for producing hafnium. Other methods to purify hafnium from zirconium include molten salt extraction and crystallization of fluorozirconates. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by-product of zirconium refinement. The end product of the separation is hafnium(IV) chloride. The purified hafnium(IV) chloride is converted to the metal by reduction with magnesium or sodium, as in the Kroll process.\n &lt;chem&gt;HfCl4{} + 2 Mg -&gt;[1100~^\\circ\\text{C}] Hf{} + 2 MgCl2&lt;/chem&gt;\nFurther purification is effected by a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of , forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of the reverse reaction happens preferentially, and the chemically bound iodine and hafnium dissociate into the native elements. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, resulting in a steady iodine turnover and ensuring the chemical equilibrium remains in favor of hafnium production.\n &lt;chem&gt;Hf{} + 2 I2 -&gt;[500~^\\circ\\text{C}] HfI4&lt;/chem&gt;\n &lt;chem&gt;HfI4 -&gt;[1700~^\\circ\\text{C}] Hf{} + 2 I2&lt;/chem&gt;\nChemical compounds.\nDue to the lanthanide contraction, the ionic radius of hafnium(IV) (0.78\u00a0\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m) is almost the same as that of zirconium(IV) (0.79\u00a0angstroms). Consequently, compounds of hafnium(IV) and zirconium(IV) have very similar chemical and physical properties. Hafnium and zirconium tend to occur together in nature and the similarity of their ionic radii makes their chemical separation rather difficult. Hafnium tends to form inorganic compounds in the oxidation state of +4. Halogens react with it to form hafnium tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, hafnium reacts with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Some hafnium compounds in lower oxidation states are known.\nHafnium(IV) chloride and hafnium(IV) iodide have some applications in the production and purification of hafnium metal. They are volatile solids with polymeric structures. These tetrahalides are precursors to various organohafnium compounds, and hafnium(IV) chloride in particular is used in microelectronics manufacturing as a source of hafnium oxide in atomic layer deposition, much in the same way as zirconium(IV) chloride.\nThe white hafnium oxide (HfO2), with a melting point of and a boiling point of roughly , is very similar to zirconia, but slightly more basic. Hafnium carbide is the most refractory binary compound known, with a melting point over , and hafnium nitride is the most refractory of all known metal nitrides, with a melting point of . Hafnium carbonitride has the highest known melting point for any material, which is confirmed to be above by experiment, while calculations predict its melting point to be .\nHistory.\nHafnium's existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.\nIn his report on \"The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements\", in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly predicted the existence of a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.\nThe X-ray spectroscopy done by Henry Moseley in 1914 showed a direct dependency between spectral line and effective nuclear charge. This led to the nuclear charge, or atomic number of an element, being used to ascertain its place within the periodic table. With this method, Moseley determined the number of lanthanides and showed the gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.\nThe discovery of the gaps led to an extensive search for the missing elements. In 1914, several people claimed the discovery after Henry Moseley predicted the gap in the periodic table for the then-undiscovered element 72. Georges Urbain asserted that he found element 72 in the rare earth elements in 1907 and published his results on \"celtium\" in 1911. Neither the spectra nor the chemical behavior he claimed matched with the element found later, and therefore his claim was turned down after a long-standing controversy. The controversy was partly because the chemists favored the chemical techniques which led to the discovery of \"celtium\", while the physicists relied on the use of the new X-ray spectroscopy method that proved that the substances discovered by Urbain did not contain element 72. In 1921, Charles R. Bury suggested that element 72 should resemble zirconium and therefore was not part of the rare earth elements group. By early 1923, Niels Bohr and others agreed with Bury. These suggestions were based on Bohr's theories of the atom which were identical to chemist Charles Bury, the X-ray spectroscopy of Moseley, and the chemical arguments of Friedrich Paneth.\nEncouraged by these suggestions and by the reappearance in 1922 of Urbain's claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. It was ultimately found in zircon in Norway through X-ray spectroscopy analysis. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin name for \"Copenhagen\", \"Hafnia\", the home town of Niels Bohr. Today, the Faculty of Science of the University of Copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of the hafnium atom.\nHafnium was separated from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer were the first to prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still in use today.\nIn 1923, six predicted elements were still missing from the periodic table: 43 (technetium), 61 (promethium), 85 (astatine), and 87 (francium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two stable elements to be discovered. The element rhenium was found in 1908 by Masataka Ogawa, though its atomic number was misidentified at the time, and it was not generally recognised by the scientific community until its rediscovery by Walter Noddack, Ida Noddack, and Otto Berg in 1925. This makes it somewhat difficult to say if hafnium or rhenium was discovered last.\nApplications.\nMuch of the hafnium produced is used in the manufacture of control rods for nuclear reactors and as an additive in nickel alloys to increase their heat resistance.\nHafnium has limited technical applications due to a few factors. It is very similar to zirconium, a more abundant element that can be used in most cases, and pure hafnium wasn't widely available until the late 1950s, when it became a byproduct of the nuclear industry's need for hafnium-free zirconium. Additionally, hafnium is rare and difficult to separate from other elements, making it expensive. After the Fukushima disaster reduced the demand for hafnium-free zirconium, the price of hafnium increased significantly from around $500\u2013$600/kg($227-$272/lb) in 2014 to around $1000/kg($454/lb) in 2015. Hafnium products, such as tubes and sheets of the metal, could be purchased at \u20ac/kg($170/lb) in 2009.\nNuclear reactors.\nThe nuclei of several hafnium isotopes can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material for nuclear reactors' control rods. Its neutron capture cross section (Capture Resonance Integral Io \u2248 2000 barns) is about 600 times that of zirconium (other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron). Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military reactors, particularly in US naval submarine reactors, to slow reactor rates that are too high. It is seldom found in civilian reactors, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.\nAlloys.\nHafnium is used in alloys with iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and other metals. An alloy used for liquid-rocket thruster nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.\nSmall additions of hafnium increase the adherence of protective oxide scales on nickel-based alloys. It thereby improves the corrosion resistance, especially under cyclic temperature conditions that tend to break oxide scales, by inducing thermal stresses between the bulk material and the oxide layer. An alloy that includes as little as 1% hafnium can withstand temperatures that are higher than the same alloy without hafnium.\nMicroprocessors.\nHafnium-based compounds are employed in gates of transistors as insulators in the 45\u00a0nm (and below) generation of integrated circuits from Intel, IBM and others. Hafnium oxide-based compounds are practical high-k dielectrics, allowing reduction of the gate leakage current which improves performance at such scales.\nIsotope geochemistry.\nIsotopes of hafnium and lutetium are also used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications, in lutetium-hafnium dating. It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earth's mantle through time. This is because 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.\nIn most geologic materials, zircon is the dominant host of hafnium (&gt;10,000 ppm) and is often the focus of hafnium studies in geology. Hafnium is readily substituted into the zircon crystal lattice, and is therefore very resistant to hafnium mobility and contamination. Zircon also has an extremely low Lu/Hf ratio, making any correction for initial lutetium minimal. Although the Lu/Hf system can be used to calculate a \"model age\", i.e. the time at which it was derived from a given isotopic reservoir such as the depleted mantle, these \"ages\" do not carry the same geologic significance as do other geochronological techniques as the results often yield isotopic mixtures and thus provide an average age of the material from which it was derived.\nGarnet is another mineral that contains appreciable amounts of hafnium to act as a geochronometer. The high and variable Lu/Hf ratios found in garnet make it useful for dating metamorphic events. Mass spectrometry also makes use of these ratios to date garnet formed through igneous events.\nOther uses.\nDue to its heat resistance and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium is a good scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and incandescent lamps. Hafnium is also used as the electrode in plasma cutting because of its ability to shed electrons into the air. Hafnium metallocene compounds can be prepared from hafnium tetrachloride and various cyclopentadiene-type ligand species. Perhaps the simplest hafnium metallocene is hafnocene dichloride. Hafnium metallocenes are part of a large collection of Group 4 transition metal metallocene catalysts that are used worldwide in the production of polyolefin resins like polyethylene and polypropylene. A pyridyl-amidohafnium catalyst can be used for the controlled iso-selective polymerization of propylene, which can then be combined with polyethylene to make a tougher recycled plastic.\nThe high energy content of 178m2Hf was the concern of a DARPA-funded program in the US. This program eventually concluded that using the 178m2Hf nuclear isomer of hafnium to construct high-yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms\u2014an application of induced gamma emission\u2014was infeasible because of its expense and difficulty to manufacture. See hafnium controversy.\nHafnium diselenide is studied in spintronics thanks to its charge density wave and superconductivity.\nToxicity and safety.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nHafnium is a pyrophoric material, and as such fine particles can spontaneously combust upon exposure to air. Hafnium powder is often wetted with at least 25% water by weight to be considered safe - the metal is insoluble in water. Machining hafnium is particularly hazardous because of the potential for fine particles of the metal to be produced and immediately introduced to frictional force. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, though it has been observed to accumulate in the liver when injected into rats. Hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds. Hafnium tetrachloride and hafnium tetrabromide, which are often part of industrial processes that use the element, are of particular note, with both compounds releasing acidic fumes on contact with water (hydrochloric and hydrobromic acid, respectively). Additionally, hafnium tetrachloride has been observed as causing liver damage at high exposure levels.\nPeople can be exposed to hafnium in the workplace by breathing, swallowing, skin, and eye contact. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for exposure to hafnium and hafnium compounds in the workplace as TWA 0.5\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the same recommended exposure limit (REL). At levels of 50\u00a0mg/m3, hafnium is immediately dangerous to life and health.\nBecause the mineral zircon is often associated with traces of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium, the chemically destructive processes used to separate zirconium from hafnium have potential to release these radioactive elements and their decay products into the environment along with other reaction wastes. Additionally, synthesis pathways that involve liquid-liquid extraction introduce ammonium chloride and sulfate into reaction mixtures, which as effluent can reduce available oxygen in water sources or produce cyanides if it comes into contact with thiocyanate-containing compounds.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Hamburg Metropolitan Region has a population of over 5.1 million and is the tenth-largest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union.\nAt the southern tip of the Jutland Peninsula, Hamburg stands on the branching River Elbe at the head of a estuary to the North Sea, at the confluence of the Alster and Bille. Hamburg is one of Germany's three city-states alongside Berlin and Bremen, and is surrounded by Schleswig-Holstein to the north and Lower Saxony to the south. The Port of Hamburg is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest, after Rotterdam and Antwerp. The local dialect is a variant of Low Saxon.\nThe official name reflects Hamburg's history as a member of the medieval Hanseatic League and a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. Before the 1871 unification of Germany, it was a fully sovereign city state, and before 1919 formed a civic republic headed constitutionally by a class of hereditary Grand Burghers, or . Beset by disasters such as the Great Fire of Hamburg, North Sea flood of 1962 and military conflicts including World War II bombing raids, the city has managed to recover and emerge wealthier after each catastrophe.\nMajor regional broadcaster NDR, the printing and publishing firm and the newspapers and are based in the city. Hamburg is the seat of Germany's oldest stock exchange and the world's oldest merchant bank, Berenberg Bank. Media, commercial, logistical, and industrial firms with significant locations in the city include multinationals Airbus, , , , Lufthansa and Unilever. Hamburg is also a major European science, research, and education hub, with several universities and institutions, including the University of Hamburg, the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron Laboratory DESY. The city enjoys a very high quality of living, being ranked 28th in the 2024 Mercer Quality of Living Survey.\nHamburg hosts specialists in world economics and international law, including consular and diplomatic missions such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the EU-LAC Foundation, and the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning, multipartite international political conferences and summits such as and the G20. Former German chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Angela Merkel were both born in Hamburg. The former Mayor of Hamburg, Olaf Scholz, was chancellor from December 2021 until May 2025.\nHamburg is a major international and domestic tourist destination. The and were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 2015. Hamburg's rivers and canals are crossed by around 2,500 bridges, making it the city with the highest number of bridges in Europe, and with five of the world's 29 tallest churches standing in Hamburg, it is also the city with the greatest number of churches surpassing worldwide. Aside from its rich architectural heritage, the city is also home to notable cultural venues such as the and concert halls. It gave birth to movements like and paved the way for bands including the Beatles. Hamburg is also known for several theatres and a variety of musical shows. St. Pauli's is among the best-known European red-light districts.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nClaudius Ptolemy (2nd century AD) reported the first name for the vicinity as Treva.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Hamburg\" comes from the first permanent building on the site, a castle which the Emperor Charlemagne ordered constructed in AD 808. It rose on rocky terrain in a marsh between the River Alster and the River Elbe as a defence against Slavic incursion, and acquired the name \"Hammaburg\", \"burg\" meaning castle or fort. The origin of the \"Hamma\" term remains uncertain, but its location is estimated to be at the site of today's Hammaburgplatz.\nMedieval Hamburg.\nIn 834 CE, Hamburg was established as the seat of a bishopric. Its first bishop, Ansgar, later known as the Apostle of the North, founded the city\u2019s early Christian institutions. Two years later, Hamburg was linked with Bremen to form the Bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen.\nHamburg faced repeated destruction in its early centuries. In 845, a fleet of 600 Viking ships sailed up the River Elbe and destroyed the town, which then had about 500 inhabitants. In 1030, King Mieszko II Lambert of the Poland burned the city, and in 1201 and 1214 it was raided and occupied by Valdemar II of Denmark. The Black Death reached Hamburg in 1350, killing at least 60% of its population, and the city also suffered several major fires in the medieval period.\nA major turning point came in 1189 when Frederick I \"Barbarossa\" granted Hamburg the status of a Free Imperial City. The imperial charter included tax-free passage up the Lower Elbe to the North Sea (a form of free-trade zone). In 1265, an allegedly forged charter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.\nHamburg\u2019s location between the North Sea and Baltic Sea trade routes helped it become a major port in Northern Europe. Its 1241 alliance with L\u00fcbeck is regarded as the founding moment of the Hanseatic League. On 8 November 1266, a contract between Henry III and Hamburg\u2019s merchants allowed them to establish a \"hanse\" in London \u2014 the first recorded use of the word for the League\u2019s trading guild.\nIn 1270, \"Jordan von Boitzenburg\", solicitor to the Senate of Hamburg, wrote the \"Ordeelbook\", the first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a German city in the German language. On 10 August 1410, civil unrest resulted in a negotiated compromise (German: \"Reze\u00df\"), considered the first constitution of Hamburg.\nOn 25 February 1356 \u2014 the first day of spring in medieval reckoning \u2014 the \"Matthiae-Mahl\" feast for Hanseatic League cities was celebrated for the first time. It continues today as the world\u2019s oldest ceremonial meal.\nEarly modern period.\nIn 1529, the city embraced Lutheranism, and it received Reformed refugees from the Netherlands and France.\nWhen Jan van Valckenborgh introduced a second layer to the fortifications to protect against the Thirty Years' War in the seventeenth century, he extended Hamburg and created a \"New Town\" (\"Neustadt\") whose street names are still based upon the grid system of roads he introduced.\nFrom the autumn of 1696 to the spring of 1697 the Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies was active in Hamburg. While it was unsuccessful in raising capital locally, it commissioned the construction of four vessels in the port. The \"Caledonia\", a ship of 600 tons with 56 guns, and the \"Instuaration\" (later renamed the \"St. Andrew\"), a vessel of 350 tons, were launched in March 1697.\nUpon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Free Imperial City of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges (mediatised), but became a sovereign state with the official title of the \"Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg\". Hamburg was briefly annexed by Napoleon I to the First French Empire (1804\u20131814/1815). Russian forces under General Bennigsen finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The Vienna Congress of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the German Confederation (1815\u20131866).\nIn 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the \"Great Fire\". The fire started on the night of 4 May and was not extinguished until 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.\nAfter periodic political unrest, particularly in 1848, Hamburg adopted in 1860 a semidemocratic constitution that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations included the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the North German Confederation (1866\u20131871) and of the German Empire (1871\u20131918), and maintained its self-ruling status during the Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933). Hamburg acceded to the German Customs Union or Zollverein in 1888, the last (along with Bremen) of the German states to join. The city experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's Atlantic trade helped make it Europe's second-largest port. The Hamburg-America Line, with Albert Ballin as its director, became the world's largest transatlantic shipping company around the start of the 20th century. Shipping companies sailing to South America, Africa, India and East Asia were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for many Germans and Eastern Europeans to emigrate to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves there.\nA major outbreak of cholera in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.\nSecond World War.\nHamburg was a within the administrative division of Nazi Germany from 1934 until 1945. During the Second World War, the Allied bombing of Hamburg devastated much of the city and the harbour. On 23 July 1943, the Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Army Air Force firebombing created a firestorm which spread from the (main railway station) and quickly moved south-east, completely destroying entire boroughs such as Hammerbrook, Billbrook and Hamm South. Thousands of people perished in these densely populated working class boroughs. The raids, codenamed Operation Gomorrah by the RAF, killed at least 42,600 civilians; the precise number is not known. About one million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids. While some of the boroughs destroyed were rebuilt as residential districts after the war, others such as Hammerbrook were entirely developed into office, retail and limited residential or industrial districts.\nThe Hamburg Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery is in the greater Ohlsdorf Cemetery in the north of Hamburg.\nAt least 42,900 people are thought to have perished in the Neuengamme concentration camp (about outside the city in the marshlands), mostly from epidemics and in the destruction of Kriegsmarine vessels housing evacuees at the end of the war.\nSystematic deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent started on 18 October 1941. These were all directed to ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe or to concentration camps. Most deported persons perished in the Holocaust. By the end of 1942, the \"J\u00fcdischer Religionsverband in Hamburg\" was dissolved as an independent legal entity and its remaining assets and staff were assumed by the Reich Association of Jews in Germany (District Northwest). On 10 June 1943, the Reich Security Main Office dissolved the association by a decree. The few remaining employees not somewhat protected by a mixed marriage were deported from Hamburg on 23 June to Theresienstadt, where most of them perished. About 7800 Hamburg Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, of the nearly 17 thousand who had lived in the city before Hitler's rise to power.\nPost-war history.\nThe city was surrendered to British Forces on 3 May 1945, in the Battle of Hamburg, three days after Adolf Hitler's death. After the Second World War, Hamburg formed part of the British Zone of Occupation; it became a state of West Germany in 1949.\nOn 16 February 1962, a North Sea flood caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one-fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people.\nThe inner German border \u2013 only east of Hamburg \u2013 separated the city from much of its hinterland and reduced Hamburg's global trade. Since German reunification in 1990, and the accession of several Central European and Baltic countries into the European Union in 2004, the Port of Hamburg has restarted ambitions for regaining its position as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre.\nGeography.\nHamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast. It is on the River Elbe at its confluence with the Alster and Bille. The city centre is around the Binnenalster (\"Inner Alster\") and Au\u00dfenalster (\"Outer Alster\"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The islands of Neuwerk, Scharh\u00f6rn, and Nigeh\u00f6rn, away in the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park, are also part of the city of Hamburg.\nThe neighbourhoods of Neuenfelde, Cranz, Francop and Finkenwerder are part of the \"Altes Land\" (old land) region, the largest contiguous fruit-producing region in Central Europe. Neugraben-Fischbek has Hamburg's highest elevation, the Hasselbrack at AMSL. Hamburg borders the states of Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony.\nClimate.\nHamburg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"; Trewartha: \"Dobk\"), influenced by its proximity to the coast and maritime influences that originate over the Atlantic Ocean. The location in the north of Germany provides extremes greater than typical marine climates, but definitely in the category due to the prevailing westerlies. Nearby wetlands enjoy a maritime temperate climate. The amount of snowfall has varied greatly in recent decades. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, heavy snowfall sometimes occurred, the winters of recent years have been less cold, with snowfall just a few days per year.\nThe warmest months are June, July, and August, with high temperatures of . The coldest are December, January, and February, with low temperatures of . The annual extreme temperatures range from on 13 February 1940, to on 20 July 2022, and the latter was measured at Hamburg-Neuwiedenthal Meteorological Station, on the same day, a high temperature record of was recorded at Hamburg Airport.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOn 31 December 2016, there were 1,860,759 people registered as living in Hamburg in an area of . The population density was . The metropolitan area of the Hamburg region (Hamburg Metropolitan Region) is home to 5,107,429 living on .\nThere were 915,319 women and 945,440 men in Hamburg. For every 1,000 females, there were 1,033 males. In 2015, there were 19,768 births in Hamburg (of which 38.3% were to unmarried women); 6422 marriages and 3190 divorces, and 17,565 deaths. In the city, 16.1% of the population was under the age of 18, while 18.3% was 65 years of age or older. There were 356 people in Hamburg over the age of 100.\nAccording to the Statistical Office for Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, there were 631,246 residents with a migrant background, representing 34% of the population. Immigrants come from 200 countries. 5,891 people have acquired German cititzenship in 2016.\nIn 2016, there were 1,021,666 households, of which 17.8% had children under the age of 18; 54.4% of all households were made up of singles. 25.6% of all households were single parent households. The average household size was 1.8.\nPortuguese community.\nHamburg has the largest Portuguese community in Germany; the city is home to about 30,000 people of Portuguese heritage. Many Portuguese sailors and merchants came to Hamburg beginning in the 15th century due to its port. Since the 1970s, there has been a district in Hamburg called the Portugiesenviertel (Portuguese quarter) where many Portuguese people settled and which has a variety of Portuguese restaurants, cafes and shops that attract many tourists. There are several statues, squares and streets in Hamburg that are named after Portuguese historical figures. These include the Vasco da Gama statue on the Kornhaus bridge, which was suggested by Portuguese residents to bring visibility to the Portuguese community in Hamburg.\nAfghan community.\nHamburg's Afghan community of about 50,000 people is the largest not only in Germany, but also in Europe. They first came to Hamburg in the 1970s before expanding during the Afghan conflict in the 1980s and 1990s where many Afghan migrants chose to live in Hamburg. After 2015 the Afghan population almost doubled due to a new influx from the migrant crisis. There is an area in Hamburg behind the central station where many Afghan restaurants and shops are located. Many carpet businesses in Speicherstadt are operated by Afghan traders, with Hamburg still a global leader in the trade of oriental rugs.\nForeign residents.\nThe breakdown of all Hamburg residents with foreign citizenship (as of 31 December 2016) by their continent of origin is as follows:\nLanguage.\nAs elsewhere in Germany, Standard German is spoken in Hamburg, but as typical for northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is Low German, usually referred to as \"Hamborger Platt\" (German \"Hamburger Platt\") or \"Hamborgsch\". Since large-scale standardisation of the German language beginning in earnest in the 18th century, various Low German-coloured dialects have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates). Originally, there was a range of such Missingsch varieties, the best-known being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat more bourgeois \"Hanseatendeutsch\" (Hanseatic German), although the term is used in appreciation. All of these are now moribund due to the influences of Standard German used by education and media. However, the former importance of Low German is indicated by several songs, such as the sea shanty Hamborger Veermaster, written in the 19th century when Low German was used more frequently. Many toponyms and street names reflect Low Saxon vocabulary, partially even in Low Saxon spelling, which is not standardised, and to some part in forms adapted to Standard German.\nReligion.\nIn 2018, 65.2% of the population was not religious or adhered to religions other than the Evangelical Church or Catholicism.\nIn 2018, 24.9% of the population belonged to the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church, the largest religious body, and 9.9% to the Roman Catholic Church. Hamburg is the seat of one of the three bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany, as well as of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg.\nAccording to the publication (\"Muslim life in Germany\"), an estimated 141,900 Muslim migrants (from nearly 50 countries of origin) lived in Hamburg in 2008. About three years later (May 2011) calculations based on census data for 21 countries of origin resulted in a figure of about 143,200 Muslim migrants in Hamburg, making up 8.4% percent of the population. As of 2021[ [update]], there were more than 50 mosques in the city, including the Ahmadiyya run Fazle Omar Mosque, which is the oldest in the city, and which hosts the Islamic Centre Hamburg.\nA Jewish Community also exists. As of 2022, around 2,500 Jews live in Hamburg.\nGovernment.\nThe city of Hamburg is one of 16 German states, therefore the Mayor of Hamburg's office corresponds more to the role of a minister-president than to that of a city mayor. As a German state government, it is responsible for public education, correctional institutions and public safety; as a municipality, it is additionally responsible for libraries, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.\nSince 1897, the seat of the government has been Hamburg City Hall (Hamburg Rathaus), with the office of the mayor, the meeting room for the Senate and the floor for the Hamburg Parliament. From 2001 until 2010, the mayor of Hamburg was Ole von Beust, who governed in Germany's first statewide \"black-green\" coalition, consisting of the conservative CDU Hamburg and the alternative GAL, which are Hamburg's regional wing of the Alliance 90/The Greens party. Von Beust was briefly succeeded by Christoph Ahlhaus in 2010, but the coalition broke apart on 28 November 2010. On 7 March 2011 Olaf Scholz (SPD) became mayor. After the 2015 election the SPD and the Alliance 90/The Greens formed a coalition.\nBoroughs.\nHamburg is made up of seven boroughs (German: \"Bezirke\"), which are subdivided into 104 quarters (German: \"Stadtteile\"). There are 181 localities (German: \"Ortsteile\"). The urban organisation is regulated by the Constitution of Hamburg and several laws. Most of the quarters were former independent cities, towns or villages annexed into Hamburg proper. The last large annexation was done through the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, when the cities Altona, Harburg, and Wandsbek were merged into the state of Hamburg. The \"Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg\" established Hamburg as a state and a municipality. Some of the boroughs and quarters have been rearranged several times.\nEach borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: \"Bezirksversammlung\") and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: \"Bezirksamtsleiter\"). The boroughs are not independent municipalities: their power is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Hamburg. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by Hamburg's Senate. The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.\nFollowing the latest territorial reform of March 2008, the boroughs are Hamburg-Mitte, Altona, Eimsb\u00fcttel, Hamburg-Nord, Wandsbek, Bergedorf, and Harburg.\n\"Hamburg-Mitte\" (\"Hamburg Centre\") covers mostly the urban centre of the city and consists of the quarters Billbrook, Billstedt, Borgfelde, Finkenwerder, HafenCity, Hamm, Hammerbrook, Horn, Kleiner Grasbrook, Neuwerk, Rothenburgsort, St. Georg, St. Pauli, Steinwerder, Veddel, Waltershof, and Wilhelmsburg. The quarters Hamburg-Altstadt (\"old town\") and Neustadt (\"new town\") are the historical origin of Hamburg.\n\"Altona\" is the westernmost urban borough, on the right bank of the Elbe river. From 1640 to 1864, Altona was under the administration of the Danish monarchy. Altona was an independent city until 1937. Politically, the following quarters are part of Altona: Altona-Altstadt, Altona-Nord, Bahrenfeld, Ottensen, Othmarschen, Gro\u00df Flottbek, Osdorf, Lurup, Nienstedten, Blankenese, Iserbrook, S\u00fclldorf, Rissen, and Sternschanze.\n\"Bergedorf\" consists of the quarters Allerm\u00f6he, Altengamme, Bergedorf\u2014the centre of the former independent town, Billwerder, Curslack, Kirchwerder, Lohbr\u00fcgge, Moorfleet, Neuengamme, Neuallerm\u00f6he, Ochsenwerder, Reitbrook, Spadenland, and Tatenberg.\n\"Eimsb\u00fcttel\" is split into nine quarters: Eidelstedt, Eimsb\u00fcttel, Harvestehude, Hoheluft-West, Lokstedt, Niendorf, Rotherbaum, Schnelsen, and Stellingen. Located within this borough is former Jewish neighbourhood of Grindel.\n\"Hamburg-Nord\" contains the quarters Alsterdorf, Barmbek-Nord, Barmbek-S\u00fcd, Dulsberg, Eppendorf, Fuhlsb\u00fcttel, Gro\u00df Borstel, Hoheluft-Ost, Hohenfelde, Langenhorn, Ohlsdorf with Ohlsdorf cemetery, Uhlenhorst, and Winterhude.\n\"Harburg\" is situated on the southern shores of the river Elbe and covers parts of the port of Hamburg, residential and rural areas, and some research institutes. The quarters are Altenwerder, Cranz, Ei\u00dfendorf, Francop, Gut Moor, Harburg, Hausbruch, Heimfeld, Langenbek, Marmstorf, Moorburg, Neuenfelde, Neugraben-Fischbek, Neuland, R\u00f6nneburg, Sinstorf, and Wilstorf.\n\"Wandsbek\" is divided into the quarters Bergstedt, Bramfeld, Duvenstedt, Eilbek, Farmsen-Berne, Hummelsb\u00fcttel, Jenfeld, Lemsahl-Mellingstedt, Marienthal, Poppenb\u00fcttel, Rahlstedt, Sasel, Steilshoop, Tonndorf, Volksdorf, Wandsbek, Wellingsb\u00fcttel, and Wohldorf-Ohlstedt.\nCityscape.\nArchitecture.\nHamburg has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles and just one skyscraper under construction (see List of tallest buildings in Hamburg). Churches are important landmarks, such as St Nicholas', which for a short time in the 19th century was the world's tallest building. The skyline features the tall spires of the most important churches (\"Hauptkirchen\") St Michael's (nicknamed \"Michel\"), St Peter's, St James's (\"St. Jacobi\"), and St. Catherine's covered with copper plates, and the Heinrich-Hertz-Turm, the radio and television tower (no longer publicly accessible).\nThe many streams, rivers, and canals are crossed by some 2,500 bridges, more than London, Amsterdam, and Venice put together. Hamburg has more bridges inside its city limits than any other city in the world. The K\u00f6hlbrandbr\u00fccke, Freihafen Elbbr\u00fccken, Lombardsbr\u00fccke, and Kennedybr\u00fccke dividing Binnenalster from Aussenalster are important roadways.\nThe town hall is a richly decorated Neo-Renaissance building finished in 1897.\nThe tower is high. Its fa\u00e7ade, long, depicts the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, since Hamburg was, as a Free Imperial City, only under the sovereignty of the emperor. The Chilehaus, a brick expressionist office building built in 1922 and designed by architect Fritz H\u00f6ger, is shaped like an ocean liner.\nEurope's largest urban development since 2008, the HafenCity, will house about 15,000 inhabitants and 45,000 workers. The plan includes designs by Rem Koolhaas and Renzo Piano. The Elbphilharmonie \"(Elbe Philharmonic Hall)\", opened in January 2017, houses concerts in a sail-shaped building on top of an old warehouse, designed by architects \"Herzog &amp; de Meuron\".\nThe many parks are distributed over the whole city, which makes Hamburg a very verdant city. The biggest parks are the \"Stadtpark\", the Ohlsdorf Cemetery, and Planten un Blomen. The \"Stadtpark\", Hamburg's \"Central Park\", has a great lawn and a huge water tower, which houses one of Europe's biggest planetaria. The park and its buildings were designed by Fritz Schumacher in the 1910s.\nParks and gardens.\nThe lavish and spacious \"Planten un Blomen\" park (Low German dialect for \"plants and flowers\") located in the centre of Hamburg is the green heart of the city. Within the park are various thematic gardens, the biggest Japanese garden in Germany, and the \"Alter Botanischer Garten Hamburg\", which is a historic botanical garden that now consists primarily of greenhouses.\nThe \"Botanischer Garten Hamburg\" is a modern botanical garden maintained by the University of Hamburg. Besides these, there are many more parks of various sizes. In 2014 Hamburg celebrated a birthday of park culture, where many parks were reconstructed and cleaned up. Moreover, every year there are water-light-concerts in the \"Planten un Blomen\" park, from May to early October.\nCulture.\nFrom the 1760s, the theatre director Abel Seyler\u2014the leader of the Hamburg National Theatre and subsequently the Seyler Theatre Company\u2014established Hamburg as one of the leading European centres of theatrical innovation, promoting experimental productions and pioneering a new more realist style of acting, introducing Shakespeare to a German-language audience, and promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of Ludvig Holberg, the Sturm und Drang playwrights, and serious German opera.\nToday Hamburg has more than 40 theatres, 60 museums, and 100 music venues and clubs. With 6.6 music venues per 100,000 inhabitants, Hamburg has the second-highest density of music venues of Germany's largest cities, after Munich and ahead of Cologne and Berlin. In 2005, more than 18\u00a0million people visited concerts, exhibitions, theatres, cinemas, museums, and cultural events, and 8,552 taxable companies (average size: 3.16 employees) were engaged in the culture sector, which includes music, performing arts, and literature. The creative industries represent almost one-fifth of all companies in Hamburg.\nHamburg has entered the European Green Capital Award scheme, and was awarded the title of European Green Capital for 2011.\nTheatres.\nTheatres in the city include the state-owned \"Deutsches Schauspielhaus\", the Thalia Theatre, Ohnsorg Theatre, \"Schmidts Tivoli\", and the \"Kampnagel\".\nThe English Theatre of Hamburg, near the U3 station Mundsburg, was founded in 1976 and is the oldest professional English-language theatre in Germany, with exclusively English-speaking actors in its company.\nMuseums.\nHamburg has several large museums and galleries showing classical and contemporary art, such as the Kunsthalle Hamburg with its contemporary art gallery (\"Galerie der Gegenwart\"), the \"Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe\" (Museum of Art and Design), and the Deichtorhallen (with the House of Photography and Hall of Contemporary Art). The Internationales Maritimes Museum Hamburg opened in the HafenCity quarter in 2008. There are various specialised museums in Hamburg, such as the \"Arch\u00e4ologisches Museum Hamburg\" (Hamburg Archaeological Museum) in the Harburg borough, the Hamburg Museum of Work (\"Museum der Arbeit\"), and several museums of local history, such as the Kiekeberg Open Air Museum (\"Freilichtmuseum am Kiekeberg\") at Kiekeberg in the Harburg Hills, just outside of Hamburg, in Rosengarten. Two museum ships near St. Pauli Piers (\"Landungsbr\u00fccken\") bear witness to the freight ship (\"Cap San Diego\") and cargo sailing ship era (\"Rickmer Rickmers\"). In 2017 the Hamburg-built iron-hulled sailing ship \"Peking\" returned to the city and was installed in the German Port Museum in 2020. The world's largest model railway museum, Miniatur Wunderland, with total railway length, is also situated near St. Pauli Piers in a former warehouse.\nBallinStadt, a memorial park and former emigration station, is dedicated to the millions of Europeans who emigrated to North and South America between 1850 and 1939. Visitors descending from those overseas emigrants may search for their ancestors at computer terminals.\nMusic.\nHamburg State Opera is a leading opera company. Its orchestra is the Philharmoniker Hamburg. The city's other major orchestra is the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra. The main concert venue is the new concert hall Elbphilharmonie. Before it was the Laeiszhalle, \"Musikhalle Hamburg\". The Laeiszhalle also houses a third orchestra, the Hamburger Symphoniker. Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti and Alfred Schnittke taught at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater Hamburg.\nHamburg is the birthplace of Johannes Brahms, who spent his formative early years in the city, and the birthplace and home of waltz composer Oscar Fetr\u00e1s, who wrote the \"Mondnacht auf der Alster\" waltz.\nSince the German premiere of \"Cats\" in 1986, there have always been musicals running, including \"The Phantom of the Opera\", \"The Lion King\", \"Dirty Dancing\", and \"Dance of the Vampires\". This density, the highest in Germany, is partly due to the major musical production company Stage Entertainment being based in the city.\nIn addition to musicals, opera houses, concert halls, and theatres, the cityscape is characterised by a large music scene. This includes, among other things, over 100 music venues, several annual festivals and over 50 event organisers based in Hamburg. Larger venues include the Barclaycard Arena, the Bahrenfeld harness racing track, and Hamburg City Park.\nHamburg was an important centre of rock music in the early 1960s. The Beatles lived and played in Hamburg from August 1960 to December 1962. They proved popular and gained local acclaim. Prior to the group's initial recording and widespread fame, Hamburg provided residency and performing venues for the band during the time they performed there. One of the venues they performed at was the Star-Club on St. Pauli.\nPop musicians from Hamburg include Udo Lindenberg, Deichkind, and Jan Delay. The singer Annett Louisan lives in the city.\nAn important meeting place for Hamburg musicians from the 1970s to the mid-1980s was the jazz pub Onkel P\u00f6, which was originally founded in the P\u00f6seldorf neighbourhood and later moved to Eppendorf. Many musicians who were counted as part of the \"Hamburg scene\" met here. In addition to Udo Lindenberg, these included Otto Waalkes, Hans Scheibner and groups such as Torfrock and Frumpy. One of the members of the band Frumpy was the Hamburg-born singer and composer Inga Rumpf.\nHamburg is the origin of the \"Hamburger Schule\", a term used for alternative music bands like Tocotronic, Blumfeld, Tomte or Kante. The meeting point of the Hamburg School was long considered to be the Golden Pudel Club in Altona's old town, near the Fischmarkt. Alongside clubs such as the Pal, the Moondoo or the Waagenbau, today the Pudel is a central location of the Hamburg electro scene. Artists of this scene include the DJ duo Moonbootica, Mladen Solomun, and Helena Hauff.\nHamburg is also home to many music labels, music distributors and publishers. These include Warner Music, Kontor Records, PIAS, Edel SE &amp; Co. KGaA, Believe Digital, and Indigo. The high proportion of independent labels in the city, which include Audiolith, Dial Records, Grand Hotel van Cleef, among others, is striking. Before its closure, the label L'\u00c2ge d'or also belonged to these.\nIn addition, Hamburg has a considerable alternative and punk scene, which gathers around the Rote Flora, a squatted former theatre located in the Sternschanze.\nThe city was a major centre for heavy metal music in the 1980s. Helloween, Gamma Ray, Running Wild, and Grave Digger started in Hamburg. The industrial rock band KMFDM was also formed in Hamburg, initially as a performance art project. The influences of these and other bands from the area helped establish the subgenre of power metal.\nIn the late 1990s, Hamburg was considered one of the strongholds of the German hip-hop scene. Bands like Beginner shaped the city's hip-hop style and made it a serious location for the hip-hop scene through songs like \"Hamburg City Blues\". In addition to Beginner, German hip-hop acts from Hamburg include F\u00fcnf Sterne Deluxe, Samy Deluxe, Fettes Brot, and 187 Strassenbande.\nHamburg has a vibrant psychedelic trance community, with record labels such as Spirit Zone.\nFestivals and regular events.\nHamburg is noted for several festivals and regular events. Some of them are street festivals, such as the LGBT pride Hamburg Pride festival or the Alster fair (German: \"Alstervergn\u00fcgen\"), held at the \"Binnenalster\". The \"Hamburger DOM\" is northern Germany's biggest funfair, held three times a year. \"Hafengeburtstag\" is a funfair to honour the birthday of the port of Hamburg with a party and a ship parade. The annual biker's service in Saint Michael's Church attracts tens of thousands of bikers. Christmas markets in December are held at the Hamburg Rathaus square, among other places. The \"long night of museums\" (German: \"Lange Nacht der Museen\") offers one entrance fee for about 40 museums until midnight. The sixth \"Festival of Cultures\" was held in September 2008, celebrating multi-cultural life. The Filmfest Hamburg \u2014 a film festival originating from the 1950s \"Film Days\" (German: \"Film Tage\") \u2014 presents a wide range of films. The \"Hamburg Messe und Congress\" offers a venue for trade shows, such \"hanseboot\", an international boat show, or \"Du und deine Welt\", a large consumer products show. Regular sports events\u2014some open to pro and amateur participants\u2014are the cycling competition EuroEyes Cyclassics, the Hamburg Marathon, the biggest marathon in Germany after Berlin, the tennis tournament Hamburg Masters, and equestrian events like the Deutsches Derby.\nHamburg is also known for its music and festival culture. For example, the Reeperbahn alone has between 25 and 30 million visitors every year. In addition, there are over a million visitors to the annual festivals and major music events. Hamburg's festivals include the https:// , which takes place 2 days a year (usually on the Whitsun weekend) in Hamburg's harbour and HafenCity.\nFor contemporary and experimental music, the \"blurred edges\" festival usually follows in May at various venues within Hamburg. In mid-August, the MS Dockville music and arts festival has run annually since 2007 in the Wilhelmsburg district. This is followed at the end of September by the Reeperbahn Festival, which has been running since 2006. As Europe's largest club festival, it offers several hundred program points around the Reeperbahn in Hamburg over four days and is one of the most important meeting places for the music industry worldwide. In November, the \u00dcberjazz Festival, which aims to expand the stylistic boundaries of the concept of jazz, starts every year at Kampnagel.\nCuisine.\nOriginal Hamburg dishes include \"Birnen, Bohnen und Speck\" (green beans cooked with pears and bacon). \"Aalsuppe\" (Hamburgisch \"Oolsupp\") is often mistaken to be German for \"eel soup\" (\"Aal\"/\"Ool\" translated 'eel'), but the name probably comes from the Low Saxon \"allns\" , meaning \"all\", \"everything and the kitchen sink\", not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the expectations of unsuspecting diners. There is \"Bratkartoffeln\" (pan-fried potato slices), \"Finkenwerder Scholle\" (Low Saxon \"Finkwarder Scholl\", pan-fried plaice), \"Pannfisch\" (pan-fried fish with mustard sauce), \"Rote Gr\u00fctze\" (Low Saxon \"Rode Gr\u00fctt\", related to Danish \"r\u00f8dgr\u00f8d\", a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish \"r\u00f8dgr\u00f8d med fl\u00f8de\"), and \"Labskaus\" (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes, and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian \"lapskaus\" and Liverpool's lobscouse, all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).\n\"Alsterwasser\" (in reference to the city's river, the Alster) is the local name for a type of shandy, a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (\"Zitronenlimonade\"), the lemonade being added to the beer.\nA regional dessert pastry called \"Franzbr\u00f6tchen\" is similar in preparation to a croissant, but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar streusel. Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is \"Schrippe\" (scored lengthways) for the oval kind and, for the round kind, \"Rundst\u00fcck\" (\"round piece\" rather than mainstream German \"Br\u00f6tchen\", diminutive form of \"Brot\" \"bread\"), a relative of Denmark's \"rundstykke\". The cuisines of Hamburg and Denmark, especially of Copenhagen, have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish.\nThe American hamburger may have developed from Hamburg's \"Frikadeller\": a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked stale bread, egg, chopped onion, salt, and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun. The Oxford Dictionary defined a \"Hamburger steak\" in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America. The name and food, \"hamburger\", has entered all English-speaking countries, and derivative words in non-English speaking countries.\nThere are restaurants which offer most of these dishes, especially in the HafenCity.\nAlternative culture.\nHamburg has long been a centre of alternative music and counter-culture movements. The boroughs of St. Pauli, Sternschanze, and Altona are known for being home to many radical left-wing and anarchist groups, culminating every year during the traditional May Day demonstrations.\nDuring the 2017 G20 summit, which took place in Hamburg from 7\u20138 July that year, protestors clashed violently with the police in the Sternschanze area and particularly around the Rote Flora. On 7 July, several cars were set on fire and street barricades were erected to prevent the police from entering the area. In response to that, the police made heavy use of water cannons and tear gas in order to scatter the protestors. However, this was met with strong resistance by protestors, resulting in a total of 160 injured police and 75 arrested participants in the protests.\nAfter the summit, however, the Rote Flora issued a statement, in which it condemns the arbitrary acts of violence that were committed by some of the protestors whilst generally defending the right to use violence as a means of self-defence against police oppression. In particular, the spokesperson of the Rote Flora said that the autonomous cultural centre had a traditionally good relationship with its neighbours and local residents, since they were united in their fight against gentrification in that neighbourhood.\nBritish, American and English-speaking culture.\nThere are several English-speaking communities, such as the Caledonian Society of Hamburg, The British Club Hamburg, British and Commonwealth Luncheon Club, Anglo-German Club e.V., Professional Women's Forum, The British Decorative and Fine Arts Society, The English Speaking Union of the Commonwealth, The Scottish Country Dancers of Hamburg, The Hamburg Players e.V. English Language Theatre Group, The Hamburg Exiles Rugby Club, several cricket clubs, and The Morris Minor Register of Hamburg. Furthermore, the Anglo-Hanseatic Lodge No. 850 within the Grand Lodge of British Freemasons of Germany under the United Grand Lodges of Germany works in Hamburg, and has a diverse expat membership. There is also a 400-year-old Anglican church community worshipping at St Thomas Becket Church.\nAmerican and international English-speaking organisations include The American Club of Hamburg e.V., the American Women's Club of Hamburg, the English Speaking Union, the German-American Women's Club, and The International Women's Club of Hamburg e.V. \"The American Chamber of Commerce\" handles matters related to business affairs. The International School of Hamburg serves school children.\nWilliam Wordsworth, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge spent the last two weeks of September 1798 at Hamburg. Dorothy wrote a detailed journal of their stay, labelled \"The Hamburg Journal (1798) by noted Wordsworth scholar Edward de Selincourt.\nA Hamburg saying, referring to its anglophile nature, is: \"Wenn es in London anf\u00e4ngt zu regnen, spannen die Hamburger den Schirm auf\". ... \"When it starts raining in London, people in Hamburg open their umbrellas\".\nMemorials.\nA memorial for English engineer William Lindley, who, beginning in 1842, reorganised the drinking water and sewerage system and thus helped to fight against cholera, is near Baumwall railway station in Vorsetzen street. \nIn 2009, more than 2,500 \"stumbling blocks\" (\"Stolpersteine\") were laid, engraved with the names of deported and murdered citizens. Inserted into the pavement in front of their former houses, the blocks draw attention to the victims of Nazi persecution.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of Hamburg was \u20ac119.0\u00a0billion in 2018, accounting for 3.6% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was \u20ac59,600 or 197% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 132% of the EU average. The city has a relatively high employment rate, at 88 percent of the working-age population, employed in over 160,000 businesses. The median gross salary in 2021 was \u20ac47,544, which is 9.29% higher than the median gross salary in Germany overall.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in October 2018 and was higher than the German average.\nBanking.\nHamburg has for centuries been a commercial centre of Northern Europe, and is the most important banking city of Northern Germany. The city is the seat of Germany's oldest bank, the Berenberg Bank, M.M.Warburg &amp; CO, and Hamburg Commercial Bank. The Hamburg Stock Exchange is the oldest of its kind in Germany.\nPort.\nThe most significant economic unit is the Port of Hamburg, which ranks third to Rotterdam and Antwerp in Europe and 17th-largest worldwide, with transshipments of 8.9\u00a0million\u00a0twenty-foot equivalent units\u00a0(TEU) of cargo and 138.2\u00a0million tons of goods in 2016. International trade is also the reason for the large number of consulates in the city. Although situated up the Elbe, it is considered a seaport due to its ability to handle large ocean-going vessels.\nIndustrial production.\nHeavy industry of Hamburg includes the making of steel, aluminium, copper and various large shipyards such as Blohm + Voss.\nHamburg, along with Seattle and Toulouse, is an important location of the civil aerospace industry. Airbus, which operates the Hamburg-Finkenwerder assembly plant in Finkenwerder, employs over 13,000\u00a0people.\nHafenCity.\nThe HafenCity is Europe's largest urban development project and is located in the Hamburg-Mitte district. It consists of the area of the Great Grasbrook, the northern part of the former Elbe island Grasbrook, and the warehouse district on the former Elbe island Kehrwieder and Wandrahm. It is bordered to the north, separated by the customs channel to Hamburg's city centre, west and south by the Elbe, and to the east, bounded by the upper harbour, Rothenburgsort. The district is full of rivers and streams and is surrounded by channels, and has a total area of about .\nHafenCity has in the area formerly belonging to the free port north of the Great Grasbrook. Residential units for up to 12,000 people are planned to be built on the site by around the mid-2020s, and jobs for up to 40,000 people, mainly in the office sector, should be created. It is the largest ongoing urban development project in Hamburg.\nConstruction work started in 2003, and in 2009 the first part of the urban development project was finished with the completion of the Dalmannkai / Sandtorkai neighbourhood \u2013 which is the first stage of the HafenCity project. According to the person responsible for the development and commercialisation of HafenCity, \"HafenCity Hamburg GmbH\", half of the master plan underlying structural construction is already completed, whereas the other half is either under construction or is in the construction preparation stages.\nTourism.\nIn 2017, more than 6,783,000\u00a0visitors with 13,822,000\u00a0overnight stays visited the city. The tourism sector employs more than 175,000 people full-time and brings in revenue of almost \u20ac9\u00a0billion, making the tourism industry a major economic force in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Hamburg has one of the fastest-growing tourism industries in Germany. From 2001 to 2007, the overnight stays in the city increased by 55.2% (Berlin +52.7%, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern +33%).\nThe area of Reeperbahn, in the quarter St. Pauli, is Europe's largest red light district and home of strip clubs, brothels, bars, and nightclubs. The singer and actor Hans Albers is strongly associated with St. Pauli, and wrote the neighbourhood's unofficial anthem, \"Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts um Halb Eins\" (\"On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight\"), in the 1940s. The Beatles had stints on the Reeperbahn early in their careers. Others prefer the laid-back neighbourhood \"Schanze\", with its street caf\u00e9s, or a barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. Hamburg's zoo, the Tierpark Hagenbeck, was founded in 1907 by Carl Hagenbeck as the first zoo with moated, barless enclosures.\nIn 2016, the average visitor spent two nights in Hamburg. The majority of visitors come from Germany. Most foreigners are European, especially from Denmark (395,681 overnight stays), the United Kingdom (301,000 overnight stays), Switzerland (340,156 overnight stays), Austria (about 252,397 overnight stays), and the Netherlands (about 182,610 overnight stays).

There is also the smaller Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport, used only as a company airport for Airbus. Some airlines market L\u00fcbeck Airport in L\u00fcbeck as serving Hamburg.\nHamburg's licence plate prefix is \"HH\" (Hansestadt Hamburg; English: Hanseatic City of Hamburg), used between 1906 and 1945 and from 1956 onwards, rather than the single letter normally used for large cities since the federal registration reform in 1956, such as B for Berlin or M for Munich. \"H\" was Hamburg's prefix in the years between 1945 and 1947; it has used by Hanover since 1956.\nPublic transport.\n Public transport by rail, bus, and ship is organised by the \"Hamburger Verkehrsverbund\" (\"Hamburg transit authority\") (HVV). Tickets sold by one company are valid on all other HVV companies' services. The HVV was the first organisation of this kind worldwide.\nThirty-three mass transit rail lines across the city are the backbone of public transport. The S-Bahn (commuter train system) comprises six lines and the U-Bahn four lines \u2013 \"U-Bahn\" is short for \"Untergrundbahn\" (underground railway). Approximately of of the U-Bahn is underground; most is on embankments or viaduct or at ground level. Older residents still speak of the system as \"Hochbahn\" (elevated railway), also because the operating company of the subway is the \"Hamburger Hochbahn\". The AKN railway connects satellite towns in Schleswig-Holstein to the city. On some routes regional trains of Germany's major railway company Deutsche Bahn AG and the regional \"metronom\" trains may be used with an HVV ticket. Regional trains stop at various stations within city limits such as the four larger stations, Hauptbahnhof, Dammtor, Altona, and Harburg, as well as Hamburg Hasselbrook and Hamburg Bergedorf. The tram system was opened in 1866 and shut down in 1978.\nGaps in the rail network are filled by more than 669 bus routes, operated by single-deck two-, three- and four-axle diesel buses. Hamburg has no trams or trolleybuses, but has hydrogen-fuelled buses. The buses run frequently during working hours, with buses on the MetroBus routes running every ten minutes from 6 am to 9 pm. On special weekday night lines the intervals can be 30 minutes or more, while on normal days (Monday-Friday) normal buses stop running at night (some lines run 24 hours a day, every day of the year at least every half hour).\nThere are eight ferry lines along the River Elbe, operated by \"HADAG\", that fall under the aegis of the HVV. While mainly used by citizens and dock workers, they can also be used for sightseeing tours.\nThe international airport serving Hamburg, Hamburg Airport Helmut Schmidt (IATA: HAM, ICAO: EDDH), is the fifth biggest and oldest airport in Germany, having been established in 1912 and located about from the city centre.

Hamburg is a secondary hub for Lufthansa, which is the largest carrier at the airport, and the airline also operates one of its biggest Lufthansa Technik maintenance facilities there. The second airport is located in Hamburg-Finkenwerder, officially named Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport (IATA: XFW, ICAO: EDHI). It is about from the city centre and is a nonpublic airport for the Airbus plant. It is the second biggest Airbus plant, after Toulouse, and the third biggest aviation manufacturing plant after Seattle and Toulouse; the plant houses the final assembly lines for A318, A319, A320, A321, and A380 aircraft.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Hamburg, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 58 min. 16% of public transit riders, ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 11% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.9\u00a0km, while 21% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nUtilities.\nElectricity for Hamburg and Northern Germany is largely provided by \"Vattenfall Europe\", formerly the state-owned \"Hamburgische Electricit\u00e4ts-Werke\". Vattenfall Europe used to operate the Brunsb\u00fcttel Nuclear Power Plant and Kr\u00fcmmel Nuclear Power Plant, both taken out of service as part of the nuclear power phase-out. In addition, E.ON operates the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant, near Hamburg. There are also the coal-fired Wedel, Tiefstack, and Moorburg CHP Plant, and the fuel-cell power plant in the HafenCity quarter. \"VERA Kl\u00e4rschlammverbrennung\" uses the biosolids of the Hamburg wastewater treatment plant; the \"Pumpspeicherwerk Geesthacht\" is a pump storage power plant and a solid waste combustion power station is \"M\u00fcllverwertung Borsigstra\u00dfe\".\nIn June 2019, Hamburg introduced a law governing the phasing out of coal based thermal and electric energy production (\"Kohleausstiegsgesetz\"). This move was the result of negotiations between parliamentary parties and representatives of a campaign called \"Tschuess Kohle] (\"Goodbye Coal\").\" In 2020, the city's Ministry for Environment and Energy announced a partnership with Namibia as a potential supplier of woody biomass, sourced through landscape maintenance in areas affected by woody plant encroachment, to replace coal.\nSports.\nHamburger SV is a football team playing in the Bundesliga.

A hurried and superficial search turns up only crayfish, people from Pinneberg, and those from Bergedorf. One accompanies the contented little kippers of a striving society; mackerels from Stade, sole from Finkenwerder, herrings from Cuxhaven swim in expectant throngs through the streets of my city and lobsters patrol the stock exchange with open claws... The first so-called unguarded glance always lands on the bottom of the sea and falls into twilight of the aquarium. Heinrich Heine must have had the same experience when he tried, with his cultivated scorn and gifted melancholy, to find the people of Hamburg.\u2014\u200a\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Psychological hedonism is the theory that all human behavior is motivated by the desire to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. As a form of egoism, it suggests that people only help others if they expect a personal benefit. Axiological hedonism is the view that pleasure is the sole source of intrinsic value. It asserts that other things, like knowledge and money, only have value insofar as they produce pleasure and reduce pain. This view divides into quantitative hedonism, which only considers the intensity and duration of pleasures, and qualitative hedonism, which identifies quality as another relevant factor. The closely related position of prudential hedonism states that pleasure and pain are the only factors of well-being. Ethical hedonism applies axiological hedonism to morality, arguing that people have a moral duty to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Utilitarian versions assert that the goal is to increase overall happiness for everyone, whereas egoistic versions state that each person should only pursue their own pleasure. Outside the academic context, \"hedonism\" is sometimes used as a pejorative term for an egoistic lifestyle seeking short-term gratification.\nHedonists typically understand pleasure and pain broadly to include any positive or negative experience. While traditionally seen as bodily sensations, some contemporary philosophers view them as attitudes of attraction or aversion toward objects or contents. Hedonists often use the term \"happiness\" for the balance of pleasure over pain. The subjective nature of these phenomena makes it difficult to measure this balance and compare it between different people. The paradox of hedonism and the hedonic treadmill are proposed psychological barriers to the hedonist goal of long-term happiness.\nAs one of the oldest philosophical theories, hedonism was discussed by the Cyrenaics and Epicureans in ancient Greece, the Charvaka school in ancient India, and Yangism in ancient China. It attracted less attention in the medieval period but became a central topic in the modern era with the rise of utilitarianism. Various criticisms of hedonism emerged in the 20th century, prompting its proponents to develop new versions to address these challenges. The concept of hedonism remains relevant to many fields, ranging from psychology and economics to animal ethics.\nTypes.\nThe term \"hedonism\" refers to a family of views about the role of pleasure. These views are often categorized into psychological, axiological, and ethical hedonism depending on whether they study the relation between pleasure and motivation, value, or right action, respectively. While these distinctions are common in contemporary philosophy, earlier philosophers did not always clearly differentiate between them and sometimes combined several views in their theories. The word \"hedonism\" derives from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning 'pleasure'. Its earliest known use in the English language is from the 1850s.\nPsychological hedonism.\nPsychological or motivational hedonism is the view that all human actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain. It is an empirical view about what motivates people, both on the conscious and the unconscious levels. Psychological hedonism is usually understood as a form of egoism, meaning that people strive to increase their own happiness. This implies that a person is only motivated to help others if it is in their own interest because they expect a personal benefit from it. As a theory of human motivation, psychological hedonism does not claim that all behavior leads to pleasure. For example, if a person holds mistaken beliefs or lacks necessary skills, they may attempt to produce pleasure but fail to attain the intended outcome.\nThe standard form of psychological hedonism asserts that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain are the only sources of all motivation. Some psychological hedonists propose less wide-reaching formulations, suggesting that considerations of pleasure and pain are not the only source of motivation, do not influence all actions, or are otherwise limited by certain conditions. For example, reflective or rationalizing hedonism says that human motivation is only driven by pleasure and pain when people actively reflect on the overall consequences. Another version is genetic hedonism, which accepts that people desire various things besides pleasure but asserts that each desire has its origin in a desire for pleasure. Darwinian hedonism explains the pleasure-seeking tendency from an evolutionary perspective, arguing that hedonistic impulses evolved as adaptive strategies to promote survival and reproductive success.\nProponents of psychological hedonism often highlight its intuitive appeal and explanatory power. They argue that many desires focus on pleasure directly, while others aim at pleasure indirectly by promoting its causes. A similar argument from behavioral psychology proposes that altruistic conduct is learned through conditioning, which reinforces behavior that leads to positive rewards. This view asserts that all primary motivation comes from selfish drives on which all secondary motivation, including altruism, depends. Critics of psychological hedonism often cite apparent counterexamples in which people act for reasons other than their personal pleasure. Proposed examples include acts of genuine altruism, such as a soldier sacrificing themselves on the battlefield to save their comrades or a parent wanting their children to be happy. Critics also mention non-altruistic cases, like a desire for posthumous fame. It is an open question to what extent these cases can be explained as types of pleasure-seeking behavior. Another criticism from evolutionary biology argues that altruistic motivation is conducive to survival and reproduction. It suggests that altruistic motivation produces some necessary behavior, like parental care, more reliably since it does not depend on additional mechanisms, such as the individual's belief that parental care leads to personal pleasure.\nAxiological hedonism.\nAxiological or evaluative hedonism is the view that pleasure is the ultimate source of all value. It states that things other than pleasure only have value insofar as they produce pleasure or reduce pain. This is typically explained through the distinction between intrinsic and instrumental value. An entity has intrinsic value if it is good in itself or if its worth does not depend on external factors; conversely, an entity has instrumental value if it leads to other good things. According to axiological hedonism, only pleasure is intrinsically valuable because it is good even when it produces no external benefit. Money, by contrast, is only instrumentally valuable because it can be used to acquire other good things but lacks value apart from these uses. The overall value of something depends on both its intrinsic and instrumental value. In some cases, even unpleasant experiences, like a painful surgery, can be good overall if their positive consequences, like preventing future pain, outweigh the present discomfort.\nAccording to quantitative hedonism, the intrinsic value of pleasure depends solely on its intensity and duration. Qualitative hedonists hold that the quality of pleasure is an additional factor. They argue, for instance, that subtle pleasures of the mind, like the enjoyment of fine art and philosophy, can be more valuable than simple bodily pleasures, like enjoying food and drink, even if their intensity is lower.\nPrudential hedonism is closely related to axiological hedonism, focusing specifically on well-being or what is good for an individual. It states that pleasure and pain are the sole factors of well-being, meaning that how good a life is for a person only depends on its balance of pleasure over pain. Prudential hedonism allows for the possibility that things other than well-being have intrinsic value, such as beauty or freedom.\nDiverse arguments for and against axiological hedonism have been proposed. Proponents often focus on the intuition that pleasure is valuable and the observation that people naturally desire pleasure for its own sake. A related approach acknowledges that people value things beyond pleasure, such as truth and beauty. It seeks to show that all other values have their source in the value of pleasure. Another argument assumes that the words \"good\" and \"pleasurable\" have the same meaning, implying that the pursuit of pleasure is inherently the pursuit of goodness.\nThe idea that most pleasures are valuable in some form is relatively uncontroversial. Critics usually focus on the stronger claim that all pleasures are valuable or that pleasure is the only source of intrinsic value. Some assert that certain pleasures are worthless or even bad, like disgraceful and sadistic pleasures. A different criticism comes from value pluralists, who contend that other things besides pleasure have value. To support the idea that beauty is an additional source of value, G. E. Moore used a thought experiment involving two worlds: one exceedingly beautiful and the other a heap of filth. He argued that the beautiful world is better even if there is no one to enjoy it. Another influential thought experiment, proposed by Robert Nozick, involves an experience machine able to create artificial pleasures. Based on his contention that most people would not want to spend the rest of their lives in this type of pleasant illusion, he argued that hedonism cannot account for the values of authenticity and genuine experience.\nEthical hedonism.\nEthical or normative hedonism is the thesis that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain are the highest moral principles of human behavior. It implies that other moral considerations, like duty, justice, or virtue, are relevant only to the extent that they influence pleasure and pain.\nTheories of ethical hedonism can be divided into utilitarian and egoistic versions. Utilitarian hedonism, also called \"classical utilitarianism\", asserts that everyone's happiness matters. It says that a person should maximize the sum total of happiness of everybody affected by their actions. This sum total includes the person's own happiness, but it is only one factor among many without any special preference compared to the happiness of others. As a result, utilitarian hedonism sometimes requires people to forego their own enjoyment to benefit others. For example, philosopher Peter Singer argues that good earners should donate a significant portion of their income to charities since this money can produce more happiness for people in need.\nEgoistic hedonism says that each person should only pursue their own pleasure. According to this controversial view, a person only has a moral reason to care about the happiness of others if it impacts their own well-being. For example, if someone experiences unpleasant feelings, such as guilt, when harming others, then they have a reason to avoid causing harm. However, under this view, a person would be morally permitted\u2014or even obliged\u2014to harm others if doing so increases their own overall pleasure.\nEthical hedonism is often combined with consequentialism, which asserts that an act is right if it has the best consequences. It is typically paired with axiological hedonism, which links the intrinsic value of consequences to pleasure and pain. As a result, many arguments for and against axiological hedonism also apply to ethical hedonism. Additionally, proponents of utilitarian hedonism often emphasize its impartial nature, its simple and objective method for evaluating moral judgments, and its flexibility to apply to any situation. Critics frequently argue that utilitarian hedonism places too high demands on conduct and leads to injustice in some cases by sacrificing individual rights for the greater good. They also point to practical difficulties in assessing all pleasure-related consequences of actions.\nOthers.\nAesthetic hedonism is a theory about the nature of aesthetic value or beauty. It states that a thing, like a landscape, a painting, or a song, has aesthetic value if people are pleased by it or get aesthetic pleasure from it. It is a subjective theory because it focuses on how people respond to aesthetically engaging things. This view contrasts with objective theories, which assert that aesthetic value only depends on objective or mind-independent features of things, like symmetry or harmonic composition. Some aesthetic hedonists believe that any type of pleasure is relevant to the aesthetic value of a thing. Others offer a more nuanced characterization, saying that aesthetic value is only based on how people with a well-developed taste respond to it.\nOutside the academic context of philosophy and psychology, the word \"hedonism\" is often used in a narrower sense as a pejorative term. Sometimes called \"folk hedonism\", it describes a lifestyle dedicated to the egoistic pursuit of short-term gratification. For example, a person who indulges in sex and drugs without concern for the long-term consequences of their behavior is acting hedonistically in this sense. The negative connotation of the term is associated with a lack of interest or foresight regarding the potential harm or ethical implications of such actions. Negative consequences can impact both the individual and the people around them, affecting areas such as health, financial stability, relationships, and societal responsibilities. Most philosophical hedonists reject the idea that a lifestyle characterized by folk hedonism leads to long-term happiness.\nCentral concepts.\nPleasure and pain.\nPleasure and pain are fundamental experiences about what is attractive and what is repulsive, shaping how people feel, think, and act. They play a central role in all forms of hedonism. Both pleasure and pain come in degrees corresponding to their intensity. They are typically understood as a continuum ranging from positive degrees through a neutral point to negative degrees. However, some hedonists reject the idea that pleasure and pain form a symmetric pair and suggest instead that avoiding pain is more important than producing pleasure.\nThe nature of pleasure and pain is disputed and affects the plausibility of various versions of hedonism. In everyday language, these concepts are often understood in a narrow sense associated with specific phenomena, like the pleasure of food and sex or the pain of an injury. However, hedonists usually adopt a broader view in which pleasure and pain cover any positive or negative experience. In this broad sense, anything that feels good is a pleasure, including the joy of watching a sunset, whereas anything that feels bad is a pain, including the sorrow of losing a loved one. A traditionally influential position says that pleasure and pain are specific bodily sensations, similar to those of hot and cold. A more common view in contemporary philosophy holds that pleasure and pain are attitudes of attraction or aversion, respectively, toward objects or contents. This view implies that they do not have a specific location in the body and do not arise in isolation since they are always directed at an object that people enjoy or suffer.\nMeasurement.\nBoth philosophers and psychologists are interested in methods of measuring pleasure and pain to understand their causes and role in decision-making. A common approach is to use self-report questionnaires in which people are asked to quantify how pleasant or unpleasant an experience is. For example, some questionnaires use a nine-point scale from -4 for the most unpleasant experiences, to +4 for the most pleasant ones. Some methods rely on memory and ask individuals to retrospectively assess their experiences. A different approach is for individuals to evaluate their experiences while they are happening to avoid biases and inaccuracies introduced by memory.\nIn either form, the measurement of pleasure and pain poses various challenges. As a highly subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to establish a standardized metric. Moreover, asking people to rate their experiences using an artificially constructed scale may not accurately reflect their subjective experiences. A closely related problem concerns comparisons between individuals, since distinct people may use the scales differently and thus arrive at varying values even if they had similar experiences. Neuroscientists avoid some of these challenges by using neuroimaging techniques such as PET scans and fMRI. However, this approach comes with new difficulties of its own since the neurological basis of happiness is not yet fully understood.\nBased on the idea that individual experiences of pleasure and pain can be quantified, Jeremy Bentham proposed the hedonistic calculus as a method to combine various episodes to arrive at their total contribution to happiness. He suggested that one can find the best course of action by quantitatively comparing the experiences produced by each action. Bentham considered several factors for each pleasurable experience: its intensity and duration, the likelihood that it occurs, its temporal distance, the likelihood that it causes further experiences of pleasure and pain, and the number of people affected. Some simplified versions of the hedonic calculus focus primarily on what is intrinsically valuable to a person and only consider two factors: intensity and duration.\nHappiness, well-being, and eudaimonia.\nSome theorists formulate hedonism in terms of happiness rather than pleasure and pain. According to a common interpretation, happiness is the balance of pleasure over pain. This means that a person is happy if they have more pleasure than pain and unhappy if the balance is overall negative. There are also other ways to understand happiness that do not fully align with the traditional account of hedonism. One view defines happiness as life satisfaction. This means that a person is happy if they have a favorable attitude toward their life; for example, by being satisfied with their life as a whole or by judging it to be good overall. This attitude may be influenced by the balance of pleasure over pain but can also be shaped by other factors.\nWell-being is closely related to happiness as a measure of what is ultimately good for a person. According to a common view, pleasure is one component of well-being. It is controversial whether it is the only factor and what other factors there are; such as health, knowledge, and friendship. Another approach focuses on desires, saying that well-being consists in the satisfaction of desires. The view that the balance of pleasure over pain is the only source of well-being is called \"prudential hedonism\".\nEudaimonia is a form of well-being rooted in ancient Greek thought, serving as a foundation of many forms of moral philosophy during this period. Aristotle understood eudaimonia as a type of flourishing in which a person is happy by leading a fulfilling life and manifesting their inborn capacities. Ethical theories based on eudaimonia often share parallels with hedonism, like an interest in long-term happiness, but are distinguished from it by their emphasis of virtues, advocating an active lifestyle focused on self-realization.\nParadox of hedonism and hedonic treadmill.\nThe paradox of hedonism is the thesis that the direct pursuit of pleasure is counterproductive. It says that conscious attempts to become happy usually backfire, acting as obstacles to one's personal happiness. According to one interpretation, the best way to produce pleasure is to follow other endeavors, with pleasure being a by-product rather than the goal itself. For example, this view suggests that a tennis player who tries to win a game may enjoy the activity more than a tennis player who tries to maximize their enjoyment. It is controversial to what extent the paradox of hedonism is true since, at least in some cases, the pursuit of pleasure is successful.\nA related phenomenon, the hedonic treadmill is the theory that people return to a stable level of happiness after significant positive or negative changes to their life circumstances. This suggests that good or bad events affect a person's happiness temporarily but not in the long term\u2014their overall level of happiness tends to revert to a baseline as they get used to the changed situation. For instance, studies on lottery winners indicate that their happiness initially increases as the newly acquired wealth augments their living standards but returns to its original level after about one year. If true, this effect would undermine efforts to increase happiness in the long term, including personal efforts to lead a healthy lifestyle and social efforts to create a free, just, and prosperous society. While there is some empirical support for this effect, it is controversial how strong this tendency is and whether it applies to all fields or only to certain aspects of life.\nNon-hedonism and asceticism.\nNon-hedonist theories reject certain aspects of hedonism. One form of non-hedonism says that pleasure is one thing in life that matters but not the only thing. Another form argues that some pleasures are good while others are bad. The strongest rejection of hedonism, sometimes termed \"anti-hedonism\", claims that all pleasures are bad. Motivations to adopt this view include the idea that pleasure is an irrational emotion and that the pursuit of pleasure is an obstacle that prevents people from leading a good life.\nAsceticism is a lifestyle dedicated to a program of self-discipline that renounces worldly pleasures. It can take various forms, including abstinence from sex and drugs, fasting, withdrawal from society, and practices like prayer and meditation. This lifestyle is often motivated by religious aspirations to become close to the divine, reach a heightened spiritual state, or purify oneself. Most forms of asceticism are opposed to hedonism and its pursuit of pleasure. However, there are forms of ascetic hedonism that combine the two views; for example, by asserting that the right form of ascetic practice leads to higher overall happiness by replacing simple sensory pleasures with deeper and more meaningful spiritual pleasures.\nHistory.\nAncient.\nHedonism is one of the oldest philosophical theories. Some interpreters trace it back to the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", written around 2100\u20132000 BCE. It was a central topic in ancient Greek thought, where Aristippus of Cyrene (435\u2013356 BCE) is usually identified as its earliest philosophical proponent. He formulated an egoistic hedonism, arguing that personal pleasure is the highest good. Aristippus and the school of Cyrenaics he inspired focused on the gratification of immediate sensory pleasures with little concern for long-term consequences. Plato (c.\u2009428\u2013347 BCE) critiqued this view and proposed a balanced pursuit of pleasure that aligns with virtue and rationality. Following a similar approach, Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) associated pleasure with eudaimonia or the realization of natural human capacities, like reason.\nEpicurus (341\u2013271 BCE) developed a nuanced form of hedonism that contrasts with the indulgence in immediate gratification proposed by the Cyrenaics. The philosophical movement he founded argues that excessive desires result in anxiety and suffering, suggesting instead that people practice moderation, cultivate a tranquil state of mind, and avoid pain. Following Antisthenes (c.\u2009446\u2014366 BCE), the Cynics warned against the pursuit of pleasure, viewing it as an obstacle to freedom. The Stoics also dismissed a hedonistic lifestyle, focusing on virtue and integrity instead of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. Lucretius (c.\u200999\u201355 BCE) further expanded on Epicureanism, highlighting the importance of overcoming obstacles to personal happiness, such as the fear of death.\nIn ancient India, starting between the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, the Charvaka school developed an egoistic hedonism. Motivated by the belief in the non-existence of God or an afterlife, this school advocates enjoying life in the present to the fullest. Many other Indian traditions rejected this view and recommended a more ascetic lifestyle, a tendency common among Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain schools of thought. In ancient China, Yang Zhu (c.\u2009440\u2013360 BCE) argued that it is human nature to follow self-interest and satisfy personal desires. His egoistic hedonism inspired the subsequent school of Yangism.\nMedieval.\nHedonist philosophy received less attention in medieval thought. The early Christian philosopher Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430 CE), was critical of the hedonism found in ancient Greek philosophy, warning of the dangers of earthly pleasures as obstacles to a spiritual life dedicated to God. Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274 CE) developed a nuanced perspective on hedonism, characterized by some interpreters as spiritual hedonism. He held that humans are naturally inclined to seek happiness, arguing that the only way to truly satisfy this inclination is through a beatific vision of God. In Islamic philosophy, the problem of pleasure played a central role in the philosophy of al-Razi (c.\u2009864\u2014925 or 932 CE). Similar to Epicureanism, he recommended a life of moderation avoiding excess and asceticism. Both al-Farabi (c.\u2009878\u2013950 CE) and Avicenna (980\u20131037 CE) asserted that a form of intellectual happiness, reachable only in the afterlife, is the highest human good.\nModern and contemporary.\nAt the transition to the early modern period, Lorenzo Valla (c.\u20091406\u20131457) synthesized Epicurean hedonism with Christian ethics, suggesting that earthly pleasures associated with the senses are stepping stones to heavenly pleasures associated with Christian virtues. Hedonism gained prominence during the Age of Enlightenment. According to Thomas Hobbes's (1588\u20131679) psychological hedonism, self-interest in what is pleasant is the root of all human motivation. John Locke (1632\u20131704) stated that pleasure and pain are the only sources of good and evil. Joseph Butler (1692\u20131752) formulated an objection to psychological hedonism, arguing that most desires, like wanting food or ambition, are not directed at pleasure itself but at external objects. According to David Hume (1711\u20131776), pleasure and pain are both the measure of ethical value and the main factors of emotional life. The libertine novels of Marquis de Sade (1740\u20131814) depicted an extreme form of hedonism, emphasizing full indulgence in pleasurable activities without moral or sexual restraint.\nJeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832) developed an influential form of hedonism known as classical utilitarianism. One of his key innovations was the rejection of egoistic hedonism, instead advocating that individuals should promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people. He introduced the idea of the hedonic calculus to assess the value of an action based on the pleasurable and painful experiences it causes, relying on factors such as intensity and duration. His student John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) feared that Bentham's quantitative focus on the intensity and duration would lead to an overemphasis on simple sensory pleasures. In response, he included the quality of pleasures as an additional factor, arguing that higher pleasures of the mind are more valuable than lower pleasures of the body. Henry Sidgwick (1838\u20131900) further refined utilitarianism and clarified many of its core distinctions, such as the contrast between ethical and psychological hedonism and between egoistic and utilitarian hedonism.\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) rejected ethical hedonism and emphasized the importance of excellence and self-overcoming instead, stating that suffering is necessary to achieve greatness rather than something to be avoided. An influential view about the nature of pleasure was developed by Franz Brentano (1838\u20131917), who dismissed the idea that pleasure is a sensation located in a specific area of the body, proposing instead that pleasure is a positive attitude that people can have toward various objects\u2014a position also later defended by Roderick Chisholm (1916\u20131999). Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939) developed a form of psychological hedonism in his early psychoanalytic theory. He stated that the pleasure principle describes how individuals seek immediate pleasure while avoiding pain whereas the reality principle represents the ability to postpone immediate gratification to avoid unpleasant long-term consequences.\nThe 20th century saw various criticisms of hedonism. G. E. Moore (1873\u20131958) rejected the hedonistic idea that pleasure is the only source of intrinsic value. According to his axiological pluralism, there are other sources, such as beauty and knowledge, a criticism also shared by W. D. Ross (1877\u20131971). Both C. D. Broad (1887\u20131971) and Richard Brandt (1910\u20131997) held that malicious pleasures, like enjoying the suffering of others, do not have inherent value. Robert Nozick (1938\u20132002) used his thought experiment involving an experience machine capable of simulated pleasure to argue against traditional hedonism, which ignores whether there is an authentic connection between pleasure and reality.\nIn response to these and similar criticisms, Fred Feldman (1941\u2013present) has developed a modified form of hedonism. Drawing on Brentano's attitudinal theory of pleasure, he has defended the idea that even though pleasure is the only source of intrinsic goodness, its value must be adjusted based on whether it is appropriate or deserved. Peter Singer (1946\u2013present) has expanded classical hedonism to include concerns about animal welfare. He has advocated effective altruism, relying on empirical evidence and reason to prioritize actions that have the most significant positive impact. Inspired by the philosophy of Albert Camus (1913\u20131960), Michel Onfray (born 1959) has aimed to rehabilitate Epicurean hedonism in a modern form. David Pearce (1959\u2013present) has developed a transhumanist version of hedonism, arguing for the use of modern technology, ranging from genetic engineering to nanotechnology, to reduce suffering and possibly eliminate it in the future. The emergence of positive psychology at the turn of the 21st century has led to an increased interest in the empirical exploration of various topics of hedonism.\nIn various fields.\nPositive psychology studies how to cultivate happiness and promote optimal human functioning. Unlike traditional psychology, which often focuses on psychopathology, positive psychology emphasizes that optimal functioning is more than the absence of mental illness. At the individual level, it investigates experiences of pleasure and pain and the role of character traits, and at the societal level, it examines how social institutions impact human well-being.\nHedonic psychology or hedonics is one of the main pillars of positive psychology, studying pleasant and unpleasant experiences. It investigates and compares different states of consciousness associated with pleasure and pain, ranging from joy and satisfaction to boredom and sorrow. Hedonic psychology also examines the biological function of these states. This includes their role as signals for what to approach or avoid, and as mechanisms of reward and punishment to reinforce or discourage behavioral patterns, respectively. Additionally, hedonic psychology explores the circumstances that evoke these experiences, on both the biological and social levels. It addresses psychological obstacles to pleasure, such as anhedonia, a reduced ability to experience pleasure, and hedonophobia, a fear or aversion to pleasure. Positive psychology in general and hedonic psychology in particular are relevant to hedonism by providing a scientific understanding of the experiences of pleasure and pain and the processes impacting them.\nIn the field of economics, welfare economics examines how economic activities affect social well-being. It is often understood as a form of normative economics, which evaluates economic processes and policies rather than just describing them. Hedonist approaches to welfare economics state that pleasure is the main criterion of this evaluation, meaning that economic activities should aim to promote societal happiness. The economics of happiness is a closely related field studying the relation between economic phenomena, such as wealth, and individual happiness. Economists also employ hedonic regression, a method used to estimate the value of commodities based on their utility or effect on the owner's pleasure.\nAnimal ethics is the branch of ethics studying human behavior towards other animals. Hedonism is an influential position in this field as a theory of animal welfare. It emphasizes that humans have the responsibility to consider the impact of their actions on how animals feel to minimize harm done to them. Some quantitative hedonists suggest that there is no qualitative difference between the pleasure and pain experienced by humans and other animals. As a result of this view, moral considerations about promoting the happiness of others apply to all sentient animals. This position is modified by some qualitative hedonists, who argue that human experiences carry more weight because they include higher forms of pleasure and pain.\nWhile many religious traditions are critical of hedonism, some have embraced it or certain aspects of it, such as Christian hedonism. Elements of hedonism are also found in various forms of popular culture, such as consumerism, the entertainment industry, and the enduring influences of the sexual revolution.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
