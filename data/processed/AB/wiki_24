S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan. The two men collaborated on fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896, of which \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and \"The Mikado\" are among the best known. The producer Richard D'Oyly Carte brought Gilbert and Sullivan together and nurtured their collaboration. He built the Savoy Theatre in 1881 to present their joint works (which came to be known as the Savoy Operas) and founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which performed and promoted Gilbert and Sullivan's works for more than a century.\nGilbert, who wrote the witty, satiric libretti for these operas, created fanciful \"topsy-turvy\" worlds where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion: fairies rub elbows with British lords, flirting is a capital offence, gondoliers ascend to the monarchy, and pirates emerge as noblemen who have gone astray. Sullivan, six years Gilbert's junior, composed the music, contributing memorable melodies that could convey both humour and pathos.\nTheir operas have enjoyed broad and enduring international success and are still performed frequently throughout the English-speaking world. Gilbert and Sullivan introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the development of musical theatre through the 20th century. The operas have also influenced political discourse, literature, film and television and have been widely parodied and pastiched by humorists.\nBeginnings.\nGilbert before Sullivan.\nGilbert was born in London on 18 November 1836. His father, William, was a naval surgeon who later wrote novels and short stories, some of which included illustrations by his son. In 1861, to supplement his income, the younger Gilbert began writing illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own, many of which would later be mined as inspiration for his plays and operas, particularly Gilbert's series of illustrated poems, the \"Bab Ballads\".\nIn the \"Bab Ballads\" and his early plays, Gilbert developed a unique \"topsy-turvy\" style in which humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. Director and playwright Mike Leigh described the \"Gilbertian\" style as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction, following the playwright and theatrical reformer Tom Robertson. At the time Gilbert began writing, theatre in Britain was in disrepute. Gilbert helped to reform and elevate the respectability of the theatre, especially beginning with his six short family-friendly comic operas, or \"entertainments\", for Thomas German Reed.\nAt a rehearsal for one of these entertainments, \"Ages Ago\", in 1870, the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan. Over the next year, before the two first collaborated, Gilbert continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas \"Our Island Home\" (1870) and \"A Sensation Novel\" (1871), and the blank verse comedies \"The Princess\" (1870), \"The Palace of Truth\" (1870) and \"Pygmalion and Galatea\" (1871).\nSullivan before Gilbert.\nSullivan was born in London on 13 May 1842. His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose anthems and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig, where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the \"Overture di Ballo\", in 1870.\nHis early major works for the voice included \"The Masque at Kenilworth\" (1864); an oratorio, \"The Prodigal Son\" (1869); and a dramatic cantata, \"On Shore and Sea\" (1871). He composed a ballet, \"L'\u00cele Enchant\u00e9e\" (1864) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his \"Symphony in E\", \"Cello Concerto\", and \"Overture in C (In Memoriam)\" (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.\nSullivan's first foray into comic opera was \"Cox and Box\" (1866), written with the librettist F. C. Burnand for an informal gathering of friends. Public performance followed, with W. S. Gilbert (then writing dramatic criticism for the magazine \"Fun\") saying that Sullivan's score \"is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded.\" Nonetheless, it proved highly successful, and is still regularly performed today. Sullivan and Burnand's second opera, \"The Contrabandista\" (1867) was not as successful.\nOperas.\nFirst collaborations.\n\"Thespis\".\nIn 1871, producer John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment, \"Thespis\", at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach's \"Orpheus in the Underworld\" and \"La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\", which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.\n\"Thespis\" opened on Boxing Day and ran for 63 performances. It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety, but no one at the time foresaw that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqu\u00e9, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to \"Thespis\" was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", and the Act II ballet music.\nOver the next three years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on \"Happy Arcadia\" (1872) and Alfred Cellier on \"Topsyturveydom\" (1874) and wrote \"The Wicked World\" (1873), \"Sweethearts\" (1874) and several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas and adaptations. Sullivan completed his \"Festival Te Deum\" (1872); another oratorio, \"The Light of the World\" (1873); his only song cycle, \"The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens\" (1871); incidental music to \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and hymns, including \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" (1872). At the same time, the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population; improvement in education and the standard of living, especially of the middle class; improving public transport; and installation of street lighting, which made travel home from the theatre safer. The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play parlour music at home and more theatres and concert halls opened.\n\"Trial by Jury\".\nIn 1874, Gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, whose wife would have played the leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's \"La P\u00e9richole\". Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; \"Trial by Jury\" was composed and staged in a matter of weeks.\nThe piece is one of Gilbert's humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his short experience as a barrister. It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since \"he is such a very bad lot,\" while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks \"substantial damages.\" After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan's brother, Fred, as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of \"La P\u00e9richole\". Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.\nFred Sullivan was the prototype for the \"patter\" (comic) baritone roles in the later operas. F. C. Burnand wrote that he \"was one of the most naturally \"comic little men\" I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest...\" Fred's creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators' works, and each of them has a crucial \"comic little man\" role, as Burnand had put it. The \"patter\" baritone (or \"principal comedian\", as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs.\nAfter the success of \"Trial by Jury\", Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of \"Thespis\" for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.\nEarly successes.\n\"The Sorcerer\".\nCarte's real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.\nGilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories, \"The Elixir of Love\", which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a Cockney businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that \"The Sorcerer\" (1877) opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed \"Thespis\". While \"The Sorcerer\" won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of \"Trial by Jury\". Nevertheless, it ran for more than six months, and Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.\n\"H.M.S. Pinafore\".\nGilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in \"The Sorcerer\", love between members of different social classes). As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.\nGilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage. He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity. He insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day. Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a crispness and polish new to the English musical theatre. Jessie Bond wrote later:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Our stage discipline was strict and unbending. Gilbert's word was law; he thoroughly worked out in his own mind every bit of action, by-play and grouping, and allowed no deviation from his plan. He...made drawings and took measurements with the minutest care... He had unlimited fertility of invention in comic business and would allow no gag, no clowning, no departure from his own definite conception. Sullivan's musical conception was equally clear-cut and decided. Every part must be made subservient to the whole, and his sarcasms overwhelmed the transgressor with scorn. \"And now, might I trouble you to try over my music,\" he would say to a singer too anxious to display his or her top notes. But there was nothing to hurt or offend us in this unswerving discipline, we took their good-humoured raillery as our due when we failed in our rendering or overstepped the bounds; and the patience and enthusiasm of that artistic pair so infected all of us that we worked willingly for hours and hours at rehearsals, trying with all our might to realize the conceptions of those two brilliant minds.\n\"H.M.S. Pinafore\" ran in London for 571 performances, an exceptional run for the period. Hundreds of unauthorised, or \"pirated\", productions of \"Pinafore\" appeared in America. During the run of \"Pinafore\", Richard D'Oyly Carte split up with his former investors. The disgruntled former partners, who had invested in the production with no return, staged a public fracas, sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance. Stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers. This event cleared the way for Carte, in alliance with Gilbert and Sullivan, to form the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which then produced all their succeeding operas.\nThe libretto of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" relied on stock character types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone \u2013 the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before \"The Sorcerer\", Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with \"Thespis\" and \"Trial by Jury\". Building on the team he had assembled for \"The Sorcerer\", Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.\nThe repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", then join the army as Major-General Stanley in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in \"The Sorcerer\" transformed into Little Buttercup in \"Pinafore\", then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in \"Pirates\". Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the mezzo-soprano soubrette.\n\"The Pirates of Penzance\".\n\"The Pirates of Penzance\" (New Year's Eve, 1879) also poked fun at grand opera conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, the \"respectability\" of civilisation and the peerage, and the relevance of a liberal education. The story also revisits \"Pinafore\"'s theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, in the person of the \"modern Major-General\" who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself. The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers, the Major-General bids them: \"resume your ranks and legislative duties, and take my daughters, all of whom are beauties!\"\nThe piece premiered in New York rather than London, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to secure the American copyright, and was another big success with both critics and audiences. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success. Nevertheless, \"Pirates\" was a hit both in New York, again spawning numerous imitators, and then in London, and it became one of the most frequently performed, translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works, also enjoying successful 1981 Broadway and 1982 West End revivals by Joseph Papp that continue to influence productions of the opera.\nIn 1880, Sullivan's cantata \"The Martyr of Antioch\" premiered at the Leeds Triennial Music Festival, with a libretto adapted by Sullivan and Gilbert from an 1822 epic poem by Henry Hart Milman concerning the 3rd-century martyrdom of St. Margaret of Antioch. Sullivan became the conductor of the Leeds festival beginning in 1880 and conducted the performance. The Carl Rosa Opera Company staged the cantata as an opera in 1898.\nSavoy Theatre opens.\n\"Patience\".\n\"Patience\" (1881) satirised the aesthetic movement in general and its colourful poets in particular, combining aspects of A. C. Swinburne, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, James McNeill Whistler and others in the rival poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor. Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photograph. The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military. The story concerns two rival aesthetic poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, formerly engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment. But both poets are in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him. Richard D'Oyly Carte was the booking manager for Oscar Wilde, a then lesser-known proponent of aestheticism, and dispatched him on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera's U.S. run, so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about.\nDuring the run of \"Patience\", Carte built the large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership's permanent home. It was the first theatre (and the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting. \"Patience\" moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran for a total of 578 performances, surpassing the run of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\".\n\"Iolanthe\".\n\"Iolanthe\" (1882) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy. The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes. The critics felt that Sullivan's work in \"Iolanthe\" had taken a step forward. \"The Daily Telegraph\" commented, \"The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account \"Iolanthe\" his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.\" Similarly, \"The Theatre\" judged that \"the music of \"Iolanthe\" is Dr Sullivan's \"chef d'oeuvre\". The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works...\"\n\"Iolanthe\" is one of several of Gilbert's works, including \"The Wicked World\" (1873), \"Broken Hearts\" (1875), \"Princess Ida\" (1884) and \"Fallen Fairies\" (1909), where the introduction of men and \"mortal love\" into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo. Gilbert had created several \"fairy comedies\" at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planch\u00e9, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.\nIn 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study. Gilbert had referred to the new technology in \"Pinafore\" in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service. Sullivan had one installed as well, and on 13 May 1883, at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), heard a direct relay of parts of \"Iolanthe\" from the Savoy. This was probably the first live \"broadcast\" of an opera.\nDuring the run of \"Iolanthe\", in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera \u2013 that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after \"Iolanthe\" opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.\n\"Princess Ida\".\n\"Princess Ida\" (1884) spoofed women's education and male chauvinism and continued the theme from \"Iolanthe\" of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem \"The Princess: A Medley\". Gilbert had written a blank verse farce based on the same material in 1870, called \"The Princess\", and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of \"Princess Ida\". \"Ida\" is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.\n\"Princess Ida\" was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after \"Ida\" opened, Sullivan told Carte that \"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\" As \"Princess Ida\" showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time. In the meantime, when \"Ida\" closed, Carte produced a revival of \"The Sorcerer\".\nDodging the magic lozenge.\n\"The Mikado\".\nThe most successful of the Savoy Operas was \"The Mikado\" (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters, which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in \"human interest and probability\", as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, \"The Sorcerer\". As dramatised in the film \"Topsy-Turvy\", the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884, when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.\nThe story focuses on a \"cheap tailor\", Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu. He loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado) and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha. The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu. When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions. Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry. Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.\nWith the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable, and a Japanese village exhibition opened in Knightsbridge, London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, \"I cannot give you a good reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.\"\nSetting the opera in Japan, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, \"The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.\" G. K. Chesterton compared it to Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\": \"Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth.\" Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including \"The Gondoliers\", \"Utopia, Limited\" and \"The Grand Duke\".\n\"The Mikado\" became the partnership's longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and surpassing the runs of \"Pinafore\" and \"Patience\". It remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera. It has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.\n\"Ruddigore\".\n\"Ruddigore\" (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian melodrama, was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances. The original title, \"Ruddygore\", together with some of the plot devices, including the revivification of ghosts, drew negative comments from critics. Gilbert and Sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts. Nevertheless, the piece was profitable, and the reviews were not all bad. For instance, \"The Illustrated London News\" praised the work and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: \"Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun.\" Further changes were made, including a new overture, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte revived \"Ruddigore\" after the First World War, and the piece was regularly performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter.\nSome of the plot elements of \"Ruddigore\" were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, \"Ages Ago\" (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits. When \"Ruddigore\" closed, no new opera was ready. Gilbert again proposed a version of the \"lozenge\" plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his reluctance to set it. While the two men worked out their artistic differences, and Sullivan finished other obligations, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", \"The Pirates of Penzance\", and \"The Mikado\".\n\"The Yeomen of the Guard\".\n\"The Yeomen of the Guard\" (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players \u2013 a jester and a singing girl \u2013 who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century. The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-Early Modern English in style, and there is no satire of British institutions. For some of the plot elements, Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, \"Broken Hearts\". \"The Times\" praised the libretto: \"It should... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things\". Although not a grand opera, the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious theatre score to date. The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, \"The Golden Legend\", considered the score to \"Yeomen\" to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which was written in sonata form, rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures. The \"Daily Telegraph\" said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly... We place the songs and choruses in \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera...\n\"Yeomen\" was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it... You say that in a serious opera, \"you\" must more or less sacrifice yourself. I say that this is just what I have been doing in all our joint pieces, and, what is more, must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful.\nSullivan insisted that the next opera must be a grand opera. Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (\"Ivanhoe\") for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life, as \"this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music.\"\n\"The Gondoliers\".\n\"The Gondoliers\" (1889) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a fictional kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of \"republican equality.\" Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes, including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos. The libretto also reflects Gilbert's fascination with the \"Stock Company Act\", highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, \"Utopia, Limited\". Press accounts were almost entirely favourable. The \"Illustrated London News\" reported:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...Gilbert has returned to the Gilbert of the past, and everyone is delighted. He is himself again. The Gilbert of the \"Bab Ballads\", the Gilbert of whimsical conceit, inoffensive cynicism, subtle satire, and playful paradox; the Gilbert who invented a school of his own, who in it was schoolmaster and pupil, who has never taught anybody but himself, and is never likely to have any imitator \u2013 this is the Gilbert the public want to see, and this is the Gilbert who on Saturday night was cheered till the audience was weary of cheering any more.\nSullivan's old collaborator on \"Cox and Box\" (later the editor of \"Punch\" magazine), F. C. Burnand, wrote to the composer: \"Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion.\" The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", \"Patience\" and \"The Mikado\". There was a command performance of \"The Gondoliers\" for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured. \"The Gondoliers\" was Gilbert and Sullivan's last great success.\nCarpet quarrel.\nThough Gilbert and Sullivan's working relationship was mostly cordial and even friendly, it sometimes became strained, especially during their later operas, partly because each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two: Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict. Gilbert imbued his libretti with absurdist \"topsy-turvy\" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content. Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.\nGilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject. After each of \"Princess Ida\" and \"Ruddigore\", which were less successful than their seven other operas from \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" to \"The Gondoliers\", Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences in those cases, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue.\nIn April 1890, during the run of \"The Gondoliers\", Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial\". On 5 May 1890, Gilbert wrote to Sullivan: \"The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived. \u2026 I am writing a letter to Carte ... giving him notice that he is not to produce or perform any of my libretti after Christmas 1890.\" As biographer Andrew Crowther has explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThings soon degraded, Gilbert lost his temper with his partners and brought a lawsuit against Carte. Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had in 1884 with Lillian Russell when, in fact, those expenses had already been paid. When Gilbert discovered this, he asked for a retraction of the affidavit; Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House (now the Palace Theatre), to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\". After \"The Gondoliers\" closed in 1891, Gilbert withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.\nGilbert next wrote \"The Mountebanks\" with Alfred Cellier and the flop \"Haste to the Wedding\" with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote \"Haddon Hall\" with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.\nLast works.\n\"Utopia, Limited\" (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and their last, \"The Grand Duke\" (1896), was an outright failure. Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, \"His Excellency\" (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from \"Utopia\", led to Sullivan's refusal, and \"His Excellency\" was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr. Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.\nAfter \"The Grand Duke\", the partners saw no reason to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan's opera \"The Beauty Stone\" on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true. The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of \"The Sorcerer\". They did not speak to each other. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died in 1900, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with Basil Hood in \"The Rose of Persia\" (1899). Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan's death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been \"completely bridged over,\" and \"the most cordial relations existed between us.\" He stated that \"Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name.\"\nRichard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, after which his widow, Helen, directed the activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy and on tour. Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. Between 1906 and 1909, he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. These were very popular and revived interest in the works. Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season. After Sullivan's death, Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera, \"Fallen Fairies\" (1909; music by Edward German), which was not a success.\nLegacy and assessment.\nGilbert died in 1911, and Richard's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, took over the opera company upon his step-mother's death in 1913. His daughter, Bridget, inherited the company upon his death in 1948. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year-round, except for its many London seasons and foreign tours, performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, until it closed in 1982. During the 20th century, the company gave well over 35,000 performances. The Savoy operas, from the beginning, were produced extensively in North America and Australasia, and soon afterwards in Germany, Russia, and elsewhere in Europe and around the world.\nIn 1922, Sir Henry Wood explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sullivan has never had an equal for brightness and drollery, for humour without coarseness and without vulgarity, and for charm and grace. His orchestration is delightful: he wrote with full understanding of every orchestral voice. Above all, his music is perfectly appropriate to the words of which it is the setting... He found the right, the only cadences to fit Gilbert's happy and original rhythms, and to match Gilbert's fun or to throw Gilbert's frequent irony, pointed although not savage, into relief. Sullivan's music is much more than the accompaniment of Gilbert's libretti, just as Gilbert's libretti are far more than words to Sullivan's music. We have two masters who are playing a concerto. Neither is subordinate to the other; each gives what is original, but the two, while neither predominates, are in perfect correspondence. This rare harmony of words and music is what makes these operas entirely unique. They are the work not of a musician and his librettist nor of a poet and one who sets his words to music, but of two geniuses.\nG. K. Chesterton similarly praised the combination of the two artists, anticipating the operas' success into the \"remote future\". He wrote that Gilbert's satire was \"too intelligent to be intelligible\" by itself, and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given \"wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious. [The words'] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it.\" In 1957, a review in \"The Times\" gave this rationale for \"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]hey were never really contemporary in their idiom... Gilbert and Sullivan's [world], from the first moment was obviously not the audience's world, [it was] an artificial world, with a neatly controlled and shapely precision which has not gone out of fashion \u2013 because it was never in fashion in the sense of using the fleeting conventions and ways of thought of contemporary human society... For this, each partner has his share of credit. The neat articulation of incredibilities in Gilbert's plots is perfectly matched by his language... His dialogue, with its primly mocking formality, satisfies both the ear and the intelligence. His verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording... How deliciously [his lines] prick the bubble of sentiment... [Of] equal importance... Gilbert's lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music... Sullivan's tunes, in these operas, also exist in a make-believe world of their own... [He is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody... The two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful... Light, and even trifling, though [the operas] may seem upon grave consideration, they yet have the shapeliness and elegance that can make a trifle into a work of art.\nBecause of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company, and to amateur troupes. For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a \"performing tradition\" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors, both amateur and professional. Indeed, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups \"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\" Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \"the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas\". The National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year, constituting most of the amateur companies in the country (this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA). The association further reported that almost 1,000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year, many of them to benefit charities. Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand. In the U.S., and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced, both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century \u2013 the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960. The Savoy Company, an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia, continues to perform today. In 1948, \"Life\" magazine reported that about 5,000 performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operas were given annually in the US, exceeding the number of performances of Shakespeare plays.\nAfter the copyrights on the operas expired, other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas, even in Britain and The Commonwealth. Many performing companies arose to produce the works, such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All in Britain, and existing companies, such as English National Opera, Carl Rosa Opera Company and Australian Opera, added Gilbert and Sullivan to their repertories. The operas were presented by professional repertory companies in the US, including the competing Light Opera of Manhattan and NYGASP in New York City. In 1980, a Broadway and West End production of \"Pirates\" produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to Gilbert and Sullivan. Between 1988 and 2003, a new iteration of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and in the West End. Today, various professional repertory companies, such as NYGASP, Opera della Luna, National Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company, Opera North, Ohio Light Opera, Scottish Opera and other regional opera companies, and numerous amateur societies, churches, schools and universities continue to produce the works. The most popular G&amp;S works also continue to be performed from time to time by major opera companies, and recordings of the operas, overtures and songs from the operas continue to be released. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has been held every August in England (except 2020), with some two dozen or more performances of the operas given on the main stage, and several dozen related \"fringe\" events given in smaller venues. The Festival records and offers videos of its most popular professional and amateur productions. In connection with the 2009 festival, a contemporary critic wrote, \"The appeal of G&amp;S's special blend of charm, silliness and gentle satire seems immune to fashion.\" There continue to be hundreds of amateur companies performing the Gilbert and Sullivan works worldwide.\nRecordings and broadcasts.\nThe first commercial recordings of individual numbers from the Savoy operas began in 1898. In 1917 the Gramophone Company (HMV) produced the first album of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera, \"The Mikado\", followed by recordings of eight more. Electrical recordings of most of the operas were then issued by HMV and Victor, beginning in the late 1920s, supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well-regarded recordings until 1979, helping to keep the operas popular through the decades. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD. After the company was revived in 1988, it recorded seven of the operas.\nAfter the copyrights on the operas expired, numerous companies around the world released popular audio and video recordings of the operas. In 1966 and again in the 1980s, BBC Radio presented complete cycles of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas, with dialogue. Ad hoc casts of operatic singers conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in the 1950s and 60s and Sir Charles Mackerras in the 1990s have made audio sets of several Savoy operas, and in the 1980s Alexander Faris conducted video recordings of eleven of the operas (omitting the last two) with casts including show-business stars as well as professional singers. Joseph Papp's Broadway production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" was put on record in 1981. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has released numerous professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions. Ohio Light Opera has recorded several of the operas in the 21st century. The Really Authentic Gilbert and Sullivan Performance Trust (RAGSPT) of Dunedin, New Zealand, recorded all 13 extant Savoy Operas between 2002 and 2012 and licensed the recordings on Creative Commons.\nCultural influence.\nFor nearly 150 years, Gilbert and Sullivan have pervasively influenced popular culture in the English-speaking world, and lines and quotations from their operas have become part of the English language (even if not originated by Gilbert), such as \"short, sharp shock\", \"What never? Well, hardly ever!\", \"let the punishment fit the crime\", and \"A policeman's lot is not a happy one\". The operas have influenced political style and discourse, literature, film and television, have been widely parodied by humorists, and have been quoted in legal rulings.\nThe American and British musical owes a tremendous debt to G&amp;S, who were admired and copied by early musical theatre authors and composers such as Ivan Caryll, Adrian Ross, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Yip Harburg, Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Gilbert's lyrics served as a model for such 20th-century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, and Lorenz Hart. No\u00ebl Coward wrote: \"I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them, my nurse, Emma, breathed them through her teeth... My aunts and uncles... sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation...\"\nProfessor Carolyn Williams has noted: \"The influence of Gilbert and Sullivan \u2013 their wit and sense of irony, the send ups of politics and contemporary culture \u2013 goes beyond musical theater to comedy in general. Allusions to their work have made their way into our own popular culture\". Gilbert and Sullivan expert and enthusiast Ian Bradley agrees:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The musical is not, of course, the only cultural form to show the influence of G&amp;S. Even more direct heirs are those witty and satirical songwriters found on both sides of the Atlantic in the twentieth century like Michael Flanders and Donald Swann in the United Kingdom and Tom Lehrer in the United States. The influence of Gilbert is discernible in a vein of British comedy that runs through John Betjeman's verse via Monty Python and Private Eye to... television series like \"Yes Minister\"... where the emphasis is on wit, irony, and poking fun at the establishment from within it in a way which manages to be both disrespectful of authority and yet cosily comfortable and urbane.\nThe works of Gilbert and Sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched and parodied. Well known examples of this include Tom Lehrer's \"The Elements\" and \"Clementine\"; Allan Sherman's \"I'm Called Little Butterball\", \"When I Was a Lad\", \"You Need an Analyst\" and \"The Bronx Bird-Watcher\"; and The Two Ronnies' 1973 Christmas Special. Other comedians have used Gilbert and Sullivan songs as a key part of their routines, including Hinge and Bracket, Anna Russell, and the \"HMS Yakko\" episode of the animated TV series \"Animaniacs\". Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising, and elaborate advertising parodies have been published, as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades. Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, such as in the film \"The Girl Said No\". There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films, such as Mike Leigh's \"Topsy-Turvy\" (1999) and \"The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan\" (1953), as well as shows about the partnership, including a 1938 Broadway show, \"Knights of Song\" and a 1975 West End show called \"Tarantara! Tarantara!\"\nIt is not surprising, given the focus of Gilbert on politics, that politicians and political observers have often found inspiration in these works. Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the Lord Chancellor in a production of \"Iolanthe\". Alternatively, Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer is recorded as objecting so strongly to \"Iolanthe\"'s comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office. British politicians, beyond quoting some of the more famous lines, have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches. These include Conservative Peter Lilley's speech mimicking the form of \"I've got a little list\" from \"The Mikado\", listing those he was against, including \"sponging socialists\" and \"young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue\".\nCollaborations.\nOvertures.\nThe overtures from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, and there are many recordings of them. Most of them are structured as a \"potpourri\" of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but not all of them were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided, and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections. Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.\nThose Sullivan wrote himself include the overtures to \"Thespis\", \"Iolanthe\", \"Princess Ida\", \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", \"The Gondoliers\" and \"The Grand Duke\". Sullivan's authorship of the overture to \"Utopia, Limited\" cannot be verified with certainty, as his autograph score is now lost, but it is likely attributable to him, as it consists of only a few bars of introduction, followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera (the Drawing Room scene). \"Thespis\" is now lost, but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture. Very early performances of \"The Sorcerer\" used a section of Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's \"Henry the VIII\", as he did not have time to write a new overture, but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke. Of those remaining, the overtures to \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" and \"The Pirates of Penzance\" are by Alfred Cellier, the overture to \"Patience\" is by Eugene d'Albert, The overtures to \"The Mikado\" and \"Ruddigore\" are by Hamilton Clarke (although the \"Ruddigore\" overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye).\nMost of the overtures are in three sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a concluding allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. Sullivan himself did not always follow this pattern. The overture to \"Princess Ida\", for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to \"Utopia Limited\" is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.\nIn the 1920s, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company commissioned its musical director at the time, Geoffrey Toye, to write new overtures for \"Ruddigore\" and \"The Pirates of Penzance\". Toye's \"Ruddigore\" overture entered the general repertory, and today is more often heard than the original overture by Clarke. Toye's \"Pirates\" overture did not last long and is now presumed lost. Sir Malcolm Sargent devised a new ending for the overture to \"The Gondoliers\", adding the \"cachucha\" from the second act of the opera. This gave the \"Gondoliers\" overture the familiar fast-slow-fast pattern of most of the rest of the Savoy Opera overtures, and this version has competed for popularity with Sullivan's original version.\nAlternative versions.\nTranslations.\nGilbert and Sullivan operas have been translated into many languages, including Yiddish, Hebrew, Portuguese, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Estonian, Hungarian, Russian, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish (reportedly including a zarzuela-style \"Pinafore\"), Catalan and others.\nThere are many German versions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the popular \"Der Mikado\". There is even a German version of \"The Grand Duke\". Some German translations of the operas were made by Friedrich Zell and Richard Gen\u00e9e, librettists of \"Die Fledermaus\" and other Viennese operettas, who even translated one of Sullivan's lesser-known operas, \"The Chieftain\", as \"(Der H\u00e4uptling)\".\nAdaptations.\nGilbert adapted the stories of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" and \"The Mikado\" into children's books called \"The Pinafore Picture Book\" and \"The Story of The Mikado\" giving, in some cases, backstory that is not found in the librettos. Many other children's books have since been written retelling the stories of the operas or adapting characters or events from them. In the 19th century, the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan songs and music were adapted as dance pieces.\nMany musical theatre and film adaptations of the operas have been produced, including the following:\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13022", "revid": "69423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13022", "title": "Garfield", "text": "Comic strip created by Jim Davis\nGarfield is an American comic strip created by Jim Davis. Originally published locally as \"Jon\" in 1976 (later changed to \"Garfield\" in 1977), then in nationwide syndication from 1978, it chronicles the life of the title character Garfield the cat, Odie the dog, and their owner Jon Arbuckle. As of 2013, it was syndicated in roughly 2,580 newspapers and journals; the comic held the Guinness World Record for being the world's most widely syndicated comic strip.\nThough its setting is rarely mentioned in print, \"Garfield\" takes place in Davis's hometown of Muncie, Indiana, according to the television special \"Happy Birthday, Garfield\". Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness and gluttony, as well as his interactions with the other characters.\n\"Garfield\" has been adapted into various other forms of media. Several half-hour television specials aired on CBS between 1982 and 1991, starting with \"Here Comes Garfield\" and ending with \"Garfield Gets a Life\". Also airing on CBS from 1988 to 1994 was the animated series \"Garfield and Friends\", which additionally adapted Davis's comic strip \"U.S. Acres\". All of these featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The feature film ' was released in 2004 and ' two years later. Both were live-action featuring a computer-animated Garfield voiced by Bill Murray. Another animated TV adaptation, \"The Garfield Show\", aired on France 3 in France and Cartoon Network in the United States from 2009 to 2016. In addition, Garfield has been the subject of merchandise, video games, books, and other spin-off merchandise. The strip has also been re-published in compilations; the first of these, \"Garfield at Large\" (1980), developed what came to be known as the \"Garfield format\" for re-publication of newspaper comics in book form.\nOn August 6, 2019, New York City\u2013based Viacom (now Paramount Skydance Corporation) announced that it would acquire Paws, Inc., including most rights to the \"Garfield\" franchise (the comics, merchandise and animated cartoons). The deal did not include the rights to the live-action \"Garfield\" films, which are still owned by The Walt Disney Company through its 20th Century Studios label, as well as \"The Garfield Movie\" (2024), released by Sony Pictures under its Columbia Pictures label. As of 2025, Davis continues to make comics, and a new animated series is in production for Paramount Skydance Corporation subsidiary Nickelodeon.\nHistory.\nCartoonist Jim Davis was born and raised in Muncie, Indiana. In 1973, while working as an assistant for T.K. Ryan's \"Tumbleweeds\", he created the comic strip \"Gnorm Gnat\", which ran in the \"Pendleton Times\" of Pendleton, Indiana, from 1973 to 1975 and met with little success. Davis had tried to syndicate the strip, but was unsuccessful; he noted that one editor told him that his \"art was good, his gags were great, [but] nobody can identify with bugs.\" Davis decided to peruse current comic strips to determine what species of animal characters might be more popular. He felt that dogs were doing well, but noticed no prominent cats.\nThe title character Garfield was based on the cats Davis grew up around; he took his name and personality from Davis' grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, whom he described as \"a large, cantankerous man.\" Garfield's human owner Jon Arbuckle derived his name from a 1950s coffee commercial. Jon's roommate Lyman, added to give Jon someone to talk with, carried on the name of an earlier \"Gnorm Gnat\" character. The final character was Lyman's dog Spot, who was renamed Odie so as to avoid confusion with a dog also named Spot in the comic strip \"Boner's Ark\". From 1976 to early 1978, these characters appeared in a strip called \"Jon\" which also ran in the \"Times\". In 1977, the strip's name was changed to \"Garfield.\" The \"Jon\" comic strip was largely unknown until 2019, when YouTuber Quinton Hoover found several microfilm archives of the \"Jon\" publications from the Pendleton Community Library and Indiana State Library. \"Jon\" first appeared in the \"Pendleton Times\" on January 8, 1976, just two weeks after \"Gnorm Gnat\" ended.\nIn March 1978, United Feature Syndicate accepted the strip for national distribution (which had been retitled \"Garfield\" on September 1, 1977), and the last \"Pendleton Times\" strip ran on March 2, 1978. United Feature Syndicate debuted the first strip nationwide in 41 newspapers, starting on June 19, 1978. After a test run, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" dropped the \"Garfield\" strip, only to reinstate it after readers' complaints.\nThe strip underwent stylistic changes, evolving from the style of the 1976\u201383 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield's design, which underwent a \"Darwinian evolution\" in which he began walking on his hind legs, \"slimmed down\", and \"stopped looking ... through squinty little eyes\" His evolution, according to Davis, was to make it easier to \"push Odie off the table\" or \"reach for a piece of pie\". The redesign was in part on the advice of Davis's mentor and erstwhile rival Charles M. Schulz; though Schulz privately expressed some jealousy at \"Garfield\" overtaking his own strip \"Peanuts\" and thought Davis's characters were lacking in subtlety and nuance, he provided substantial advice to Davis over the years, particularly in setting the franchising and merchandising blueprint Schulz had built for Snoopy, which Davis adopted to great success for \"Garfield\".\n\"Garfield\" quickly became a commercial success. By the beginning of 1981, less than three years after its nationwide launch, the strip was in 850 newspapers and had sold over $15\u00a0million in merchandise. To manage the merchandise, Davis founded Paws, Inc. In 1982 the strip was appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers.\nBy 2002, \"Garfield\" became the world's most syndicated strip, appearing in 2,570\u00a0newspapers with 263\u00a0million readers worldwide; by 2004, \"Garfield\" appeared in nearly 2,600\u00a0newspapers and sold from $750\u00a0million to $1\u00a0billion worth of merchandise in 111\u00a0countries. In 1994, Davis's company, Paws, Inc., purchased all rights to the strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature.\nWhile retaining creative control and being the only person to whom the strip is credited in newspapers, Davis now only writes and usually does the rough sketches. Since the late 1990s most of the work has been done by long-time assistants Brett Koth and Gary Barker. Inking and coloring work is done by other artists, while Davis spends most of the time supervising production and merchandising the characters.\nContent.\nThe strip's title character is Garfield, an obese orange tabby cat. Garfield's personality is defined by his sarcasm, laziness, and gluttony, with the character showing a particular affinity for lasagna. His owner is Jon Arbuckle, a man with an affinity for stereotypically nerdy pastimes. Jon's other pet is Odie, a dim-witted yellow dog. Most strips center around interactions among the three characters' conflicting personalities. For much of the strip's history, one recurring theme was Jon's unsuccessful attempts at dating, particularly involving the pets' veterinarian, Dr. Liz Wilson, a character who also carried over from \"Jon\". However, after a 2006 story arc, the two became engaged and started to live together. Many strips feature Jon, Garfield, and Odie visiting Jon's unnamed parents and brother Doc Boy on their family farm. Other side characters include various mice and spiders within the house, both frequent targets of abuse and scorn from Garfield; Garfield's teddy bear Pooky; Garfield's girlfriend Arlene, a pink cat; Nermal, a gray striped kitten who enjoys tormenting Garfield over his perceived age; and various other pets who live in the neighborhood.\nPart of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his \"grasp of politics isn't strong\", joking that, for many years, he thought \"OPEC was a denture adhesive\".\nOriginally created with the intentions to \"come up with a good, marketable character\", \"Garfield\" has spawned merchandise earning $750\u00a0million to $1\u00a0billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action animated films, three fully computer-animated direct-to-video films, and a theatrical computer-animated film.\nMarketing.\nNow the world's most syndicated comic strip, \"Garfield\" has spawned a \"profusion\" of merchandise including clothing, toys, games, books, Caribbean cruises, credit cards, dolls, DVDs of the movies or the TV series, and related media. In April 2024, Motel 6 announced Garfield as their first \"Chief Pet Officer\" and Garfield-themed rooms for the release of \"The Garfield Movie\".\nMedia.\nBooks.\nSince 1980, the strip has been compiled in anthology books. The first, \"Garfield at Large\", was published in March 1980 by Ballantine Books. These books helped increase the strip's popularity through sales, leading to several of them reaching the top of the \"New York Times\" best sellers list. For these compilation books, Davis devised a book layout which is considerably longer and less tall than the average book. This allowed the strip to be oriented in the same format as it appeared in the newspaper, as opposed to earlier comic strip anthologies which often stacked the panels vertically. This book style has since been referred to in the publishing industry as the \"Garfield format\" and has been adapted by other publishers. Davis noted that it became popular for other comic strip anthologies in particular, such as those of \"The Far Side\".\nInternet.\nGarfield.com was the strip's official website, which contained archives of past strips along with games and an online store. Jim Davis had also collaborated with Ball State University and Pearson Digital Learning to create ProfessorGarfield.org, an educational website with interactive games focusing on math and reading skills, and with Children's Technology Group to create MindWalker, a web browser that allows parents to limit the websites their children can view to a preset list.\nA variety of edited \"Garfield\" strips have been made available on the Internet, with some being hosted on their own unofficial, dedicated sites. Dating from 2005, a site titled the \"Garfield Randomizer\" created a three-panel strip using panels from previous \"Garfield\" strips. Another approach, known as \"Silent Garfield\", involved removing Garfield's thought balloons from the strips. Some examples date from 2006. A webcomic called \"Arbuckle\" does the above but also redraws the originals in a different art style. The \"Arbuckle\" website creator writes: \"'Garfield' changes from being a comic about a sassy, corpulent feline, and becomes a compelling picture of a lonely, pathetic, delusional man who talks to his pets. Consider that Jon, according to Garfield canon, cannot hear his cat's thoughts. This is the world as he sees it. This is his story\".\nAnother variation along the same lines, called \"Realfield\" or \"Realistic Garfield\", was to redraw Garfield as a real cat and remove his thought balloons. Still another approach to editing the strips involved removing Garfield and other main characters from the originals completely, leaving Jon talking to himself. While strips in this vein could be found online as early as 2006, the 2008 site \"Garfield Minus Garfield\" by Dan Walsh received enough online attention to be covered by news media. Reception was largely positive: at its peak, the site received as many as 300,000 hits per day. Fans connected with Jon's \"loneliness and desperation\" and found his \"crazy antics\" humorous; Jim Davis himself called Walsh's strips an \"inspired thing to do\" and said that \"some of [the strips] work better [than the originals]\". Ballantine Books, which publishes the \"Garfield\" books, released a volume of \"Garfield Minus Garfield\" strips on October 28, 2008. The volume retains Davis as author and features a foreword by Walsh.\nOn June 19, 2020, the website was shut down during the strip's 42nd anniversary, following Viacom's acquisition of Paws, Inc. in August 2019. The website now redirects to Nick.com, with an alternative link to GoComics.\nTelevision.\nGarfield's animation debut was on \"The Fantastic Funnies\", which aired on CBS on May 15, 1980, voiced by actor Scott Beach. \"Garfield\" was one of the strips featured, introduced as a newcomer (the strip was only two years old at the time). From 1982 to 1991, twelve primetime \"Garfield\" cartoon specials and one hour-long primetime documentary celebrating the character's 10th anniversary were aired; Lorenzo Music voiced Garfield in all of them. A Saturday-morning cartoon show, \"Garfield and Friends\", aired for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994. This adaptation also starred Music as the voice of Garfield.\n\"The Garfield Show\", a CGI series, started development in 2007 to coincide with the strip's 30th anniversary in 2008. It premiered in France in December 2008 and made its U.S. debut on Cartoon Network on November 2, 2009. A new series is currently in development at Nickelodeon after Paramount Skydance Corporation acquired the franchise.\nFilms.\nA live-action/computed animated film titled ' was released in theaters on June 11, 2004, and a sequel titled ' was released on June 16, 2006. Both films were released by 20th Century Fox with actor Bill Murray voicing the character in both films. Despite receiving negative reviews from critics, the films were both commercial successes. Three direct-to-video films were released by Paws, Inc. in cooperation with Davis Entertainment: \"Garfield Gets Real\" on November 20, 2007, \"Garfield's Fun Fest\" on August 5, 2008, and \"Garfield's Pet Force\" on June 16, 2009.\nOn May 24, 2016, it was announced that Alcon Entertainment would develop a new CG-animated \"Garfield\" film, with John Cohen and Steven P. Wegner producing, and Mark Dindal directing the feature. In August 2019, Viacom acquired the rights to Garfield, leaving the status of the movie for the time uncertain, with Dindal confirming that the film was still in production in December 2020. On November 1, 2021, Chris Pratt was announced as the voice of Garfield, with animation being provided by DNEG, a production company of the film. David Reynolds was announced as the screenwriter of the film, reuniting him with Dindal after they worked together on \"The Emperor's New Groove\". Sony Pictures will maintain global distribution rights for the film, apart from China. On May 24, 2022, Samuel L. Jackson joined the voice cast as Vic, Garfield's father. In September 2022, the film was scheduled to be released on May 24, 2024.\nVideo games.\nA \"Garfield\" video game was developed by Atari, Inc. for its Atari 2600 home video game system and appears in their 1984 catalog. However, after Atari's spinoff and sale of its home games and computers division, owner Jack Tramiel decided the character's royalties were too expensive given the declining state of the video game industry at the time, and the game was cancelled. A ROM image of the game was however released with Jim Davis' blessing.\n' is a 1987 video game for the Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and the Amiga based on the comic strip. Towa Chiki made \"A Week of Garfield\" for the Family Computer, released only in Japan in 1989. Sega also made the 1995 video game ' for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear and Windows 3.1 computers. Other companies made games, such as ' for the DS, published by Game Factory, \"Garfield's Nightmare\" for DS, \"Garfield's Funfest\" for DS, and \"Garfield Labyrinth\" for Game Boy. On PlayStation 2 were \"Garfield\" and \"Garfield 2\" (known in the US as \"Garfield, a Tale of Two Kitties\"). ' was also made for PS2. \"Garfield: Saving Arlene\" was only released in Japan and in the United Kingdom. And recent additions for mobile devices are \"Garfield's Diner\" and \"Garfield's Zombie Defense\".\nKonami also released a Garfield handheld electronic game titled \"Lasagnator\" in 1991, which met with mild success.\nIn 2012, a series of Garfield video games was launched by French publisher Anuman Interactive, including \"My Puzzles with Garfield!\", \"Multiplication Tables with Garfield\", \"Garfield Kart\", \"Garfield Kart: Furious Racing\", and \"Garfield's Match Up\".\nGarfield appears as a playable character in several Nickelodeon crossover games, including \"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl\", \"\", and \"Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2\".\nStage.\nJoseph Papp, producer of \"A Chorus Line\", discussed making a Garfield stage musical, but due to some complications, it never got off ground. A full-length stage musical, titled \"Garfield Live\", was planned to kick off its US tour in September 2010, but got moved to January 18, 2011, where it premiered in Muncie, Indiana. The book was written by Jim Davis, with music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker and Bill Meade, and it was booked by AWA Touring Services. The opening song, \"Cattitude\", can be heard on the national tour's website, along with two more, \"On the Fence\" and \"Going Home!\". When the North American tour concluded in 2012, it toured throughout Asia.\nComic book.\nIn agreement with Paws, Boom! Studios launched in May 2012 a monthly \"Garfield\" comic book, with the first issue featuring a story written by Mark Evanier (who has supervised \"Garfield and Friends\" and \"The Garfield Show\") and illustrated by Davis's long-time assistant Gary Barker.\nArt book.\nIn 2016, Hermes Press signed an agreement with Paws, Inc to publish an art book on the art of author Jim Davis, titled \"The Art of Jim Davis' Garfield\". The book includes an essay by author R.C. Harvey and other original material, and was released in July 2016 for San Diego Comic-Con.\nRestaurant.\nIn 2018, a ghost restaurant themed after the franchise known as GarfieldEATS was opened in Dubai. Customers order food through the official mobile app, which also contains games and allows users to purchase episodes of \"Garfield and Friends\". The restaurant serves lasagna, Garfield-shaped pizza, \"Garfuccinos\", and Garfield-shaped dark chocolate bars. A second location opened in Toronto in 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a dispute over rent, the restaurant closed in 2020.\nMain characters.\nThrough the Garfield strips, there have been many additional characters, but the main ones are described here.\nGarfield.\nFirst appearance: June 19, 1978\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI'm not overweight, I'm undertall.\n \u2014\" (1980)\nGarfield is an orange, fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant (later revealed in the television special \" to be Mama Leoni's Italian Restaurant) who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza.\nGags in the strips commonly deal with Garfield's obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes: \"I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, but the last time he got on a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death\") and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying \"breathing is exercise\".\nThough Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food, and sleep, and during one Christmas he says, \"They say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast\u2026 I wish it would never end.\" However, in the feature film \"Garfield Gets Real\" and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. However, in the feature film \"Garfield Gets Real\" and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals (save for Odie) are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the April 1 (April Fools' Day), 1997, strip drawn by the artists of \"Blondie\" as part of the comic strip switcheroo, Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.\nTo break the fourth wall, June 19 is celebrated within the strip as Garfield's birthday. The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (June 19, 1978), he was portrayed as a fully grown cat, implying that the birthday is for the strip itself.\nJon Arbuckle.\nFirst appearance: June 19, 1978\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Jon:\" Here's my sixth-grade report card. My parents were so proud.\n\"Garfield, reading the report card:\" \"Jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term.\"\n\u2014\"Garfield\" (1996)\nJon (Full name: Jonathan Q. Arbuckle) is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy geek who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested\", attitude and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought. Garfield tends to brush off these attempts with a simple yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. Jon's exact age is unknown, as in one 1980 strip where he stated he was 29 (though the fact he said that he would be 30 if he wasn't sick a year and this was said in the context of a joke told to Garfield makes it possible he is a different age) and in an episode of \"The Garfield Show\" he was stated to be 22. His birthday is July 28.\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that \"two hundred moths committed suicide\"; in another, the \"geek police\" ordered Jon to \"throw out his tie\"), and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with \"polka ninjas\". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a pop-up book in one strip).\nJon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks: \"Woo-ha! Ain't science something?\" Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was portrayed as a cartoonist in the first strip and occasional others in the early years; Davis stated his intent had been to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist. Ultimately, Jon's job has been referenced far more frequently in \"Garfield\" animated series than in the strip.\nOdie.\nFirst appearance: August 8, 1978\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Jon:\" I think I'm having some kind of identity crisis.\n\"Garfield, walking past Odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer:\" He thinks he's having an identity crisis ... Odie thinks he's a potato peeler.\n\u2014\"Garfield\" (1991)\nOdie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, who walks on all four legs, though occasionally he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book \"Garfield: His 9 Lives\" (1984) retcons Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten).\nOdie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as na\u00efve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as in one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading \"War and Peace\" and watching \"An Evening With Mozart\" on television, but in \"Ask a Dog\" strips, he is depicted as illiterate and has to be read to by Garfield. Odie has only thought once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.\nDr. Liz Wilson.\nFirst appearance: June 26, 1979\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Jon:\" Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before? A rice paddy in Hong Kong?\n\"Liz:\" Look, jerk. I'll be the vet for your cat, but I won't play fall guy for your stupid lines. Understood?\n\"Jon, shocked:\" Uh-huh. So long, doctor.\n\"Liz:\" Have a nice day.\n\u2014\"Garfield\" (1979)\nDr. Liz Wilson is Garfield and Odie's sarcastic veterinarian and a long time crush of Jon Arbuckle. She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempts to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeds; however, in an extended story arc from June 20 to July 29, 2006 (with the main event taking place on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss, and have been a couple ever since. Her first appearance was in a 1976 \"Jon\" strip, where Jon runs into her at a laundromat. This became a running gag of the strip, where Jon would often go out of his way to bump into her (a 1976 strip, for example, sees Jon stalking Liz in an alleyway.) in a 1977 strip, Liz takes a job as a waitress at Irma's diner, where Jon would also frequently ask her out to no avail. It wouldn't be until \"Garfield\" was syndicated where Liz would work as a vet. Her birthday is January 13.\nRecurring subjects and themes.\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi, or simply throwing him \"through\" the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish).\nHe also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\"). When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the vet's office (a place he loathes). Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment.\nOn the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, once kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along\u2014once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.\nFrequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting that his thoughts are stuffed up.\nShort storylines.\nOne particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point that she even erects an electric fence (which does not stop him).\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\", \"Garfield's Law\", \"Garfield's History of Dogs\", and \"Garfield's History of Cats\", which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is \"National Fat Week\", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and \"kicking Odie into next week\". Soon, Garfield realizes that \"Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food\" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself).\nA few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a \"nagging feeling I'm forgetting something\", with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel. Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently. Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle-bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve.\nMost of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\nOne storyline, which ran the week before Halloween in 1989, is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous. It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's \"Twentieth Anniversary Collection\", in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986, from August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off \u2013 and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly join, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (December 3\u201323, 1984). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special \"Garfield on the Town\".\nNational Stupid Day.\nThe November 11, 2010, strip featured an interaction between Garfield and a spider. The spider forcefully warns Garfield (who is brandishing a newspaper) that should he be squished, there will be an \"annual day of remembrance\" for him and that he will become famous. The final panel shows a classroom full of spiders, in which the teacher asks, \"does anyone here know why we celebrate 'National Stupid Day'?\"\nSince November 11 is Veterans Day in the US, some readers expressed concern that the strip and its timing were mocking the holiday. Davis released a statement saying that he had no control over the strip's timing but nonetheless apologized for any offense it may have caused.\nPaws, Inc..\nPaws, Inc. was founded in 1981 by Jim Davis to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing. It is located in Muncie, Indiana, and has a staff of nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators. In 1994, the company purchased all rights to the Garfield comic strips from 1978 to 1993 from United Feature Syndicate. However, the original black and white daily strips and original color Sunday strips remain copyrighted to United Feature Syndicate. The full-color daily strips and recolored Sunday strips are copyrighted to Paws as they are considered a different product. Though rights to the strip remain with Paws, Inc., it is currently distributed by the Andrews McMeel Syndication. In August 2019, Davis sold Paws, Inc. to Viacom, who has placed Garfield under the Nickelodeon banner.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13024", "revid": "47248563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13024", "title": "Graham Chapman", "text": "English actor, comedian and writer (1941\u20131989)\nGraham Chapman (8 January 1941 \u2013 4 October 1989) was a British actor, comedian and writer. He was one of the six members of the surrealist comedy group Monty Python. He portrayed authority figures such as The Colonel and the lead role in two Python films, \"Holy Grail\" (1975) and \"Life of Brian\" (1979).\nChapman was born in Leicester and was raised in Melton Mowbray. He enjoyed science, acting, and comedy and after graduating from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, he turned down a career as a doctor to be a comedian. Chapman eventually established a writing partnership with John Cleese, which reached its critical peak with Monty Python during the 1970s. He subsequently left Britain for Los Angeles, where he attempted to be a success on American television, speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film \"Yellowbeard\" (1983), before returning to Britain in the early 1980s.\nChapman was in a long-term partnership with David Sherlock and supportive of gay rights. He was an alcoholic from his time at Cambridge until he quit drinking shortly before working on \"Life of Brian\". He became an enthusiast and patron of the Dangerous Sports Club in the later years of his life. In 1989, Chapman died of tonsil cancer which had spread to his spine. His life and legacy were commemorated at a memorial service in the Great Hall of St Bartholomew's Hospital two months after his death, which was a testament to Chapman's surreal sense of humour that the remaining five Pythons enacted.\nEarly life and education.\nChapman was born on 8 January 1941 at the Stoneygate Nursing Home, Stoneygate, Leicester, the son of policeman Walter Chapman and Edith Towers. Walter Chapman was a police constable at the time of Graham's birth; he ended his career as a chief inspector. He had been trained as a French polisher for a coffin-maker before entering the police force in the 1930s.\nChapman had an elder brother, John, who was born in 1936. They had, according to Chapman and his brother, an \"extremely poor upbringing\". One of Chapman's earliest memories was seeing the remains of Polish airmen who had suffered an aeroplane accident near Leicester, later saying the sight remained in his memory.\nChapman was educated at Melton Mowbray Grammar School. He showed a strong affinity for science, sports and amateur dramatics and was singled out for attention when a local paper reviewed his performance of Mark Antony in Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\". Graham and his brother John were both avid fans of radio comedy, being especially fond of \"The Goon Show\" and Robert Moreton's skill of telling jokes the wrong way round and reversing punchlines. Biographer Jim Yoakum said \"the radio shows didn't necessarily make him laugh\".\nIn 1959, Chapman began reading medicine at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He joined the Cambridge Footlights, where he first began writing with John Cleese. Following graduation, Chapman joined the Footlights show \"Cambridge Circus\" and toured New Zealand, deferring his medical studies for a year. After the tour, he continued his studies at St Bartholomew's Medical College, but became torn between whether to pursue a career in medicine or acting. His brother John later said, \"He [Graham] wasn't ever driven to go into medicine... it wasn't his life's ambition.\"\nCareer.\nPre-Python career.\nFollowing their Footlights success, Chapman and Cleese began to write professionally for the BBC, initially for David Frost but also for Marty Feldman. Frost had recruited Cleese, and in turn Cleese decided he needed Chapman as a sounding board. Chapman also contributed sketches to the radio series \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\" and wrote material on his own and with Bill Oddie. He wrote for \"The Illustrated Weekly Hudd\" (starring Roy Hudd), \"Cilla Black\", \"This Is Petula Clark\" and \"This Is Tom Jones\". Chapman, Cleese and Tim Brooke-Taylor later joined Feldman in the television comedy series \"At Last the 1948 Show\". It was Chapman's first significant role as a performer as well as a writer and he displayed a gift for deadpan comedy (such as in the sketch \"The Minister Who Falls to Pieces\") and imitating various British dialects. The series was the first to feature Chapman's sketch of wrestling with himself.\nDespite the series' success, Chapman was still unsure about abandoning his medical career. In between the two series of \"At Last The 1948 Show\", he completed his studies at St Bartholomew's and became professionally registered as a doctor. Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long-running television comedy series \"Doctor in the House\", and both appeared on a one-off television special, \"How to Irritate People\" alongside Brooke-Taylor and future Python member Michael Palin. One of Cleese's and Chapman's sketches, featuring a used car salesman refusing to believe a customer's model had broken down, became the inspiration for the Dead Parrot sketch. Chapman also co-wrote several episodes of \"Doctor in the House\"'s follow up, \"Doctor in Charge\", with Bernard McKenna.\nMonty Python.\nIn 1969, Chapman and Cleese joined the other Pythons, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, for their sketch comedy series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". The group's writing was split into well-defined teams, with Chapman collaborating almost exclusively with Cleese. Chapman was particularly keen to remove stereotypical punchlines in sketches and created The Colonel, who would stop them in mid-flow by saying they were \"too silly\".\nAlthough the pair were officially equal partners, Cleese later thought that Chapman contributed comparatively little in the way of direct writing, saying \"he would come in, say something marvelous and then drift off in his own mind\". The other Pythons have said that Chapman's biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition for what was funny. Gilliam later recalled that \"Graham would do the nudge that would push it into something extraordinary\". The series was an immediate success, and Chapman was delighted to learn that medical students at St Bartholomew's crowded round the television in the bar to watch it. Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording, leading to the other Pythons calling him \"the late Graham Chapman\".\nChapman's main contribution to the \"Dead Parrot sketch\", derived from the piece within \"How to Irritate People\" and involving a customer returning a faulty toaster, was \"How can we make this \"madder\"?\", turning the toaster into a dead Norwegian Blue parrot. Cleese later said he and Chapman believed that \"there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it\". Cleese was in particular concerned that the Cheese Shop sketch simply was not funny, in that it was just mainly a man listing different types of cheese. Chapman urged his partner to continue with it, telling him \"Trust me, it's funny.\" When it was read out at the next script meeting, Cleese found that the others, particularly Palin, thought it was hilarious. The group felt that Chapman had the best acting skills among them. Cleese complimented Chapman by saying that he was \"particularly a wonderful actor\".\nChapman played the lead role in two Python films, \"Holy Grail\" and \"Life of Brian\". He was chosen to play the lead in \"Holy Grail\" because of the group's respect for his straight acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters. Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude in front of a crowd in \"Life of Brian\", but the scene, filmed in Tunisia, caused problems with the female Muslim extras.\nOther work.\nIn 1975, Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a pilot for a television series, entitled \"Out of the Trees\", but it received poor ratings after being broadcast at the same time as \"Match of the Day\" and only the initial episode was produced. In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film \"The Odd Job\" with Bernard_McKenna_(writer) and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on \"Do Not Adjust Your Set\" with Pythons Idle, Jones and Palin. The film was moderately successful. Chapman guest-starred on several television series including \"The Big Show\".\nIn 1976, Chapman began writing a pirate film, \"Yellowbeard\" (1983), which came out of conversations between Chapman and Moon while in Los Angeles. Moon had always wanted to play Long John Silver, so Chapman began to write a script for him. Moon died in 1978 and the work stalled, eventually being rewritten by McKenna, then by Peter Cook. The film, which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate, also featured appearances from Cook, Marty Feldman, Cleese, Idle, Spike Milligan and Cheech &amp; Chong. It marked the last appearance of Feldman, who suffered a fatal heart attack in December 1982. The project was fraught with financial difficulties and at times there was not enough money to pay the crew. It was released to mixed reviews. David Robinson, reviewing the film in \"The Times\", said that \"the Monty Python style of comic anarchy requires more than scatology, rude words and funny faces\".\nChapman published his memoirs, \"A Liar's Autobiography\", in 1980, choosing the title because he said \"it's almost \"impossible\" to tell the truth\". He returned to Britain permanently after \"Yellowbeard\" was released. He became involved with the extreme sports club Dangerous Sports Club, which popularised bungee jumping. Chapman was scheduled to perform a bungee jump himself, but it was cancelled due to safety concerns.\nAfter reuniting with the other Pythons in the film \"The Meaning of Life\" (1983), Chapman began a lengthy series of US college tours, talking about The Pythons, the Dangerous Sports Club and his friend Moon, among other subjects. \"Saturday Night Live\" creator and Python fan Lorne Michaels persuaded Chapman to star in \"The Big Show\".\nIn 1988, Chapman appeared in the Iron Maiden video \"Can I Play with Madness\". The same year, he starred in a pilot of a proposed television series, \"Jake's Journey\", but financial problems prevented a full series from being made. In 1988, he also appeared on stage with three other Pythons (Gilliam, Jones and Palin) at the 41st British Academy Film Awards where Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema.\nBroadcast in November 1989, the 20th anniversary television special, \"Parrot Sketch Not Included \u2013 20 Years of Monty Python\", hosted by Python fan Steve Martin, was Chapman's final onscreen appearance with the other five Python members. Chapman was intended to be cast in the \"Red Dwarf\" episode \"Timeslides\", but died before shooting could begin.\nPersonal life.\nChapman first met his long-term partner David Sherlock in Ibiza in 1966. He later described realising he was gay as \"an important moment in my life\".\nThe following year, he told his close friends, including Cleese and Feldman, about his relationship. Chapman and Sherlock moved to Belsize Park in 1968, and the pair enjoyed visiting gay clubs in Central London. In the early 1970s, after Chapman had found fame with Monty Python, they moved to a house in Highgate, North London.\nIn 1972, on a television show hosted by English jazz and blues singer George Melly, Chapman first disclosed his homosexuality publicly, becoming one of the first celebrities to do so. He was a vocal spokesman for gay rights, supporting the Gay Liberation Front. In 1972, Chapman supported the newspaper \"Gay News\", which listed him as one of the publication's \"special friends\" in recognition. During a college tour, Chapman mentioned that a television audience member had written to the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, citing a Bible passage that said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned. Idle replied jokingly that they had found the perpetrator and killed him.\nIn 1971, Chapman and Sherlock adopted John Tomiczek as their son. Chapman met Tomiczek when Tomiczek was a 14-year-old run-away from Liverpool. After discussions with Tomiczek's father, it was agreed that Chapman would become Tomiczek's legal guardian. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant presence in Chapman's life. During the 1970s, Chapman became increasingly concerned about the Pythons' income and finances. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to avoid British income tax. In the mid-1980s, he returned to the UK and moved to Maidstone, Kent, with Sherlock and Tomiczek. Tomiczek later became Chapman's business manager; he died of a heart attack in 1992 at age 35.\nChapman took up pipe smoking aged 15, which became a lifelong habit. He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St. Bartholomew's, favouring gin. He was an alcoholic from his time at Cambridge until he quit drinking shortly before working on \"Life of Brian\". By the time Monty Python went out on tour in 1973, Chapman's drinking had begun to affect his performance, causing him to miss cues to go on stage, and he was known to suffer from delirium tremens (DTs). He stopped drinking during Christmas 1977, concerned about being able to act in \"Life of Brian\" successfully, and remained sober for the rest of his life.\nIllness and death.\nIn 1988 Chapman made a routine visit to a dentist, who found a small, malignant tumour on one of his tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year it was discovered that the cancer had spread into Chapman's spinal column, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", the final time he appeared on television.\nChapman died on 4 October 1989 in Maidstone Hospital from resulting complications, aged 48. At the time of his death, he was being visited by Sherlock, his brother John and his sister-in-law, and fellow Pythons Palin and Cleese, the latter of whom had to be led out of the room to deal with his grief.\nPalin was alone with Chapman when he died, and recounted the moment of death in his diary entry of 4 October 1989:\nI walk round to the window and then come back to his right-hand side; take his cold hand in my hot one and tell him, quite loudly, that we all love him.\nThe regularity of his breathing is broken. A long pause, then a long inhalation. His lower jaw rises, his mouth closes and bares his lower teeth. I reach for my cup of tea. He breathes heavily. I start to talk again. A single tear emerges from his right eye and rolls down his cheek. The mouth is set. The great ridge of Adam's apple is still. There's no more noise from him. Nothing dramatic, no rattles or chokes or cries. He's not moving any more.\nI don't want to leave him, nor do I want to make any noise or sudden movement. It's a moment out of time. All I feel is that I shouldn't be here, that David and John his brother should be.\nThere's noise outside. The clatter of patients and visiting friends. I call John and David to go in. They re-emerge a minute or so later. Graham is dead. It's about twenty past seven.\nPeter Cook had intended to visit, but arrived too late and was visibly shaken by the news. Chapman's death occurred on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the Pythons' collective debut on British television, and Jones called it \"the worst case of party-pooping in all history\".\nMemorial service.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I guess that we're all thinking how sad it is that a man of such talent, of such capability for kindness, of such unusual intelligence, should now, so suddenly, be spirited away at the age of only forty-eight, before he'd achieved many of the things of which he was capable, and before he'd had enough fun. Well, I feel that I should say, nonsense. Good riddance to him, the freeloading bastard, I hope he fries! And the reason I feel I should say this, is he would never forgive me if I didn't, if I threw away this glorious opportunity to shock you all on his behalf. Anything for him, but mindless good taste.\"\nJohn Cleese at Graham Chapman's memorial service\nThe five surviving Python members had decided to stay away from Chapman's private funeral to prevent it from becoming a media circus and to give his family some privacy. They sent a wreath in the shape of the Python foot, with the message: \"To Graham from the other Pythons with all our love. PS: Stop us if we're getting too silly\". The Rolling Stones also sent a floral arrangement, saying \"Thanks for all the laughs.\"\nA public memorial service for Chapman was held in the Great Hall of St Bartholomew's on 3 December, two months after his death. The service began with a chorus of the hymn \"Jerusalem\" sung in Engrish with a mock Chinese accent. Cleese delivered a eulogy to Chapman with shock humour that he believed Chapman would have appreciated and became the first person at a televised British memorial service to say \"fuck\". Palin also delivered a eulogy to Chapman, as did Idle, quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin again. Idle led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman's close friends and family in a rendition of the song \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\", from \"Life of Brian\", and later closed his remarks by saying: \"I'd just like to be the last person at this meeting to say 'fuck'.\"\nTen years after Chapman's death, his ashes were first rumoured to have been \"blasted into the skies in a rocket\" with assistance from the Dangerous Sports Club. In a second rumour, Chapman's ashes had been scattered on the mountains of Snowdonia, Wales, where he had visited regularly as a climber.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"We would only do a reunion if Chapman came back from the dead. So we're negotiating with his agent.\"\nEric Idle on speculation of a Monty Python reunion\nFollowing Chapman's death, reformations of the Pythons have included an urn said to contain his ashes. At the 1998 Aspen Comedy Arts festival, the urn, brought onstage by a stiff English butler, was \"accidentally\" knocked over by Terry Gilliam, spilling the \"ashes\" on-stage. The apparently cremated remains were then removed with a DustBuster. Idle recalled meeting Sherlock, saying \"I wish he [Chapman] was here now\" and Sherlock replied \"Oh, but he is. He's in my pocket!\"\nAsteroid 9617 Grahamchapman, named in Chapman's honour, is one of six asteroids named after the Python members.\nIn 1997, Sherlock allowed Jim Yoakum to start the \"Graham Chapman Archives\". Later that year, the novel \"Graham Crackers: Fuzzy Memories, Silly Bits, and Outright Lies\" was released. It is a semi-sequel to \"A Liar's Autobiography\", with Chapman's works compiled by Yoakum. A compendium of writings, \"Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays &amp; Gondolas\", also compiled and edited by Yoakum, was published in 2005 in association with the David Sherlock and John Tomiczek trust. In 2000, Chapman's play \"O Happy Day\" was performed by Dad's Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta, Georgia, with the assistance of Cleese and Palin. In 2006, the album and DVD release \"Looks Like Another Brown Trouser Job\" came out, featuring a college lecture recorded in April 1988.\nIn June 2011, it was announced that Cleese, Jones, Gilliam and Palin would perform in a 3D-animated version of Chapman's memoir \"A Liar's Autobiography: Volume VI\". Co-director Jeff Simpson worked closely with Chapman's estate and the surviving Python members to \"get this exactly right\". The film, titled \"\", was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2012 and premiered in the UK the following month as part of the BFI London Film Festival. The voices of Cleese, Gilliam, Jones and Palin were spliced into commentary recorded by Chapman reading from his memoir and taped shortly before his death. The film's official trailer quoted Chapman as saying, \"This is the best film I've been in since I died.\"\nIn September 2012, a British Comedy Society blue plaque commemorating Chapman was unveiled at The Angel pub in Highgate by Jones, Palin, Barry Cryer, Ray Davies and Carol Cleveland. Palin said, \"Highgate was his patch, and he should be celebrated because he was a very good, brilliant, funny, nice, wise, kind man, who occasionally drank too much.\"\nIn December 2014, a green plaque funded by Leicestershire County Council was placed on Chapman's former home in Burton Road, Melton Mowbray. A year later, a blue plaque at the entrance of Chapman's old school, King Edward VII School, was reported as stolen but was later found inside the building. In March 2017, the plaque was moved to Melton Mowbray town centre.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It reaches a length of , a weight of up to and lives between 55 and 70 years, although one female was estimated to be 75\u201380 years of age. The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin. Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted. The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus \"Eschrichtius\". It is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae, however some recent studies classify it as a member of the family Balaenopteridae. This mammal is descended from filter-feeding whales that appeared during the Neogene.\nThe gray whale is distributed in a Northeast Pacific (North American), and an endangered Northwest Pacific (Asian), population. North Atlantic populations were extirpated (perhaps by whaling) on the European coast before 500 CE, and on the American and African Atlantic coasts around the late 17th to early 18th centuries. However, in the 2010s and 2020s there have been rare sightings of gray whales in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and even off South Atlantic coasts. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTaxonomy.\nThe gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family, \"Eschrichtius\" and Eschrichtiidae, but an extinct species was discovered and placed in the genus in 2017, the Akishima whale (\"E. akishimaensis\"). Some recent studies place gray whales as being outside the rorqual clade, but as the closest relatives to the rorquals. But other recent DNA analyses have suggested that certain rorquals of the family Balaenopteridae, such as the humpback whale, \"Megaptera novaeangliae\", and fin whale, \"Balaenoptera physalus\", are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whales. The American Society of Mammalogists has followed this classification.\nJohn Edward Gray placed it in its own genus in 1865, naming it in honour of physician and zoologist Daniel Frederik Eschricht. The common name of the whale comes from its coloration. The subfossil remains of now extinct gray whales from the Atlantic coasts of England and Sweden were used by Gray to make the first scientific description of a species then surviving only in Pacific waters. The living Pacific species was described by Cope as \"Rhachianectes glaucus\" in 1869. Skeletal comparisons showed the Pacific species to be identical to the Atlantic remains in the 1930s, and Gray's naming has been generally accepted since. Although identity between the Atlantic and Pacific populations cannot be proven by anatomical data, its skeleton is distinctive and easy to distinguish from that of all other living whales.\nMany other names have been ascribed to the gray whale, including desert whale, devilfish, gray back, mussel digger and rip sack. The name \"Eschrichtius gibbosus\" is sometimes seen; this is dependent on the acceptance of a 1777 description by Erxleben.\nTaxonomic history.\nA number of 18th century authors described the gray whale as \"Balaena gibbosa\", the \"whale with six bosses\", apparently based on a brief note by :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Scrag Whale is near a kin to the Fin-back, but instead of a Fin upon his Back, the Ridge of the Afterpart of his Back is cragged with half a Dozen Knobs or Nuckles; he is nearest the right Whale in Figure and for Quantity of Oil; his Bone is white, but won't split.\nThe gray whale was first described as a distinct species by based on a subfossil found in the brackish Baltic Sea, apparently a specimen from the now extinct north Atlantic population. Lilljeborg, however, identified it as \"Balaenoptera robusta\", a species of rorqual. realized that the rib and scapula of the specimen was different from those of any known rorquals, and therefore erected a new genus for it, \"Eschrichtius\". were convinced that the bones described by Lilljeborg could not belong to a living species but that they were similar to fossils that Van Beneden had described from the harbour of Antwerp (most of his named species are now considered nomina dubia) and therefore named the gray whale \"Plesiocetus robustus\", reducing Lilljeborg's and Gray's names to synonyms.\nCharles Melville Scammon produced one of the earliest descriptions of living Pacific gray whales, and notwithstanding that he was among the whalers who nearly drove them to extinction in the lagoons of the Baja California Peninsula, they were and still are associated with him and his description of the species. At this time, however, the extinct Atlantic population was considered a separate species (\"Eschrischtius robustus\") from the living Pacific population (\"Rhachianectes glaucus\").\nThings got increasingly confused as 19th century scientists introduced new species at an alarming rate (e.g. \"Eschrichtius pusillus\", \"E. expansus\", \"E. priscus\", \"E. mysticetoides\"), often based on fragmentary specimens, and taxonomists started to use several generic and specific names interchangeably and not always correctly (e.g. \"Agalephus gobbosus\", \"Balaenoptera robustus\", \"Agalephus gibbosus\"). Things got even worse in the 1930s when it was finally realised that the extinct Atlantic population was the same species as the extant Pacific population, and the new combination \"Eschrichtius gibbosus\" was proposed.\nDescription.\nThe gray whale has a dark slate-gray color and is covered by characteristic gray-white patterns, which are scars left by parasites that drop off in its cold feeding grounds. Individual whales are typically identified using photographs of their dorsal surface, matching the scars and patches associated with parasites that have either fallen off or are still attached. They have two blowholes on top of their head, which can create a distinctive heart-shaped blow at the surface in calm wind conditions.\nGray whales measure from in length for newborns to for adults (females tend to be slightly larger than adult males). Newborns are a darker gray to black in color. A mature gray whale can reach , with a typical range of , making them the ninth largest sized species of cetacean.\nNotable features that distinguish the gray whale from other mysticetes include its baleen that is variously described as cream, off-white, or blond in color and is unusually short. Small depressions on the upper jaw each contain a lone stiff hair, but are only visible on close inspection. Its head's ventral surface lacks the numerous prominent furrows of the related rorquals, instead bearing two to five shallow furrows on the throat's underside. The gray whale also lacks a dorsal fin, instead bearing 6 to 12 dorsal crenulations (\"knuckles\"), which are raised bumps on the midline of its rear quarter, leading to the flukes. This is known as the dorsal ridge. The tail itself is across and deeply notched at the center while its edges taper to a point.\nPacific groups.\nThe two populations of Pacific gray whales (east and west) are morphologically and phylogenically different. Other than DNA structures, differences in proportions of several body parts and body colors including skeletal features, and length ratios of flippers and baleen plates have been confirmed between Eastern and Western populations, and some claims that the original eastern and western groups could have been much more distinct than previously thought, enough to be counted as subspecies. Since the original Asian and Atlantic populations have become extinct, it is difficult to determine the unique features among whales in these stocks. However, there have been observations of some whales showing distinctive, blackish body colors in recent years. This corresponds with the DNA analysis of last recorded stranding in China. Differences were also observed between Korean and Chinese specimens.\nPopulations.\nNorth Pacific.\nTwo Pacific Ocean populations are known to exist: one population that is very low, whose migratory route is presumed to be between the Sea of Okhotsk and southern Korea, and a larger population numbering about 27,000 individuals in the eastern Pacific, traveling between the waters off northernmost Alaska and Baja California Sur. Mothers make this journey accompanied by their calves, usually hugging the shore in shallow kelp beds, and fight viciously to protect their young if they are attacked, earning gray whales the moniker \"devil fish.\"\nThe western population has had a very slow growth rate despite heavy conservation action over the years, likely due to their very slow reproduction rate. The state of the population hit an all-time low in 2010, when no new reproductive females were recorded, resulting in a minimum of 26 reproductive females being observed since 1995. Even a very small number of additional annual female deaths will cause the subpopulation to decline. However, as of 2018, evidence has indicated that the western population is markedly increasing in number, especially off Sakhalin Island. Following this, the IUCN downlisted the population's conservation status from critically endangered to endangered.\nNorth Atlantic.\nThe gray whale became extinct in the North Atlantic in the 18th century. They had been seasonal migrants to coastal waters of both sides of Atlantic, including the Baltic Sea, the Wadden Sea, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, Pamlico Sound and possibly Hudson Bay. Radiocarbon dating of subfossil or fossil European (Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom) coastal remains confirms this, with whaling the possible cause for the population's extinction. Remains dating from the Roman epoch were found in the Mediterranean during excavation of the antique harbor of Lattara near Montpellier, France, in 1997, raising the question of whether Atlantic gray whales migrated up and down the coast of Europe from the Wadden Sea to calve in the Mediterranean. A 2018 study utilizing ancient DNA barcoding and collagen peptide matrix fingerprinting confirmed that Roman era whale bones east of the Strait of Gibraltar were gray whales (and North Atlantic right whales), confirming that gray whales once ranged into the Mediterranean. Similarly, radiocarbon dating of American east coastal subfossil remains confirm that gray whales existed there at least through the 17th century. This population ranged at least from Southampton, New York, to Jupiter Island, Florida, the latest from 1675. In his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony a whale of the kind called \"scragg\" entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. A. B. Van Deinse points out that the \"scrag whale\", described by P. Dudley in 1725 as one of the species hunted by the early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale.\nSince the 2010s, there have been occasional sightings of gray whales in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea, including one off the coast of Israel and one off the coast of Namibia. These were presumably migrants from the North Pacific population through the Arctic Ocean. A 2015 study of DNA from subfossil gray whales indicated that this may not be a historically unique event. That study suggested that over the past 100,000 years there have been several migrations of gray whales between the Pacific and Atlantic, with the most recent large scale migration of this sort occurring about 5,000 years ago. These migrations corresponded to times of relatively high temperatures in the Arctic Ocean. In 2021, one individual was seen in the port of Rabat, Morocco, followed by sightings in Algeria and Italy. In March 2024, New England Aquarium researchers photographed a gray whale south of Nantucket, Massachusetts.\nPre-whaling abundance.\nResearchers used a genetic approach to estimate pre-whaling abundance based on samples from 42 gray whales, and reported DNA variability at 10 genetic loci consistent with a population size of 76,000\u2013118,000 individuals, three to five times larger than the average census size as measured through 2007. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has collected surveys of gray whale population since at least the 1960s. They state that \"the most recent population estimate [from 2007] was approximately 19,000 whales, with a high probability (88%) that the population is at 'optimum sustainable population' size, as defined by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\" They speculate that the ocean ecosystem has likely changed since the pre-whaling era, making a return to pre-whaling numbers infeasible. Factors limiting or threatening current population levels include ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and changes in sea-ice coverage associated with climate change.\nIntegration and recolonization.\nSeveral whales seen off Sakhalin and on Kamchatka Peninsula have been confirmed to migrate towards eastern side of Pacific and join the larger eastern population. In January 2011, a gray whale that had been tagged in the western population was tracked as far east as the eastern population range off the coast of British Columbia. Recent findings from either stranded or entangled specimens indicate that the original western population have become functionally extinct, and possibly all the whales that have appeared on Japanese and Chinese coasts in modern times are vagrants or re-colonizers from the eastern population.\nIn mid-1980, there were three gray whale sightings in the eastern Beaufort Sea, placing them further east than their known range at the time. Recent increases in sightings are confirmed in Arctic areas of the historic range for Atlantic stocks, most notably on several locations in the Laptev Sea including the New Siberian Islands in the East Siberian Sea, and around the marine mammal sanctuary of the Franz Josef Land, indicating possible earlier pioneers of re-colonizations. These whales were darker in body color than those whales seen in Sea of Okhotsk. In May 2010, a gray whale was sighted off the Mediterranean shore of Israel. It has been speculated that this whale crossed from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the Northwest Passage, since an alternative route around Cape Horn would not be contiguous to the whale's established territory. There has been gradual melting and recession of Arctic sea ice with extreme loss in 2007 rendering the Northwest Passage \"fully navigable\". The same whale was sighted again on May 30, 2010, off the coast of Barcelona, Spain.\nIn May 2013, a gray whale was sighted off Walvis Bay, Namibia. Scientists from the Namibian Dolphin Project confirmed the whale's identity and thus provides the only sighting of this species in the Southern Hemisphere. Photographic identification suggests that this is a different individual than the one spotted in the Mediterranean in 2010. As of July 2013, the Namibian whale was still being seen regularly.\nIn March 2021, a gray whale was sighted near Rabat, the capital of Morocco. In April, additional sightings were made off Algeria and Italy.\nIn December 2023, a gray whale was sighted off Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.\nGenetic analysis of fossil and prefossil gray whale remains in the Atlantic Ocean suggests several waves of dispersal from the Pacific to the Atlantic related to successive periods of climactic warming \u2013 during the Pleistocene before the last glacial period and the early Holocene immediately following the opening of the Bering Strait. This information and the recent sightings of Pacific gray whales in the Atlantic, suggest that another range expansion to the Atlantic may be starting.\nLife history.\nReproduction.\nBreeding behavior is complex and often involves three or more animals. Both male and female whales reach puberty between the ages of 6 and 12 with an average of eight to nine years. Females show highly synchronized reproduction, undergoing oestrus in late November to early December. During the breeding season, it is common for females to have several mates. This single ovulation event is believed to coincide with the species' annual migration patterns, when births can occur in warmer waters. Most females show biennial reproduction, although annual births have been reported. Males also show seasonal changes, experiencing an increase in testes mass that correlates with the time females undergo oestrus. Currently there are no accounts of twin births, although an instance of twins \"in utero\" has been reported.\nThe gestation period for gray whales is approximately 13\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 months, with females giving birth every one to three years. In the latter half of the pregnancy, the fetus experiences a rapid growth in length and mass. Similar to the narrow breeding season, most calves are born within a six-week time period in mid January. The calf is born tail first, and measures about 14\u201316\u00a0ft in length, and a weight of 2,000\u00a0lbs. Females lactate for approximately seven months following birth, at which point calves are weaned and maternal care begins to decrease. The shallow lagoon waters in which gray whales reproduce are believed to protect the newborn from sharks and orcas.\nOn 7 January 2014, a pair of newborn or aborted conjoined twin gray whale calves were found dead in the Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Scammon's Lagoon), off the west coast of Mexico. They were joined by their bellies.\nFeeding.\nThe whale feeds mainly on benthic crustaceans (such as amphipods and ghost shrimp), which it eats by turning on its side and scooping up sediments from the sea floor. This unique feeding selection makes gray whales one of the most strongly reliant on coastal waters among baleen whales. It is classified as a baleen whale and has baleen, or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including amphipods taken in along with sand, water and other material. Off Vancouver Island, gray whales commonly feed on shrimp-like mysids. When mysids are abundant gray whales are present in fairly large numbers. Despite mysids being a prey of choice, gray whales are opportunistic feeders and can easily switch from feeding planktonically to benthically. When gray whales feed planktonically, they roll onto their right side while their fluke remains above the surface, or they apply the skimming method seen in other baleen whales (skimming the surface with their mouth open). This skimming behavior mainly seems to be used when gray whales are feeding on crab larvae. Other prey items include polychaete worms, herring eggs, various forms of larvae, and small fish.\nGray whales feed benthically, by diving to the ocean floor and rolling on to their side, (like blue whales, gray whales seem to favor rolling onto their right side) and suck up prey from the sea floor. Gray whales seem to favor feeding planktonically in their feeding grounds, but benthically along their migration route in shallower water. Mostly, the animal feeds in the northern waters during the summer; and opportunistically feeds during its migration, depending primarily on its extensive fat reserves. Another reason for this opportunistic feeding may be the result of population increases, resulting in the whales taking advantage of whatever prey is available, due to increased competition. Feeding areas during migration seem to include the Gulf of California, Monterey Bay and Baja California Sur. Calf gray whales drink of their mothers' 53% fat milk per day.\nThe main feeding habitat of the western Pacific subpopulation is the shallow ( depth) shelf off northeastern Sakhalin Island, particularly off the southern portion of Piltun Lagoon, where the main prey species appear to be amphipods and isopods. In some years, the whales have also used an offshore feeding ground in depth southeast of Chayvo Bay, where benthic amphipods and cumaceans are the main prey species. Some gray whales have also been seen off western Kamchatka, but to date all whales photographed there are also known from the Piltun area.\nDiagram of the gray whale seafloor feeding strategy\nMigration.\nPredicted distribution models indicate that overall range in the last glacial period was broader or more southerly distributed, and inhabitations in waters where species presences lack in present situation, such as in southern hemisphere and south Asian waters and northern Indian Ocean were possible due to feasibility of the environment on those days. Range expansions due to recoveries and re-colonization in the future is likely to happen and the predicted range covers wider than that of today. The gray whale undergoes the longest migration of any mammal.\nEastern Pacific population.\nEach October, as the northern ice pushes southward, small groups of eastern gray whales in the eastern Pacific start a two- to three-month, trip south. Beginning in the Bering and Chukchi seas and ending in the warm-water lagoons of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula and the southern Gulf of California, they travel along the west coast of Canada, the United States and Mexico.\nTraveling night and day, the gray whale averages approximately per day at an average speed of . This round trip of is believed to be the longest annual migration of any mammal. By mid-December to early January, the majority are usually found between Monterey and San Diego such as at Morro bay, often visible from shore. The whale watching industry provides ecotourists and marine mammal enthusiasts the opportunity to see groups of gray whales as they migrate.\nBy late December to early January, eastern grays begin to arrive in the calving lagoons and bays on the west coast of Baja California Sur. The three most popular are San Ignacio, Magdalena Bay to the south, and, to the north, Laguna Ojo de Liebre (formerly known in English as Scammon's Lagoon after whaleman Charles Melville Scammon, who discovered the lagoons in the 1850s and hunted the grays).\nGray whales once ranged into Sea of Cortez and Pacific coasts of continental Mexico south to the Islas Mar\u00edas, Bah\u00eda de Banderas, and Nayarit/Jalisco, and there were two modern calving grounds in Sonora (Tojahui or Yavaros) and Sinaloa (Bahia Santa Maria, Bahia Navachiste, La Reforma, Bahia Altata) until being abandoned in the 1980s.\nThese first whales to arrive are usually pregnant mothers looking for the protection of the lagoons to bear their calves, along with single females seeking mates. By mid-February to mid-March, the bulk of the population has arrived in the lagoons, filling them with nursing, calving and mating gray whales.\nThroughout February and March, the first to leave the lagoons are males and females without new calves. Pregnant females and nursing mothers with their newborns are the last to depart, leaving only when their calves are ready for the journey, which is usually from late March to mid-April. Often, a few mothers linger with their young calves well into May. Whale watching in Baja's lagoons is particularly popular because the whales often come close enough to boats for tourists to pet them.\nBy late March or early April, the returning animals can be seen from Puget Sound to Canada.\nResident groups.\nA population of about 200 gray whales stay along the eastern Pacific coast from Canada to California throughout the summer, not making the farther trip to Alaskan waters. This summer resident group is known as the Pacific Coast feeding group.\nAny historical or current presence of similar groups of residents among the western population is currently unknown, however, whalers' logbooks and scientific observations indicate that possible year-round occurrences in Chinese waters and Yellow and Bohai basins were likely to be summering grounds. Some of the better documented historical catches show that it was common for whales to stay for months in enclosed waters elsewhere, with known records in the Seto Inland Sea and the Gulf of Tosa. Former feeding areas were once spread over large portions on mid-Honshu to northern Hokkaido, and at least whales were recorded for majority of annual seasons including wintering periods at least along east coasts of Korean Peninsula and Yamaguchi Prefecture. Some recent observations indicate that historic presences of resident whales are possible: a group of two or three were observed feeding in Izu \u014cshima in 1994 for almost a month, two single individuals stayed in Ise Bay for almost two months in the 1980s and in 2012, the first confirmed living individuals in Japanese EEZ in the Sea of Japan and the first of living cow-calf pairs since the end of whaling stayed for about three weeks on the coastline of Teradomari in 2014. One of the pair returned to the same coasts at the same time of the year in 2015 again. Reviewing on other cases on different locations among Japanese coasts and islands observed during 2015 indicate that spatial or seasonal residencies regardless of being temporal or permanental staying once occurred throughout many parts of Japan or on other coastal Asia.\nWestern population.\nThe current western gray whale population summers in the Sea of Okhotsk, mainly off Piltun Bay region at the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island (Russian Federation). There are also occasional sightings off the eastern coast of Kamchatka (Russian Federation) and in other coastal waters of the northern Okhotsk Sea. Its migration routes and wintering grounds are poorly known, the only recent information being from occasional records on both the eastern and western coasts of Japan and along the Chinese coast. Gray whale had not been observed on Commander Islands until 2016. The northwestern pacific population consists of approximately 300 individuals, based on photo identification collected off of Sakhalin Island and Kamchatka.\nThe Sea of Japan was once thought not to have been a migration route, until several entanglements were recorded. Any records of the species had not been confirmed since after 1921 on Kyushu. However, there were numerous records of whales along the Genkai Sea off Yamaguchi Prefecture, in Ine Bay in the Gulf of Wakasa, and in Tsushima. Gray whales, along with other species such as right whales and Baird's beaked whales, were common features off the north eastern coast of Hokkaido near Teshio, Ishikari Bay near Otaru, the Shakotan Peninsula, and islands in the La P\u00e9rouse Strait such as Rebun Island and Rishiri Island. These areas may also have included feeding grounds. There are shallow, muddy areas favorable for feeding whales off Shiretoko, such as at Shibetsu, the Notsuke Peninsula, Cape Ochiishi on Nemuro Peninsula, Mutsu Bay, along the Tottori Sand Dunes, in the Suou-nada Sea, and \u014cmura Bay.\nThe historical calving grounds were unknown but might have been along southern Chinese coasts from Zhejiang and Fujian Province to Guangdong, especially south of Hailing Island and to near Hong Kong. Possibilities include Daya Bay, Wailou Harbour on Leizhou Peninsula, and possibly as far south as Hainan Province and Guangxi, particularly around Hainan Island. These areas are at the southwestern end of the known range. It is unknown whether the whales' normal range once reached further south, to the Gulf of Tonkin. In addition, the existence of historical calving ground on Taiwan and Penghu Islands (with some fossil records and captures), and any presence in other areas outside of the known ranges off Babuyan Islands in Philippines and coastal Vietnamese waters in Gulf of Tonkin are unknown. There is only one confirmed record of accidentally killing of the species in Vietnam, at Ngoc Vung Island off Ha Long Bay in 1994 and the skeleton is on exhibition at the Quang Ninh Provincial Historical Museum. Gray whales are known to occur in Taiwan Strait even in recent years.\nIt is also unknown whether any winter breeding grounds ever existed beyond Chinese coasts. For example, it is not known if the whales visited the southern coasts of the Korean Peninsula, adjacent to the Island of Jeju), Haiyang Island, the Gulf of Shanghai, or the Zhoushan Archipelago. There is no evidence of historical presence in Japan south of \u014csumi Peninsula; only one skeleton has been discovered in Miyazaki Prefecture. Hideo Omura once considered the Seto Inland Sea to be a historical breeding ground, but only a handful of capture records support this idea, although migrations into the sea have been confirmed. Recent studies using genetics and acoustics, suggest that there are several wintering sites for western gray whales such as Mexico and the East China sea. However, their wintering ground habits in the western North Pacific are still poorly understood and additional research is needed.\nRecent migration in Asian waters.\nEven though South Korea put the most effort into conservation of the species among the Asian nations, there are no confirmed sightings along the Korean Peninsula or even in the Sea of Japan in recent years.\nThe last confirmed record in Korean waters was the sighting of a pair off Bangeojin, Ulsan in 1977. Prior to this, the last was of catches of 5 animals off Ulsan in 1966. There was a possible sighting of a whale within the port of Samcheok in 2015.\nThere had been 24 records along Chinese coasts including sighting, stranding, intended hunts, and bycatches since 1933. The last report of occurrence of the species in Chinese waters was of a stranded semi adult female in the Bohai Sea in 1996, and the only record in Chinese waters in the 21st century was of a fully-grown female being killed by entanglement in Pingtan, China in November, 2007. DNA studies indicated that this individual might have originated from the eastern population rather than the western.\nMost notable observations of living whales after the 1980s were of 17 or 18 whales along Primorsky Krai in late October, 1989 (prior to this, a pair was reported swimming in the area in 1987), followed by the record of 14 whales in La P\u00e9rouse Strait on 13th, June in 1982 (in this strait, there was another sighting of a pair in October, 1987). In 2011, presences of gray whales were acoustically detected among pelagic waters in East China Sea between Chinese and Japanese waters.\nSince the mid-1990s, almost all the confirmed records of living animals in Asian waters were from Japanese coasts. There have been eight to fifteen sightings and stray records including unconfirmed sightings and re-sightings of the same individual, and one later killed by net-entanglement. The most notable of these observations are listed below:\nWhaling.\nNorth Pacific.\nEastern population.\nHumans and orcas are the adult gray whale's only predators, although orcas are the more prominent predator. Aboriginal hunters, including those on Vancouver Island and the Makah in Washington, have hunted gray whales.\nCommercial whaling of the species by Europeans in the North Pacific began in the winter of 1845\u201346, when two United States ships, the \"Hibernia\" and the \"United States\", under Captains Smith and Stevens, caught 32 in Magdalena Bay. More ships followed in the two following winters, after which gray whaling in the bay was nearly abandoned because \"of the inferior quality and low price of the dark-colored gray whale oil, the low quality and quantity of whalebone from the gray, and the dangers of lagoon whaling.\"\nGray whaling in Magdalena Bay was revived in the winter of 1855\u201356 by several vessels, mainly from San Francisco, including the ship \"Leonore\", under Captain Charles Melville Scammon. This was the first of 11 winters from 1855 through 1865 known as the \"bonanza period\", during which gray whaling along the coast of Baja California reached its peak. Not only were the whales taken in Magdalena Bay, but also by ships anchored along the coast from San Diego south to Cabo San Lucas and from whaling stations from Crescent City in northern California south to San Ignacio Lagoon. During the same period, vessels targeting right and bowhead whales in the Gulf of Alaska, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Western Arctic would take the odd gray whale if neither of the more desirable two species were in sight.\nIn December 1857, Charles Scammon, in the brig \"Boston\", along with his schooner-tender \"Marin\", entered Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Jack-Rabbit Spring Lagoon) or later known as Scammon's Lagoon (by 1860) and found one of the gray's last refuges. He caught 20 whales. He returned the following winter (1858\u201359) with the bark \"Ocean Bird\" and schooner tenders \"A.M. Simpson\" and \"Kate\". In three months, he caught 47 cows, yielding of oil. In the winter of 1859\u201360, Scammon, again in the bark \"Ocean Bird\", along with several other vessels, entered San Ignacio Lagoon to the south where he discovered the last breeding lagoon. Within only a couple of seasons, the lagoon was nearly devoid of whales.\nBetween 1846 and 1874, an estimated 8,000 gray whales were killed by American and European whalemen, with over half having been killed in the Magdalena Bay complex (Estero Santo Domingo, Magdalena Bay itself, and Almejas Bay) and by shore whalemen in California and Baja California.\nA second, shorter, and less intensive hunt occurred for gray whales in the eastern North Pacific. Only a few were caught from two whaling stations on the coast of California from 1919 to 1926, and a single station in Washington (1911\u201321) accounted for the capture of another. For the entire west coast of North America for the years 1919 to 1929, 234 gray whales were caught. Only a dozen or so were taken by British Columbian stations, nearly all of them in 1953 at Coal Harbour. A whaling station in Richmond, California, caught 311 gray whales for \"scientific purposes\" between 1964 and 1969. From 1961 to 1972, the Soviet Union caught 138 gray whales (they originally reported not having taken any). The only other significant catch was made in two seasons by the steam-schooner \"California\" off Malibu, California. In the winters of 1934\u201335 and 1935\u201336, the \"California\" anchored off Point Dume in Paradise Cove, processing gray whales. In 1936, gray whales became protected in the United States.\nWestern population.\nThe Japanese began to catch gray whales beginning in the 1570s. At Kawajiri, Nagato, 169 gray whales were caught between 1698 and 1889. At Tsuro, Shikoku, 201 were taken between 1849 and 1896. Several hundred more were probably caught by American and European whalemen in the Sea of Okhotsk from the 1840s to the early 20th century. Whalemen caught 44 with nets in Japan during the 1890s. The real damage was done between 1911 and 1933, when Japanese whalemen killed 1,449 after Japanese companies established several whaling stations on Korean Peninsula and on Chinese coast such as near the Daya bay and on Hainan Island. By 1934, the western gray whale was near extinction. From 1891 to 1966, an estimated 1,800\u20132,000 gray whales were caught, with peak catches of between 100 and 200 annually occurring in the 1910s.\nAs of 2001, the Californian gray whale population had grown to about 26,000. As of 2016, the population of western Pacific (seas near Korea, Japan, and Kamchatka) gray whales was an estimated 200.\nNorth Atlantic.\nThe North Atlantic population may have been hunted to extinction in the 18th century. Circumstantial evidence indicates whaling could have contributed to this population's decline, as the increase in whaling activity in the 17th and 18th centuries coincided with the population's disappearance. A. B. Van Deinse points out the \"scrag whale\", described by P. Dudley in 1725, as one target of early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale. In his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony, a whale of the kind called \"scragg\" entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. Gray whales (Icelandic \"sandl\u00e6gja\") were described in Iceland in the early 17th century. Formations of commercial whaling among the Mediterranean basin(s) have been considered to be feasible as well.\nConservation.\nGray whales have been granted protection from commercial hunting by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) since 1949, and are no longer hunted on a large scale.\nLimited hunting of gray whales has continued since that time, however, primarily in the Chukotka region of northeastern Russia, where large numbers of gray whales spend the summer months. This hunt has been allowed under an \"aboriginal/subsistence whaling\" exception to the commercial-hunting ban. Anti-whaling groups have protested the hunt, saying the meat from the whales is not for traditional native consumption, but is used instead to feed animals in government-run fur farms; they cite annual catch numbers that rose dramatically during the 1940s, at the time when state-run fur farms were being established in the region. Although the Soviet government denied these charges as recently as 1987, in recent years the Russian government has acknowledged the practice. The Russian IWC delegation has said that the hunt is justified under the aboriginal/subsistence exemption, since the fur farms provide a necessary economic base for the region's native population.\nCurrently, the annual quota for the gray whale catch in the region is 140 per year. Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Russia, the Makah tribe of Washington claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single gray whale killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal appeals court decision in December 2002 that required the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using high-powered rifles in spite of the decision. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while heading out to sea.\nAs of 2018, the IUCN regards the gray whale as being of \"least concern\" from a conservation perspective. However, the specific subpopulation in the northwest Pacific is regarded as being \"critically endangered\". The northwest Pacific population is also listed as endangered by the U.S. government's National Marine Fisheries Service under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The IWC Bowhead, Right and Gray Whale subcommittee in 2011 reiterated the conservation risk to western gray whales is large because of the small size of the population and the potential anthropogenic impacts.\nGray whale migrations off of the Pacific Coast were observed, initially, by Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes, California. The Gray Whale Census, an official gray whale migration census that has been recording data on the migration of the Pacific gray whale has been keeping track of the population of the Pacific gray whale since 1985. This census is the longest running census of the Pacific gray whale. Census keepers volunteer from December 1 through May, from sun up to sun down, seven days a week, keeping track of the number of gray whales migrating through the area off of Los Angeles. Information from this census is listed through the American Cetacean Society of Los Angeles (ACSLA).\nSouth Korea and China list gray whales as protected species of high concern. In South Korea, the Gray Whale Migration Site was registered as the 126th national monument in 1962, although illegal hunts have taken place thereafter, and there have been no recent sightings of the species in Korean waters.\nRewilding proposal.\nIn 2005, two conservation biologists proposed a plan to airlift 50 gray whales from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. They reasoned that, as Californian gray whales had replenished to a suitable population, surplus whales could be transported to repopulate the extinct British population. As of 2024[ [update]] this plan has not been undertaken.\nThreats.\nAccording to the Government of Canada's Management Plan for gray whales, threats to the eastern North Pacific population of gray whales include: increased human activities in their breeding lagoons in Mexico, climate change, acute noise, toxic spills, aboriginal whaling, entanglement with fishing gear, boat collisions, and possible impacts from fossil fuel exploration and extraction.\nWestern gray whales are facing large-scale offshore oil and gas development programs near their summer feeding grounds, as well as fatal net entrapments off Japan during migration, which pose significant threats to the future survival of the population. The substantial nearshore industrialization and shipping congestion throughout the migratory corridors of the western gray whale population represent potential threats by increasing the likelihood of exposure to ship strikes, chemical pollution, and general disturbance.\nOffshore gas and oil development in the Okhotsk Sea within of the primary feeding ground off northeast Sakhalin Island is of particular concern. Activities related to oil and gas exploration, including geophysical seismic surveying, pipelaying and drilling operations, increased vessel traffic, and oil spills, all pose potential threats to western gray whales. Disturbance from underwater industrial noise may displace whales from critical feeding habitat. Physical habitat damage from drilling and dredging operations, combined with possible impacts of oil and chemical spills on benthic prey communities also warrants concern. The western gray whale population is considered to be endangered according to IUCN standards.\nAlong Japanese coasts, four females including a cow-calf pair were trapped and killed in nets in the 2000s. There had been a record of dead whale thought to be harpooned by dolphin-hunters found on Hokkaido in the 1990s. Meats for sale were also discovered in Japanese markets as well.\n2019 has had a record number of gray whale strandings and deaths, with 122 strandings in United States waters and 214 in Canadian waters. The cause of death in some specimens appears to be related to poor nutritional condition. It is hypothesized that some of these strandings are related to changes in prey abundance or quality in the Arctic feeding grounds, resulting in poor feeding. Some scientists suggest that the lack of sea ice has been preventing the fertilization of amphipods, a main source of food for gray whales, so that they have been hunting krill instead, which is far less nutritious. More research needs to be conducted to understand this issue.\nA recent study provides some evidence that solar activity is correlated to gray whale strandings. When there was a high prevalence of sunspots, gray whales were five times more likely to strand. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that solar storms release a large amount of electromagnetic radiation, which disrupts Earth's magnetic field and/or the whale's ability to analyze it. This may apply to the other species of cetaceans, such as sperm whales. However, there is not enough evidence to suggest that whales navigate through the use of magnetoreception (an organism's ability to sense a magnetic field).\nOrcas are \"a prime predator of gray whale calves.\" Typically three to four orcas ram a calf from beneath in order to separate it from its mother, who defends it. Humpback whales have been observed defending gray whale calves from orcas. Orcas will often arrive in Monterey Bay to intercept gray whales during their northbound migration, targeting females migrating with newborn calves. They will separate the calf from the mother and hold the calf under water to drown it. The tactic of holding whales under water to drown them is certainly used by orcas on adult gray whales as well. It is roughly estimated that 33% of the gray whales born in a given year might be killed by predation.\nCaptivity.\nBecause of their size and need to migrate, gray whales have rarely been held in captivity, and then only for brief periods of time. The first captive gray whale, who was captured in Scammon's Lagoon, Baja California in 1965, was named Gigi and died two months later from an infection. The second gray whale, who was captured in 1972 from the same lagoon, was named Gigi II and was released a year later after becoming too large for the facilities. The third gray whale, J.J., first beached herself in 1997 in Marina del Rey, California where she was rushed to SeaWorld San Diego. After 14 months, she was released because she also grew too large to be cared for in the existing facilities. At and when she was released, J.J. was the largest marine mammal ever to be kept in captivity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like humans, they are accountable for their deeds and can be either believers (\"Mu'minun\") or unbelievers (\"kuffar\"), depending on whether they accept God's guidance.\nSince jinn are neither innately evil nor innately good, Islam acknowledged spirits from other religions and could adapt them during its expansion. Likewise, jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept; they may represent several pagan beliefs integrated into Islam. Islam places jinn and humans on the same plane in relation to God, with both being subject to divine judgement and an afterlife. The Quran condemns the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of worshipping or seeking protection from them.\nWhile they are naturally invisible, jinn are supposed to be composed of thin and subtle bodies () and are capable of shapeshifting, usually choosing to appear as snakes, but also as scorpions, lizards, or humans. A jinn's interaction with a human may be negative, positive, or neutral; and can range from casual to highly intimate, even involving sexual activity and the production of hybrid offspring. However, they rarely meddle in human affairs, preferring instead to live among their own in a societal arrangement similar to that of the Arabian tribes. Upon being disturbed or harmed by humans, they usually retaliate in kind, with the most drastic interactions leading them to possess the assailant's body, thus requiring exorcism.\nIndividual jinn appear on charms and talismans. They are called upon for protection or magical aid, often under the leadership of a king. Many people who believe in jinn wear amulets to protect themselves against their assaults, as they may be called upon by sorcerers and witches to cause harm. A commonly held belief is that jinn cannot hurt someone who wears something with the name of God () written on it. These folkloric beliefs and practices, although especially common throughout the Muslim world in the past, have been met with increasing disapproval due to their association with idolatry.\nEtymology and translation.\n\"Jinn\" is an Arabic collective noun deriving from the Semitic root JNN (, \"jann\"), whose primary meaning is 'to hide' or 'to adapt'. Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, 'beings that are concealed from the senses'.\nCognates include the Arabic ' (, 'possessed' or, generally, 'insane'), ' (, 'garden', 'eden' or 'heaven'), and \"\" (, 'embryo').\u062c\u0646\u064a\u0647 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0646\u0643\u0627\u062d \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0648 \u0627\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0631\n\"Jinn\" is properly treated as a plural (however in Classical Arabic, may also appear as \"j\u0101nn\", ), with the singular being \"jinn\u012b\" (), which the English word \"genie\" is derived from.\nThe origin of the word \"jinn\" remains uncertain.(p22) Some scholars relate the Arabic term \"jinn\" to the Latin \"genius\" \u2013 a guardian spirit of people and places in Roman religion \u2013 as a result of syncretism during the reign of the Roman empire under Tiberius and Augustus; however, this derivation is also disputed.(p25) Supporters argue that both Roman genii as well as Arabian jinn are considered to be lesser deities inhabiting local sanctuaries, trees or springs, and persons or families. Aramaic \"ginnaya\" () with the meaning of 'tutelary deity'(p24) or 'guardian' are attributed to similar functions and are another possible origin of the term \"jinn\".\nAnother suggestion holds that the word is of Persian origin and appeared in the form of the Avestic \"Jaini\", a wicked (female) spirit. Jaini were among various creatures in the possibly even pre-Zoroastrian mythology of peoples of Iran. Wensick advocates a purely Arabic origin of the term, asserting that according to the common Semitic view psychic and bodily affections are caused by spirits. An object reacting upon such an affect would be an incarnation of said spirit. Since these spirits are covered from the sight of humans, they would have been called jinn.(p45)\nThe anglicized form \"genie\" is a borrowing of the French \"\", also from the Latin \"genius\". It first appeared in 18th\u00a0century translations of the \"Thousand and One Nights\" from the 1706 French edition,\nwhere it had been used owing to its rough similarity in sound and sense and further applies to benevolent intermediary spirits, in contrast to the malevolent spirits called 'demon' and mostly-benevolent 'heavenly angels', in literature.\nIn Assyrian art, the modern term used for creatures ontologically between humans and divinities is also \"genie\".\nThough not a precise fit, descriptive analogies that have been used for these beings in Western thought include \"demon\", \"spirit\", \"sprite\", and \"fairy\", depending on source.(p22)\nIn turn, the Arabic translation for the Greek nymph (\"ar\u016bsa\") is also used for jinn by Middle Eastern sources.(p43)\nAlthough the term \"spirit\" is frequently used, it has been criticised for not capturing the corporeal nature of the jinn, and that the term \"genie\" should be used instead.\nPre-Islamic era.\nThe exact origins of belief in jinn are not entirely clear. Belief in jinn in pre-Islamic Arab religion is testified not only by the Quran, but also by pre-Islamic Arabic poetry.(p54) Some scholars of the Middle East hold that they originated as malevolent spirits residing in deserts and unclean places, who often took the forms of animals;(p1\u201310) others hold that they were originally pagan nature deities who gradually became marginalized as other deities took greater importance. Many ancient deities may have developed from jinn, while others represent degraded gods.\nJoseph Chelhod connects the jinn to ancient Middle Eastern dualistic beliefs, according to those heaven and earth represent polar opposites of order and chaos respectively. The high god El (or Allah) represents the source of the holy celestial abode while the jinn are the chthonic powers of the lower world. The jinn continuously rise to the sky in an attempt to obtain divinity. The belief that angels are daughters born from a union between Allah and jinn would derive from the assumption of a union between the heavenly and earthly forces and are then represented in the intermediate world in the form of stars.\nFear and veneration.\nJinn were already worshipped by many Arabs in pre-Islamic Arabia.(p54) Julius Wellhausen observed that jinn were often thought to \"inhabit or haunt desolate, dark and dingy places in the desert\". For that reason, they were held responsible for various diseases and mental illnesses. Emilie Savage-Smith asserts that malicious jinn and good gods were distinct in pre-Islamic Arabia, but admits that such distinction is not absolute.(p39) In the regions north to the Hejaz, Palmyra and Baalbek, the terms \"jinni\" and \"ilah\" (deity) were often used interchangeably. Julius Wellhausen likewise agrees that in pre-Islamic Arabia it was assumed there are at least some friendly and helpful beings among the jinn. He distinguishes between a god and a jinni, not on the basis of morality, but on the basis of worship; the jinn are worshipped in private while the gods are worshipped in public.(p39)\nMuqatil ibn Sulayman attributes the origin of the practise of jinn-veneration to the Banu Hanifa. When travelling through the wilderness and the sun sets, they sought refuge among the spirits of the place:\u0641\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0648\u0630 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646 \u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u064a \u062d\u0646\u0641\u064a\u0629\u060c \u062b\u0645 \u0641\u0634\u0627 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u060c \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0633\u0627\u0641\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0647\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u062f\u0631\u0643\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0641\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0644\u00a0 \u0623\u0639\u0648\u0630 \u0628\u0633\u064a\u062f \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0641\u0647\u0627\u0621 \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0622\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u064a\u0635\u0628\u062d.\nThe first who sought refuge among the jinn were people from Yemen, from the Banu Hanifa tribe. Afterwards, this [practise] spread to the rest of the Arabs. When a man during the era of Jahiliyyah traveled the lands and realized the evening sets over the desert, he would say, \u201cI seek refuge in the master of this valley from the impudent ones,\u201d so he would spend the night safely in their vicinity until morning.Al-Jahiz credits the pre-Islamic Arabs with believing that the society of jinn constitutes several tribes and groups, analogous to pre-Islamic Arabian culture. Jinn could also protect, marry, kidnap, possess, and kill people.(p424) Despite being invisible, jinn are considered to have bodies (\"ajs\u0101m\"), as described by Zakariya al-Qazwini, they are among animals, along with humans, burdened beasts (like horses), cattle, wild beasts, birds, and reptiles.(p135) Jinn are further known as shapeshifters, often assuming the form of an animal, favoring the form of a snake. Other chthonic animals regarded as forms of jinn include scorpions and lizards. Both scorpions and serpents have been venerated in the ancient Near East.\nWhen they shift into a human form however, they are said to stay partly animal and are not fully human.(p164) Although the power of jinn usually exceed those of humans, it is conceivable a man could kill a jinni in single combat, but they are feared for attacking without being seen. Some sources even speak of killed jinn leaving behind a carcass similar to either a serpent or a scorpion.\nPoetry and soothsaying.\nDespite that they were often feared or inspired awe, the jinn were also pictured to befriend humans or have romantic feelings for them. According to common Arabian belief, pre-Islamic soothsayers, philosophers, and poets were inspired by the jinn. In his Book of Idols, Al-Kalbi records a story about a jinni named Ab\u016b-Thumama working as an oracle advising Amr ibn Luhay.\nThe Arabian poet al-A'sha (d. after 3/625) claimed that his inspiration for his poetry come from a befriended jinni named Mis\u1e25al (\"da\u02bfawtu khal\u012bl\u012b Mis\u1e25alan\") whom he called his jinni-brother (\"akh\u012b \u02bel-jinn\u012b\"). Similarly, the poet Th\u0101bit (d. 54/674) who later converted to Islam and became known as \"the poet of the prophet\", referred to his jinni-friend as his \"sharp-sighted brother from the jinn\" (\"wa-akh\u012b min al-jinn al-ba\u1e63\u012br\"). The relationship between jinn and humans can also be romantic in nature. According to one famous Arabian story, the jinni Manzur fell in love with a human woman called Habbah. He is supposed to have taught her the arts of healing.\nThe mutual relationship between jinn and humans is different than that of a jinni and a soothsayer (\"k\u0101hin\"). The soothsayer is presented as someone who is totally controlled by the jinni entering. The soothsayer was consulted to reveal hidden information or settle disputes, as it was believed, the jinn speaking through them revealed hidden knowledge. Muhammad's opponents believed that the Quran was also inspired by a jinni, whereupon the Quran criticizes them for not distinguishing between jinn and God.\nIslam.\nJinn have been called an integral part of the Muslim tradition or faith, completely accepted in official Islam;\nprominently featured in folklore. Medieval and modern scholars have studied the consequences implied by their existence, legal status, the possible relations between them and mankind, especially in questions of marriage and property.\nMedieval sources often describe the jinn inhabiting the earth before the creation of mankind. They serve as a pattern for later human disobedience: at first, they were created by God, then rebel against God's messengers, shed blood and exploit the environment, and are eventually punished by God's angels. Muslims raised the question, if some jinn may have survived from primordial times. Some Quran exegetes, such as ibn Kathir hold this to be the case. Especially in folklore, the belief that some jinn still hide in desolate places and wastelands are widespread.\nQuran.\nJinn are mentioned approximately 29 times in the Quran,(p21) exclusively in Meccan surahs. The Quran assumes that the audience is familiar with the subject without elaborating on the jinn much further. According to the Quran https://, Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities, and prophets and messengers were sent to both communities.\nThroughout the Quran, humans and jinn (\"al-ins wa-l-jinn\") appear frequently as a pair, designating their equal status in regards of their creation and rejecting that jinn share divinity with the Creator.(p181) The term \"ins\" derives from \"anisa\", which means \"to be familiar with\", and refers to recognisable familiar human beings. In contrast, the term \"jinn\" refers to foreign, invisible, or unknown anthropomorphic beings, which are nonetheless subject to the same considerations as the former.(p101) They were both created to worship God ( https://).(p182) Because they are supposed to worship God from free will, they are both able for good and evil deeds ( https://, https://).(p182) They are, like humans, rational beings formed of nations ( https://).(p182)\nSurah al-jinn is about the revelation to jinn. The same Surah mentions righteous jinn on one hand, and malicious jinn on the other.(p181) The jinn can neither harm nor benefit humans, for they are occupied with looking after themselves and their own place in the cosmos.(p185) This is in notable contrast to demons and devils in the Judeo-Christian tradition.(p181, 185) The Quran does not condemn the jinn as a source of harm, but by mistaking them for beings deserving cultic veneration ( https://).(p41)(p185) Jinn and humans are blamed for ascribing divine attributes to another creature (i.e. jinn); jinn to themselves and humans to the jinn.(p41)(p102) The prophet Muhammad is believed to preach both humans and jinn about \"isl\u0101m\". Some were Jewish jinn ( https://) while others were pagans ( https://) who aided fortune tellers and soothsayers.\nIn the Quranic account, despite their similarities with humans, there are important differences between these two species. Whereas humans are made from \"clay\" or \"dirt\", jinn were created from \"smokeless fire\" (Quran https://, Quran https://),(p182) which is possibly the reason why they are credited with some extraordinary abilities, such as invisibility, transformation, and ascending into the air like devils (Quran https://).(p182) Despite some superhuman powers, the jinn occupy no fundamentally different position in the Quran than humans. Like humans, the jinn have no knowledge of the future.(p182) Like humanity, jinn face epistemic limitations regarding \"the hidden/occult\", have to rely on God's messengers, and face eschatological judgement.(p182)\nExegesis.\nThe term \"jinn\" is polysemic and can refer to (genuine) jinn, angels, and devils.(p12) For example, Surah \"\u2019a\u1e63-\u1e63\u0101ff\u0101t\" states: \"And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before (Him).\" In Islamic exegesis, the verse uses the term \"jinn\" to refer to both angels and devils simultaneously, but for different meanings:\n\u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627: \u0627\u0644\u0640\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627: \u0627\u0644\u0640\u062c\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0629: \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0640\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629. \u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0644\nThey said: The angels are the daughters of God, and they said: These jinn are the angels.\nand\n\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647: \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0628\u0644\u0640\u064a\u0633 \u0623\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\nIt is about what the enemies of God said: God and the Devil are brothers.\nIn Quranic interpretation and Muslim texts, the term \"jinn\" is thus used for any object hidden from sight, such as angels, devils, and the (spiritual) interior of human beings (psyche), as well as to a specific being, separate from both angels and devils. An example of jinn referring in the former sense, can be found in al-Ghazali's \"Alchemy of Bliss\", in which the author describes \"jinn\" as the internal angelic and demoniacal qualities of the human mind. The latter, separate type, are believed to be the offspring of \"al-J\u0101nn\", created out of \"smokeless fire\" (, \"m\u0101rijin min n\u0101r\") \u2013 whereas the angels are created from light and the devils from \"pure fire\" or \"fire of poison\" \u2013 and considered to be, along with humans, \"thaqal\u0101n\" (lit. 'weighty ones', meaning, they are 'accountable for their deeds', or 'honored on earth by God'). Muqatil ibn Sulayman describes the creation of these jinn as follows:\n\u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0632 \u0648\u062c\u0644 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0622\u062f\u0645\u060c \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0641\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0633\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636\u060c \u0648\u062c\u0639\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629 \u0633\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0627\u062a\u060c \u0641\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u062f\u060c \u0641\u0627\u0642\u062a\u062a\u0644\u0648\u0627\u060c \u0641\u0628\u0639\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0646\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0627\u060c \u064a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u060c \u0625\u0628\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0639\u062f\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645\u060c \u062e\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0645 \u062e\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629 \u0631\u0623\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0625\u0628\u0644\u064a\u0633\u060c \u0641\u0647\u0628\u0637\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636 \nThis is because God Almighty created the angels and the jinn before He created the devils and mankind, namely Adam, peace be upon him. He made them [the jinn] inhabitants of the earth, and He made the angels inhabitants of the heavens. Then temptations and envy overcame the jinn and so they began to fight. Whereupon God sent an army from the people of the lowest heaven, called \"al-jinn\" [the angelic tribe], with Iblis, the enemy of God, among them. They were all created from fire, and they are the keepers of Paradise, with Iblis as their leader.\nBelief in jinn is not included among the six articles of Islamic faith, as belief in angels is. Nonetheless, many Muslim scholars, including the Hanbal\u012b scholar ibn Taymiyya and the \u1e92\u0101hir\u012b scholar ibn Hazm, believe they are essential to the Islamic faith since they are mentioned in the Quran.(p33) Although jinn do not play any major role in Sufi literature, their existence is never doubted. They feature in poetic anecdotes but, because of their similarities to humans, function neither as a model to follow (like angels) nor tempters of the lower self (like Satan). \nJinn are generally weak and fragile beings, those potencies derive mostly from people attributing powers to them. Even though jinn are mostly impotent, they are able to possess people. The majority of Muslim scholars hold the opinion that jinn can at least possess individuals. This is considered to be part of the doctrines (\"aqidah\") of the \"people of the Sunnah\" (\"ahl as-sunnah wal-jammah'a\") in the tradition of Ash'ari.(p68) The Athar\u012b scholars ibn Taimiyya and ibn Qayyim agree on this matter. \nFrom among the Sunni schools of theology, only some of the M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012bs seem to doubt possession. Al-Rustughfan\u012b deemed jinn-possession impossible. Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi (c.1030-c.1100) asserts that jinn, like devils, can whisper to the people. He refers to Surah an-Nas stating \"that whispers into the heart of men from the jinn and humans\" (Original: \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0630\u0649 \u064a\u064f\u0648\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0633 \u0641\u0649 \u0635\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u0646\u0651\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633). Due to their subtile bodies, both jinn and devils could also enter through the pores of a human and refers to a hadith: \"the devil flows through the veins of the sons of Adam like blood\" (Original: \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u0631\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u0649 \u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0645\u062c\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645). Like every other being, jinn and devils cannot cause anything by themselves, but only acquire (\"kasb\") their action through God's will. Unlike devils, some of the jinn enter paradise.\nUnlike devils and demons, jinn might be helpful or even benevolent. Jinn helping people is well-known throughout Islamic literature. In the story about the burial of Nasir Khusraw, two jinn be mourn the death of Nasir Khusraw and help his disciple Ab\u016b Sa'\u012bd to prepare a rock as a tomb and wash the body of the dead master. Al-Suyuti narrates about an encounter in which a jinn challanges a human to a duel. If he can defeat the jinni, the jinni would reveal Ayatul-Kursi (the verse of the Throne) to him, which grands him protection from demons and devils. Rather than focusing on possession, Al-M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b focuses on the dynamics between jinn and humans based on their role as semi-divinities in pre-Islamic Arabia alluded to in Quran https:// and discusses how to properly handle interactions with jinn and what to avoid:\u0648\u0642\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0633 - \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0647\u0645 - \u0634\u0631\u0643\u061b \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u064a\u0631\u061b \u0641\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649\u061b \u0644\u064a\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631\u0627 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0641\u0632\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062c\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0642\u062f \u0631\u0623\u0648\u0627 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0630\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0631\u061b \u0641\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0634\u0631\u0643\u0627.\nIt has been said that this act by humans\u2014seeking refuge with them\u2014is \"shirk\", because God Almighty is the only true protector. Therefore, they should have sought refuge with God Almighty to ward off the plots of the jinn, and they should not have seen any protector other than God Almighty. So, when they resort to seeking refuge with the jinn, they have seen someone other than God Almighty defend and support them, and this is \"shirk\" on their part.He states that seeking refuge among the jinn increases fear and anxiety, however, not because of the power of the jinn, but due to the psychological dependence of the individual towards external powers. By that, he refers to seeking refuge among the jinn as a form of \"\u0161irk\", due to the reliance on a created thing instead of God.(p23) If the jinn are not mistaken for gods, the jinn are harmless or may even have a protective function.\nJurisprudence.\nThe jinn are obligated to follow the divine law (\"shar\u012b\u02bfa\"), as derived from the Quran by Muslim jurists (\"faq\u012bh\"). Thus, the jinn are considered, along with humans, to be \"mukall\u0101f\". Believers among the jinn are called \"Muslim jinn\" (\"muslim\u016b l-jinn\").\nSince both creations must perform the required prayers (\"salah\"), Muslim jurists debated if one is allowed to perform the prayer behind a jinni. Shibli cites two Hanbalite scholars who regard this as permissible without hesitation. Since Muhammad was sent to jinn and humans, both are \"mukall\u0101f\" and subject to the command to pray.\nBecause humans and jinn are capable of procreation, Muslim jurists dealt with the issue of permissibility of intercourse between these two types of creatures. Some \"\u1e24ad\u012bths\", though considered fabricated (\"maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bb\") by some \"muhaddith (hadith scholars)\", pushed the necessity for an explanation:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Hour will come when the children of jinn will become many among you.\" \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Among you are those who are expatriated (mugharrab\u00fbn);\" and \nthis, he explained, meant \"crossed with jinn.\"\nAlthough there are recorded cases of purported human-jinn relationships most Muslim jurists agree that such a relationship is not permissible. Even those scholars who allowed such relationships, still considered them undesirable (\"makruh\"). Offspring of human-jinn relationships are nonetheless, usually considered to be gifted and talented people with special abilities. Some scholars, also showed approval by referring to the union between the prophet Solomon in Islam and the Queen Bilqis who is said to be a jinn-hybrid. Yet, as according to Islamic hagiography, she had to remove her hair on her legs, which was believed to be a sign of her jinn-ancestry, traits inhereted from the jinn were met with suspicion.\nFolklore.\nThe jinn (also known as: , , ) were adopted by later Islamic culture, since the Quran affirms their existence. This allowed animistic beliefs to remain among Muslims after converting to a monotheistic religion. Although depictions are categorized into \"little tradition\" (folklore) and \"greater tradition\" (official Islam) for research purposes, both depictions are largely the same.\nThe Quran does not consider foreign mythological beings to be devils, but entities erroneously ascribed divine power to. Therefore, jinn were considered a third class of invisible beings, often neutral or morally ambiguous, not consequently equated with devils. Islam allowed to integrate local beliefs about spirits and deities from Iran, Africa, Turkey and India, into a monotheistic framework without demonizing them. Besides local deities, the existence of purely malevolent spirits is also acknowledged. Thus, jinn exist alongside other mythological entities, such as demons (\"D\u0113w\") and \"fairies\" (\"par\u012b\").\nThe moral attitude of the jinn is usually associated with their religion. Good jinn are usually considered \"Muslim jinn\" or \"jinn Islam\", whereas unbelieving jinn were tempted by the devils (\"shayatin\") and are called \"k\u0101fir jinn\" or \"jinn k\u0101fir\". Besides Islam, they could also practise Christianity and Judaism. Good jinn might teach people moral lessons and might be benevolent, or aid spiritual persons, such as shamans (\"kam\") in Central Asia, or spiritual healers in Senegal. Mediha Esenel's studies in 1940 Anatolia mentions the belief that spiritually gifted people can act as intermediaries between humans and jinn.\nMost of the time, jinn are believed not to interfere with humans and live mostly in desolate or abandoned places. This is, for example, evident from the Turkish phrase \"\u0130n Cin top oynuyor\". It is only when they are angered or disturbed, for example, if their children are trodden upon or hot water is thrown on them, that they take revenge on humans. For this reason, Muslims utter \"destur\" (permission), before doing something which might accidentally hurt jinn, such as sprinkling hot water on public grounds or into bushes, so present jinn are advised to leave the place.(phttps://)\nAngered or straightforwardly evil mannered jinn, could hurt people by inflicting physical damage, causing illness, or taking control over a human's body. A human can be controlled by jinn under certain circumstances. The individual needs to be in a state of \"dha'iyfah\" (Arabic: \u0636\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064e\u0629, \"(mental) weakness\"). Feelings of insecurity, mental instability, unhappy love and depression (being \"tired from the soul\") are forms of \"dha'iyfah\". In that case, it is believed that an exorcism is required to save the person from the assaulting jinni. To protect oneself from jinn, many Muslims wear amulets with the name of God engraved on them. Jinn are also said to be scared of iron and wolves.(p34)(p95)\nModern and post-modern era.\nPost-modern literature and movies.\nJinn feature in the magical realism genre, introduced into Turkish literature by Latife Tekin (1983), who uses magical elements known from pre-Islamic and Islamic Anatolian lore. Since the 1980s, this genre has become prominent in Turkish literature. The story by Tekin deals with folkloric and religious belief in a rationalized society.\nContrary to the neutral to positive depiction of jinn in Tekin's novels, since 2004 jinn have become a common trope in Middle Eastern horror movies. The presentation of jinn usually combines Quranic with oral and cultural beliefs about jinn. Out of 89\u00a0films, 59 have direct references to jinn as the antagonist, 12 use other sorts of demons, while other types of horror, such as the impending apocalypse, hauntings, or ghosts, constitute only 14\u00a0films. The popularity of jinn as a choice of monster can best be explained by their affirmation in the Quran. They are still a popular trope today. A study from 2020 shows that jinn are still the favorite horror element among teenagers. Jinn further feature in Iranian horror movies.\nPrevalence of belief.\nThough discouraged by some teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remain popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology. Affirmation on the existence of jinn as sapient creatures living along with humans is still widespread in the Middle Eastern world (including Egypt), and West Africa, mental illnesses are still often attributed to jinn possession.\nSince modern times, jinn were often portrayed in a more negative light. After the failure of the rebellion against the East India Company, the Muslim elite regarded jinn-veneration in India as a superstitional belief and hinders the common people to instigate military power. Similarly, the Deobandi movement, although not denying the reality of jinn, mostly depicts jinn as malevolent beings who need to be avoided or exorcised. In modern Iran, (evil) jinn are often substituted by devils. Similarly, in many modern tales, the term \"jinn\" is used for \"div\" (demon), causing a shift in meaning. Nonetheless, traditional belief in jinn remains popular in Islamic culture. The negative evaluations of jinn are not static, but rather entangled with traditional and also positive depictions of jinn.\nAccording to a survey undertaken by the Pew Research Center in 2012:\nThe amount of Muslims believing in jinn from Bosnia and Herzegovina is higher than the general European average (30%), although only 21% believe in sorcery and 13% would wear talisman for protection against jinn; 12% support offerings and appeal given to the jinn.\nSleep paralysis is understood as a \"jinn attack\" by many sleep paralysis sufferers in Egypt, as discovered by a Cambridge neuroscience study Jalal, Simons-Rudolph, Jalal, &amp; Hinton (2013). The study found that as many as 48% of those who experience sleep paralysis in Egypt believe it to be an assault by the jinn. Almost all of these sleep paralysis sufferers (95%) would recite verses from the Quran during sleep paralysis to prevent future \"jinn attacks\". In addition, some (9%) would increase their daily Islamic prayer (\"\u1e63al\u0101h\") to get rid of these assaults by jinn. Sleep paralysis is generally associated with great fear in Egypt, especially if believed to be supernatural in origin.\nSimilarly, European patients with a Muslim background often attribute mental illnesses to jinn. Most common attributions to jinn are symptoms of hallucination and psychotic symptoms, but can also include mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Capgras syndrome, and epilepsy.\nIt has been noted that not all Muslims who believe in jinn, believe they can possess people. Furthermore, belief in possession is not limited to Muslims. Contrary to the assumption that higher education is proportional to disenchantment, belief in jinn-possession may remain intact even after medical graduation.\nIn the process of objectification of Islam occurring especially among Muslims in the diaspora, folkloric depictions of jinn become less common and increasingly viewed as \"local beliefs\" or \"un-Islamic\". Stories and beliefs regarding jinn, are often downplayed in favor of a normative approach to religion.\nVisual art.\nAlthough there are very few visual representations of jinn in Islamic art, when they do appear, it is usually related to a specific event or individual jinn.\nVisual representations of jinn appear in manuscripts, and their existence is often implied in works of architecture by the presence of apotropaic devices like serpents, which were intended to ward off evil spirits. Lastly, King Solomon is illustrated very often with jinn as the commander of an army that included them.\nArchitectural representation.\nIn addition to these representations of jinn in vicinity to kingship, there were also architectural references to jinn throughout the Islamic world. In the Citadel of Aleppo, the entrance gate Bab al-Hayyat made reference to jinn in the stone relief carvings of serpents; likewise, the water gate at Ayyubid Harran housed two copper sculptures of jinn, serving as talismans to ward off both snakes and evil jinn in the form of snakes.(p408)\nAlongside these depictions of the jinn found at the Aleppo Citadel, depictions of the jinn can be found in the R\u016bm Seljuk palace. There are a phenomenal range of creatures that can be found on the eight-pointed tiles of the Seal of Sulaym\u0101n device.(p390) Among these were the jinn, that belonged among Solomon's army and as Solomon claimed to have control over the jinn, so did the R\u016bm Seljuk sultan that claimed to be the Sulaym\u0101n of his time.(p393) In fact, one of the most common representations of jinn are alongside or in association with King Solomon. It was thought that King Solomon had very close ties to the jinn, and even had control over many of them.(p399) The idea that a great and just ruler commands jinn was also extended to other emperors, such as Alexander the Great.(p399)\nGiven this association, jinn were often seen with Solomon in a princely or kingly context, such as the small, animal-like jinn sitting beside King Solomon on his throne illustrated in an illuminated manuscript of \"Aja'ib al-Makhluqat\" by Zakariya al-Qazwini, written in the 13th century.\nTalismanic representation.\nThe jinn had an indirect impact on Islamic art through the creation of talismans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included Qur'anic verses. It was not unusual for those talismans to be inscribed with separated Arabic letters, because the separation of those letters was thought to positively affect the potency of the talisman overall. An object that was inscribed with the word of \"Allah\" was thought to have the power to ward off evil from the person who obtained the object, though many of these objects also had astrological signs, depictions of prophets, or religious narratives.\nIn the \"Kit\u0101b al-Bulh\u0101n\".\nIn the \"Book of Wonders\" compiled in the 14th century by Abd al-Hasan al-Isfahani, there are illustrations of various supernatural beings (demons, \"\u02bfaf\u0101r\u012bt\", jinn, the evil eye, devils, lilith, celestial spirits, etc.).(p27)\nEach celestial spirit is referred to as a \"King of the Jinn\", represented alongside his spiritual helpers and alongside the corresponding talismanic symbols.(p27) For instance, the 'Red King of Tuesday' was depicted in the \"Book of Wonders\" as a sinister form astride a lion. In the same illustration, he holds a severed head and a sword, because the 'Red King of Tuesday' was aligned with Mars, the god of war.(p27) Alongside that, there were illustrations of the 'Gold King' and the 'White King'.(p27)\nAside from the seven 'Kings of the Jinn', the \"Book of Wonders\" included an illustration of \"Huma\" (Arabic: \u062d\u0645\u0649), or the 'Fever'. \"Huma\" was depicted as three-headed and as embracing the room around him, in order to capture someone and bring on a fever in them.(p28)\nMagical practises.\nJinn might be invoked, along with demons and devils, for means of sorcery, incantation, protection, or divination. Soothsayers (\"k\u0101hin\") are credited with the ability to ask jinn about things of the past, since their lives are believed to last longer than that of humans.(p73)\nCommon beliefs regarding sorcery and commanding jinn are attested in ibn al-Nadim's \"Kit\u0101b al-Fihrist\".(p141) Since he locates such practises not as a branch of science or philosophy, but rather in a chapter about stories and fables, the author might not have believed in the efficiency of sorcery himself.(p141) He reports that the art of commanding jinn and demons is traced back to Solomon and Jamshid. The first who would have practised a lawful method of incantation is supposed to be Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r A\u1e25mad b. Hil\u0101l during the Umayyad period.(p142) Ibn Nadim explains lawful and unlawful subjugating of jinn and demons as distinct: While the former controls the jinn by the power of God's divine names, the latter pleases demons and devils by prohibited offerings and sinful acts.(p141\u2013142) According to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93, ibn Hil\u0101l is said to have the power to summon demons and jinn(p142) and further claimed to have married a daughter of Satan and begotten a child.(p143)\nThere is evidence that subjugation of spirits, jinn, and demons, was also cultivated by various Islamic authorities. Al-\u1e6cabas\u012b, who was considered a reliable \"mu\u1e25ad\u012bth\" (scholar of \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") and pious ascetic, wrote an extensive treatise (\"al-Sh\u0101mil f\u012b al-ba\u1e25r al-k\u0101mil\") on subjugating demons and jinn.(p145) According to Zakariya al-Qazwini, it was well known that jinn obeyed al-\u1e6cabas\u012b. He gives an example, that al-\u1e6cabas\u012b demonstrated the jinn to the famous scholar Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, who saw them as shadows on the wall.(p145) He professes that jinn only obey when the individual turns away from the temptations of creation and devoting oneself towards God.(p146) The \"al-Sh\u0101mil\" gives detailed instructions for preparations of various incantations. Unlike, for example in the writings of al-Razi, the \"al-Sh\u0101mil\" has no direct link to Hellenistic or Hermetic magic or philosophy.(p148) Magic was also used in the Ottoman Empire as evident from the Talismanic shirts of Murad III.\nRelated to the occult traditions in Islamic culture is the belief in the \"Seven kings of the Week\", also known as \"r\u016b\u1e25\u0101iya ulia\" (higher spirits; angels) and \"r\u016b\u1e25\u0101iya sufula\" (lower spirits; demons). These beings are, for example, invoked for the preparation of Magic squares.(p87) This belief is attested by the Book of Wonders. It contains artistic depictions of several supernatural beings (demons, jinn, the evil eye, fever (Huma, Arabic: \u062d\u0645\u0649), devils, lilith, etc.). Some of these beings indicate that the work connects Hebrew, Christian, and Islamic magical traditions. The original work is attributed to al-Bakhi, who founded a system of astrological magic based on Neo-Platonic thought. Although many pages are damaged, it is possible to reconstruct their meanings from Ottoman copies. Each king is depicted with helpers and associated talismanic symbols.\nComparative mythology.\nIn comparative mythology and historical context studies, Quranic studies scholars discuss the relationship between Islamic notions of jinn and earlier ideas in Judaism, Christianity, Zorastrianism, and pre-Islamic Arabia, of supernatural beings or preternatural creatures, especially those of angels, spirits, deities, and demons. It is widely agreed that the belief in jinn was a common element of the culture out of which the Quran came.\nOn a theological level, the Quranic portrayal of jinn, as spirits converting to a one's religion rather than being demonized, is not unique to Islam and bears resemblance to the portrayal of devas (particularly n\u0101gas and yakshas) in Buddhism. Similar to Muhammad in the Quran, the Buddha is also credited with preaching to the spirits and deities of the previous religion, asserting that they are in need of salvation.\nThe jinn have been compared to the deities of Palmyra called \"gennaye.\" They functioned as protectors of places and people. Similar to the jinn of the modern Bedouin beliefs, the \"gennaye\" were imagined as beings similar to humans in terms of behavior and presence, and thus, mirror social expectations of society in pre-Islamic Arabia.\nThe Islamic jinn also bear resemblance to the \"shedim\" of the Babylonian Talmud,(p120) such as the idea that jinn are subordinate to divine law and integrated into religious legal texts. The jinn frequently appearing as students of Muslim scholars, mirrors the description of \"shedim\" in the Babylonian Talmud. Like jinn, among a class of beings of Jewish mythology/belief (\"jnun\", \"shedim\", etc.), there is a tradition of ritual exorcism and negotiations that differs from that of traditional Jewish cure of spirit possession associated with ghosts (Dybbuk).\nWhen compared to Christian tradition, one question has concerned the degree to Quranic jinn might be compared to fallen angels in Christian traditions. However, issues with this view are that jinn are not identified as \"angels\" and that descriptions of angels do not involve their flying up the sky to eavesdrop on heavenly secrets (unlike jinn who do so in Surah 72). Pierre Lory states that jinn are \"in no way comparable to angels\", and must be understood as distinct from the Quranic motif of fallen angels.\nPatricia Crone notes that, like jinn, the demons of the Testament of Solomon ascend to the firmament and eavesdrop on heavenly secrets; as did demons of Zoroastrian cosmology, who in addition encounter a heavenly defense systems (as did Islamic jinn). Similar statements are also found in the Talmud (Berakhot 18b) and the 8th-century \"Scolion\" of Theodore bar Konai.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Gallurese is variously described as a distinct southern dialect of Corsican or transitional language of the dialect continuum between Corsican and Sardinian. \"Gallurese International Day\" () takes place each year in Palau (Sardinia) with the participation of orators from other areas, including Corsica.\nGallurese is generally considered a southern Corsican dialect, sharing close resemblance in morphology and vocabulary with the dialects of Sartene and Porto-Vecchio on Corsica, whereas its phonology and syntax are similar to those of Sardinian. One third of Gallurese vocabulary is also influenced by Logudorese Sardinian, Catalan, and Spanish.\nThe Sassarese language, spoken in the area of Sassari, shares similar transitional traits between Tuscan, Corsican and Sardinian but, in comparison with Gallurese, is definitely closer to the Logudorese dialects of Sardinian.\nHistory.\nThe most ancient literary sources in Gallurese date back to the early 17th century, mainly as poetry and religious odes. Some late Middle Age fragments suggest that the formation of the language could be dated to the early 15th century. The origin and the development of Gallurese are debated. Max Leopold Wagner and Maurice Le Lannou argued that successive migration waves from Southern Corsica, promoted under the Aragonese rule to repopulate an area devastated by famine and pandemics, were crucial in the formation of a transitional language.\nRelation to Corsican.\nGallurese is classified by some linguists as a dialect of Corsican, and by others as a dialect of Sardinian. In any case, a great deal of similarity exists between Southern Corsican dialects and Gallurese, while there is relatively more distance from the neighbouring Sardinian varieties.\nConcluding the debate speech, the Sardinian linguist Mauro Maxia stated as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From a historical and geographic point of view, Gallurese might be classed either under Corsican or Sardinian, in light of its presence specific to Sardinia for the last six-seven centuries. From a linguistic point of view, Gallurese might be defined as:\nGallurese is less Corsican than many scholars make it out to be. What makes Gallurese a different language from Corsican, rather than a Corsican dialect, are many grammatical features, especially related to syntax, and the significant number of Sardinian, Catalan and Spanish loanwords.\nIt can be therefore claimed that, from a grammatical and lexical point of view, Gallurese is a transitional language between Corsican and Sardinian.\u2014\u200a\nThe Regional Government of Sardinia has recognized Gallurese, along with Sassarese as separate languages, distinct from Sardinian.\nSample of text.\nAn excerpt from a hymn dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While he was in fourth grade, Busey moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he later attended Bell Junior High School, then attended and graduated from Nathan Hale High School. Busey attended Coffeyville Community College before attending Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas, on a football scholarship, where he became interested in acting. After a knee injury, he then transferred to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to study theater. He quit school just one unit short of graduation.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nBusey began his showbusiness career as a drummer in the Rubber Band. He appears on several Leon Russell recordings, credited as playing drums under the name \"Teddy Jack Eddy\" a character he created when he was a cast member of a local television comedy show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called \"The Uncanny Film Festival and Camp Meeting\" on station KTUL (which starred fellow Tulsan Gailard Sartain as \"Dr. Mazeppa Pompazoidi\"). For his skits on Uncanny Film Festival, Busey drew on his American Hero, belligerent, know-it-all character.

{"id": "13031", "revid": "570614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13031", "title": "-gry puzzle", "text": "Word puzzle\nThe \"-gry\" puzzle is a popular word puzzle that asks for the third English word that ends with the letters \"-gry\" other than \"angry\" and \"hungry\". Specific wording varies substantially, but the puzzle has no clear answer, as there are no other common English words that end in \"-gry\". Interpretations of the puzzle suggest it is either an answerless hoax; a trick question; a sincere question asking for an obscure word; or a corruption of a more straightforward puzzle, which may have asked for words containing \"gry\" (such as \"gryphon\"). Of these, countless trick question variants and obscure English words (or nonce words) have been proposed. The lack of a conclusive answer has ensured the enduring popularity of the puzzle, and it has become one of the most frequently asked word puzzles.\nThe ultimate origin and original form of the puzzle is unknown, but it was popularized in 1975, starting in the New York area, and has remained popular into the 21st century. Various similar puzzles exist, though these have straightforward answers. The most notable is \"words ending in \"-dous\"\", which has been popular since the 1880s.\nAnswers.\nVarious proposed answers exist, stating that the question is one of the following:\nThis topic is a source of lively interest, both to lovers of word puzzles and lovers of words. For both groups, much of the appeal lies in the quest, either to trace the origin of the puzzle or compile a complete list of words ending in \"-gry\".\nMore recently, the word \"hangry\"\u2014a portmanteau of 'hungry' and 'angry'\u2014has been used to refer to an irritable state induced by lack of food. Oxford Dictionaries (controlled by, but less restrictive than, the Oxford English Dictionary) added \"hangry\" on 27 August 2015, and the full Oxford English Dictionary added \"hangry\" in 2018.\nHistory.\nThere are anecdotal reports of various forms of the puzzle dating to the 1950s or earlier; the ultimate origin is presumably an oral tradition or a lost book of puzzles. However, the first documented evidence is from early 1975 in the New York metropolitan area, and the puzzle rapidly gained popularity in this year. The most likely source is the talk show of Bob Grant, from some program in early or mid March 1975.\nMerriam-Webster, publishers of the leading American dictionaries, first heard of this puzzle in a letter dated March 17, 1975, from Patricia Lasker of Brooklyn, New York. Lasker says her plant manager heard the question on an unnamed quiz show. Since that time Merriam-Webster has received about four letters each year asking the question.\nThe puzzle first appears in print in Anita Richterman's \"Problem Line\" column in \"Newsday\" on April 29, 1975. One \"M.Z.\" from Wantagh, New York states that the problem was asked on a TV quiz program. Richterman states that she asked a learned professor of English for help when she first received the inquiry, and he did not respond for over a month. This agrees with the Merriam-Webster report, suggesting a quiz show in early or mid March 1975.\nIn Anita Richterman's column on May 9, 1975, several correspondents reported that they had heard the puzzle on the Bob Grant radio talk show on WMCA in New York City. This suggests either that the earlier claims of a (TV) quiz show confused a talk show with a quiz show, or that there was another unspecified quiz show that was then repeated by Grant. The majority of readers gave the answer \"gry\", an obsolete unit of measure invented by John Locke. It is unclear whether this was the answer given on the Grant show, or what the precise wording had been.\nBy fall 1975 the puzzle had reached the Delaware Valley, again apparently by radio, by which time the puzzle seems to have mutated to a form in which the missing word is an adjective that describes the state of the world.\nThe puzzle has had occasional bouts of popularity: after its initial popularity in 1975, it was popular in 1978, then again in 1995\u20131996.\nReports of earlier versions.\nThe most credible report of an early version was given on Stumpers-L in 1999, which reported a trick question formulation from a book of riddles entitled \"Things to Think About\", probably dating to the 1940s:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Talk about serendipity. New neighbor was up in her attic, and found a few pages of a book ... \"Things to Think About\" ... it was just 8 pages, and they were from the middle. They were all more or less riddles.\n\"Someone offers to give you 5 cents if you can jump across the street. Take it or leave it? What do you think?\" next page, \"Take it. Walk across the street and jump.\"\n\"Do you think you could bite 2 inches from the mantle? After you think about it, turn the page\", next page \"Of course you can, get a yard stick, and measure two inches away from the mantle and bite!\"\n\"How many pieces of string would you need to fly a kite to the moon? Think a minute!\" next page \"Only one, but it would have to be a long one!\"\nAND THE LAST ONE ...\n\"There are three words in the English language that end with 'gry'. Two of these are angry and hungry. The third word is a very common word, and you use it often. If you have read what I have told you, you will see that I have given you the third word. What is the third word? Think very carefully.\" next page \"Three, the question has nothing to do with angry, hungry, or any of the many other obscure words that end in 'gry', it is a simple question asking you what the third word in the sentance is. As you take tests, remember this.\"\nI have no idea who the author was, or the publisher. From the paper, it would guess it was from the 40s, as it looks like WW2 type paper. Connie\nAlternative versions.\nMeta-puzzle versions.\nThe remaining versions are a form of meta-puzzle, in the sense that they make no use of the actual letters \"gry\" themselves, which therefore are a red herring. The red herring only works because there is another puzzle that does use these letters (even though that puzzle has no good answer).\nSimilar puzzles.\nThere are numerous similar puzzles, giving letter sequences that rarely occur in words. The most-notable of these is the \"-dous\" puzzle of finding words ending in \"-dous\", which was popular in the 1880s. This took various forms, sometimes simply listing all words or all common words, sometimes being posed as a riddle, giving the three common words, \"tremendous\", \"stupendous\", and \"hazardous\", and requesting the rarer fourth, which is \"jeopardous\". This form originated in 1883, with an A.A. of Glasgow writing to George Augustus Henry Sala in his \"Echoes of the Week\" column in the \"Illustrated London News\".\nThis question has had enduring popularity, even inspiring a contest, though the words have proven less stable: today \"jeopardous\" is considered too rare, and the formerly unpopular \"horrendous\" has taken its place; this change occurred as early as 1909. At times other words such as \"hybridous\" have been accepted. Today \"hazardous\" is typically the omitted word, and differs from the others in being a visible compound \"hazard\" + \"-ous\". This puzzle has continued in popularity through the end of the 20th century, with recent versions giving it as an alternative to the gry puzzle.\nThere is a Russian puzzle which goes: \"There are three words in the Russian language which end in -zo. Two of them are \"zhelezo\" \"iron\" and \"puzo\" \"belly\". What is the third word?\" There is quite a handful of other nouns that end in -zo, in the Russian language, but most of them are fairly obscure terms like \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043e, abbreviations or proper names like \u041a\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e. \nAnother similar one is words ending in \"-cion\", of which the common words are \"coercion\", \"scion\", and \"suspicion\".\nThe most similar to the gry puzzle in form is to find three words that contain the letter sequence \"shion\", to which the answer is \"cushion, \"fashion, and \"parishioner\"; this is typically stated by giving \"cushion\" and \"fashion\", and requesting the third word, namely \"parishioner\". This can be modified to finding words \"ending\" with \"-shion\", in which case the answer is the obsolete word \"parishion\", which is a synonymous variant of \"parishioner\". This has not been nearly as popular as the gry puzzle.\nSolution techniques.\nThe standard way to solve such puzzles is to use a reverse dictionary, or to perform an exhaustive search through a dictionary, either manually, which is tedious and error-prone, or using computer tools such as grep, which requires an electronic word list. At the origin of the gry puzzle, the standard reverse dictionary in modern English was the \"Air Force Reverse Dictionary\" (formally the \"Normal and Reverse Word List\", compiled under the direction of A. F. Brown), which did not have additional answers for gry. The most plausible answer at the time was \"meagry\", found in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". A more elaborate strategy is to list words that have endings similar to gry, such as \"-gary\", and then search a larger dictionary for obsolete variants ending in \"-gry\", for example \"begry\" for \"beggary\".\nFrom around 1980 electronic word lists became widely available on Unix systems, and searching for answers to the gry puzzle was an occasional benchmark; this also turned up \"gryphon\" in some cases, if match is not required to be at the end. This is now easily done in milliseconds on modern personal computers:\ngrep gry$ /usr/share/dict/words # Search for words ending in gry\ngrep gry /usr/share/dict/words # Search for words containing gry\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was noticeably influential, and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy. In 1906, he became the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. The Swedish Academy awarded him the prize \"not only in consideration of his deep learning and critical research, but above all as a tribute to the creative energy, freshness of style, and lyrical force which characterize his poetic masterpieces.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nGiosu\u00e8 Carducci was born in Valdicastello in Pietrasanta, a small town currently part of the Province of Lucca in the northwest corner of Tuscany, which at the time was an independent grand duchy. His father, Michele, was a country doctor and an advocate of the unification of Italy. A member of the Carboneria, in his youth he had suffered imprisonment for his share in the revolution of 1831. Because of his politics, the family was forced to move several times during Carducci's childhood, eventually settling for a few years in Florence.\nCarducci's father attempted to impart to his son his own fervent enthusiasm for the writings of Manzoni, but Carducci never acquired a taste for Romanticism. The boy was also taught Latin by his father and delighted in the works of Virgil and other ancient authors. He avidly read books on the history of Rome and anything dealing with the French Revolution. He wrote his first poems when he was still a boy, in 1846.\nAfter the failure of the revolution of 1848, the Carducci family was obliged to move. The threat of violence became too great for Carducci's father, and the family relocated first to Lajatico, then to Florence.\nCarducci went to religious schools until 1852, and was influenced by his rhetoric teacher, the Piarist Father Geremia Barsottini, who had translated into Italian prose all the \"odes\" or Horace. The boy became fascinated with the restrained style of Greek and Roman Antiquity, and translated Book\u00a09 of Homer's \"Iliad\" into Italian. In these years Carducci became further impassioned in the cause of Italian unification and discovered the works of Ugo Foscolo and Giuseppe Mazzini. After completing his education, Carducci followed his wandering father to Celle sul Rigo on Monte Amiata, but soon after won a scholarship to the prestigious Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa.\nEarly works.\nIn 1855, Carducci published his first work, \"L'arpa del popolo\", an anthology of Italian poetry for use in schools, and a year later he received his doctorate and a certification for teaching. He took a position as a rhetoric teacher in a secondary school at the gymnasium in San Miniato, Pisa.\nIn this period Carducci began working on his first major collection of poems. The collection was published in six books in 1871 under the title of \"Juvenilia\". Carducci's early verses exhibit the strong influence of classical models, of the \"stilnovisti\", of Dante and Petrarch and, among the moderns, Alfieri, Monti, Foscolo and Leopardi. But the Carduccian spirit is already visible; his love for the beauty of style, the purity of sentiments and the celebration of liberty, as well as the ability to appreciate all that is genuine, therefore also the language of the common people.\nWith several friends, among them Giuseppe Chiarini and Torquato Gargani, Carducci founded a literary society, \"Amici Pedanti\", a group that was essentially anti-Romantic and anti-Catholic. They believed that ltaly's only hope for the future was in the revival of the classical, pagan spirit of the ancient world, which was emphasized as still existing in the Italian land and blood. Such opinions naturally provoked violent objections, both from Romantcs and from those who favored the \"status quo\", Carducci freely and ferociously responded in prose to the attacks many times. His first collection of poetry, \"Rime\", appeared in July, 1857.\nAlthough Carducci won a competition for the Chair of Greek in a secondary school in Arezzo, his political opinions and his father's political record as a revolutionary caused the granducal government to deny him the appointment. Carducci was forced to return to Florence, where he eked out a living by giving private lessons. In November, his depression became worse when his brother Dante killed himself for unknown reasons. After the death of his father (1858), Carducci was compelled to take care of his family, whose affairs were in disarray. He moved with his mother and brother into a very poor house in Florence, continuing his private lessons. He also began to collaborate with the publisher Gaspero Barbera; together they founded a short-lived literary magazine, \"Il Poliziano\". Despite his financial situation, Carducci married Elvira Menicucci in March, 1859.\nItalian unification.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHymn to Satan\nTo thee of All Being \nThe First Cause immense\nOf matter and spirit\nOf reason and sense\nWhilst in the full goblet\nShall sparkle the wine,\nSo bright the pupil\nThe souls of men shine,\nWhilst earth still is smiling,\nAnd the sun smiles above,\nAnd men are exchanging\nTheir sweet words of love,\nThrills mystic of Hymen\nThrough high mountains course,\nAnd broad plains are heaving\nWith life's fertile force,\nOn thee in verse daring,\nFrom tight rein released,\nOn thee I call, Satan,\nThe King of the feast.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n\"From \"Hymn to Satan\" poem by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci\"\nOn April 27 of that year, the Grand Duchy was dissolved and Tuscany joined the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. Carducci's fortunes began to turn for the better. First, he was offered the Chair of Greek in the secondary school of Pistoia, where he remained for nearly a year; then, the Minister of Public Education, Terenzio Mamiani della Rovere, appointed him to the Chair of Italian Eloquence at the University of Bologna. Carducci soon became a popular lecturer. He was somewhat ambivalent toward his professorial role and its traditional philological orientation and fretted about its effect on his poetry, but the position allowed him to deepen his acquaintance with the classics and with the literature of other nations. His political views also changed. Under Victor Emmanuel II, Carducci had been an idealistic monarchist in support of the union of Italy, but after Garibaldi was wounded and captured by Italian troops in the battle of Aspromonte in 1862, Carducci allied himself with the democratic republicans and became more pronouncedly Jacobin and anticlerical, venting his intense feelings in aggressive poetry.\nHis anti-clerical revolutionary vehemence was prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative \"Inno a Satana\" (\"Hymn to Satan\"). \"Satan\" / \"Lucifer\" was considered by Italian leftists of the time as a metaphor for the rebellious and freethinking spirit. The poem was composed in 1863 as a dinner party toast, published in 1865, and then republished in 1869 by Bologna's radical newspaper, \"Il Popolo\", as a provocation timed to coincide with the First Vatican Council, a time when revolutionary fervour directed against the papacy was running high as republicans pressed both politically and militarily for an end to the Vatican's domination over the Papal States. In 1866 Carducci was initiated at the Masonic lodge \"Galvani\" of Bologna.\nLiterary fame.\nWhile \"Inno a Satana\" had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years. He published his \"Giambi\" (iambics; later \"Giambi ed epodi\"), a collection of polemical poems, under the pseudonym \"Enotrio Romano\"; the poems reveal Carducci's affinities with Victor Hugo and Heinrich Heine. By 1872, Carducci had begun to control his polemical instincts, and some of his finest poems, later collected in \"The New Lyrics\", were written in the 1870s. \"Barbarian Odes\", begun in 1873, are considered his most influential work, and contain some of his most celebrated poems.\nIn the \"Barbarian Odes\" Carducci endeavored to imitate ancient classical stanza forms, such as the Alcaic and the Sapphic. Since they were based on stress and not on syllabic quantity, he believed they would have sounded \u2018barbaric\u2019 to classical poets: hence the title of the collection.\nFollowing the publication of the \"Barbarian Odes\", Carducci became an object of adulation for the younger generation of Italian poets. Periodicals such as \"Fanfulla della Domenica\", \"Cronaca\" \"bizantina\", and \"Domenica letteraria\" helped spread his fame. \"New Barbarian Odes\" solidified his reputation, and he assumed the role of national poet.\nThe 1880s were for Carducci a period of intense literary activity. In 1881 he began to write for \"Cronaca bizantina\", a flamboyant and very successful literary journal that numbered among its contributors the likes of Giovanni Marradi, Matilde Serao, Edoardo Scarfoglio, Guido Magnoni, and Gabriele D'Annunzio. Within the next few years he published the three admirable volumes of his \"Confessioni e\" \"Battaglie\" (1882), the \"\u00c7a Ira\" sonnets (1883), and a considerable number of articles, pamphlets and essays. \nHis lyrical production, too, seemed to reach its perfection in these years of tense, unrelenting work; for the \"Canzone\" \"di Legnano\", the Odes to Rome and to Monte Mario, the Elegy on the urn of Percy Bysshe Shelley, the ringing rhymes of the \"Intermezzo\", in which he happily blended the satire of Heine with the lyrical form of his native poetry \u2013 all belong to this period.\nIn the Late 19th century Carducci's political and philosophical views shifted; he resigned himself to constitutional monarchy and acquired a more religious attitude, with some appreciation of the Church's mission, though he remained fundamentally anticlerical.\nLater life and international success.\nThe last two decades of Carducci's life were filled with misery. In 1885, he became ill. Five years later he was made a senator by the King of Italy, but in 1899, a stroke paralyzed his hand and nearly deprived him of speech. He continued working, despite the setbacks, publishing his last volume of poetry, \"Rime e ritmi\" (Rhymes and Rhythms), in 1899 and collecting his works from 1850 to 1900. In 1904, he resigned from teaching. His disciple Giovanni Pascoli replaced him as professor of Italian literature at the University of Bologna. \nIn 1906, Carducci became the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died the following year in Bologna, at the age of 71. His funeral, celebrated in San Petronio, was followed by a procession through the streets of the city attended by a large crowd. He is buried in the Certosa di Bologna. A monument in his honor was erected in Bologna between 1908 and 1926 to a design by Leonardo Bistolfi.\nReligious views.\nIn his youth Carducci was an atheist, whose political views were vehemently hostile to the Catholic Church. In the course of his life, his views on religion shifted towards a socially oriented theism which he exposed in his famous \"Discorso sulla libert\u00e0 perpetua di San Marino\" (\"A Speech on San Marino's Perpetual Freedom\"), pronounced on 30 September 1894 before the authorities and people of that ancient Republic and celebrating \"the Universal God of Peoples, Mazzini's and Washington's God\". According to some sources Carducci was reconciled to the Catholic Church in 1895. On 11 September 1978, Pope John Paul I mentioned him as a \"model\" for university professors and teachers of Latin.\nLegacy.\nCarducci dominated the Italian literary scene in the last thirty or forty years of the 19th century. He is considered one of the greatest lyric poets of modern Italy. Carducci's works are exceptional in their synthesis of literary qualities often seen as opposites. Though his life coincided with the height of Romanticism in Italy, he took the classical mode as his paradigm of artistic creation. This might have made him a curious anachronism, but his passion and his agility with classical form kept his works free of the servility that mars much neoclassical poetry. In the \"Rime nuove\" Carducci proves a skilful reworker of medieval themes in poems such as \u2018Il comune rustico\u2019, \u2018Sui campi di Marengo\u2019, and \u2018Faida di comune\u2019 (as also in \"La canzone di Legnano\" of 1879); whilst he achieves remarkable blends of neoclassical and romantic motifs in \u2018Primavere elleniche\u2019 and pure moments of autobiographical lyricism in \u2018Idillio maremmano\u2019, \u2018Pianto antico\u2019, and \u2018Davanti a San Guido\u2019. Of the \"Odi barbare\" \u2018Alla stazione in una mattina d'autunno\u2019, which culminates in the image of the steam engine carrying his beloved away from him like a fiery Moloch, is one of the most impressive Italian poems of all time. The Museum of the Risorgimento, Bologna is housed in the Casa Carducci, the house where he died, and contains an exhibit on the author. Carducci's poems have been translated several times into English. The crater Carducci\u00a0on Mercury is named in his honor.\nWorks.\nIt is not always easy to follow the development of Carducci's poetry through the collections he edited. The poet in fact organized his compositions several times and in different ways and gave a definitive arrangement only later in the edition of his \"Opere\" published for Zanichelli between 1889 and 1909. The following is a list of poetic works published in one volume, then rearranged into the 20 volumes of his \"Opere\".\nBelow are the poetic volumes in the \"Opere\". The volumes, however, do not correspond to the chronological order with which the poet had published his first collections, but refer more than anything else to the distinctions of genres and therefore we find poems of the same period in different collections. The collections follow this order:\nAlthough his reputation rests primarily on his poetry, Carducci also produced a large body of prose works. Indeed, his prose writings, including literary criticism, biographies, speeches and essays, fill some 20 volumes. Carducci\u2019s best critical works are his ample commentary on the works of Parini, his essay on Dante\u2019s \"Rime\", his defense of Tasso\u2019s \"Aminta\", and his study of the early works of Foscolo.

The formation of geysers is fairly rare and is caused by particular hydrogeological conditions that exist only in a few places on Earth.\nGenerally, geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas, and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of magma. Surface water works its way down to an average depth of around where it contacts hot rocks. The pressurized water boils, and this causes the geyser effect of hot water and steam spraying out of the geyser's surface vent.\nA geyser's eruptive activity may change or cease due to ongoing deposition of minerals within their plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention. Like many other natural phenomena, geysers are not unique to Earth. Jet-like eruptions, often called cryogeysers, have been observed on several of the moons of the outer Solar System. Due to the low ambient pressures, these eruptions consist of vapour without liquid; they are made more easily visible by particles of dust and ice carried aloft by the gas. Water vapour jets have been observed near the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus, while nitrogen eruptions have been observed on Neptune's moon Triton. There are also signs of carbon dioxide eruptions from the southern polar ice cap of Mars.\nIn the case of Enceladus, the plumes are believed to be driven by internal energy. In the cases of the venting on Mars and Triton, the activity may result from solar heating via a solid-state greenhouse effect. In all three cases, there is no evidence of the subsurface hydrological system which differentiates terrestrial geysers from other sorts of venting, such as fumaroles.\nEtymology.\nThe term 'geyser' in English dates back to the late 18th century and comes from Geysir, which is a geyser in Iceland. Its name means \"one who gushes\".\nGeology.\nForm and function.\nGeysers are nonpermanent geological features. Geysers are generally associated with areas of recent magmatism. As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam and water to the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain: heat, water, and a subsurface hydraulic system with the right geometry.\nThe heat needed for geyser formation comes from magma that needs to be close to the surface of the Earth. For the heated water to form a geyser, a plumbing system (made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities) is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated.\nGeysers tend to be coated with geyserite, or siliceous sinter. The water in geysers comes in contact with hot silica-containing rocks, such as rhyolite. The heated water dissolves the silica. As it gets closer to the surface, the water cools and the silica drops out of solution, leaving a deposit of amorphous opal. Gradually the opal anneals into quartz, forming geyserite. Geyserite often covers the microbial mats that grow in geysers. As the mats grow and the silica is deposited, the mats can form up to 50% of the volume of the geyserite.\nEruptions.\nGeyser activity, like all hot spring activity, is caused by surface water gradually seeping down through the ground until it meets geothermally heated rock. In non-eruptive hot springs, the heated water then rises back toward the surface by convection through porous and fractured rocks, while in geysers, the water instead is explosively forced upwards by the high steam pressure created when water boils below. Geysers also differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure: geysers have constrictions in their plumbing that create pressure build-up.\nAs the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, convective cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.\nUltimately, the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins, forcing steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.\nEventually the water remaining in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and the time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts for a few seconds every few minutes, while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10\u00a0minutes every 8\u201312\u00a0hours.\nGeneral categorization.\nThere are two types of geysers: \"fountain geysers\" which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and \"cone geysers\" which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on Earth (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.\nThere are many volcanic areas in the world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is that multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.\nGeysers are fragile, and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many have been destroyed simply by people throwing debris into them, while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Geysir in Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced\u2014often on special occasions\u2014by the addition of surfactant soaps to the water.\nBiology.\nSome geysers have specific colours because, despite the harsh conditions, life is often found in them (and also in other hot habitats) in the form of thermophilic prokaryotes. No known eukaryote can survive over .\nIn the 1960s, when the research of the biology of geysers first appeared, scientists were generally convinced that no life can survive above around \u2014the upper limit for the survival of cyanobacteria, as the structure of key cellular proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) would be destroyed. The optimal temperature for thermophilic bacteria was placed even lower, around .\nHowever, the observations proved that they can exist at high temperatures and that some bacteria even prefer temperatures higher than the boiling point of water. Dozens of such bacteria are known.\nThermophiles prefer temperatures from , while hyperthermophiles grow better at temperatures as high as . As they have heat-stable enzymes that retain their activity even at high temperatures, they have been used as a source of thermostable tools, which are important in medicine and biotechnology, for example in manufacturing antibiotics, plastics, detergents (by the use of heat-stable enzymes lipases, pullulanases and proteases), and fermentation products (for example ethanol is produced). Among these, the first discovered and the most important for biotechnology is \"Thermus aquaticus\".\nMajor geyser fields and their distribution.\nGeysers are quite rare, requiring a combination of water, heat, and fortuitous plumbing. The combination exists in few places on Earth.\nYellowstone National Park.\nYellowstone is the largest geyser locale, containing thousands of hot springs, and approximately 300 to 500 geysers. It is home to half of the world's total number of geysers in its nine geyser basins. It is located mostly in Wyoming, USA, with small portions in Montana and Idaho. Yellowstone includes the world's tallest active geyser (Steamboat Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin).\nValley of Geysers, Russia.\nThe Valley of Geysers (), located in the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia, is the second-largest concentration of geysers in the world. The area was discovered and explored by Tatyana Ustinova in 1941. There are about 200 geysers in the area, along with many hot-water springs and perpetual spouters. The area was formed by vigorous volcanic activity. The peculiar way of eruptions is an important feature of these geysers. Most of the geysers erupt at angles, and only very few have the geyser cones that exist at many other of the world's geyser fields. On 3 June 2007, a massive mudflow influenced two-thirds of the valley. It was then reported that a thermal lake was forming above the valley. Four of the eight thermal areas in the valley were covered by the landslide or by the lake. Velikan Geyser, one of the field's largest, was not buried in the slide: the slide shortened its period of eruption from 379 minutes before the slide to 339 minutes after (through 2010).\nEl Tatio, Chile.\nThe name \"El Tatio\" comes from the Quechua word for \"oven\". El Tatio is located in the high valleys of the Andes in Chile, surrounded by many active volcanoes, at around above mean sea level. The valley is home to approximately 80 geysers at present. It became the largest geyser field in the Southern Hemisphere after the destruction of many of the New Zealand geysers, and is the third largest geyser field in the world. The salient feature of these geysers is that the height of their eruptions is very low, the tallest being only high, but with steam columns that can be over high. The average geyser eruption height at El Tatio is about .\nTaup\u014d Volcanic Zone, New Zealand.\nThe Taup\u014d Volcanic Zone is located on New Zealand's North Island. It is long by and lies over a subduction zone in the Earth's crust. Mount Ruapehu marks its southwestern end, while the submarine Whakat\u0101ne seamount ( beyond Whakaari / White Island) is considered its northeastern limit. Many geysers in this zone were destroyed due to geothermal developments and a hydroelectric reservoir: only one geyser basin at Whakarewarewa remains.\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, the largest geyser ever known, the Waimangu Geyser, existed in this zone. It began erupting in 1900 and erupted periodically for four years until a landslide changed the local water table. Eruptions of Waimangu would typically reach and some superbursts are known to have reached . Recent scientific work indicates that the Earth's crust below the zone may be as little as thick. Beneath this lies a film of magma wide and long.\nIceland.\nDue to the high rate of volcanic activity in Iceland, it is home to some of the most famous geysers in the world. There are around 20\u201329 active geysers in the country, as well as numerous formerly active geysers. Icelandic geysers are distributed in the zone stretching from south-west to north-east, along the boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate. Most of the Icelandic geysers are comparatively short-lived. It is also characteristic that many geysers here are reactivated or newly created after earthquakes, becoming dormant or extinct after some years or some decades.\nTwo most prominent geysers of Iceland are located in Haukadalur. \"The Great Geysir\", which first erupted in the 14th century, gave rise to the word \"geyser\". By 1896, Geysir was almost dormant before an earthquake that year caused eruptions to begin again, occurring several times a day; but in 1916, eruptions all but ceased. Throughout much of the 20th century, eruptions did happen from time to time, usually following earthquakes. Some man-made improvements were made to the spring and eruptions were forced with soap on special occasions. Earthquakes in June 2000 subsequently reawakened the giant for a time, but it is not currently erupting regularly. The nearby Strokkur geyser erupts every 5\u20138 minutes to a height of some .\nExtinct and dormant geyser fields.\nThere used to be two large geyser fields in Nevada\u2014Beowawe and Steamboat Springs\u2014but they were destroyed by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water table to the point that geyser activity could no longer be sustained.\nMany of New Zealand's geysers have been destroyed by humans in the last century. Several New Zealand geysers have also become dormant or extinct by natural means. The main remaining field is Whakarewarewa at Rotorua. Two-thirds of the geysers at Orakei Korako were flooded by the construction of the hydroelectric Ohakuri dam in 1961. The Wairakei field was lost to a geothermal power plant in 1958. The Rotomahana field was destroyed by the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera.\nMisnamed geysers.\nThere are various other types of geysers which are different in nature compared to the normal steam-driven geysers. These geysers differ not only in their style of eruption but also in the cause that makes them erupt.\nArtificial geysers.\nIn a number of places where there is geothermal activity, wells have been drilled and fitted with impermeable casements that allow them to erupt like geysers. The vents of such geysers are artificial, but are tapped into natural hydrothermal systems. These so-called \"artificial geysers\", technically known as \"erupting geothermal wells\", are not true geysers. Little Old Faithful Geyser, in Calistoga, California, is an example. The geyser erupts from the casing of a well drilled in the late 19th century, which opened up a dead geyser.\nIn the case of the Big Mine Run Geyser in Ashland, Pennsylvania, the heat powering the geyser (which erupts from an abandoned mine vent) comes not from geothermal power, but from the long-simmering Centralia mine fire.\nPerpetual spouter.\nThis is a natural hot spring that spouts water constantly without stopping for recharge. Some of these are incorrectly called geysers, but because they are not periodic in nature they are not considered true geysers.\nCommercialization.\nGeysers are used for various activities such as electricity generation, heating and geotourism. Many geothermal reserves are found all around the world. The geyser fields in Iceland are some of the most commercially viable geyser locations in the world. Since the 1920s hot water directed from the geysers has been used to heat greenhouses and to grow food that otherwise could not have been cultivated in Iceland's inhospitable climate. Steam and hot water from the geysers has also been used for heating homes since 1943 in Iceland. In 1979 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) actively promoted development of geothermal energy in the \"Geysers-Calistoga Known Geothermal Resource Area\" (KGRA) near Calistoga, California through a variety of research programs and the Geothermal Loan Guarantee Program. The department is obligated by law to assess the potential environmental impacts of geothermal development.\nExtraterrestrial geyser-like features.\nThere are many bodies in the Solar System where eruptions which superficially resemble terrestrial geysers have been observed or are believed to occur. Despite being commonly referred to as geysers, they are driven by fundamentally different processes, consist of a wide range of volatiles, and can occur on vastly disparate scales; from the modestly sized Martian carbon dioxide jets to the immense plumes of Enceladus. Generally, there are two broad categories of feature commonly referred to as geysers: sublimation plumes, and cryovolcanic plumes (also referred to as cryogeysers).\nSublimation plumes are jets of sublimated volatiles and dust from shallow sources under icy surfaces. Known examples include the CO2 jets on Mars, and the nitrogen eruptions on Neptune's moon Triton.\nOn Mars carbon dioxide jets are believed to occur in the southern polar region of Mars during spring, as a layer of dry ice accumulated over winter is warmed by the sun. Although these jets have not yet been directly observed, they leave evidence visible from orbit in the form of dark spots and lighter fans atop the dry ice. These features consist primarily of sand and dust blown out by the outbursts, as well as spider-like patterns of channels created below the ice by the rapid flow of CO2 gas. There are a plethora of theories to explain the eruptions, including heating from sunlight, chemical reactions, or even biological activity.\nTriton was found to have active eruptions of nitrogen and dust by \"Voyager 2\" when it flew past the moon in 1989. These plumes were up to 8km high, where winds would blow them up to 150km downwind, creating long, dark streaks across the otherwise bright south polar ice cap. There are various theories as to what drives the activity on Triton, such as solar heating through transparent ice, cryovolcanism, or basal heating of nitrogen ice sheets.\nCryovolcanic plumes or cryogeysers generally refer to large-scale eruptions of predominantly water vapour from active cryovolcanic features on certain icy moons. Such plumes occur on Saturn's moon Enceladus and Jupiter's moon Europa.\nPlumes of water vapour, together with ice particles and smaller amounts of other components (such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, hydrocarbons and silicates), have been observed erupting from vents associated with the \"tiger stripes\" in the south polar region of Enceladus by the \"Cassini\" orbiter. These plumes are the source of the material in Saturn's E ring. The mechanism which causes these eruptions are generated remains uncertain, as well as to what extent they are physically linked to Enceladus' subsurface ocean, but they are believed to be powered at least in part by tidal heating. \"Cassini\" flew through these plumes several times, allowing direct analysis of water from inside another solar system body for the first time.\nIn December 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapour plumes potentially 200km high above the south polar region of Europa. Re-examination of \"Galileo\" data also suggested that it may have flown through a plume during a flyby in 1997. Water was also detected by the Keck Observatory in 2016, announced in a 2019 Nature article speculating the cause to be a cryovolcanic eruption. It is thought that Europa's lineae might be venting this water vapour into space in a similar manner to the \"tiger stripes\" of Enceladus.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of a sequence of row-wise operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix. The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855).\nTo perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of elementary row operations:\nUsing these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into \"reduced row echelon form\": each nonzero row is above every zero row, each nonzero row has leftmost nonzero entry equal to 1, the columns containing these leading 1s have all other entries 0, and the leading 1 in each nonzero row is to the right of the leading 1 in the previous row. This final form is unique; in other words, it is independent of the sequence of row operations used. For example, in the following sequence of row operations (where two elementary operations on different rows are done at the first and third steps), the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form, and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form.\nformula_1\nUsing row operations to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form is sometimes called &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination. In this case, the term \"Gaussian elimination\" refers to the process until it has reached its upper triangular, (unreduced) row echelon form. For computational reasons, when solving systems of linear equations, it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations before the matrix is completely reduced.\nDefinitions and example of algorithm.\nThe process of row reduction makes use of elementary row operations, and can be divided into two parts. The first part (sometimes called forward elimination) reduces a given system to row echelon form, from which one can tell whether there are no solutions, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. The second part (sometimes called back substitution) continues to use row operations until the solution is found; in other words, it puts the matrix into reduced row echelon form.\nAnother point of view, which turns out to be very useful to analyze the algorithm, is that row reduction produces a matrix decomposition of the original matrix. The elementary row operations may be viewed as the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by elementary matrices. Alternatively, a sequence of elementary operations that reduces a single row may be viewed as multiplication by a Frobenius matrix. Then the first part of the algorithm computes an LU decomposition, while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix.\nRow operations.\nThere are three types of elementary row operations which may be performed on the rows of a matrix:\nIf the matrix is associated to a system of linear equations, then these operations do not change the solution set. Therefore, if one's goal is to solve a system of linear equations, then using these row operations could make the problem easier.\nEchelon form.\nFor each row in a matrix, if the row does not consist of only zeros, then the leftmost nonzero entry is called the \"leading entry\" (or \"pivot\") of that row. If two leading entries are in the same column, then a row operation of type 3 can be used to make one of those entries zero. Then by using the row swapping operation, one can always order the rows so that for every non-zero row, the leading entry is to the right of the leading entry of the row above. If this is the case, the matrix is said to be in \"row echelon form\". In this form, the lower left part of the matrix contains only zeros, and all of the zero rows are below the non-zero rows. The word \"echelon\" is used here because one can roughly think of the rows being ranked by their size, with the largest being at the top and the smallest being at the bottom.\nFor example, the following matrix is in row echelon form, and its leading entries are shown in red:\nformula_2\nIt is in echelon form because the zero row is at the bottom and the leading entry of the second row (in the third column) is to the right of the leading entry of the first row (in the second column).\nA matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form if furthermore all of the leading entries are equal to 1 (which can be achieved by using the elementary row operation of type 2), and in every column containing a leading entry, all of the other entries in that column are zero (which can be achieved by using elementary row operations of type 3).\nExample of the algorithm.\nSuppose the goal is to find and describe the set of solutions to the following system of linear equations:\nformula_3\nThe table below is the row reduction process applied simultaneously to the system of equations and its associated augmented matrix. In practice, one does not usually deal with the systems in terms of equations, but instead makes use of the augmented matrix, which is more suitable for computer manipulations. The row reduction procedure may be summarized as follows: eliminate x from all equations below \"L\"1, and then eliminate y from all equations below \"L\"2. This will put the system into triangular form. Then, using back-substitution, each unknown can be solved for.\nThe second column describes which row operations have just been performed. For the first step, x is eliminated from \"L\"2 by adding \"L\"1 to \"L\"2. Next, x is eliminated from \"L\"3 by adding \"L\"1 to \"L\"3. These row operations are labelled in the table as\nformula_4\nOnce y is also eliminated from the third row, the result is a system of linear equations in triangular form, and so the first part of the algorithm is complete. From a computational point of view, it is faster to solve the variables in reverse order, a process known as back-substitution. One sees the solution is \"z\" = \u22121, \"y\" = 3, and \"x\" = 2. In particular, there is a unique solution to the original system of equations in this case.\nInstead of stopping once the matrix is in row echelon form, one could continue until the matrix is in \"reduced\" row echelon form, as it is done in the table. The process of row reducing until the matrix is reduced is sometimes referred to as Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination, to distinguish it from stopping after reaching echelon form.\nHistory.\nThe method of Gaussian elimination appears \u2013 albeit without proof \u2013 in the Chinese mathematical text Chapter Eight: \"Rectangular Arrays\" of \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\". Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. The first reference to the book by this title is dated to 179 AD, but parts of it were written as early as approximately 150\u00a0BC. It was commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century.\nAccording to Grcar solution of linear equations by elimination was invented independently in several cultures in Eurasia starting from antiquity and in Europe definite examples of procedure were published already by late Renaissance (in 1550's). It is quite possible that already then the procedure was considered by mathematicians elementary and in no need to explanation for professionals, so we may never learn its detailed history except that by then it was practiced in at least several places in Europe.\nThe method in Europe stems from the notes of Isaac Newton. In 1669\u20131670, Newton wrote that all the algebra books known to him lacked a lesson for solving simultaneous equations, which Newton then supplied. Cambridge University eventually published the notes as \"Arithmetica Universalis\" in 1707 long after Newton had left academic life. The notes were widely imitated, which made (what is now called) Gaussian elimination a standard lesson in algebra textbooks by the end of the 18th century. Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1810 devised a notation for symmetric elimination that was adopted in the 19th century by professional hand computers to solve the normal equations of least-squares problems. The algorithm that is taught in high school was named for Gauss only in the 1950s as a result of confusion over the history of the subject.\nSome authors use the term \"Gaussian elimination\" to refer only to the procedure until the matrix is in echelon form, and use the term Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination to refer to the procedure which ends in reduced echelon form. The name is used because it is a variation of Gaussian elimination as described by Wilhelm Jordan in 1888. However, the method also appears in an article by Clasen published in the same year. Jordan and Clasen probably discovered Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination independently.\nApplications.\nHistorically, the first application of the row reduction method is for solving systems of linear equations. Below are some other important applications of the algorithm.\nComputing determinants.\nTo explain how Gaussian elimination allows the computation of the determinant of a square matrix, we have to recall how the elementary row operations change the determinant:\nIf Gaussian elimination applied to a square matrix A produces a row echelon matrix B, let d be the product of the scalars by which the determinant has been multiplied, using the above rules. Then the determinant of A is the quotient by d of the product of the elements of the diagonal of B:\nformula_5\nComputationally, for an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix, this method needs only O(\"n\"3) arithmetic operations, while using Leibniz formula for determinants requires formula_6 operations , and recursive Laplace expansion requires O(\"n\" 2\"n\") operations if the sub-determinants are memorized for being computed only once . Even on the fastest computers, these two methods are impractical or almost impracticable for \"n\" above 20.\nFinding the inverse of a matrix.\nA variant of Gaussian elimination called Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination can be used for finding the inverse of a matrix, if it exists. If \"A\" is an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" square matrix, then one can use row reduction to compute its inverse matrix, if it exists. First, the \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" identity matrix is augmented to the right of \"A\", forming an \"n\" \u00d7 2\"n\" block matrix [\"A\" | \"I\"]. Now through application of elementary row operations, find the reduced echelon form of this \"n\" \u00d7 2\"n\" matrix. The matrix \"A\" is invertible if and only if it can be reduced to the identity matrix \"I\"; in this case the right block of the final matrix is \"A\"\u22121. If the algorithm is unable to reduce the left block to \"I\", then \"A\" is not invertible.\nFor example, consider the following matrix:\nformula_7\nTo find the inverse of this matrix, one takes the following matrix augmented by the identity and row-reduces it as a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 matrix:\nformula_8\nBy performing row operations, one can check that the reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix is\nformula_9\nOne can think of each row operation as the left product by an elementary matrix. Denoting by \"B\" the product of these elementary matrices, we showed, on the left, that \"BA\" = \"I\", and therefore, \"B\" = \"A\"\u22121. On the right, we kept a record of \"BI\" = \"B\", which we know is the inverse desired. This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.\nComputing ranks and bases.\nThe Gaussian elimination algorithm can be applied to any \"m\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix A. In this way, for example, some 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a09 matrices can be transformed to a matrix that has a row echelon form like\nformula_10\nwhere the stars are arbitrary entries, and \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\" are nonzero entries. This echelon matrix T contains a wealth of information about A: the rank of A is 5, since there are 5 nonzero rows in T; the vector space spanned by the columns of A has a basis consisting of its columns 1, 3, 4, 7 and 9 (the columns with \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\" in T), and the stars show how the other columns of A can be written as linear combinations of the basis columns.\nAll of this applies also to the reduced row echelon form, which is a particular row echelon format.\nComputational efficiency.\nThe number of arithmetic operations required to perform row reduction is one way of measuring the algorithm's computational efficiency. For example, to solve a system of \"n\" equations for \"n\" unknowns by performing row operations on the matrix until it is in echelon form, and then solving for each unknown in reverse order, requires \"n\"(\"n\" + 1)/2 divisions, (2\"n\"3 + 3\"n\"2 \u2212 5\"n\")/6 multiplications, and (2\"n\"3 + 3\"n\"2 \u2212 5\"n\")/6 subtractions, for a total of approximately 2\"n\"3/3 operations. Thus it has a \"arithmetic complexity\" (time complexity, where each arithmetic operation takes one unit of time, independently of the size of the inputs) of O(\"n\"3).\nThis complexity is a good measure of the time needed for the whole computation when the time for each arithmetic operation is approximately constant. This is the case when the coefficients are represented by floating-point numbers or when they belong to a finite field. If the coefficients are integers or rational numbers exactly represented, the intermediate entries can grow exponentially large, so the bit complexity is exponential.\nHowever, the Bareiss algorithm is a variant of Gaussian elimination that avoids this exponential growth of the intermediate entries; with the same arithmetic complexity of O(\"n\"3), it has a bit complexity of O(\"n\"5), and has therefore a strongly-polynomial time complexity.\nGaussian elimination and its variants can be used on computers for systems with thousands of equations and unknowns. However, the cost becomes prohibitive for systems with millions of equations. These large systems are generally solved using iterative methods. Specific methods exist for systems whose coefficients follow a regular pattern (see System of linear equations).\nBareiss algorithm.\nThe first strongly-polynomial time algorithm for Gaussian elimination was published by Jack Edmonds in 1967.37 Independently, and almost simultaneously, Erwin Bareiss discovered another algorithm, based on the following remark, which applies to a division-free variant of Gaussian elimination.\nIn standard Gaussian elimination, one subtracts from each row formula_11 below the pivot row formula_12 a multiple of formula_12 by formula_14 where formula_15 and formula_16 are the entries in the pivot column of formula_11 and formula_18 respectively.\nBareiss variant consists, instead, of replacing formula_11 with formula_20 This produces a row echelon form that has the same zero entries as with the standard Gaussian elimination.\nBareiss' main remark is that each matrix entry generated by this variant is the determinant of a submatrix of the original matrix.\nIn particular, if one starts with integer entries, the divisions occurring in the algorithm are exact divisions resulting in integers. Therefore, all intermediate entries and final entries are integers. Moreover, Hadamard's inequality provides an upper bound on the absolute values of the intermediate and final entries, and thus a bit complexity of formula_21 using soft O notation.\nMoreover, as an upper bound on the size of final entries is known, a complexity formula_22 can be obtained with modular computation followed either by Chinese remaindering or Hensel lifting.\nAs a corollary, the following problems can be solved in strongly polynomial time with the same bit complexity:40\nNumeric instability.\nOne possible problem is numerical instability, caused by the possibility of dividing by very small numbers. If, for example, the leading coefficient of one of the rows is very close to zero, then to row-reduce the matrix, one would need to divide by that number. This means that any error which existed for the number that was close to zero would be amplified. Gaussian elimination is numerically stable for diagonally dominant or positive-definite matrices. For general matrices, Gaussian elimination is usually considered to be stable, when using partial pivoting, even though there are examples of stable matrices for which it is unstable.\nGeneralizations.\nGaussian elimination can be performed over any field, not just the real numbers.\nBuchberger's algorithm is a generalization of Gaussian elimination to systems of polynomial equations. This generalization depends heavily on the notion of a monomial order. The choice of an ordering on the variables is already implicit in Gaussian elimination, manifesting as the choice to work from left to right when selecting pivot positions.\nComputing the rank of a tensor of order greater than 2 is NP-hard. Therefore, if , there cannot be a polynomial time analog of Gaussian elimination for higher-order tensors (matrices are array representations of order-2 tensors).\nPseudocode.\nAs explained above, Gaussian elimination transforms a given \"m\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix A into a matrix in row-echelon form.\nIn the following pseudocode, codice_1 denotes the entry of the matrix A in row i and column j with the indices starting from\u00a01. The transformation is performed \"in place\", meaning that the original matrix is lost for being eventually replaced by its row-echelon form.\n h := 1 /* \"Initialization of the pivot row\" */\n k := 1 /* \"Initialization of the pivot column\" */\n while h \u2264 m and k \u2264 n:\n /* \"Find the k-th pivot:\" */\n i_max := argmax (i = h ... m, abs(A[i, k]))\n if A[i_max, k] = 0:\n /* \"No pivot in this column, pass to next column\" */\n k := k + 1\n else:\n swap rows(h, i_max)\n /* \"Do for all rows below pivot:\" */\n for i = h + 1 ... m:\n f := A[i, k] / A[h, k]\n /* \"Fill with zeros the lower part of pivot column:\" */\n A[i, k] := 0\n /* \"Do for all remaining elements in current row:\" */\n for j = k + 1 ... n:\n A[i, j] := A[i, j] - A[h, j] * f\n /* \"Increase pivot row and column\" */\n h := h + 1\n k := k + 1\nThis algorithm differs slightly from the one discussed earlier, by choosing a pivot with largest absolute value. Such a \"partial pivoting\" may be required if, at the pivot place, the entry of the matrix is zero. In any case, choosing the largest possible absolute value of the pivot improves the numerical stability of the algorithm, when floating point is used for representing numbers.\nUpon completion of this procedure the matrix will be in row echelon form and the corresponding system may be solved by back substitution.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13037", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13037", "title": "Guantanamo Bay Naval Base", "text": "Military base of the United States Navy\nGuantanamo Bay Naval Base (), officially known as Naval Station Guantanamo Bay or NSGB, (also called GTMO, pronounced Gitmo as jargon by the U.S. military) is a United States military base located on of land and water on the shore of Guant\u00e1namo Bay at the southeastern end of Cuba. It has been leased from Cuba to the U.S., without expiry, since 1903 as a coaling station and naval base. It is the oldest overseas American naval base. Since 1974, the U.S. has paid the Cuban government an annual sum equivalent to $4,085 in 1934 dollars (approximately $ in 2024) to lease the bay. The lease was previously $2,000 per year (paid in gold) until 1934, when it was set to match the value of gold in dollars. \nSince taking power in 1959, the Cuban government has consistently protested against the U.S. presence on Cuban soil, arguing that the base was imposed on Cuba by force and is illegal under international law. The lease requires either bilateral consent or full U.S. military withdrawal in order to terminate lease. Since 2002, the naval base has maintained the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, for alleged unlawful combatants captured in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places during the war on terror. Cases of alleged torture of prisoners by the U.S. military, and their denial of protection under the Geneva Conventions, have been criticized. The base has been a focal point for debates over civil liberties, notably influenced by the landmark 2008 Supreme Court decision in \"Boumediene v. Bush\". This ruling affirmed the constitutional right of detainees to challenge their detention via habeas corpus, highlighting the ongoing tensions between national security and civil liberties.\nGeography.\nThe Naval Base occupies three main geographical sections: Leeward Point, Windward Point, and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Guant\u00e1namo Bay physically divides the Naval Station into sections. The bay extends past the boundaries of the base into Cuba, where the bay is then referred to as Bah\u00eda de Guant\u00e1namo. Guant\u00e1namo Bay contains several cays, which are identified as Hospital Cay, Medico Cay, North Toro Cay, and South Toro Cay.\nLeeward Point of the Naval Station is the site of the active airfield. Major geographical features on Leeward Point include Mohomilla Bay and the Guant\u00e1namo River. Three beaches exist on the Leeward side. Two are available for use by base residents, while the third, Hicacal Beach, is closed. Nearby is the US Naval Cemetery at Guantanamo Bay, also known as Cuzco Wells Cemetery. The cemetery holds over 350 burials, including that of Captain Henry Smith, who died as a result of injuries received during the sinking of his ship, the SS Delmundo, by the German submarine U-600 on 13 August 1942. \nWindward Point contains most of the activities at the Naval Station. There are nine beaches available to base personnel. The highest point on the base is John Paul Jones Hill (named after the Revolutionary War hero) at . The geography of Windward Point is such that there are many coves and peninsulas along the bay shoreline providing ideal areas for mooring ships.\nAccording to Stephen Benz, Stephen Crane described the area as \"craggy\" and \"cut with ravines.\" He also described the coastline as covered in ridges and \"chalky cliffs\".\nHistory.\nSpanish colonial era.\nThe area surrounding Guantanamo Bay was originally inhabited by the Ta\u00edno people. On 30 April 1494, Christopher Columbus, on his second voyage, arrived and spent the night. The place where Columbus landed is now known as Fisherman's Point. Columbus declared the bay \"Puerto Grande\". The bay and surrounding areas briefly came under British control during the War of Jenkins' Ear. Prior to the outbreak of the conflict, the bay was referred to as \"Walthenham Harbor\" by British cartographers. The British expeditionary force renamed the bay \"Cumberland Bay\". They eventually retreated from the area after an attempt to march to Santiago de Cuba was repulsed by Spanish troops.\nSpanish\u2013American War.\nDuring the Spanish\u2013American War, the U.S. fleet attacking Santiago secured Guant\u00e1namo's harbor for protection during the hurricane season of 1898. The Marines landed at Guantanamo Bay with naval support, and American and Cuban forces routed the defending Spanish troops. There is a monument on McCalla Hill to one Navy officer and five Marines who died in battle at Guantanamo Bay.\nThe war ended with the Treaty of Paris of 1898, in which Spain formally relinquished control of Cuba. Although the war was over, the United States maintained a strong military presence on the island. In 1901 the United States government passed the Platt Amendment as part of an Army Appropriations Bill. Section VII of this amendment read\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That to enable the United States to maintain the independence of Cuba, and to protect the people thereof, as well as for its own defense, the government of Cuba will sell or lease to the United States lands necessary for coaling or naval stations at certain specified points to be agreed upon with the President of the United States.\nAfter initial resistance by the Cuban Constitutional Convention, the Platt Amendment was incorporated into the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba in 1901. The Constitution took effect in 1902, and land for a naval base at Guantanamo Bay was granted to the United States the following year.\nPermanent lease.\nThe 1903 lease agreement, which has no fixed expiration date, was executed in two parts. The first, signed in February, consisted of the following provisions: \nThe second part, signed five months later in July 1903, consisted of the following provisions: \nSIGNED Theodore Roosevelt and Jose M Garcia Montes.\nIn 1934, the United States unilaterally changed the payment from gold coin to U.S. dollars per the Gold Reserve Act. The lease amount was set at US$3,386.25, based on the price of gold at the time. In 1973, the U.S. adjusted the lease amount to $3,676.50, and in 1974 to $4,085, based on further increases to the price of gold in USD. Payments have been sent annually, but only one lease payment has been accepted since the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro claimed that this check was deposited due to confusion in 1959. The Cuban government has not deposited any other lease check since that time.\nBefore and during World War II.\nThe Naval Base became a prime area for winter training for the Atlantic fleet. Due to the large increase in population during the training months, the Naval Base quickly established facilities to support everyday functions. Construction of the Guantanamo Bay fleet range system began as early as 1905 under Captain Rogers. Four primary ranges were built during its construction: Range Alpha, Range Beta, Range Charlie, and Range Delta. Due to the size of the base, sections were shut down in order for range operations to proceed. Ironically, the concrete range system's size and cost led to its downfall. Strong evidence suggests the fleet ranges were used throughout World War I and the beginning of World War II.\nDuring World War II, the base was set up to use a nondescript number for postal operations. The base used the Fleet Post Office, Atlantic, in New York City, with the address: 115 FPO NY. The base was also an important intermediate distribution point for merchant shipping convoys from New York City and Key West, Florida, to the Panama Canal and the islands of Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.\nCold War and beyond.\nFrom 1953 to 1959, thousands of Cubans commuted daily from outside the base to jobs within it. In mid-1958, vehicular traffic was stopped; workers were required to walk through the base's several gates. Public Works Center buses were pressed into service almost overnight to carry the tides of workers to and from the gate. \nThe \"Cactus Curtain\" is a term describing the line separating the naval base from Cuban-controlled territory, an allusion to Europe's Iron Curtain, the Bamboo Curtain in East Asia, and the similar Ice Curtain in the Bering Strait. After the Cuban Revolution, some Cubans sought refuge on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. In late 1961, Cuban troops planted an -long, -wide barrier of \"Opuntia\" (prickly pear) cactus along the northeastern section of the fence surrounding the base, to prevent checkpoint evasion when moving between the base and Cuba proper.\nThe curtain forms part of a \"no man's land\" that encircles the base. This area is complete with perimeter patrols, outposts featuring sandbags, and watchtowers, and has been complemented with barbed wire fences, minefields, and cacti. Apart from the cacti, both U.S. and Cuban troops erected, maintained, and otherwise manned these defenses, primarily to prevent checkpoint evasion and possible invasion from the other side.\nU.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 anti-personnel and anti-tank land mines across the \"no man's land\" around the perimeter of the naval base, creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the Western Hemisphere. Initially, the mines were laid down by US troops, who also posted signs stating that the landmines were \"precautions\" and should not be viewed as \"aggressive\". In response, Cuban troops also laid down their own mines, with both sides completing their minefields in 1961. Between 1961 and 1965, landmine explosions resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, including as the result of engineering accidents and late-night partygoers. On 16 May 1996, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the demining of the American field. They have since been replaced with motion and sound sensors to detect intruders on the base. The Cuban government has not removed its corresponding minefield outside the perimeter.\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the families of military personnel were evacuated from the base. Notified of the evacuation on 22 October, evacuees were told to pack one suitcase per family member, to bring evacuation and immunization cards, to tie pets in the yard, to leave the keys to the house on the dining table, and to wait in front of the house for buses. Dependents traveled to the airfield for flights to the United States, or to ports for passage aboard evacuation ships. After the crisis was resolved, family members were allowed to return to the base in December 1962.\nFrom 1939, the base's water was supplied by pipelines that drew water from the Yateras River about north-east of the base, for which the U.S. government paid a fee. In 1964, that was about $14,000 a month for about per day. In 1964, the Cuban government stopped the flow. The base had about of water in storage, and strict water conservation measures were put into effect immediately. Initially, the U.S. imported water from Jamaica by barge, but then relocated a desalination plant from San Diego (Point Loma). When the Cuban government accused the United States of \"stealing water\", base commander John D. Bulkeley ordered that the pipelines be cut and a section removed. A length of the diameter pipe and a length of the diameter pipe were lifted from the ground and the openings sealed.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the base had problems with alcohol and racial tension. Harassment and strip searches also became a regular occurrence for Cuban workers on the base.\nSeveral old guns from the USS \"Monongahela\" (1862) have been salvaged and placed around the base. The old warship served as a storeship at Guantanamo until destroyed by fire on 17 March 1908. A gun was salvaged from its wreck and put on display at the Naval Station. Since the gun was deformed by the heat from the fire, it was nicknamed \"Ole Droopy\". A similar gun, possibly also salvaged from the \"Monongahela\", is on display near the Bay View Club on the Naval Station.\nBy 2006, only two elderly Cubans, Luis Delarosa and Harry Henry, still crossed the base's North East Gate daily to work on the base, because the Cuban government has prohibited new recruitment since 1959. Both men retired at the end of 2012. At the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2013, Cuba's Foreign Minister demanded the U.S. return the base.\nCurrent operations.\nThe military facility has over 8,500 U.S. sailors and Marines stationed there, as of 2011. It is the only military base the U.S. maintains in a socialist country.\nIn 2005, the U.S. Navy completed a $12\u00a0million wind-power project at the base, erecting four 950 kilowatt, wind turbines, reducing the reliance on diesel fuel to power the existing diesel generators (the base's primary electricity generation). In 2006, the wind turbines reduced diesel fuel consumption by annually.\nUnits and commands.\nAccess to the Naval Station is very limited and must be pre-approved through the appropriate local chain of command with the Commander of the station as the final approval. Since berthing facilities are limited, visitors must be sponsored indicating that they have an approved residence for the duration of the visit.\nBesides servicemembers, the base houses a large number of civilian contractors working for the military. Many of these contractors are migrant workers from Jamaica and the Philippines, and are thought to constitute up to 40% of the base's population.\nMajor contractors working at NSGB have included the following:\nCargo shipping.\nOcean transportation is provided by Schuyler Line Navigation Company, a U.S. Flag Ocean Carrier. Schuyler Line operates under government contract to supply sustainment and building supplies to the base.\nAirfields.\nThere are two airfields within the base, Leeward Point Field and McCalla Field. Leeward Point Field is the active military airfield, with the ICAO code MUGM and IATA code NBW. McCalla Field was designated as the auxiliary landing field in 1970s, but was no longer a viable airfield by the 1990s.\nLeeward Point Field.\nLeeward Point Field was constructed with a 6,000-foot main runway in 1943; the runway was extended in 1953 to 8,000 feet to accommodate jet aircraft. \nLeeward Point Field has a single active runway, 10/28, measuring . The former runway, 9/27 was . Currently, Leeward Point Field operates several aircraft and helicopters supporting base operations. Leeward Point Field was home to Fleet Composite Squadron 10 (VC-10) until the unit was phased out in 1993. VC-10 was one of the last active-duty squadrons flying the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk.\nMcCalla Field.\nMcCalla Field was established in 1931 and remained operational until 1970. The airfield was named for Bowman H. McCalla, who was a United States Navy admiral in charge of the Battle of Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The current field was expanded in 1941 when the original grass runway was replaced. Naval Air Station Guantanamo Bay was officially established 1 February 1941. Aircraft routinely operating out of McCalla included JRF-5, N3N, J2F, C-1 Trader, and dirigibles. \nThe airfield was deactivated in the 1970s and was used to house Cuban and Haitian refugees beginning in the 1990s. Sometime between 1996 and 2001, the refugee camps were dismantled and the area became a collection of abandoned buildings. McCalla Field is now listed as a closed airfield. The USN aviation assets are now located across the bay at Leeward Point Field, about 1.5 miles to the west.\nAfter the events of September 11, the area was reevaluated as a possible location for a detention facility. Camp Justice is now located on the grounds of the former airfield.\nThe area formerly consisted of three runways, all now closed: 1/19 at , 14/32 at , and 10/28 at . \nThe former airfield resides at an elevation of above mean sea level.\nDetention camp.\nBeginning in the last quarter of the 20th century, the base was used to house Cuban and Haitian refugees intercepted on the high seas. In the early 1990s, it held refugees who fled Haiti after military forces overthrew president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. These refugees were held in a detainment area called Camp Bulkeley until United States district court Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. declared the camp unconstitutional on 8 June 1993. This decision was later vacated. The last Haitian migrants departed Guantanamo on 1 November 1995.\nBeginning in 2002, following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, started in response to the September 11 attacks, a small portion of the base was used to detain several hundred individuals with ties or suspected ties to Islamic terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban. These detainees were not afforded POW status or facing formal charges but instead designated enemy combatants; assigned to confinement in Camp Delta, Camp Echo, Camp Iguana, and the now-closed Camp X-Ray. In litigation regarding the availability of fundamental rights to those imprisoned at the base, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that the detainees \"have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.\" Therefore, the detainees have the fundamental right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. A district court has since held that the \"Geneva Conventions applied to the Taliban detainees, but not to members of Al-Qaeda terrorist organization.\"\nOn 10 June 2006, the Department of Defense reported that three Guantanamo Bay detainees took their own lives. The military reported the men hanged themselves with nooses made of sheets and clothes. A study published by Seton Hall Law's Center for Policy and Research, while making no conclusions regarding what actually transpired, asserts that the military investigation failed to address significant issues detailed in that report.\nOn 6 September 2006, President George W. Bush announced that alleged or non-alleged combatants held by the CIA would be transferred to the custody of Department of Defense, and held at Guantanamo Prison. Of approximately 500 prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, only 10 have been tried by the Guantanamo military commission, but all cases have been stayed pending the adjustments being made to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\".\nIn January 2009, President Obama signed an executive order directing the closing of the Guant\u00e1namo detention camp within a year. This plan was thwarted for the time being on 20 May 2009, when the United States Senate voted to keep the prison at Guantanamo Bay open for the foreseeable future and forbid the transfer of any detainees to facilities in the United States. Senator Daniel Inouye, a Democrat from Hawaii and chairman of the appropriations committee, said he favored keeping Guantanamo open until Obama produced a \"coherent plan for closing the prison.\" Consequently, Obama decided to postpone difficult decisions on the details for at least six months. On 7 March 2011, Obama issued a new executive order permitting indefinite detention of Guant\u00e1namo detainees. This decision was codified into federal law by provision added to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. \nIn early February 2021, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden declared his intention to shut down the facility before he leaves office. He did not.\nIn July 2021, an additional detainee was released.\nIn June 2022, an Afghan prisoner held at Guantanamo Bay for about 15 years without trial was released.\nIn February 2023, three prisoners were released from Guantanamo Bay. Majid Khan, who pleaded guilty before a Military Commission in 2012, had completed his sentence of 10 years, and was released to Belize. Brothers Abdul Al-Rahim Ghulam Rabbani and Mohammed Ahmad Ghulam Rabbani, whose detentions were deemed no longer necessary in order to protect the United States from a national security threat, were released and repatriated to the government of Pakistan.\nIn March 2023, Ghassan al-Sharbi was released to his home country of Saudi Arabia from Guantanamo Bay, after being deemed no longer necessary to detain in order to protect the United States from a national security threat.\nAs of \u00a06, 2025[ [update]], 15 detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay.\nIn June 2023, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism Fionnuala N\u00ed Aol\u00e1in released her final report on the detention center. The report concludes that prisoners endure \"ongoing cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment\" and that the detention center should be closed.\nIn early 2025, the Trump administration started sending numerous illegal migrants there, and he has stated that he intends to send the worst criminal migrants to the prison. Multiple groups and people have filed lawsuits against this, claiming that the prisoners do not have access to a lawyer or habeas corpus, and that the prisoners' conditions were brutal enough that some have attempted suicide.\nRepresented businesses.\nDespite the prohibition on the establishment of \"commercial or other enterprises\" as stated in Article 3 of the second part of the lease, several recognized American food outlets have been opened at the military base. Most of the restaurants on the installation are franchises which are owned and operated by the Department of the Navy. Proceeds from these restaurants are used to support Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) activities for service personnel and their families. These restaurants are located inside the base; as such, they are not accessible to Cubans.\nA Baskin-Robbins ice cream stand, which opened in the 1980s, was one of the first business franchises allowed on the base. In early 1986, the base added the first and only McDonald's restaurant within Cuba. A Subway restaurant was opened in 1987 and closed in 1994 when the Navy Department refused to renew the lease. In 2004, a combined KFC and A&amp;W restaurant was opened at the bowling alley and a Pizza Hut Express was added to the Windjammer Restaurant. There is also a cafe that sells Starbucks coffee, and there is a combined KFC and Taco Bell restaurant.\nEducation and schooling.\nDepartment of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) provides for the education of dependent personnel with two schools. Both schools are named for Rear Admiral William Thomas Sampson. W.T. Sampson Elementary School serves grades K\u20135 and W. T. Sampson High School serves grades 6\u201312. The Villamar Child Development Center provides child care for dependents from six weeks to five years old. MWR operates a Youth Center that provides activities for dependents.\nSome former students of Guant\u00e1namo have shared stories of their experiences with the Guant\u00e1namo Public Memory Project. The 2013 documentary \"Guantanamo Circus\" directed by Christina Linhardt and Michael Rose reveals a glimpse of day-to-day life on GTMO as seen through the eyes of circus performers who visit the base. It is used as a reference by the Guant\u00e1namo Public Memory Project.\nClimate.\nThe bay has an annual rainfall of about . The amount of rainfall has resulted in the base being classified as a semi-arid desert environment. The annual average high temperature on the base is , the annual average low is .\nNotable people.\nNotable people born at the naval base include actor Peter Bergman and American guitarist Isaac Guillory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is an anthropomorphic gander (male goose) who possesses exceptionally good luck that grants him anything he desires as well as protecting him from any harm. This is in contrast to his cousin Donald Duck, who is often characterized for having bad luck. Gladstone is also a rival of Donald for the affection of Daisy Duck. Gladstone dresses in a very debonair way, often in a suit, and wearing a bow-tie, fedora, and spats. He has a wavy hairstyle which is depicted either as white or blonde. In the story \"Luck of the North\" (December 1949), he is described as having a brassy voice.\nOrigin.\nGladstone Gander first appeared in \"Wintertime Wager\" in \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #88 (January 1948), written and drawn by Carl Barks. In that story he arrives at Donald Duck's house during a freezing cold Christmas Day to remind him of a wager Donald made the previous summer; that he could swim in the Frozenbear Lake during Christmas Day or forfeit his house to Gladstone. Donald eventually loses the wager but Gladstone later on loses a wager of his own, brought to light by Daisy Duck, and thus Donald's house is returned to him.\nBarks gradually developed Gladstone's personality and demeanor after his first appearance and used him quite frequently\u2014in 24 stories between 1948 and 1953, the first five years of his existence. In his first three appearances in 1948 (\"Wintertime Wager\", \"Gladstone Returns\", \"Links Hijinks\"), he was portrayed as the mirror image of Donald: an obstinate braggart, perhaps just a little bit more arrogant, but did not yet have his characteristic luck. In his next two appearances, \"Rival Beachcombers\" and \"The Goldilocks Gambit\", Gladstone is portrayed as merely lazy and irritable, and also gullible. The breakthrough of his lucky streak occurs in 1949, within the adventure story \"Race to the South Seas!\" (\"March of Comics\" #41). In that story, Donald and his three nephews set sail on a rescue mission from Duckburg to a remote Pacific island on which Scrooge McDuck is believed to have stranded, in an attempt to gain their uncle's favor. For the same reason Gladstone is in hot pursuit as well, but because he was \"born lucky\" as Donald explains to his nephews, without lifting a finger, is having a much easier time than them.\nHis and Donald's rivalry over Daisy is established in \"Donald's Love Letters\" (1949), \"Wild About Flowers\" (1950), and \"Knightly Rivals\" (1951), and as potential heirs to Scrooge's fortune in \"Some Heir Over the Rainbow\" (1953). After that, Barks felt unable to develop the character further, finding him basically unsympathetic, and began using him less frequently. But by then, Gladstone had found a steady place in the Duck universe as one of the main established characters; frequently used by other writers and artists both in the Americas and Europe. He was first used by an artist other than Barks in 1951: \"Presents For All\" by Del Connell and Bob Moore. He appears as a main character in the Big Little Book series book \"Luck of the Ducks\" (1969).\nCharacter.\nGladstone's good luck defies probability and provides him with anything that would be to his benefit or enjoyment; as well as things he specifically wishes for, which are at times related to the plot of some stories. This could range from finding wallets and other valuables on the sidewalk to pieces of a ripped apart treasure map floating together in river to form it whole again; revealing the treasure's location. His good luck also protects him from any harm. At times he might not even know that a situation will work out in his favor in a later stage and by then often feeling confused or at times even thinking his luck has abandoned him; just to learn that it has been with him all along.\nThere have been various explanations for Gladstone's good luck over the years by various writers and artists. In Barks' story \"Luck of the North\" Gladstone proclaims: \"I was born under a lucky star, and everything I do will bring me good fortune [...].\" This is read from a horoscope book he owns which also has a map showing his lucky star conniving with the planet Neptunus. In many of the Italian comic books stories, Gladstone is bestowed with his luck because Fortuna, the goddess of fortune, is in love with him. In Don Rosa's story \"The Sign of the Triple Distelfink\" (1997), he added the fact that Gladstone was born on the day of his mother Daphne's birthday in 1920, under the protection sign of the Triple Distelfink, thus inheriting his mother's luck. In some stories he also uses good luck charms like lucky horseshoes or rabbits foots.\nHowever, for all his luck, Gladstone has no achievements to be proud of and no true ambitions, as he is incapable of long-term planning. This is all because of that he does not have to make the slightest of efforts to get what he wants, as his good luck will just give it to him in the end. He also often does not learn any life lessons from any misfortunes he could experience. This leads him to be extremely lazy; at times even thinking that willfully wishing for something is hard work, and disconnected from the realities of ordinary life. All of this is in stark contrast to his relative Scrooge McDuck, who is also capable of taking advantage of opportunities but works hard to create situations favorable for him; is strongly motivated by his ambitions and takes pride in forming his fortune by his own efforts and experiences. Instead, Gladstone often shows pride in his effortlessness and expresses great anxiety if he would betray those ideals. This is something first explored in more detail in Carl Barks's story \"Gladstone's Terrible Secret\" (May, 1952). Comic artist and writer Don Rosa has commented about this on the character: \"Gladstone is unwilling to make the slightest effort to gain something that his luck cannot give him, and, when things go wrong, he resigns immediately, certain that around the next corner a wallet, dropped by a passer-by, will be waiting for him\". Gladstone feels open contempt towards work of any kind, claiming it is beneath him, to the point of hesitating to help others even if it is to his own advantage, claiming that it seems alarmingly like work.\nAlso because of his good fortune, Gladstone is most often characterized to be very snobbish and a gloat; especially (and in some stories exclusively) toward his cousin Donald to whom he also can be very aggravating. For all of these reasons, he and Donald have formed an intense rivalry with each other. Gladstone's outrageous luck and boastfulness toward his cousin, combined with Donald's own ego and belief he can still best him despite all odds \u2014 or as Don Rosa's version of Donald comments, \"Donald's eternal tendency towards self-destruction\" \u2014 have set the stage for many stories featuring the two cousins' confrontations. They have, however, worked together or at least tolerated each other at times, but this is very rare and not without some tension that easily can turn into their ordinary rivalry.\nOccasionally, he is a rival to Scrooge McDuck himself who resents his complete reliance on his uncanny good luck. In such stories, often the only way Gladstone can be believably defeated is to have him win by the letter of the original story preset while the heroes later on take the bigger prize. In Carl Barks' story \"The Golden Nugget Boat\" (\"Uncle Scrooge\" #35, September 1961), Gladstone and Scrooge are competing in a gold prospecting contest in which Gladstone finds a gold nugget the nephews fashioned from a gold item Scrooge already owns to stop him from killing himself from overexertion in the contest. Gladstone finds the nugget and returns to win, but Scrooge and his nephews then find a much bigger nugget they are able to fashion into a boat to return to civilization afterward with a monetary worth that is easily more than Gladstone's find. Another instance of this with his rivalry with Donald was in the \"Salmon Derby\" (\"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #167, August 1954), where Gladstone catches the biggest fish and wins a new car but Donald manages to save a wealthy tycoon's daughter and is able to purchase a much bigger car. Another instance was when both Donald and Gladstone were competing for a job as a cameraman for a nature film director because Daisy was the director's assistant, Gladstone got the job but wished he had not because he wound up trudging through a swamp to film giant spiders while Daisy stayed behind in America, with Donald.\nIn more modern stories where he takes a more protagonistic role, writers most often downplay his unlikability to make him more relatable. For example, showing that he can learn from potential bad experiences, even if they never would become reality, and put more emphasis on his love for his family, even if he at times has a hard time expressing these feelings.\nIn many stories, Gladstone is also considered among the prime candidates for Scrooge McDuck's succession. In \"Some Heir Over the Rainbow\" (\"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #155, August 1953) by Carl Barks, Scrooge gives $1,000 to Donald, Gladstone, and Huey, Dewey and Louie to determine how they use it in order to be the most suitable heir to his fortune. Gladstone thinks of using the money to buy a television set until he finds a raffle ticket, in which he decides to save the money by placing it in a tree. Scrooge is unimpressed that Gladstone did not increase the money at all, but acknowledges that at least he still \"had\" it. Huey, Dewey, and Louie infuriate Scrooge by investing their money in what Scrooge assumes was a scam. Finally, Scrooge thinks to himself, \"I guess my heir will have to be Gladstone Gander! ... What an awful injustice to the world!\" Soon afterwards, however, the children's decision proves to be the wisest, and they become Scrooge's heirs instead of Gladstone.\nHe is a rival of Donald for the love of his girlfriend Daisy Duck. This is often portrayed either by showing Daisy uncertain of which one she likes the most or; the more common version, that she is angry with Donald and goes out with Gladstone instead to make Donald jealous. In modern comics this love-triangle is at times often more downplayed. However, despite having an eternal crush on Daisy Duck, Gladstone has appeared in love with other duck girls in Italian and Danish comic stories. One of those is Linda Paper, who really conquered Gladstone, making him want to give up all his luck, since she is unlucky and absolutely hates lucky people. She appeared in two subsequent comic stories. Another is Feather Mallard, who is as lucky as Gladstone but whenever they are together they are instead experiencing bad luck. A number of recent Italian stories feature Gladstone's protector goddess Fortuna appearing in person. She appears in one noteworthy tale, \"Gastone e il debole dalla Fortuna\" (\"Gladstone and the Struck of Luck\"), by Enrico Faccini and Augusto Macchetto, first published on March 24, 1998. In this story, the Goddess takes mortal guise in order to be able to date her favorite gander, and appears to be love-struck with him. Although Gladstone competes for Daisy's attention and affection with Donald and often loses, he reassures himself that at least he still has his extraordinary luck, because in the end he is a hedonist and the only person he really adores is himself.\nHis exact relation to the Duck Family Tree at its early stages was somewhat uncertain. In Carl Barks' original version of the family tree from the 1950s, Gladstone was the son of Luke the Goose and Daphne Duck who died by overeating at a free-lunch picnic. He was later adopted by Matilda McDuck and Goosetave Gander. Later, Barks is reported to have done away with the adoption, which was never featured in any story. (Of course, no stories denying the event were published.) In a more recent version of the family tree created by Don Rosa, with input from Barks, it was established that Daphne Duck (Donald's paternal aunt) married Goostave Gander and the two were Gladstone's parents. This is consistent with what Gladstone says in \"Race to the South Seas\": \"Scrooge McDuck is my mother's brother's brother-in-law\".\nGladstone has a nephew named Shamrock Gladstone who shares his propensity for luck. He also has a con artist cousin (not on Donald's side of the family) named Disraeli Duck.\nAnimation.\nGladstone makes two speaking appearances in the animated series \"DuckTales\", where he was voiced by Rob Paulsen. In these episodes he is not characterized as much of a braggart he is in the comics but rather focusing much more on his care-free nature, and additionally acting a bit more foolishly. In the episode \"Dime Enough for Luck\", Gladstone is an unwitting stooge for Magica De Spell in one of her attempts to steal Scrooge's Number One Dime. He returns in the episode \"Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. McDuck\", where he accidentally bids on an item that turns out to be valuable. This inspires Scrooge to bid on the next item\u2014a trunk containing Dr. Jekyll's formula\u2014which sets the plot in motion. He also makes non-speaking cameo appearances in the episodes \"Sweet Duck of Youth\" and \"Till Nephews Do Us Part\", as well in episode of \"House of Mouse\" titled \"Goofy For A Day\". Gladstone appears in the 2000 video game \"\" in his traditional role of Donald's rival for Daisy's affection, and every time a Boss Battle is about to start, Gladstone greets Donald, but always gets hurt, becoming squished by a giant bird, getting knocked off a building by a wrecking ball, being sent crashing to the bottom of a haunted mansion, and even gets sent back to Duckburg inside a pipe, and every time he gets hurt, he says that he has found a nickel. He also appears in the \"DuckTales\" reboot, first appearing in the episode \"The House of the Lucky Gander!\". In this series, he is voiced by Paul F. Tompkins. This series brings his personality far closer to how he acts in the comics, although it is implied that he is genuinely unaware of how arrogant he is.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13040", "revid": "50712324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13040", "title": "Gypsum", "text": "Soft calcium sulfate mineral\nGypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical formula . It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, drywall and blackboard or sidewalk chalk. Gypsum also crystallizes as translucent crystals of selenite. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite. The Mohs scale of mineral hardness defines gypsum as hardness value 2 based on scratch hardness comparison.\nFine-grained white or lightly tinted forms of gypsum known as alabaster have been used for sculpture by many cultures including Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ancient Rome, the Byzantine Empire, and the Nottingham alabasters of Medieval England.\nEtymology and history.\nThe word \"gypsum\" is derived from the Greek word (), \"plaster\". Because the quarries of the Montmartre district of Paris have long furnished burnt gypsum (calcined gypsum) used for various purposes, this dehydrated gypsum became known as plaster of Paris. Upon adding water, after a few dozen minutes, plaster of Paris becomes regular gypsum (dihydrate) again, causing the material to harden or \"set\" in ways that are useful for casting and construction.\nGypsum was known in Old English as , \"spear stone\", referring to its crystalline projections. Thus, the word spar in mineralogy, by comparison to gypsum, refers to any non-ore mineral or crystal that forms in spearlike projections. In the mid-18th century, the German clergyman and agriculturalist Johann Friderich Mayer investigated and publicized gypsum's use as a fertilizer. Gypsum may act as a source of sulfur for plant growth, and in the early 19th century, it was regarded as an almost miraculous fertilizer. American farmers were so anxious to acquire it that a lively smuggling trade with Nova Scotia evolved, resulting in the so-called \"Plaster War\" of 1820.\nPhysical properties.\nGypsum is moderately water-soluble (~2.0\u20132.5\u00a0g/L at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) and, in contrast to most other salts, it exhibits retrograde solubility, becoming less soluble at higher temperatures. When gypsum is heated in air it loses water and converts first to calcium sulfate hemihydrate (bassanite, often simply called \"plaster\") and, if heated further, to anhydrous calcium sulfate (anhydrite). As with anhydrite, the solubility of gypsum in saline solutions and in brines is also strongly dependent on sodium chloride (common table salt) concentration.\nThe structure of gypsum consists of layers of calcium (Ca2+) and sulfate () ions tightly bound together. These layers are bonded by sheets of anion water molecules via weaker hydrogen bonding, which gives the crystal perfect cleavage along the sheets (in the {010} plane).\nCrystal varieties.\nGypsum occurs in nature as flattened and often twinned crystals, and transparent, cleavable masses called selenite. In the form of selenite, gypsum forms some of the largest crystals found in nature, up to long. Selenite contains no significant selenium; rather, both substances were named for the ancient Greek word for the Moon.\nSelenite may also occur in a silky, fibrous form, in which case it is commonly called \"satin spar\". \nIt may also be granular or quite compact. In hand-sized samples, it can be anywhere from transparent to opaque. \nA very fine-grained white or lightly tinted variety of gypsum, called alabaster, is prized for ornamental work of various sorts. \nIn arid areas, gypsum can occur in a flower-like form, typically opaque, with embedded sand grains called desert rose.\nOccurrence.\nGypsum is a common mineral, with thick and extensive evaporite beds in association with sedimentary rocks. Deposits are known to occur in strata from as far back as the Archaean eon. Gypsum is deposited from lake and sea water, as well as in hot springs, from volcanic vapors, and sulfate solutions in veins. Hydrothermal anhydrite in veins is commonly hydrated to gypsum by groundwater in near-surface exposures. It is often associated with the minerals halite and sulfur. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral. Pure gypsum is white, but other substances found as impurities may give a wide range of colors to local deposits.\nBecause gypsum dissolves over time in water, gypsum is rarely found in the form of sand. However, the unique conditions of the White Sands National Park in the US state of New Mexico have created a expanse of white gypsum sand, enough to supply the US construction industry with drywall for 1,000 years.\nCommercial exploitation of the area, strongly opposed by area residents, was permanently prevented in 1933 when President Herbert Hoover declared the gypsum dunes a protected national monument.\nGypsum is also formed as a by-product of sulfide oxidation, amongst others by pyrite oxidation, when the sulfuric acid generated reacts with calcium carbonate. Its presence indicates oxidizing conditions. Under reducing conditions, the sulfates it contains can be reduced back to sulfide by sulfate-reducing bacteria. This can lead to accumulation of elemental sulfur in oil-bearing formations, such as salt domes, where it can be mined using the Frasch process Electric power stations burning coal with flue gas desulfurization produce large quantities of gypsum as a byproduct from the scrubbers.\nOrbital pictures from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have indicated the existence of gypsum dunes in the northern polar region of Mars, which were later confirmed at ground level by the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) \"Opportunity\".\nMining.\nCommercial quantities of gypsum are found in the cities of Araripina and Graja\u00fa in Brazil; in Pakistan, Jamaica, Iran (world's second largest producer), Thailand, Spain (the main producer in Europe), Germany, Italy, England, Ireland, Canada and the United States. Large open pit quarries are located in many places including Fort Dodge, Iowa, which sits on one of the largest deposits of gypsum in the world, and Plaster City, California, United States, and East Kutai, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Several small mines also exist in places such as Kalannie in Western Australia, where gypsum is sold to private buyers for additions of calcium and sulfur as well as reduction of aluminium toxicities on soil for agricultural purposes.\nCrystals of gypsum up to long have been found in the caves of the Naica Mine of Chihuahua, Mexico. The crystals thrived in the cave's extremely rare and stable natural environment. Temperatures stayed at , and the cave was filled with mineral-rich water that drove the crystals' growth. The largest of those crystals weighs and is around 500,000 years old.\nSynthesis.\nSynthetic gypsum is produced as a waste product or by-product in a range of industrial processes.\nDesulfurization.\nFlue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG) is recovered at some coal-fired power plants. The main contaminants are Mg, K, Cl, F, B, Al, Fe, Si, and Se. They come both from the limestone used in desulfurization and from the coal burned. This product is pure enough to replace natural gypsum in a wide variety of fields including drywalls, water treatment, and cement set retarder. Improvements in flue gas desulfurization have greatly reduced the amount of toxic elements present.\nDesalination.\nGypsum precipitates onto brackish water membranes, a phenomenon known as mineral salt scaling, such as during brackish water desalination of water with high concentrations of calcium and sulfate. Scaling decreases membrane life and productivity. This is one of the main obstacles in brackish water membrane desalination processes, such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration. Other forms of scaling, such as calcite scaling, depending on the water source, can also be important considerations in distillation, as well as in heat exchangers, where either the salt solubility or concentration can change rapidly.\nA new study has suggested that the formation of gypsum starts as tiny crystals of a mineral called bassanite (2CaSO4\u00b7H2O). This process occurs via a three-stage pathway: \nRefinery waste.\nThe production of phosphate fertilizers requires breaking down calcium-containing phosphate rock with acid, producing calcium sulfate waste known as phosphogypsum (PG). This form of gypsum is contaminated by impurities found in the rock, namely fluoride, silica, radioactive elements such as radium, and heavy metal elements such as cadmium. Similarly, production of titanium dioxide produces titanium gypsum (TG) due to neutralization of excess acid with lime. The product is contaminated with silica, fluorides, organic matters, and alkalis.\nImpurities in refinery gypsum waste have, in many cases, prevented them from being used as normal gypsum in fields such as construction. As a result, waste gypsum is stored in stacks indefinitely, with significant risk of leaching their contaminants into water and soil. To reduce the accumulation and ultimately clear out these stacks, research is underway to find more applications for such waste products.\nOccupational safety.\nPeople can be exposed to gypsum in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, and eye contact. Calcium sulfate \"per se\" is nontoxic and is even approved as a food additive, but as powdered gypsum, it can irritate skin and mucous membranes.\nUnited States.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for gypsum exposure in the workplace as TWA 15\u00a0mg/m3 for total exposure and TWA 5\u00a0mg/m3 for respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 10\u00a0mg/m3 for total exposure and TWA 5\u00a0mg/m3 for respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday.\nUses.\nGypsum is used in a wide variety of applications:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to which he contributed much notation, for instance, notations of set operations. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin. He also created an international auxiliary language, Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflections\"), which is a simplified version of Classical Latin. Most of his books and papers are in Latino sine flexione, while others are in Italian.\nBiography.\nPeano was born and raised on a farm at Spinetta, a hamlet now belonging to Cuneo, Piedmont, Italy. He attended the Liceo classico Cavour in Turin, and enrolled at the University of Turin in 1876, graduating in 1880 with high honours, after which the University employed him to assist first Enrico D'Ovidio, and then Angelo Genocchi, the Chair of calculus. Due to Genocchi's poor health, Peano took over the teaching of calculus course within two years. His first major work, a textbook on calculus entitled \"Calcolo differenziale, e principii di calcolo integrale\", was published in 1884 and was credited to Genocchi. A few years later, Peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic. Here the modern symbols for the union and intersection of sets appeared for the first time.\nPeano joined Freemasonry. It is not known where he was initiated, but on 24 December 1885, he was affiliated as Master in the \"Dante Alighieri\" Masonic Lodge in Turin. Here he knew the Italian socialist and freemason Giovanni Lerda (1853-1927), a close collaborator of Cesare Lombroso.\nIn 1887, Peano married Carola Crosio, the daughter of the Turin-based painter Luigi Crosio, known for painting the \"Refugium Peccatorum Madonna\". In 1886, he began teaching concurrently at the Royal Military Academy, and was promoted to Professor First Class in 1889. In that year he published the Peano axioms, a formal foundation for the collection of natural numbers. The next year, the University of Turin also granted him his full professorship. The Peano curve was published in 1890 as the first example of a space-filling curve which demonstrated that the unit interval and the unit square have the same cardinality. Today it is understood to be an early example of what is known as a fractal.\nIn 1890 Peano founded the journal \"Rivista di Matematica\", which published its first issue in January 1891. In 1891 Peano started the Formulario Project. It was to be an \"Encyclopedia of Mathematics\", containing all known formulae and theorems of mathematical science using a standard notation invented by Peano. In 1897, the first International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Z\u00fcrich. Peano was a key participant, presenting a paper on mathematical logic. He also started to become increasingly occupied with \"Formulario\" to the detriment of his other work.\nIn 1898 he presented a note to the Academy about binary numeration and its ability to be used to represent the sounds of languages. He also became so frustrated with publishing delays (due to his demand that formulae be printed on one line) that he purchased a printing press.\nParis was the venue for the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900. The conference was preceded by the First International Conference of Philosophy where Peano was a member of the patronage committee. He presented a paper which posed the question of correctly formed definitions in mathematics, \"i.e.\" \"how do you define a definition?\". This became one of Peano's main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference, Peano met Bertrand Russell and gave him a copy of \"Formulario\". Russell was struck by Peano's innovative logical symbols and after the conference, he retired to the country \"to study quietly every word written by him or his disciples\".\nPeano's students Mario Pieri and Alessandro Padoa also had papers presented at the philosophy congress. For the mathematical congress, Peano did not speak, but Padoa's memorable presentation has been frequently recalled. A resolution calling for the formation of an \"international auxiliary language\" to facilitate the spread of mathematical (and commercial) ideas, was proposed; Peano fully supported it.\nBy 1901, Peano was at the peak of his mathematical career. He had made advances in the areas of analysis, foundations and logic, made many contributions to the teaching of calculus and also contributed to the fields of differential equations and vector analysis. Peano played a key role in the axiomatization of mathematics and was a leading pioneer in the development of mathematical logic. Peano had by this stage become heavily involved with the \"Formulario\" project and his teaching began to suffer. In fact, he became so determined to teach his new mathematical symbols that the calculus in his course was neglected. As a result, he was dismissed from the Royal Military Academy but retained his post at Turin University.\nIn 1903 Peano announced his work on an international auxiliary language called \"Latino sine flexione\" (\"Latin without inflexion,\" later called Interlingua, and the precursor of the Interlingua of the IALA). This was an important project for him (along with finding contributors for 'Formulario'). The idea was to use Latin vocabulary, since this was widely known, but simplify the grammar as much as possible and remove all irregular and anomalous forms to make it easier to learn. On 3 January 1908, he read a paper to the \"Academia delle Scienze di Torino\" in which he started speaking in Latin and, as he described each simplification, introduced it into his speech so that by the end he was talking in his new language.\nThe year 1908 was important for Peano. The fifth and final edition of the \"Formulario\" project, titled \"Formulario mathematico\", was published. It contained 4200 formulae and theorems, all completely stated and most of them proved. The book received little attention since much of the content was dated by this time. However, it remains a significant contribution to mathematical literature. The comments and examples were written in \"Latino sine flexione\".\nAlso in 1908, Peano took over the chair of higher analysis at Turin (this appointment was to last for only two years). He was elected the director of \"Academia pro Interlingua\". Having previously created Idiom Neutral, the Academy effectively chose to abandon it in favour of Peano's Latino sine flexione.\nAfter his mother died in 1910, Peano divided his time between teaching, working on texts aimed for secondary schooling including a dictionary of mathematics, and developing and promoting his and other auxiliary languages, becoming a revered member of the international auxiliary language movement. He used his membership of the \"Accademia dei Lincei\" to present papers written by friends and colleagues who were not members (the Accademia recorded and published all presented papers given in sessions).\nDuring the years 1913\u20131918, Peano published several papers that dealt with the remainder term for various numerical quadrature formulas, and introduced the Peano kernel.\nIn 1925 Peano switched Chairs unofficially from Infinitesimal Calculus to Complementary Mathematics, a field which better suited his current style of mathematics. This move became official in 1931. Giuseppe Peano continued teaching at Turin University until the day before he died when he suffered a fatal heart attack.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the United Kingdom, the use of both lemon and lime together is known as an \"Evans\". Although the origins of the use of lemons are unknown, their use dates back at least as far as the late 1930s. The use of lemon or lime is a debated issue \u2013 some leading brands, such as Gordon's, Tanqueray, and Bombay Sapphire, recommend the use of lime in their gin.\nThe use of a balloon glass for serving gin has become popular, possibly through promotion by the Bombay Sapphire gin brand. The use of such a glass, with plenty of ice and a garnish tailored to the flavours of the gin, is sometimes said to allow the aromas of the drink to gather at its opening for the drinker to more easily appreciate.\nThe use of assorted fruits, herbs, and vegetables, as garnish (reflecting the botanicals of the individual gin), is increasingly popular. Besides the classic lime wheel or wedge, alternative garnishes can include orange peel, star anise, thyme, elderflower, a slice of ginger, pink grapefruit, rosemary, cucumber, mint, black peppercorns, strawberry and basil, strawberry syrup, or chillies. Fruits such as kumquats or other citrus or cucumber can be included.\nHistory.\nThe cocktail was created by British military officers in India during the 19th century. In India and other tropical regions, malaria was a persistent problem for Europeans, and during the 18th century the Scottish doctor George Cleghorn studied how quinine, a traditional cure for malaria, could be used to prevent the disease. Finding its bitter taste to be unpleasant, as early as 1825 British officers stationed in India took to adding quinine to a mixture of water, sugar, lime and gin in order to make the cure more palatable, thus creating the cocktail. The officers were already given a gin ration as part of their rations, and the sweet concoction made sense. Since it is no longer used as an antimalarial, tonic water today contains much less quinine, is usually sweetened, and is consequently much less bitter.\nA 2004 study found that after 12 hours, \"considerable quantities (500 to 1,000\u00a0ml) of tonic water may, for a short period of time, lead to quinine plasma levels at the lower limit of therapeutic efficacy and may, in fact, cause transitory suppression of parasites\". This method of consumption of quinine was impractical for malaria prophylaxis, as the amount of drug needed \"cannot be maintained with even large amounts of tonic\". The authors concluded that it is not an effective form of treatment for malaria.\nVariations.\nMixers can include lime juice, lemon juice, orange juice and spiced simple syrup, grenadine, tea, etc.\nA gin and tonic can also be mixed with a sorbet.\nSome gin-and-tonic inspired drinks also have champagne (e.g., the Parisian), vermouth and Campari (e.g. the Negroni Sbagliato), vermouth and bitters (e.g., the Posh G&amp;T), super smokey whiskey (e.g., the Ol' Smokey), peach liqueur and grapefruit bitters (e.g., the Tonic Delight), mint bitters, and chocolate liqueur (e.g., the Guilty Pleasure), etc.\nIn popular culture.\nIn \"Top Gear\" and\" The Grand Tour\", Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond were known to be quite fond of the drink, and drank them on camera a number of times, in one case causing controversy when Jeremy Clarkson appeared to drink one whilst behind the wheel of a car driving to the North Pole.\nJames Bond specifies a recipe for a gin and tonic while in Kingston, Jamaica, in the book \"Dr. No\". Unusually, it involves the juice of a whole lime.\nIn the BBC1 and Amazon Prime television series \"Fleabag\", Fleabag and the Priest enjoy canned G&amp;Ts from Marks and Spencer. The store reported a 24% increase in sales after the episodes aired.\nFounded in 2010, International Gin &amp; Tonic Day is celebrated worldwide on 19 October.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

It was defined in Joseph Gwilt's \"Architecture\" (1859) as \"a piece of steel of a semi-cylindrical form, hollow on one side, having a cross handle at one end and a worm or screw at the other\".\nA gimlet is always a small tool. A similar tool of larger size is called an auger. The cutting action of the gimlet is slightly different from an auger and the initial hole it makes is smaller; the cutting edges pare away the wood, which is moved out by the spiral sides, falling out through the entry hole. This also pulls the gimlet further into the hole as it is turned. Unlike a bradawl, pressure is not required once the tip has been drawn in.\nThe name \"gimlet\" comes from the Old French , , later , probably a diminutive of the Anglo-French , a variation of \"guimble\", from the Middle Low German (cf. the Scandinavian , 'to bore or twist'). Modern French uses the term , also the French for \"tendril\".\nUse as a metaphor.\nThe term is also used figuratively to describe something as sharp or piercing, along with describing the twisting, boring motion of using a gimlet. For example, the gimlet cocktail may be named after the tool. The term \"gimlet-eyed\" can mean sharp-eyed or squint-eyed. One example of this use is Major General Smedley Darlington Butler, who was known as \"Old Gimlet Eye\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The geometric mean of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; numbers is the nth root of their product, i.e., for a collection of numbers \"a\"1, \"a\"2, ..., \"an\", the geometric mean is defined as\nformula_1\nWhen the collection of numbers and their geometric mean are plotted in logarithmic scale, the geometric mean is transformed into an arithmetic mean, so the geometric mean can equivalently be calculated by taking the natural logarithm &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; of each number, finding the arithmetic mean of the logarithms, and then returning the result to linear scale using the exponential function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;,\nformula_2\nThe geometric mean of two numbers is the square root of their product, for example with numbers &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; the geometric mean is formula_3 The geometric mean of the three numbers is the cube root of their product, for example with numbers &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the geometric mean is formula_4\nThe geometric mean is useful whenever the quantities to be averaged combine multiplicatively, such as population growth rates or interest rates of a financial investment. Suppose for example a person invests $1000 and achieves annual returns of +10%, \u221212%, +90%, \u221230% and +25%, giving a final value of $1609. The average percentage growth is the geometric mean of the annual growth ratios (1.10, 0.88, 1.90, 0.70, 1.25), namely 1.0998, an annual average growth of 9.98%. The arithmetic mean of these annual returns is 16.6% per annum, which is not a meaningful average because growth rates do not combine additively.\nThe geometric mean can be understood in terms of geometry. The geometric mean of two numbers, formula_5 and formula_6, is the length of one side of a square whose area is equal to the area of a rectangle with sides of lengths formula_5 and formula_6. Similarly, the geometric mean of three numbers, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_11, is the length of one edge of a cube whose volume is the same as that of a cuboid with sides whose lengths are equal to the three given numbers.\nThe geometric mean is one of the three classical Pythagorean means, together with the arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean. For all positive data sets containing at least one pair of unequal values, the harmonic mean is always the least of the three means, while the arithmetic mean is always the greatest of the three and the geometric mean is always in between (see Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.)\nFormulation.\nThe geometric mean of a data set formula_12 is given by:\nformula_13\nThat is, the \"n\"th root of the product of the elements. For example, for formula_14, the product formula_15 is formula_16, and the geometric mean is the fourth root of 24, approximately 2.213. \nFormulation using logarithms.\nThe geometric mean can also be expressed as the exponential of the arithmetic mean of logarithms. By using logarithmic identities to transform the formula, the multiplications can be expressed as a sum and the power as a multiplication:\nWhen formula_17\n formula_18 \nsince formula_19 \nThis is sometimes called the log-average (not to be confused with the logarithmic average). It is simply the arithmetic mean of the logarithm-transformed values of formula_20 (i.e., the arithmetic mean on the log scale), using the exponentiation to return to the original scale, i.e., it is the generalized f-mean with formula_21. A logarithm of any base can be used in place of the natural logarithm. For example, the geometric mean of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can be calculated using logarithms base 2:\nformula_22\nRelated to the above, it can be seen that for a given sample of points formula_23, the geometric mean is the minimizer of \nformula_24, \nwhereas the arithmetic mean is the minimizer of \nformula_25. \nThus, the geometric mean provides a summary of the samples whose exponent best matches the exponents of the samples (in the least squares sense).\nIn computer implementations, na\u00efvely multiplying many numbers together can cause arithmetic overflow or underflow. Calculating the geometric mean using logarithms is one way to avoid this problem.\nRelated concepts.\nIterative means.\nThe geometric mean of a data set is less than the data set's arithmetic mean unless all members of the data set are equal, in which case the geometric and arithmetic means are equal. This allows the definition of the arithmetic-geometric mean, an intersection of the two which always lies in between.\nThe geometric mean is also the arithmetic-harmonic mean in the sense that if two sequences (formula_26) and (formula_27) are defined:\nformula_28\nand\nformula_29\nwhere formula_30 is the harmonic mean of the previous values of the two sequences, then formula_26 and formula_27 will converge to the geometric mean of formula_33 and formula_34. The sequences converge to a common limit, and the geometric mean is preserved:\nformula_35\nReplacing the arithmetic and harmonic mean by a pair of generalized means of opposite, finite exponents yields the same result.\nComparison to arithmetic mean.\nThe geometric mean of a non-empty data set of positive numbers is always at most their arithmetic mean. Equality is only obtained when all numbers in the data set are equal; otherwise, the geometric mean is smaller. For example, the geometric mean of 2 and 3 is 2.45, while their arithmetic mean is 2.5. In particular, this means that when a set of non-identical numbers is subjected to a mean-preserving spread \u2014 that is, the elements of the set are \"spread apart\" more from each other while leaving the arithmetic mean unchanged \u2014 their geometric mean decreases.\nGeometric mean of a continuous function.\nIf formula_36 is a positive continuous real-valued function, its geometric mean over this interval is\nformula_37\nFor instance, taking the identity function formula_38 over the unit interval shows that the geometric mean of the positive numbers between 0 and 1 is equal to formula_39.\nApplications.\nAverage proportional growth rate.\nThe geometric mean is more appropriate than the arithmetic mean for describing proportional growth, both exponential growth (constant proportional growth) and varying growth; in business the geometric mean of growth rates is known as the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The geometric mean of growth over periods yields the equivalent constant growth rate that would yield the same final amount.\nAs an example, suppose an orange tree yields 100 oranges one year and then 180, 210 and 300 the following years, for growth rates of 80%, 16.7% and 42.9% respectively. Using the arithmetic mean calculates a (linear) average growth of 46.5% (calculated by formula_40). However, when applied to the 100 orange starting yield, 46.5% annual growth results in 314 oranges after three years of growth, rather than the observed 300. The linear average overstates the rate of growth.\nInstead, using the geometric mean, the average yearly growth is approximately 44.2% (calculated by formula_41). Starting from a 100 orange yield with annual growth of 44.2% gives the expected 300 orange yield after three years.\nIn order to determine the average growth rate, it is not necessary to take the product of the measured growth rates at every step. Let the quantity be given as the sequence formula_42, where formula_43 is the number of steps from the initial to final state. The growth rate between successive measurements formula_44 and formula_45 is formula_46. The geometric mean of these growth rates is then just:\nformula_47\nNormalized values.\nThe fundamental property of the geometric mean, which does not hold for any other mean, is that for two sequences formula_48 and formula_49 of equal length,\n formula_50.\nThis makes the geometric mean the only correct mean when averaging \"normalized\" results; that is, results that are presented as ratios to reference values. This is the case when presenting computer performance with respect to a reference computer, or when computing a single average index from several heterogeneous sources (for example, life expectancy, education years, and infant mortality). In this scenario, using the arithmetic or harmonic mean would change the ranking of the results depending on what is used as a reference. For example, take the following comparison of execution time of computer programs:\nTable 1\nThe arithmetic and geometric means \"agree\" that computer C is the fastest. However, by presenting appropriately normalized values \"and\" using the arithmetic mean, we can show either of the other two computers to be the fastest. Normalizing by A's result gives A as the fastest computer according to the arithmetic mean:\nTable 2\nwhile normalizing by B's result gives B as the fastest computer according to the arithmetic mean but A as the fastest according to the harmonic mean:\nTable 3\nand normalizing by C's result gives C as the fastest computer according to the arithmetic mean but A as the fastest according to the harmonic mean:\nTable 4\nIn all cases, the ranking given by the geometric mean stays the same as the one obtained with unnormalized values.\nHowever, this reasoning has been questioned.\nGiving consistent results is not always equal to giving the correct results. In general, it is more rigorous to assign weights to each of the programs, calculate the average weighted execution time (using the arithmetic mean), and then normalize that result to one of the computers. The three tables above just give a different weight to each of the programs, explaining the inconsistent results of the arithmetic and harmonic means (Table 4 gives equal weight to both programs, the Table 2 gives a weight of 1/1000 to the second program, and the Table 3 gives a weight of 1/100 to the second program and 1/10 to the first one). The use of the geometric mean for aggregating performance numbers should be avoided if possible, because multiplying execution times has no physical meaning, in contrast to adding times as in the arithmetic mean. Metrics that are inversely proportional to time (speedup, IPC) should be averaged using the harmonic mean.\nThe geometric mean can be derived from the generalized mean as its limit as formula_51 goes to zero. Similarly, this is possible for the weighted geometric mean.\nFinancial.\nThe geometric mean has from time to time been used to calculate financial indices (the averaging is over the components of the index). For example, in the past the FT 30 index used a geometric mean. It is also used in the CPI calculation and recently introduced \"RPIJ\" measure of inflation in the United Kingdom and in the European Union.\nThis has the effect of understating movements in the index compared to using the arithmetic mean.\nApplications in the social sciences.\nAlthough the geometric mean has been relatively rare in computing social statistics, starting from 2010 the United Nations Human Development Index did switch to this mode of calculation, on the grounds that it better reflected the non-substitutable nature of the statistics being compiled and compared:\n The geometric mean decreases the level of substitutability between dimensions [being compared] and at the same time ensures that a 1 percent decline in say life expectancy at birth has the same impact on the HDI as a 1 percent decline in education or income. Thus, as a basis for comparisons of achievements, this method is also more respectful of the intrinsic differences across the dimensions than a simple average.\nNot all values used to compute the HDI (Human Development Index) are normalized; some of them instead have the form formula_52. This makes the choice of the geometric mean less obvious than one would expect from the \"Properties\" section above.\nThe equally distributed welfare equivalent income associated with an Atkinson Index with an inequality aversion parameter of 1.0 is simply the geometric mean of incomes. For values other than one, the equivalent value is an Lp norm divided by the number of elements, with p equal to one minus the inequality aversion parameter.\nGeometry.\nIn the case of a right triangle, its altitude is the length of a line extending perpendicularly from the hypotenuse to its 90\u00b0 vertex. Imagining that this line splits the hypotenuse into two segments, the geometric mean of these segment lengths is the length of the altitude. This property is known as the geometric mean theorem.\nIn an ellipse, the semi-minor axis is the geometric mean of the maximum and minimum distances of the ellipse from a focus; it is also the geometric mean of the semi-major axis and the semi-latus rectum. The semi-major axis of an ellipse is the geometric mean of the distance from the center to either focus and the distance from the center to either directrix.\nAnother way to think about it is as follows:\nConsider a circle with radius formula_53. Now take two diametrically opposite points on the circle and apply pressure from both ends to deform it into an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axes of lengths formula_5 and formula_6.\nSince the area of the circle and the ellipse stays the same, we have:\n formula_56\nThe radius of the circle is the geometric mean of the semi-major and the semi-minor axes of the ellipse formed by deforming the circle.\nDistance to the horizon of a sphere (ignoring the effect of atmospheric refraction when atmosphere is present) is equal to the geometric mean of the distance to the closest point of the sphere and the distance to the farthest point of the sphere.\nThe geometric mean is used in both in the approximation of squaring the circle by S.A. Ramanujan and in the construction of the heptadecagon with \"mean proportionals\".\nAspect ratios.\nThe geometric mean has been used in choosing a compromise aspect ratio in film and video: given two aspect ratios, the geometric mean of them provides a compromise between them, distorting or cropping both in some sense equally. Concretely, two equal area rectangles (with the same center and parallel sides) of different aspect ratios intersect in a rectangle whose aspect ratio is the geometric mean, and their hull (smallest rectangle which contains both of them) likewise has the aspect ratio of their geometric mean.\nIn aspect ratio by the SMPTE, balancing 2.35 and 4:3, the geometric mean is formula_57, and thus formula_58... was chosen. This was discovered empirically by Kerns Powers, who cut out rectangles with equal areas and shaped them to match each of the popular aspect ratios. When overlapped with their center points aligned, he found that all of those aspect ratio rectangles fit within an outer rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1.77:1 and all of them also covered a smaller common inner rectangle with the same aspect ratio 1.77:1. The value found by Powers is exactly the geometric mean of the extreme aspect ratios, (1.33:1) and CinemaScope(2.35:1), which is coincidentally close to formula_59 (formula_60). The intermediate ratios have no effect on the result, only the two extreme ratios.\nApplying the same geometric mean technique to 16:9 and 4:3 approximately yields the (formula_61...) aspect ratio, which is likewise used as a compromise between these ratios. In this case 14:9 is exactly the \"arithmetic mean\" of formula_59 and formula_63, since 14 is the average of 16 and 12, while the precise \"geometric mean\" is formula_64 but the two different \"means\", arithmetic and geometric, are approximately equal because both numbers are sufficiently close to each other (a difference of less than 2%).\nPaper formats.\nThe geometric mean is also used to calculate B and C series paper formats. The formula_65 format has an area which is the geometric mean of the areas of formula_66 and formula_67. For example, the area of a B1 paper is formula_68, because it is the geometric mean of the areas of an A0 (formula_69) and an A1 (formula_70) paper \u200b\nThe same principle applies with the C series, whose area is the geometric mean of the A and B series. For example, the C4 format has an area which is the geometric mean of the areas of A4 and B4.\nAn advantage that comes from this relationship is that an A4 paper fits inside a C4 envelope, and both fit inside a B4 envelope.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She wrote seven novels: \"Adam Bede\" (1859), \"The Mill on the Floss\" (1860), \"Silas Marner\" (1861), \"Romola\" (1862\u20131863), \"Felix Holt, the Radical\" (1866), \"Middlemarch\" (1871\u20131872) and \"Daniel Deronda\" (1876). Like Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy, she emerged from provincial England; most of her works are set there. Her works are known for their realism, psychological insight, sense of place, and detailed depiction of the countryside. \"Middlemarch\" was described by the novelist Virginia Woolf as \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\" and by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language.\nScandalously and unconventionally for the era, she lived with the married George Henry Lewes as his conjugal partner, from 1854 to 1878, and called him her husband. He remained married to his wife, Agnes Jervis, and supported their children, even after Jervis left him to live with another man and have children with him. In May 1880, 18 months after Lewes's death, Eliot married her longtime friend John Cross, a man much younger than her, and changed her name to Mary Ann Cross.\nLife.\nEarly life and education.\nMary Ann Evans was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, at South Farm on the Arbury Hall estate. She was the third child of Robert Evans (1773\u20131849), manager of the Arbury Hall estate, and Christiana Evans (\"n\u00e9e\" Pearson, 1788\u20131836), daughter of a local mill-owner. Her full siblings were: Christiana, known as Chrissey (1814\u20131859), Isaac (1816\u20131890), and twin brothers who died a few days after birth in March 1821. She also had a half-brother, Robert Evans (1802\u20131864), and half-sister, Frances \"Fanny\" Evans Houghton (1805\u20131882), from her father's previous marriage to Harriet Poynton (1780\u20131809). In early 1820, the family moved to a house named Griff House, between Nuneaton and Bedworth.\nThe young Evans was a voracious reader and obviously intelligent. Because she was not considered physically beautiful, Evans was not thought to have much chance of marriage, and this, coupled with her intelligence, led her father to invest in an education not often afforded to women. From ages five to nine, she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Latham's school in Attleborough, from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallington's school in Nuneaton, and from ages thirteen to sixteen at Miss Franklin's school in Coventry. At Mrs. Wallington's school, she was taught by the evangelical Maria Lewis\u2014to whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Misses Franklin's school, Evans was exposed to a quiet, disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism.\nAfter age sixteen, Evans had little formal education. Thanks to her father's important role on the estate, she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall, which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that \"George Eliot's novels draw heavily on Greek literature (only one of her books can be printed correctly without the use of a Greek typeface), and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy\". Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate, and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a low church Anglican family, but at that time the Midlands was an area with a growing number of religious dissenters.\nMove to Coventry.\nIn 1836, her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, though she continued to correspond with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to Foleshill near Coventry. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. Charles Bray had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the radical, free-thinking Brays, who had a casual view of marital obligations and the Brays' \"Rosehill\" home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays' house included Robert Owen, Herbert Spencer, Harriet Martineau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal and agnostic theologies and to writers such as David Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach, who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical texts. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss's \"\" as \"The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined\" (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by Elizabeth \"Rufa\" Brabant, another member of the \"Rosehill Circle\".\nThe Strauss book had caused a sensation in Germany by arguing that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical additions with little basis in fact. Evans's translation had a similar effect in England, with the Earl of Shaftesbury calling her translation \"the most pestilential book ever vomited out of the jaws of hell.\" Later she translated Feuerbach's \"The Essence of Christianity\" (1854). The ideas in these books would have an effect on her own fiction.\nAs a product of their friendship, Bray published some of Evans's own earliest writing, such as reviews, in his newspaper the \"Coventry Herald and Observer\". As Evans began to question her own religious faith, her father threatened to throw her out of the house, but his threat was not carried out. Instead, she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849, when she was 30. Five days after her father's funeral, she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in Geneva alone, living first on the lake at Plongeon (near the present-day United Nations buildings) and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends Fran\u00e7ois and Juliet d'Albert Durade on the rue de Chanoines (now the rue de la Pelisserie). She commented happily that \"one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree\". Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there, she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside, which was a great inspiration to her. Fran\u00e7ois Durade painted her portrait there as well.\nMove to London and editorship of the \"Westminster Review\".\nOn her return to England the following year (1850), she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer, and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans. She stayed at the house of John Chapman, the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. She then joined Chapman's \"m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois\" along with his wife and mistress. Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning, left-wing journal \"The Westminster Review\". Evans became its assistant editor in 1851 after joining just a year earlier. Evans's writings for the paper were comments on her views of society and the Victorian way of thinking. She was sympathetic to the lower classes and criticised organised religion throughout her articles and reviews and commented on contemporary ideas of the time. Much of this was drawn from her own experiences and knowledge and she used this to critique other ideas and organisations. This led to her writing being viewed as authentic and wise but not too obviously opinionated. Evans also focused on the business side of the Review with attempts to change its layout and design. Although Chapman was officially the editor, it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal, contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the \"Review\" in the first half of 1854. Eliot sympathized with the 1848 Revolutions throughout continental Europe, and even hoped that the Italians would chase the \"odious Austrians\" out of Lombardy and that \"decayed monarchs\" would be pensioned off, although she believed a gradual reformist approach to social problems was best for England.\nIn 1850\u201351, Evans attended classes in mathematics at the Ladies College in Bedford Square, later known as Bedford College, London.\nRelationship with George Henry Lewes.\nThe philosopher and critic George Henry Lewes (1817\u20131878) met Evans in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis, although in an open marriage. In addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by Thornton Leigh Hunt. In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to Weimar and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany, Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbach's \"The Essence of Christianity\", and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of Baruch Spinoza's \"Ethics\", which she completed in 1856, but which was not published in her lifetime because the prospective publisher refused to pay the requested \u00a375. In 1981, Eliot's translation of Spinoza's \"Ethics\" was finally published by Thomas Deegan, and was determined to be in the public domain in 2018 and published by the \"George Eliot Archive\". It has been re-published in 2020 by Princeton University Press.\nThe trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes, who subsequently considered themselves married. Evans began to refer to Lewes as her husband and to sign her name as Mary Ann Evans Lewes, legally changing her name to Mary Ann Evans Lewes after his death. The refusal to conceal the relationship was contrary to the social conventions of the time, and attracted considerable disapproval.\nCareer in fiction.\nWhile continuing to contribute pieces to the \"Westminster Review\", Evans resolved to become a novelist, and set out a pertinent manifesto in one of her last essays for the \"Review\", \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\" (1856). The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction written by women. In other essays, she praised the realism of novels that were being written in Europe at the time, an emphasis on realistic storytelling confirmed in her own subsequent fiction. She also adopted a nom-de-plume, George Eliot; as she explained to her biographer J. W. Cross, George was Lewes's forename, and Eliot was \"a good mouth-filling, easily pronounced word\". Although female authors were published under their own names during her lifetime, she wanted to escape the stereotype of women's writing being limited to lighthearted romances or other lighter fare not to be taken very seriously. She also wanted to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as a translator, editor, and critic. Another factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny, thus avoiding the scandal that would have arisen because of her relationship with Lewes, who was married.\nIn 1857, when she was 37 years of age, \"The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton\", the first of the three stories included in \"Scenes of Clerical Life\", and the first work of \"George Eliot\", was published in \"Blackwood's Magazine\". \"The Scenes\" (published as a 2-volume book in 1858) was well received, and was widely believed to have been written by a country parson, or perhaps the wife of a parson.\nEliot was profoundly influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle. As early as 1841, she referred to him as \"a grand favourite of mine\", and references to him abound in her letters from the 1840s and 1850s. According to University of Victoria professor Lisa Surridge, Carlyle \"stimulated Eliot's interest in German thought, encouraged her turn from Christian orthodoxy, and shaped her ideas on work, duty, sympathy, and the evolution of the self.\" These themes made their way into Evans's first complete novel, \"Adam Bede\" (1859). It was an instant success, and prompted yet more intense curiosity as to the author's identity: there was even a pretender to the authorship, one Joseph Liggins. This public interest subsequently led to Mary Anne Evans Lewes's acknowledgment that it was she who stood behind the pseudonym George Eliot. \"Adam Bede\" is known for embracing a realist aesthetic inspired by Dutch visual art.\nThe revelations about Eliot's private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers, but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Her relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she needed to write fiction, but it would be some time before the couple were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to Princess Louise, the daughter of Queen Victoria. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of Eliot's novels and was so impressed with \"Adam Bede\" that she commissioned the artist Edward Henry Corbould to paint scenes from the book.\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Eliot expressed sympathy for the Union cause, something which historians have attributed to her abolitionist sympathies. In 1868, she supported philosopher Richard Congreve's protests against governmental policies in Ireland and had a positive view of the growing movement in support of Irish home rule.\nShe was influenced by the writings of John Stuart Mill and read all of his major works as they were published. In Mill's \"The Subjection of Women\" (1869) she judged the second chapter excoriating the laws which oppress married women \"excellent.\" She was supportive of Mill's parliamentary run, but believed that the electorate was unlikely to vote for a philosopher and was surprised when he won. While Mill served in parliament, she expressed her agreement with his efforts on behalf of female suffrage, being \"inclined to hope for much good from the serious presentation of women's claims before Parliament.\" In a letter to John Morley, she declared her support for plans \"which held out reasonable promise of tending to establish as far as possible an equivalence of advantage for the two sexes, as to education and the possibilities of free development\", and dismissed appeals to nature in explaining women's lower status. In 1870, she responded enthusiastically to Lady Amberley's feminist lecture on the claims of women for education, occupations, equality in marriage, and child custody. It would be wrong to assume that the female protagonists of her works can be considered \"feminist\", with the sole exception perhaps of Romola de' Bardi, who resolutely rejects the State and Church obligations of her time.\nAfter the success of \"Adam Bede\", Eliot continued to write popular novels for the next fifteen years. Within a year of completing \"Adam Bede\", she finished \"The Mill on the Floss\", dedicating the manuscript: \"To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third book, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge, South Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21 March 1860.\" \"Silas Marner\" (1861) and \"Romola\" (1863) soon followed, and later \"Felix Holt, the Radical\" (1866) and her most acclaimed novel, \"Middlemarch\" (1871\u20131872). Her last novel was \"Daniel Deronda\", published in 1876, after which she and Lewes moved to Witley, Surrey. By this time Lewes's health was failing, and he died two years later, on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next six months editing Lewes's final work, \"Life and Mind\", for publication, and found solace and companionship with longtime friend and financial adviser John Walter Cross, a Scottish commission agent 20 years her junior, whose mother had recently died.\nMarriage to John Cross and death.\nOn 16 May 1880, eighteen months after Lewes' death, Eliot married John Walter Cross (1840\u20131924) and again changed her name, this time to Mary Ann Cross. While the marriage courted some controversy due to the 21 year age differences, it pleased her brother Isaac that she was married in this relationship. He had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes, and now sent congratulations. While the couple were honeymooning in Venice, Cross, in a suicide attempt, jumped from the hotel balcony into the Grand Canal. He survived, and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea, but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection. This, coupled with the kidney disease with which she had been afflicted for several years, led to her death on 22 December 1880 at the age of 61.\nDue to her denial of the Christian faith and her relationship with Lewes, Eliot was not buried in Westminster Abbey. She was instead interred in Highgate Cemetery (East), Highgate, London, in the area reserved for political and religious dissenters and agnostics, beside the love of her life, George Henry Lewes. The graves of Karl Marx and her friend Herbert Spencer are nearby. In 1980, on the centenary of her death, a memorial stone was established for her in the Poets' Corner between W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas, with a quote from \"Scenes of Clerical Life\": \"The first condition of human goodness is something to love; the second something to reverence\".\nPersonal appearance.\nGeorge Eliot was considered by contemporaries to be physically unattractive; she herself knew this and made jokes about her appearance in letters to friends. Despite this, numerous acquaintances found that the force of her personality overcame their impression of her appearance. Of his first meeting with her on 9 May 1869, Henry James wrote:\n... To begin with she is magnificently ugly \u2014 deliciously hideous. She has a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth, full of uneven teeth &amp; a chin &amp; jawbone \"qui n'en finissent pas\" [\"which never end\"] ... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes steals forth &amp; charms the mind, so that you end as I ended, in falling in love with her.\nSpelling of her name.\nShe spelled her name differently at different times. Mary Anne was the spelling used by her father for the baptismal record and she uses this spelling in her earliest letters. Within her family, however, it was spelled Mary Ann. By 1852, she had changed to Marian, but she reverted to Mary Ann in 1880 after she married John Cross. Her memorial stone reads &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here lies the body of'George Eliot'Mary Ann Cross\nMemorials and tributes.\nSeveral landmarks in her birthplace of Nuneaton are named in her honour. These include the George Eliot Academy, Middlemarch Junior School, George Eliot Hospital (formerly Nuneaton Emergency Hospital), and George Eliot Road, in Foleshill, Coventry. Also, The Mary Anne Evans Hospice in Nuneaton. A statue of Eliot is in Newdegate Street, Nuneaton, and Nuneaton Museum &amp; Art Gallery has a display of artefacts related to her.\nA tunnel boring machine constructing the Bromford Tunnel on High Speed 2 was named in honour of her.\nIn 2015, a new residence hall was named after Evans at Royal Holloway University of London, successor to Bedford College, which Evans attended in 1850-1.\nLiterary assessment.\nThroughout her career, Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From \"Adam Bede\" to \"The Mill on the Floss\" and \"Silas Marner\", Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. \"Felix Holt, the Radical\" and \"The Legend of Jubal\" were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of \"Middlemarch\", in which she presents the stories of a number of inhabitants of a small English town on the eve of the Reform Bill of 1832; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of John Ruskin's \"Modern Painters\" in \"Westminster Review\" in 1856. Eliot also expresses proto-Zionist ideas in Daniel Deronda.\nReaders in the Victorian era praised her novels for their depictions of rural society. Much of the material for her prose was drawn from her own experience. She shared with Wordsworth the belief that there was much value and beauty to be found in the mundane details of ordinary country life. Eliot did not, however, confine herself to stories of the English countryside. \"Romola\", an historical novel set in late fifteenth century Florence, was based on the life of the Italian priest Girolamo Savonarola. In \"The Spanish Gypsy\", Eliot made a foray into verse, but her poetry's initial popularity has not endured.\nWorking as a translator, Eliot was exposed to German texts of religious, social, and moral philosophy such as David Friedrich Strauss's \"Life of Jesus\" and Feuerbach's \"The Essence of Christianity\"; also important was her translation from Latin of Jewish-Dutch philosopher Spinoza's \"Ethics\". Elements from these works show up in her fiction, much of which is written with her trademark sense of agnostic humanism. According to Clare Carlisle, who published a new biography on George Eliot in 2023, the overdue publication of Spinoza's \"Ethics\" was a real shame, because it could have provided some illuminating cues for understanding the more mature works of the writer. She had taken particular notice of Feuerbach's conception of Christianity, positing that our understanding of the nature of the divine was to be found ultimately in the nature of humanity projected onto a divine figure. An example of this philosophy appeared in her novel \"Romola\", in which Eliot's protagonist displayed a \"surprisingly modern readiness to interpret religious language in humanist or secular ethical terms.\" Though Eliot herself was not religious, she had respect for religious tradition and its ability to maintain a sense of social order and morality. \nThe religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing, with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from \"The Mill on the Floss\" sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans. Eliot also faced a quandary similar to that of Silas Marner, whose alienation from the church simultaneously meant his alienation from society. Because Eliot retained a vestigial respect for religion, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche excoriated her system of morality for figuring sin as a debt that can be expiated through suffering, which he demeaned as characteristic of \"little moralistic females \u00e0 la Eliot.\"\nShe was at her most autobiographical in \"Looking Backwards\", part of her final published work \"Impressions of Theophrastus Such\". By the time of \"Daniel Deronda\", Eliot's sales were falling off, and she had faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the posthumous biography written by her husband, which portrayed a wonderful, almost saintly woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics, most notably by Virginia Woolf, who called \"Middlemarch\" \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\". In 1994, literary critic Harold Bloom placed Eliot among . In a 2007 authors' poll by \"Time\", \"Middlemarch\" was voted the tenth greatest literary work ever written. In 2015, writers from outside the UK voted it first among all British novels \"by a landslide\". The various film and television adaptations of Eliot's books have reintroduced her to the wider reading public.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is now also used by Varnish, a software component used by many content-heavy websites. This has led to many internet users seeing a \"Guru Meditation\" message (or the variant \"Guru Mediation\") when these websites suffer crashes or other issues. It is analogous to the \"Blue Screen of Death\" in Microsoft Windows operating systems, or a kernel panic in Unix. \nIt has also been used as a message for unrecoverable errors in software packages such as VirtualBox and other operating systems (see Legacy section below).\nOrigins.\nThe term \"Guru Meditation Error\" originated as an in-house joke in Amiga's early days. The company had a product called the \"Joyboard\" for the Atari 2600 home video game console, a game controller much like a joystick but operated by the feet, similar to the Wii Balance Board. Early in the development of the Amiga computer operating system, the company's developers became so frustrated with the system's frequent crashes that, as a relaxation technique, a game was developed where a person would sit cross-legged on the Joyboard, resembling an Indian guru. The player tried to remain extremely still; the winner was the player who stayed still the longest. If the player moved too much, a \"guru meditation\" error occurred.\nDescription of \"Guru Meditation\" errors on the Amiga.\nThe alert occurred when there was a fatal problem with the system. If the system had no means of recovery, it could display the alert, even in systems with numerous critical flaws. In extreme cases, the alert could even be displayed if the system's memory was completely exhausted.\nThe text of the alert messages was completely baffling to most users. Only highly technically adept Amiga users would know, for example, that exception 3 was an address error, and meant the program was accessing a word on an unaligned boundary. Users without this specialized knowledge would have no recourse but to look for a \"Guru\" or to simply reboot the machine and hope for the best.\nTechnical description (Amiga).\nWhen a Guru Meditation is displayed, the options are to reboot by pressing the left mouse button, or to invoke ROMWack by pressing the right mouse button or to manually reboot. ROMWack is a minimalist debugger built into the operating system which is accessible by connecting a 9600 baud terminal to the serial port.\nThe alert itself appears as a black rectangular box located in the upper portion of the screen. Its border and text are red for a normal Guru Meditation, or green/yellow for a Recoverable Alert, another kind of Guru Meditation. The screen may go black, but the power LEDs always alternates between full and half-brightness for a few seconds before the alert appears. In AmigaOS 1.x, programmed in ROMs known as Kickstart 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, the errors are always red. In AmigaOS 2.x and 3.x, recoverable alerts are yellow, except for some very early versions of 2.x where they were green.\nDead-end alerts are always red and terminal in all OS versions except in a rare series of events, as in when a deprecated Kickstart (example: 1.1) program conditionally boots from disk on a more advanced Kickstart 3.x ROM Amiga running in compatibility mode (therefore eschewing the on-disk OS) and crashes with a red Guru Meditation but subsequently restores itself by pressing the left mouse button, the newer Kickstart recognizing an inadvised low level chipset call for the older ROM directly poking the hardware, and addressing it.\nThe error is displayed as two fields, separated by a period. The format is codice_1 in case of a CPU error, or codice_2 in case of a system software error. The first field is either the Motorola 68000 exception number that occurred (if a CPU error occurs) or an internal error identifier (such as an \"Out of Memory\" code), in case of a system software error. The second can be the address of a \"Task\" structure, or the address of a memory block whose allocation or deallocation failed. It is never the address of the code that caused the error. If the cause of the crash is uncertain, this number is rendered as codice_3, which stands for \"HELP\" in hexadecimal ASCII characters (48=H, 45=E, 4C=L, 50=P).\nGuru Meditation handler.\nThere was a commercially available error handler for AmigaOS, before version 2.04, called GOMF (Get Outta My Face) made by Hypertek/Silicon Springs Development corp. It was able to deal with many kinds of errors and gave the user a choice to either remove the offending process and associated screen, or allow the machine to show the Guru Meditation. In many cases, removal of the offending process gave one the choice to save one's data and exit running programs before rebooting the system. When the damage was not extensive, one was able to continue using the machine. However, it did not save the user from all errors, as one may have still seen this error occasionally.\nRecoverable Alerts.\nRecoverable Alerts are non-critical crashes in the computer system. In most cases, it is possible to resume work and save files after a Recoverable Alert, while a normal, red Guru Meditation always results in an immediate reboot.\nIt is, however, still recommended to reboot as soon as possible after encountering a Recoverable Alert, because the system may be in an unpredictable state that can cause data corruption.\nSystem software error codes.\nThe first byte specifies the area of the system affected. The top bit will be set if the error is a dead end alert.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13052", "revid": "41011003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13052", "title": "GNU Debugger", "text": "Source-level debugger\nThe GNU Debugger (GDB) is a portable debugger that runs on many Unix-like systems and works for many programming languages, including Ada, Assembly, C, C++, D, Fortran, Haskell, Go, Objective-C, OpenCL C, Modula-2, Pascal, Rust, and partially others. It detects problems in a program while letting it run and allows users to examine different registers.\nHistory.\nGDB was first written by Richard Stallman in 1986 as part of his GNU system, after his GNU Emacs was \"reasonably stable\". GDB is free software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It was modeled after the DBX debugger, which came with Berkeley Unix distributions.\nFrom 1990 to 1993 it was maintained by John Gilmore. Now it is maintained by the GDB Steering Committee which is appointed by the Free Software Foundation.\nTechnical Features.\nGDB offers extensive facilities for tracing, examining and altering the execution of computer programs. The user can monitor and modify the values of programs' internal variables, and even call functions independently of the program's normal behavior.\nSupported Platforms.\nGDB target processors (as of 2003) include: Alpha, ARM, AVR, H8/300, Altera Nios/Nios II, System/370, System 390, x86 and its 64-bit extension x86-64, IA-64 \"Itanium\", Motorola 68000, MIPS, PA-RISC, PowerPC, RISC-V, SuperH, SPARC, and VAX. Lesser-known target processors supported in the standard release have included A29K, ARC, ETRAX CRIS, D10V, D30V, FR-30, FR-V, Intel i960, 68HC11, Motorola 88000, MCORE, MN10200, MN10300, NS32K, Stormy16, and Z8000 (newer releases will likely not support some of these). GDB has compiled-in simulators for even lesser-known target processors such like M32R or V850.\nStepping through code.\nBoth the next \"n and step \"n command can be used to advance execution over the next n statements. If \"n\" is omitted it defaults to 1. The difference between the commands is that step will follow the flow of execution into the internals of any function call whereas next will execute the whole function and proceed to the next statement within the current routine.\nThe jump \"location\" command is used either to skip over a section of problematic code or go back to a previous statement in order to review execution again. The location should be in the same function.\nPrinting Values and Expressions.\nWhen a program is halted in mid execution the print (abbreviated as p) command can be used to display the value of a variable or an expression using C or C++ syntax. The x command (meaning \"examine\") is similar but it's argument is an address in memory including address expressions. Both commands use flags to indicate presentation format of the output though there are some differences as x allows one to specify the number of bytes.\ne.g.:\n print /f myVar #Prints a double precision floating point number \n x /8bx &amp;foo #Print 8 bytes in hex format starting at the memory location of foo \nAdditionally the call command invokes both library and user written functions and the returned value will be displayed.\nValues displayed are automatically assigned to special \"value history\" variables which begin with a $ sign followed by a sequence number which can then be redisplayed using print.\ni.e.: \n call getpid()\n $1 = 23995\nOne can also use the set command to create \"convenience variables\" for use during a gdb session.\ne.g.:\n set $foo=i+42\nIf the argument of print is an array or struct all elements will be output. The following syntax can be used to show a sub range of the array:\ni.e.: \n print myArray[10]@10 #show 10 elements of the array starting at myArray[4]\nBreakpoints and Watchpoints.\nBreakpoints and watchpoints are used when one needs to examine a program prior to a known situation where things are likely to go wrong. Both break and watchpoints issued integer identification numbers, 1, 2, 3... which can be used to enable, disable or delete them. The command info break|watch displays all breakpoints and their current status.\nBreakpoints are set to halt the flow of execution either on specific line numbers in one's code or on entry to a function when run within the debugger i.e.: break \"sourcefile:42\" will stop on line 42 of the specified file. It the file name is omitted the reference is to the current file.\nA conditional breakpoint halts on a specified line when a specified expression is true, i.e.:\nbreak \"sourcefile:275\" \"if productNum=1275\"\nThe condition \"breakNum\" \"expression\" command allows one to add conditions to an established breakpoint.\nWatchpoints halt the flow of execution when the value of a variable or an expression changes, irrespective of where in the program it occurs. By default, where possible, gdb monitors the memory location where the change takes place, a useful feature given that multiple pointers may refer to the same address. Conversely a software watchpoint, which are slower, track just the variables.\nThe rwatch and awatch commands will halt the program whenever the memory location or variable is read.\nAnother conditional feature of both watches and breakpoints is the command ignore \"breakNum\" \"count\" which disregards the halting criteria until count execution passes.\nThe display command primes gdb to automatically out the value of an expression each time it stops. Multiple display commands are cumulative and the output can be formatted using the same flags available to the x command.\nFramestacks.\nWhen a program is halted it may be several layers deep in function calls.\u00a0 Each level of function call is called a frame and the collection of frames is called a frame stack.\u00a0 When execution is halted one can navigate either up or down to a specific frame in order to examine the value of variables or expressions at a particular level which is useful to assist debugging programs. The backtrace command will provide a list of all of the frames in the stack. The info args command displays all of the arguments passed to the current frame and the info local command displays a list of the variables available to it along with their values. \nScripting Support.\nGDB includes the ability to define command routines that can be used to automate frequently repeated sets of gdb instructions. These consisting of gdb commands placed between define and end statements. Parameters to these routines are not declared by name however they are passed in special variables $arg1, $arg2, $arg3... with special variable $argc representing the # of command line arguments. \nAdditionally gdb includes if/else and while blocks terminated by end statements as well as loop_break and loop_continue statements to manage flow of control.\ne.g.: \ndefine cmd\n set prompt \"My debugger&gt; \"\n set print pretty #display structures on multiple lines\n if $argc==0\n print \"There are no arguments to the command\"\n else\n break $arg0\n end\nend\nConsider that one is debugging a C program with a generic linked list a leading value and next field pointing to the next element, the following command would use a while loop to display all the elements:\ndefine p_generic_list\n set var $n = $arg0\n while $n\n print *($n)\n set var $n = $n-&gt;next\n end\nend\nCommand definitions placed in the local file .gdbinit are automatically loaded at the beginning of the gdb session. Command definitions can also be saved in ordinary files and loaded using the source command.\nAs of version 7.0 new features include support for Python scripting and as of version 7.8 GNU Guile scripting as well which is based on the Scheme (programming language).\nReversible Debugging.\nSince version 7.0, support for \"reversible debugging\" \u2014 allowing a debugging session to step backward, much like rewinding a crashed program to see what happened \u2014 is available. The feature is highly memory intensive and slows execution with a default limit of 20,000 instructions. The recommended procedure is to set breakpoints before and after the suspected problem, then issue the record command when the program stops at first one. Continue execution to the 2nd breakpoint. The reverse-step, reverse-next and reverse-continue commands can then be used to backtrack execution, undoing changes in variables piecemeal, However reverse debugging does not undo actions such as console output nor does it reissue external events such as interrupts or incoming network packets.80-82\nRemote debugging.\nGDB offers a \"remote\" mode often used when debugging embedded systems. Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another. GDB can communicate to the remote \"stub\" that understands GDB protocol through a serial device or TCP/IP. A stub program can be created by linking to the appropriate stub files provided with GDB, which implement the target side of the communication protocol. Alternatively, gdbserver can be used to remotely debug the program without needing to change it in any way.\nThe same mode is also used by KGDB for debugging a running Linux kernel on the source level with gdb. With KGDB, kernel developers can debug a kernel in much the same way as they debug application programs. It makes it possible to place breakpoints in kernel code, step through the code, and observe variables. On architectures where hardware debugging registers are available, watchpoints can be set which trigger breakpoints when specified memory addresses are executed or accessed. KGDB requires an additional machine which is connected to the machine to be debugged using a serial cable or Ethernet. On FreeBSD, it is also possible to debug using FireWire direct memory access (DMA).\nGraphical user interface.\nThe debugger does not contain its own graphical user interface, and defaults to a command-line interface, although it does contain a text user interface. Several front-ends have been built for it, such as UltraGDB, Xxgdb, Data Display Debugger (DDD), Nemiver, KDbg, the Xcode debugger, GDBtk/Insight, Gede, Seer, and HP Wildebeest Debugger GUI (WDB GUI). IDEs such as Codelite, , Dev-C++, Geany, GNAT Programming Studio (GPS), KDevelop, Qt Creator, Lazarus, MonoDevelop, Eclipse, NetBeans, and Visual Studio can interface with GDB. GNU Emacs has a \"GUD mode\" and tools for Vim exist (e.g. clewn). These offer facilities similar to debuggers found in IDEs.\nSome other debugging tools have been designed to work with GDB, such as memory leak detectors.\nInternals.\nGDB uses a system call named ptrace (the name is an abbreviation of \"process trace\") to observe and control the execution of another process, and examine and change the process's memory and registers.\nA breakpoint is implemented by replacing an instruction at a given memory address with another special instruction.

It gained some popularity in the early 2000s due to its speed, flexibility in configuration and features.\nThe disagreement over the future of Galeon split the development team in 2002, which resulted in the departure of the browser's initial author and several other developers. This event marked the beginning of the browser's popularity decline, which led to its discontinuation in September 2008. Some of Galeon's features were subsequently ported to Epiphany (now called Web) \u2013 the descendant of Galeon.\nFeatures.\nGaleon made use of Gecko's features including configuration options and standards support. Apart from that, Galeon had several features that were uncommon in browsers at that time:\nDevelopment history.\nThe project was started by Marco Pesenti Gritti with the goal of creating a web browser that would be fast and consistent with the GNOME desktop environment. The first public version (Galeon 0.6) was released in June 2000.\nOn the rise.\nThe first releases of Galeon were criticised for lack of such basic features as cookie and proxy support, though the browser added some features with every release. Version 1.2 of Galeon introduced many new features that drew attention of the general public.\nAt the time of Galeon's creation, the most popular Linux browsers, including Netscape and Mozilla, were large multi-functional programs. This made them slow to start and often impractical due to their high memory usage and processor requirements. Opera was somewhat faster, but it was proprietary software distributed in trialware and adware versions, both of which lacked some of the functionality of the Microsoft Windows version.\nGaleon was widely seen as one of the best Linux browsers available. The polls revealed the substantial usage share of Galeon, though its popularity was regarded as owing to lack of stability evident in Mozilla's browsers.\nSplit of the development team.\nWith the release of new version of the GTK+ widget toolkit, which was used to construct the user interface of Galeon, the team decided to write a new version of Galeon from scratch. At the same time the GNOME project has adopted its new human interface guidelines, which promoted simplicity and uniform design. The Galeon team had differing opinions on the new guidelines. The author and lead developer, Marco Pesenti Gritti, endorsed them and saw the rewrite as an opportunity to make Galeon simpler. Many other developers believed that reducing the number of preferences and simplifying the user interface would harm the project.\nIn November 2002, as the result of several discussions on the topic Gritti made the decision to cease his work in Galeon and fork the project and started development of a HIG-compliant web browser he called \"Epiphany\" (now known as Web).\nAfter the split.\nAs Gritti no longer controlled the development of Galeon, the previous functionality was restored in subsequent releases and some new features were added, though development got slow after the split. At the same time the rising popularity of Firefox, its status of the default browser in major distribution and the overwhelming number of its extensions led to decline of Galeon's user base.\nEventually the Galeon developers announced plans to halt development of Galeon, saying \"the current approach is unsustainable\" regarding the resources required to maintain it. Instead, they planned to develop a set of extensions for Epiphany to provide similar functionality.\nPersistence.\nEven after development ceased in September 2008, the browser remained popular and in December 2011 was still available in some Linux distribution's repositories, such as Debian 6 Squeeze, although it was not part of Debian 7 Wheezy.\nReception.\nGaleon was praised for its customizability and speed, as compared to Netscape Navigator and Firefox, though Konqueror and Opera were still faster on older hardware. Galeon was noted for its session handling and crash recovery.\nIn November 2002, OSNews conducted a poll to determine the most popular Gecko-based browser, which included several browsers for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, but didn't include Netscape Navigator and Mozilla Suite. The Linux-only Galeon was the second most popular, after cross-platform Firefox, at that time known as Phoenix.\nCritics noted Galeon's tricky plugin installation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "13057", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13057", "title": "Gatling gun", "text": "1860s multi-barrel rapid-fire gun\nThe Gatling gun is a rapid-firing multiple-barrel firearm invented in 1861 by Richard Jordan Gatling of North Carolina. It is an early machine gun and a forerunner of the modern electric motor-driven rotary cannon.\nThe Gatling gun's operation centered on a cyclic multi-barrel design which facilitated cooling and synchronized the firing-reloading sequence. As the handwheel is cranked, the barrels rotate, and each barrel sequentially loads a single cartridge from a top-mounted magazine, fires off the shot when it reaches a set position (usually at 4 o'clock), then ejects the spent casing out of the left side at the bottom, after which the barrel is empty and allowed to cool until rotated back to the top position and gravity-fed another new round. This configuration eliminated the need for a single reciprocating bolt design and allowed higher rates of fire to be achieved without the barrels overheating quickly.\nOne of the best-known early rapid-fire firearms, the Gatling gun saw occasional use by the Union Army during the American Civil War, which was the first time it was employed in combat. It was later used in numerous military conflicts, including the Boshin War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the assault on San Juan Hill during the Spanish\u2013American War. It was also used by the Pennsylvania militia in episodes of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, specifically in Pittsburgh. Gatling guns were also mounted aboard ships.\nDesign.\nThe Gatling gun is operated by a hand-crank mechanism, with six barrels revolving around a central shaft (although some models had as many as ten). Each barrel fires once per revolution at about the same position. The barrels, a carrier, and a lock cylinder were separate and all mounted on a solid plate revolving around a central shaft, mounted on an oblong fixed frame. Turning the crank rotated the shaft. The carrier was grooved and the lock cylinder was drilled with holes corresponding to the barrels.\nThe casing was partitioned, and through this opening, the barrel shaft was journaled. In front of the casing was a cam with spiral surfaces. The cam imparted a reciprocating motion to the locks when the gun rotated. Also in the casing was a cocking ring with projections to cock and fire the gun. Each barrel had a single lock, working in the lock cylinder on a line with the barrel. The lock cylinder was encased and joined to the frame. Early models had a fibrous matting stuffed in among the barrels, which could be soaked with water to cool the barrels down. Later models eliminated the matting jacketing as being unnecessary.\nCartridges, held in a hopper, dropped individually into the grooves of the carrier. The lock was simultaneously forced by the cam to move forward and load the cartridge, and when the cam was at its highest point, the cocking ring freed the lock and fired the cartridge. After the cartridge was fired the continuing action of the cam drew back the lock bringing with it the spent casing which then dropped to the ground.\nThe grouped barrel concept had been explored by inventors since the 18th century, but poor engineering and the lack of a unitary cartridge made previous designs unsuccessful. The initial Gatling gun design used self-contained, reloadable steel cylinders with a chamber holding a ball and black-powder charge, and a percussion cap on one end. As the barrels rotated, these steel cylinders dropped into place, were fired, and were then ejected from the gun. The innovative features of the Gatling gun were its independent firing mechanism for each barrel and the simultaneous action of the locks, barrels, carrier, and breech.\nThe ammunition that Gatling eventually implemented was a paper cartridge charged with black powder and primed with a percussion cap because self-contained brass cartridges were not yet fully developed and available. The shells were gravity-fed into the breech through a hopper or simple box \"magazine\" with an unsprung gravity follower on top of the gun. Each barrel had its own firing mechanism.\nDespite self-contained brass cartridges replacing the paper cartridge in the 1860s, it was only in the Model 1881 that Gatling switched to the 'Bruce'-style feed system (U.S. Patents 247,158 and 343,532) which accepted two rows of .45-70 cartridges. While one row was being fed into the gun, the other could be reloaded, thus allowing sustained fire. The final gun required four operators. By 1886, the gun was capable of firing more than 400 rounds per minute.\nThe smallest-caliber gun also had a Broadwell drum feed in place of the curved box of the other guns. The drum, named after L. W. Broadwell, an agent for Gatling's company, comprised twenty stacks of rounds arranged around a central axis, like the spokes of a wheel, each holding twenty cartridges with the bullet noses oriented toward the central axis. This invention was patented in U. S. 110,338. As each stack emptied, the drum was manually rotated to bring a new stack into use until all 400 rounds had been fired. A more common variant had 240 rounds in twenty stands of fifteen.\nBy 1893, the Gatling was adapted to take the new .30 Army smokeless cartridge. The new M1893 guns featured six barrels, later increased to ten barrels, and were capable of a maximum (initial) rate of fire of 800\u2013900 rounds per minute, though 600 rpm was recommended for continuous fire. Dr. Gatling later used examples of the M1893 powered by electric motor and belt to drive the crank. Tests demonstrated the electric Gatling could fire bursts of up to 1,500\u00a0rpm.\nThe M1893, with minor revisions, became the M1895, and 94 guns were produced for the U.S. Army by Colt. Four M1895 Gatlings under Lieutenant John H. Parker saw considerable combat during the Santiago campaign in Cuba in 1898. The M1895 was designed to accept only the Bruce feeder. All previous models were unpainted, but the M1895 was painted olive drab green, with some parts left blued.\nModel 1900 was very similar to Model 1895 but with only a few components finished in O.D. green. The U.S. Army purchased several M1900s. All Gatling Models 1895-1903 could be mounted on an armored field carriage. In 1903, the Army converted its M1900 guns into .30 Army to fit the new .30-03 cartridge (standardized for the M1903 Springfield rifle) as the M1903. The later M1903-'06 was an M1903 converted to .30-06. This conversion was principally carried out at the Army's Springfield Armory arsenal repair shops. All models of Gatling guns were declared obsolete by the U.S. military in 1911, after 45 years of service.\nThe original Gatling gun was a field weapon that used multiple rotating barrels turned by a hand crank, and firing loose (no links or belt) metal cartridge ammunition using a gravity feed system from a hopper. The Gatling gun's innovation lay in the use of multiple barrels to limit overheating, a rotating mechanism, and a gravity-feed reloading system, which allowed unskilled operators to achieve a relatively high rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.\nAlthough the first Gatling gun was capable of firing continuously, it required a person to crank it and so it was not a true automatic weapon. The Maxim gun, invented and patented in 1883, was the first true fully-automatic weapon making use of the fired projectile's recoil force to reload the weapon. Nonetheless, the Gatling gun represented a huge leap in firearm technology.\nBefore the Gatling gun, the only weapons available to military forces that could fire many projectiles in a short period of time were mass-firing volley weapons, like the Belgian and French mitrailleuse of the 1860s and 1870s, and field cannons firing canister shot, much like an upsized shotgun. The latter was widely used during and after the Napoleonic Wars. Although the maximum rate of fire was increased by firing multiple projectiles simultaneously, those weapons still needed to be reloaded after each discharge, which for multi-barrel systems like the \"mitrailleuse\" was cumbersome and time-consuming. That negated much of the advantage of their high rate of fire per discharge by making them much less powerful on the battlefield. In comparison, the Gatling gun offered a rapid and continuous rate of fire without having to be manually reloaded by opening the breech.\nEarly multi-barrel guns were approximately the size and weight of artillery pieces and were often perceived as a replacement for cannons firing grapeshot or canister shot. Compared with earlier weapons such as the \"mitrailleuse,\" which required manual reloading, the Gatling gun was more reliable and easier to operate and had a lower, but continuous rate of fire. The large wheels required to move these guns around required a high firing position, which increased the vulnerability of their crews.\nSustained firing of black powder cartridges generated a cloud of smoke, making concealment impossible until smokeless powder became available in the late 19th century. When operators were firing Gatling guns against troops of industrialized nations, they were at risk, being vulnerable to artillery they could not reach and snipers they could not see.\nHistory.\nThe Gatling gun was designed by the American inventor Richard J. Gatling in 1861 and patented on November 4, 1862. Gatling wrote that he created it to reduce the size of armies and so reduce the number of deaths by combat and disease.\nUnited States and South America.\nThe US Army adopted Gatling guns in several calibers, including .42 caliber, .45-70, .50 caliber, 1 inch, and (M1893 and later) .30 Army, with conversions of M1900 weapons to .30-03 and .30-06. The .45-70 weapon was also mounted on some US Navy ships of the 1880s and 1890s.\nThe British manufacturer James George Accles, previously employed by Colt 1867\u20131886, developed a modified Gatling gun circa 1888 known as the Accles Machine Gun. Circa 1895, the American Ordnance Company acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute this weapon in the Americas. It was trialed by the US Navy in December 1895, and was said to be the only weapon to complete the trial out of five competing weapons, but was apparently not adopted by US forces.\nThe Gatling gun was first used in warfare during the American Civil War. Twelve of the guns were purchased personally by Union commanders and used in the trenches during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia (June 1864\u2014April 1865). Eight other Gatling guns were fitted on gunboats. The gun was not accepted by the American Army until 1866 when a sales representative of the manufacturing company demonstrated it in combat.\nOn July 17, 1863, Gatling guns were purportedly used to overawe New York anti-draft rioters. Two were brought by a Pennsylvania National Guard unit from Philadelphia to use against strikers in Pittsburgh.\nGatling guns were famously \"not\" used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as \"Custer's Last Stand,\" when General George Armstrong Custer chose not to bring Gatling guns with his main force.\nIn April 1867, a Gatling gun was purchased for the Argentine Army by Interior Minister Domingo F. Sarmiento under instructions from President Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre.\nCaptain Luis Germ\u00e1n Astete of the Peruvian Navy took with him dozens of Gatling guns from the United States to Peru in December 1879 during the Peru-Chile War of the Pacific. Gatling guns were used by the Peruvian Navy and Army, especially in the Battle of Tacna (May 1880) and the Battle of San Juan (January 1881) against the invading Chilean Army.\nIn 1888, the \"SS Ozama\" smuggled a number of Gatling guns into Haiti\nIn 1907, Gatling guns were used by Nicaragua in the battle of Namasique, largely manned by American mercenaries\nGatling guns were kept in store by coal companies and used during the Battle of Blair Mountain; On September 1, a group of miners looted one of these guns and assaulted a spot called Craddock Fork. Opposing forces fought back with a machine gun, but after three hours of heavy fire, their weapon jammed. The miners surged forward and briefly broke the defensive line, but were repulsed by another machine gun nest located further up the ridge.\nRussia.\nAccording to Ellis, the Russians were amongst the first to realize the potential of machine guns, testing two Gatlings in 1865 and promptly ordering twenty for the Imperial Russian Army, eventually obtaining a license to build them locally. By 1876, the Russians had 400 Gatlings organized in eight batteries; While McNab stated that the Russians were introduced to the Gatling in 1871, when Colonel Aleksandr Pavlovich Gorloff was given a demonstration, and impressed by what he saw, ordered 400 Gatlings for the Imperial Army. Both accounts agree that these guns, known in Russia as the \"Gorloffs\" first saw action during the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878), where they were effectively used at the Battle of Nikopol and the Siege of Plevna. The \"Gorloff\" gun was also used during the Russian conquest of Central Asia to repel Turkmen cavalry charges.\nAfrica and Asia.\nThe Gatling gun was used most successfully to expand European colonial empires by defeating indigenous warriors mounting massed attacks, including the Zulu, the Bedouin, and the Mahdists. The British Army first deployed the Gatling gun in 1873-74 during the Anglo-Ashanti wars, and extensively during the last actions of the 1879 Anglo-Zulu war. The Royal Navy used Gatling guns during the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War.\nGatling guns were used by Egyptian forces both on sea and land and saw combat in Sudan and Abyssinia. Isma'il Pasha ordered 120 Colt 1865 six-barrel Gatling guns; after being convinced by Shahine Pasha who witnessed Gatling gun trials at Shoeburyness in 1866. In 1872 a few \"camel\" guns were purchased, these were smaller and used a tripod instead of the carriage. During the Siege of Khartoum an Egyptian Gatling gun aided by a telescope was able to target Sudanese artillery crews from a distance of 2,000 yards.\nGatling guns were imported by some states in Nigeria. They were used during the Kalabari Civil war of 1879\u201383, the Abbi House bought one from King Jaja of Opobo and it may have been used in canoe warfare. The Ijesha used a Gatling gun against the Ibadan during the early 1880s. In 1882 the Bonny used a Gatling gun during an attack on New Calabar.\nBy 1880, Siam had imported an unknown number of Gatlings. By 1885 the kingdom had a Gatling Gun regiment of 600 men; those weapons were possibly used in the Haw Wars. They were also seen among Prince Bigit's escort in 1886.\nThe Korean Empire possessed a number of Gatlings. Six had been imported in 1884, by 1891 it had a battery of fourteen guns and in 1894 the army's two American drilled regiments had as many as 40 Gatlings and practiced regularly (Supposedly because the noise pleased Emperor Gojong). Some of them were deployed to defend the approaches of the capital during the Donghak Rebellion, but there is no evidence they saw combat.\nBritish North America.\nLieutenant Arthur L. Howard of the Connecticut National Guard had an interest in the company manufacturing Gatling guns and took a personally owned Gatling gun to the District of Saskatchewan, Canada, in 1885 for use with the Canadian military against M\u00e9tis and First Nations rebels during Louis Riel's North-West Rebellion.\nSpanish\u2013American War.\nBecause of infighting within army ordnance, Gatling guns were used by the U.S. Army during the Spanish\u2013American War. A four-gun battery of Model 1895 ten-barrel Gatling guns in .30 Army, made by Colt's Arms Company, was formed into a separate detachment led by Lt. John \"Gatling Gun\" Parker. The detachment proved very effective, supporting the advance of American forces at the Battle of San Juan Hill. Three of the Gatlings with swivel mountings were used with great success against the Spanish defenders. During the American charge up San Juan and Kettle hills, the three guns fired a total of 18,000 .30 Army rounds in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;8+1\u20442 minutes (an average of over 700 rounds per minute per gun of continuous fire) against Spanish troop positions along the crest of both hills, causing significant casualties.\nDespite this successful deployment, the Gatling's weight and cumbersome artillery carriage hindered its ability to keep up with infantry forces over difficult ground, particularly in Cuba, where roads were often little more than jungle footpaths. By this time, the U.S. Marines had been issued the modern tripod-mounted M1895 Colt\u2013Browning machine gun using the 6mm Lee Navy round, which they employed to defeat the Spanish infantry at the battle of Cuzco Wells.\nPhilippine\u2013American War.\nGatling guns were used by the U.S. Army during the Philippine\u2013American War.\nOne such instance was during the Battle of San Jacinto (1899) () which was fought on November 11, 1899, in San Jacinto in the Philippines, between Philippine Republican Army soldiers and American troops.\nThe Gatling's weight and artillery carriage hindered its ability to keep up with American troops over uneven terrain, particularly in the Philippines, where outside the cities there were heavily foliaged forests and steep mountain paths.\nFurther development.\nAfter the Gatling gun was replaced in service by newer recoil or gas-operated weapons, the approach of using multiple externally powered rotating barrels fell into disuse for many decades. However, some examples were developed during the interwar years, but only existed as prototypes or were rarely used. The concept resurfaced after World War II with the development of the Minigun and the M61 Vulcan in particular for use in aircraft over reciprocating bolt autocannons which are more prone to jamming in high g environments. Other versions of the Gatling gun were built from the late 20th century to the present, the largest of them being the 30mm GAU-8 Avenger autocannon as used on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II.\nUsers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Until 1989, it was generally viewed as a communist state and described itself as a socialist workers' and peasants' state. The economy of the country was centrally planned and state-owned. Although the GDR had to pay substantial war reparations to the Soviet Union, its economy became the most successful in the Eastern Bloc.\nBefore its establishment, the country's territory was administered and occupied by Soviet forces following the Berlin Declaration abolishing German sovereignty in World War II. The Potsdam Agreement established the Soviet-occupied zone, bounded on the east by the Oder\u2013Nei\u00dfe line. The GDR was dominated by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), a communist party, before being democratized and liberalized amid the revolutions of 1989; this paved the way for East Germany's reunification with West Germany. Unlike the government of West Germany, the SED did not see its state as the successor to the German Reich (1871\u20131945). In 1974, it abolished the goal of unification in the constitution. The SED-ruled GDR was often described as a Soviet satellite state; historians describe it as an authoritarian regime.\nGeographically, the GDR bordered the Baltic Sea to the north, Poland to the east, Czechoslovakia to the southeast, and West Germany to the west. Internally, the GDR bordered East Berlin, the Soviet sector of Allied-occupied Berlin, which was also administered as the country's \"de facto\" capital. It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the United States, United Kingdom, and France, known collectively as West Berlin (\"de facto\" part of the FRG). Emigration to the West was a significant problem; as many emigrants were well-educated young people, this trend economically weakened the state. In response, the GDR government fortified its inner German border and built the Berlin Wall in 1961. Many people attempting to flee were killed by border guards or booby traps such as landmines.\nIn 1989, numerous social, economic, and political forces in the GDR and abroad\u2014one of the most notable being peaceful protests starting in the city of Leipzig\u2014led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the establishment of a government committed to liberalization. The following year, a free and fair election was held in the country, and international negotiations between the four former Allied countries and the two German states commenced. The negotiations led to the signing of the Final Settlement treaty, which replaced the Potsdam Agreement on the status and borders of a future, reunited Germany. The GDR ceased to exist when its five states (\"L\u00e4nder\") joined the Federal Republic of Germany under Article 23 of the Basic Law, and its capital East Berlin united with West Berlin on 3 October 1990. Several of the GDR's leaders, notably its last communist leader Egon Krenz, were later prosecuted for offenses committed during the GDR era.\nEtymology.\nThe official name was ('German Democratic Republic'), usually abbreviated to \"DDR\" (GDR). Both terms were used in East Germany, with increasing usage of the abbreviated form, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its second constitution in 1968. West Germans, the western media, and statesmen initially avoided the official name and its abbreviation, instead using terms like \"Ostzone\" ('Eastern Zone'), ('Soviet Occupation Zone'; often abbreviated to \"SBZ\"), and ('so-called GDR').\nIn the West, the centre of political power in East Berlin was referred to as \"Pankow\" (the seat of command of the Soviet forces in Germany was in Karlshorst, a district in the East of Berlin). Over time, however, the abbreviation DDR was also increasingly used colloquially by West Germans and West German media.\nWhen used by West Germans, the term ('West Germany') almost always referred to the geographic region of western Germany and not to the area within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, this use was not always consistent and West Berliners frequently used the term to denote the Federal Republic. Before World War II, ('East Germany') was used to describe all the territories east of the Elbe (East Elbia), as reflected in the works of sociologist Max Weber and political theorist Carl Schmitt.\nHistory.\nExplaining the internal impact of the GDR government from the perspective of German history in the long term, historian Gerhard A. Ritter (2002) has argued that two dominant forces defined the East German state: Soviet communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German communists on the other. Throughout its existence, the GDR consistently grappled with the influence of the more prosperous West, against which East Germans continually measured their own nation. The notable transformations instituted by the communist regime were particularly evident in the abolition of capitalism, the overhaul of industrial and agricultural sectors, the militarization of society, and the political orientation of both the educational system and the media.\nOn the other hand, the new regime made relatively few changes in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles. Social policy, says Ritter, became a critical legitimization tool in the last decades and mixed socialist and traditional elements about equally.\nOrigins.\nAt the Yalta Conference during World War II, the Allies\u00a0\u2013 the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and the Soviet Union (USSR)\u00a0\u2013 agreed to divide defeated Nazi Germany into occupation zones, as well as divide Berlin, the German capital, among the Allied powers. Initially, this meant the formation of three zones of occupation (i.e., American, British, and Soviet). Later, a French zone was carved out of the US and British zones.\n1949 establishment.\nThe ruling communist party, known as the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), formed on 21 April 1946 from the merger between the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The two former parties had previously been notorious rivals before the Nazis consolidated all power and criminalized both of them. Official East German and Soviet histories portrayed this merger as a voluntary pooling of efforts by the socialist parties and as symbolic of the new friendship of German socialists after defeating their common enemy. However, there is much evidence that the merger was more troubled than was commonly portrayed; that the Soviet occupation authorities applied great pressure on the SPD's eastern branch to merge with the KPD; and the communists, who held a majority, had virtually total control over policy. The SED remained the dominant party for the entire duration of the East German state. It had close ties with the Soviets, which maintained military forces in East Germany until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 (Russia continued to maintain forces in the territory of the former East Germany until 1994), with the purpose of countering NATO bases in West Germany.\nAs West Germany was reorganized and gained independence from its occupiers (1945\u20131949), the GDR was established in eastern Germany in October 1949. The emergence of the two sovereign states solidified the 1945 division of Germany. On 10 March 1952 (in what would become known as the \"Stalin Note\"), the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, issued a proposal to reunify Germany with a policy of neutrality, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for \"the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly\" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations. The West demurred; reunification was not then a priority for the leadership of West Germany, and the NATO powers declined the proposal, asserting that Germany should be able to join NATO and that such a negotiation with the Soviet Union would be seen as a capitulation.\nIn October 7th, 1949 the Germany Democratic Republic was formally established and the Soviets Military Administration turned control of East Germany over to the SED, headed by Wilhelm Pieck (1876\u20131960), who became President of the GDR and held the office until his death, while the SED general secretary Walter Ulbricht assumed most executive authority. Socialist leader Otto Grotewohl (1894\u20131964) became prime minister until his death.\nThe government of East Germany denounced West German failures in accomplishing denazification and renounced ties to the Nazi past, imprisoning many former Nazis and preventing them from holding government positions. The SED set a primary goal of ridding East Germany of all traces of Nazism. It is estimated that between 180,000 and 250,000 people were sentenced to imprisonment on political grounds.\nZones of occupation.\nIn the Yalta and Potsdam conferences of 1945, the Allies established their joint military occupation and administration of Germany via the Allied Control Council (ACC), a four-power (US, UK, USSR, France) military government effective until the restoration of German sovereignty. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation Zone (\"Sowjetische Besatzungszone\", SBZ) comprised the five states (\"L\u00e4nder\") of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones. The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently, as the other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the Soviet administration instituted a separate socialist government in its zone.\nSeven years after the Allies' 1945 Potsdam Agreement on common German policies, the USSR via the Stalin Note (10 March 1952) proposed German reunification and superpower disengagement from Central Europe, which the three Western Allies (US, UK, France) rejected. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, a Communist proponent of reunification, died in early March 1953. Similarly, Lavrenty Beria, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued German reunification but was removed from power that same year before he could act on the matter. His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification was off the table until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989.\nEast Germany regarded East Berlin as its capital, and the Soviet Union and the rest of the Eastern Bloc diplomatically recognized East Berlin as the capital. However, the Western Allies disputed this recognition, and considered the entire city of Berlin to be occupied territory governed by the ACC. According to Margarete Feinstein, the West and most Third World countries largely unrecognized East Berlin's status as the capital. In practice, the Cold War nullified the ACC's authority, East Berlin's status as occupied territory largely became a legal fiction, and the Soviet sector of Berlin fully integrated into the GDR.\nThe deepening Cold War conflict between the Western Powers and the Soviet Union over the unresolved status of West Berlin led to the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948\u00a0\u2013 12 May 1949). The Soviet army initiated the blockade by halting all Allied rail, road, and water traffic to and from West Berlin. The Allies countered the Soviets with the Berlin Airlift (1948\u201349) of food, fuel, and supplies to West Berlin.\nPartition.\nOn 21 April 1946 the Communist Party of Germany (; KPD) and the part of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (; SPD) in the Soviet zone merged to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (; SED), which then won the elections of October 1946. The SED government nationalised infrastructure and industrial plants.\nIn March 1948 the German Economic Commission (; DWK) under its chairman Heinrich Rau assumed administrative authority in the Soviet occupation zone, thus becoming the predecessor of the East German government.\nOn 7 October 1949 the SED established the German Democratic Republic (; GDR), based on a socialist political constitution establishing its control of the Anti-Fascist National Front of the German Democratic Republic (; NF), an omnibus alliance of every party and mass organisation in East Germany. The NF was established to stand for election to the People's Chamber (), the East German parliament. The first and only president of the German Democratic Republic was Wilhelm Pieck. However, after 1950, political power in East Germany was held by the First Secretary of the SED, Walter Ulbricht.\nOn 16 June 1953, workers constructing the new boulevard in East Berlin, according to the GDR's officially promulgated Sixteen Principles of Urban Design, rioted against a 10% production-quota increase. Initially a labour protest, the action soon included the general populace, and on 17 June similar protests occurred throughout the GDR, with more than a million people striking in some 700 cities and towns. Fearing anti-communist counter-revolution, on 18 June 1953 the government of the GDR enlisted the Soviet Occupation Forces to aid the police in ending the riot; some fifty people were killed and 10,000 were jailed (see Uprising of 1953 in East Germany). From 1956 until the mid-1960s, East Germany competed in three respective Olympic Games as part of the United Team of Germany.\nThe German war reparations owed to the Soviets impoverished the Soviet Zone of Occupation and severely weakened the East German economy. During 1945\u201346 the Soviets confiscated and transported to the USSR approximately 33% of the industrial plants, and by the early 1950s had extracted some US$10\u00a0billion in reparations in agricultural and industrial products. The poverty of East Germany, induced or deepened by reparations, provoked the (\"desertion from the republic\") to West Germany, further weakening the GDR's economy. Western economic opportunities induced a brain drain. In response, the GDR closed the inner German border, and on the night of 12 August 1961, East German soldiers began erecting the Berlin Wall.\nIn 1971, Ulbricht was removed from leadership after Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev supported his ouster; Erich Honecker replaced him. While the Ulbricht government had experimented with liberal reforms, the Honecker government reversed them. The new government introduced a new East German Constitution which defined the German Democratic Republic as a \"republic of workers and peasants\".\nInitially, East Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany, a claim supported by most of the Communist Bloc. It claimed that West Germany was an illegally constituted puppet state of NATO. However, from the 1960s onward, East Germany began recognizing itself as a separate country from West Germany and shared the legacy of the united German state of 1871\u20131945. This was formalized in 1974 when the reunification clause was removed from the revised East German constitution. West Germany, in contrast, maintained that it was the only legitimate government of Germany. From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East Germany was an illegally constituted state. It argued that the GDR was a Soviet puppet-state and frequently referred to it as the \"Soviet occupation zone\". West Germany's allies shared this position until 1973. East Germany was recognized primarily by socialist countries and the Arab Bloc, along with some \"scattered sympathizers\". According to the Hallstein Doctrine (1955), West Germany did not establish (formal) diplomatic ties with any country\u00a0\u2013 except the Soviets\u00a0\u2013 that recognized East German sovereignty.\nIn the early 1970s, the ('Eastern Policy') of \"Change Through Rapprochement\" of the pragmatic government of FRG Chancellor Willy Brandt, established normal diplomatic relations with the Eastern Bloc states. This policy saw the Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw (December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972), which relinquished any separate claims to an exclusive mandate over Germany as a whole and established normal relations between the two Germanies. Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanies into the UN to that effect. Following the Ostpolitik, West Germany viewed East Germany as a \"de facto\" government within a single German nation and a \"de jure\" state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR \"de jure\" as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the \"de facto\" and \"de jure\" government, but also the sole \"de jure\" legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\". The two German governments each relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally, which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations \"de jure\" in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1973:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular, the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.\nTravel between the GDR and Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary became visa-free from 1972.\nGDR identity.\nFrom the beginning, the newly formed GDR tried to establish its own separate identity. Because of the imperial and military legacy of Prussia, the SED repudiated continuity between Prussia and the GDR. The SED destroyed a number of symbolic relics of the former Prussian aristocracy\u00a0\u2013 Junker manor-houses were torn down, the Berliner Stadtschlo\u00df was razed and the Palace of the Republic was built in its place, and the equestrian statue of Frederick the Great was removed from East Berlin. Instead, the SED focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including Thomas M\u00fcntzer's role in the German Peasants' War (1524\u20131525) and the roles of heroes of the class struggle during Prussia's industrialization. The SED upheld other notable figures and reformers from Prussian history\u00a0\u2013 such as Karl Freiherr vom Stein (1757\u20131831), Karl August von Hardenberg (1750\u20131822), Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835), and Gerhard von Scharnhorst (1755\u20131813)\u00a0\u2013 as examples and role models.\nRemembrance of the Third Reich.\nThe communist regime of the GDR based its legitimacy on the struggle of anti-fascist militants. The Buchenwald Resistance, a resistance group, was established at the memorial site of the Buchenwald concentration camp, with the creation of a museum in 1958, and the annual celebration of the Buchenwald oath taken on 19 April 1945 by the prisoners who pledged to fight for peace and freedom. In the 1990s, the 'state anti-fascism' of the GDR gave way to the 'state anti-communism' of the FRG. From then on, the dominant interpretation of GDR history, based on the concept of totalitarianism, led to the equivalence of communism and Nazism.\nAlthough officially built in opposition to the 'fascist world' in West Germany, 32% of GDR public administration employees in 1954 were former members of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). While by 1961, the share of former NSDAP members among the senior Interior Ministry administration staff was less than 10% in the GDR, compared to 67% in the FRG, having been a former Nazi was still not a hindrance for a career in the GDR's ministries and even in the SED, several high-ranking party functionaries such as Fritz M\u00fcller and Bruno Lietz being former NSDAP members. While a work of memory on the resurgence of Nazism was carried out in West Germany, this was not the case in the East, where the existence of Neo-Nazism in a socialist state was seen as being impossible. In addition, East Germany, not seeing itself as the legal successor to Nazi Germany, refused all remuneration requests by Jewish Holocaust victims and their families.\nOn 17 October 1987, around thirty skinheads threw themselves into a crowd of 2,000 people at a rock concert in the Zionskirche without the police intervening. In 1990, the writer Freya Klier received a death threat for writing an essay on antisemitism and xenophobia in the GDR. SPDA Vice President Wolfgang Thierse, for his part, complained in \"Die Welt\" about the rise of the extreme right in the everyday life of the inhabitants of the former GDR, in particular the terrorist group NSU, with the German journalist Odile Benyahia-Kouider explaining that \"it is no coincidence that the neo-Nazi party NPD has experienced a renaissance via the East\".\nThe historian Sonia Combe observes that until the 1990s, the majority of West German historians described the Normandy landings in June 1944 as an \"invasion\", exonerated the Wehrmacht of its responsibility for the genocide of the Jews, and fabricated the myth of a diplomatic corps that \"did not know\". In contrast, Auschwitz was never a taboo in the GDR. The Nazis' crimes were the subject of extensive film, theatre, and literary productions. In 1991, 16% of the population in West Germany and 6% in East Germany had antisemitic prejudices. In 1994, 40% of West Germans and 22% of East Germans felt that too much emphasis was placed on the genocide of the Jews.\nHistorian Ulrich Pfeil, nevertheless, recalls the fact that anti-fascist commemoration in the GDR had \"a hagiographic and indoctrination character\". As in the case of the memory of the protagonists of the German labour movement and the victims of the camps, it was \"staged, censored, ordered\" and, during the 40 years of the regime, was an instrument of legitimisation, repression, and maintenance of power.\n\"Die Wende\" (German reunification).\nIn May 1989, following widespread public anger over the faking of local government election results, many GDR citizens applied for exit visas or left the country contrary to GDR laws. The impetus for this exodus of East Germans was the removal of the electrified fence along Hungary's border with Austria on 2 May 1989. Although formally the Hungarian frontier was still closed, many East Germans took the opportunity to enter Hungary via Czechoslovakia, and then make the illegal crossing from Hungary to Austria and to West Germany beyond. By July, 25,000 East Germans had crossed into Hungary; most of them did not attempt the risky crossing into Austria but remained instead in Hungary or claimed asylum in West German embassies in Prague or Budapest.\nThe opening of a border gate between Austria and Hungary at the Pan-European Picnic on 19 August 1989 then triggered a chain reaction leading to the end of the GDR and the disintegration of the Eastern Bloc. It was the largest mass escape from East Germany since the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony came from Otto von Habsburg, who proposed it to Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth, then Hungarian Prime Minister, who promoted the idea. The patrons of the picnic, Habsburg and Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, who did not attend the event, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev's reaction to an opening of the border on the Iron Curtain. In particular, it tested whether Moscow would give the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary the command to intervene. The Paneuropean Union advertised extensively for the planned picnic with posters and flyers distributed among GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting GDR citizens to a picnic near the border at Sopron (near Hungary's border with Austria). The local Sopron organizers knew nothing of possible GDR refugees, but envisaged a local party with Austrian and Hungarian participation. But with the mass exodus at the picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams. Thus, the barrier of the Eastern Bloc was broken. Tens of thousands of East Germans, alerted by the media, made their way to Hungary, which was no longer ready to keep its borders completely closed or force its border troops to open fire on escapees. The GDR leadership in East Berlin did not dare to completely lock down their own country's borders.\nThe next major turning point in the exodus came on 10 September 1989, when Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn announced that his country would no longer restrict movement from Hungary into Austria. Within two days, 22,000 East Germans crossed into Austria; tens of thousands more did so in the following weeks.\nMany other GDR citizens demonstrated against the ruling party, especially in the city of Leipzig. The Leipzig demonstrations became a weekly occurrence, with a turnout of 10,000 people at the first demonstration on 2 October, and a peak of an estimated 300,000 by the end of the month. The protests were surpassed in East Berlin, where half a million demonstrators turned out against the regime on 4 November. Kurt Masur, conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, led local negotiations with the government and held town meetings in the concert hall. The demonstrations eventually led Erich Honecker to resign in October; he was replaced by a slightly more moderate communist, Egon Krenz.\nThe massive demonstration in East Berlin on 4 November coincided with Czechoslovakia formally opening its border to West Germany. With the West more accessible than ever before, 30,000 East Germans made the crossing via Czechoslovakia in the first two days alone. To try to stem the outward flow of the population, the SED proposed a law loosening travel restrictions. When the rejected it on 5 November, the Cabinet and Politburo of the GDR resigned. This left only one avenue open for Krenz and the SED: completely abolishing travel restrictions between East and West.\nOn 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing freely into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time in nearly 30 years. Krenz resigned a month later, and the SED opened negotiations with the leaders of the incipient Democratic movement, Neues Forum, to schedule free elections and begin the process of democratization. As part of this process, the SED eliminated the clause in the East German constitution guaranteeing the Communists leadership of the state. The change was approved in the on 1 December 1989 by a vote of 420 to 0.\nEast Germany held its last election in March 1990. The winner was Alliance for Germany, a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's Christian Democratic Union, which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations (2+4 Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former Allies, which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original East German states that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored. On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as Bremen and Hamburg). On 1 July, a currency union preceded the political union: the Ostmark was abolished, and the Western German Deutsche Mark became the common currency.\nAlthough the 's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions, and qualifications, some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990 \u2013 that is, through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic, now recognising each other as separate sovereign states in international law. The treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for unification by both the and the Bundestag by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities, effecting on the one hand the extinction of the GDR, and on the other the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.\nThe wide economic and socio-political inequalities between the former German states required government subsidies for the full integration of the GDR into the FRG. Because of the resulting deindustrialization in former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient command economy. But many East German critics contend that the shock-therapy style of privatization, the artificially high rate of exchange offered for the Ostmark, and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe political history of East Germany had four periods: 1949\u20131961, which saw the \"Construction of Socialism\"; 1961\u20131970, after the Berlin Wall closed off escape, was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971\u20131985 was termed the \"Honecker Era\", and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985\u20131990 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.\nOrganization.\nThe ruling political party in East Germany was the (Socialist Unity Party of Germany; SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the Soviet-controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged communist party as the more independent-minded social democrats were pushed out.\nThe Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to support a democratic form of government in Germany, though the Soviets' understanding of democracy was radically different from that of the West. As in other Soviet Bloc countries, non-communist political parties were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the National Front of Democratic Germany, a SED-led coalition of parties and mass political organisations, which included:\nThe member parties were completely subservient to the SED and had to accept its \"leading role\" as a condition of their existence. They received generous financial support and some posts in the government.\nThe Volkskammer also included representatives from the SED-controlled mass organisations like the Free German Youth (; FDJ), or the Free German Trade Union Federation. There was also the Democratic Women's Federation of Germany, with seats in the .\nImportant non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (; DTSB), and the People's Solidarity (), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the Society for German\u2013Soviet Friendship.\nAfter the fall of socialism, the SED transformed into the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which continued for a decade after reunification, before merging with the West German WASG to form the Left Party (). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany.\nState symbols.\nThe flag of the German Democratic Republic consisted of three horizontal stripes in the traditional German-democratic colors black-red-gold; at its center was a GDR national coat of arms, consisting of a wreath of corn surrounding a hammer and compass, which symbolised the alliance of workers, peasants, and intelligentsia. The first drafts of Fritz Behrendt's coat of arms contained only a hammer and wreath of corn; the final version was mainly based on the work of Heinz Behling.\nThe state coat of arms and flag were set by law on 26 September 1955. Initially, the flag lacked the coat of arms; it was later added (1 October 1959). Until the end of the 1960s, the public display of this flag in the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin was regarded as a violation of the constitution and public order, and prevented by police measures. It was not until 1969 that the Federal Government decreed \"that the police should no longer intervene anywhere against the use of the flag and coat of arms of the GDR.\"\nAt the request of the DSU, the first freely elected People's Chamber of the GDR decided on 31 May 1990 that the GDR state coat of arms should be removed within a week in and on public buildings. Nevertheless, until the official end of the republic, it continued to be used in other ways, such as on documents.\nThe national anthem of the GDR, \"Resurrected from Ruins\", had its text was written by Johannes R. Becher and its melody composed by Hanns Eisler. From the beginning of the 1970s to the end of 1989, however, the text of the anthem was no longer sung due to the passage \"Deutschland einig Vaterland\" (\"Germany a united Fatherland\").\nPolitical and social emblems.\nAfter being a member of the Th\u00e4lmann Pioneers, which was for schoolchildren ages 6 to 14, East German youths would usually join the Free German Youth (\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\"; FDJ).\nYoung Pioneer programs.\nErnst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation.\nThe Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation was a youth organisation of schoolchildren aged 6 to 14 in East Germany. In the 1960s and 1970s, nearly all schoolchildren were organised into \"Young Pioneer\" or \"Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer\" groups, with the organisations having \"nearly two million children\" collectively by 1975. The group was a subdivision of the \"Freie Deutsche Jugend\" (FDJ), East Germany's youth movement.\nThe pioneer group was loosely based on Scouting, but organised to teach socialist ideology to schoolchildren and prepare them for the FDJ. The program was designed to follow the Soviet pioneer program Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization. Both pioneer groups would often have massive parades, honoring and celebrating the socialist success of their nations.\nMembership was formally voluntary, but often expected by the state or by parents. In practice, admission of all students in a class came from the school. As the membership quota of up to 98 percent of the students (in the later years of the GDR) shows, the six- or ten-year-olds (or their parents) had to be independently active to \"not\" become members. Rarely, students were not admitted because of poor academic performance or bad behavior \"as a punishment\", or excluded from further membership.\nThe pioneers' uniform consisted of white shirts and blouses, along with blue trousers or skirts. A distinctive feature was the triangular neckerchief. In contrast to the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries, a blue neckerchief was common in the GDR. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the organization in 1973, the red neckerchief was introduced for the Th\u00e4lmann Pioneers.\nFree German Youth.\nAfter being a member of the Th\u00e4lmann Pioneers, East German youths would usually join the \"Freie Deutsche Jugend\" (Free German Youth; FDJ), a youth organization for both boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 25 and which comprised about 75% of the GDR's young population. In 1981\u20131982, this meant 2.3\u00a0million members. Its main objective was to win over the hearts and minds of young East Germans to socialism and the ideals of the SED.\nThe FDJ was founded in 1946 with an emphasis on 'happy youth life', which involved organised activities like sports, dances, concerts, and hikes. During the following decades, the FDJ increasingly developed into an instrument of communist rule, and gained a more severe anti-religious agenda. After German reunification in October 1990, the FDJ quickly lost nearly all of its remaining memberships.\nUpon request, young people were admitted to the FDJ from the age of 14. Membership was voluntary according to the statutes, but there was high pressure to join from line-loyal teachers and societal expectations. Non-members had to fear considerable disadvantages in school admission, choice of study, career, and military service. By the end of 1949, almost a third of young people (around one million) had joined; yet in Berlin, where other youth organizations were also admitted due to the four-power status, participation was limited to just under 5%. In 1985, about 80% of all GDR youths between the ages of 14 and 25 were members. Most young people tacitly ended their FDJ membership after completing their apprenticeship or studies when they entered the workforce. The degree of organisation was much higher in urban areas than in rural areas.\nFrom 1948, the official organizational clothing of the FDJ were long-sleeved blue shirts for boys and blouses for girls. The left sleeve was sewn with the FDJ symbol of the rising sun.\nAdministrative districts.\n Berlin \nCottbus \nDresden \nErfurt \nFrankfurt \nGera \nHalle \nKarl-Marx-Stadt \nLeipzig \nMagdeburg \nNeubrandenburg \nPotsdam \nRostock \nSchwerin \nSuhl \nUntil 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, East Berlin (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt (named Province of Saxony until 1946), Thuringia, and Saxony. The states' post-war territorial demarcations approximated the pre-war German demarcations of the Middle German \"L\u00e4nder\" (states) and \"Provinzen\" (provinces of Prussia). The western parts of two provinces, Pomerania and Lower Silesia, the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.\nThe East German Administrative Reform of 1952 established 14 (districts) and \"de facto\" disestablished the five \"L\u00e4nder\". The new , named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) Rostock, (ii) Neubrandenburg, and (iii) Schwerin created from the \"Land\" (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) Potsdam, (v) Frankfurt (Oder), and (vii) Cottbus from Brandenburg; (vi) Magdeburg and (viii) Halle from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) Leipzig, (xi) Dresden, and (xii) Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) Erfurt, (xiii) Gera, and (xiv) Suhl from Thuringia.\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th \"Bezirk\" in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the Allied Control Council, and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the \"Bezirk\" of Berlin as part of its territory.\nForeign relations.\nSupport of Third World socialist countries.\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and national liberation movements. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the People's Republic of Angola and socialist Ethiopia), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\nAlready in the 1960s, contacts were established with the MPLA in Angola, the FRELIMO in Mozambique, and the PAIGC in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s, official cooperation was established with other socialist states, such as the People's Republic of the Congo, People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Somali Democratic Republic, Libya, and the People's Republic of Benin.\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique, and Ethiopia.\nIt was estimated that altogether 2,000\u20134,000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.\nEast Germany and the Middle East conflict.\nEast Germany pursued an anti-Zionist policy; Jeffrey Herf argues that East Germany was waging an undeclared war on Israel. According to Herf, \"the Middle East was one of the crucial battlefields of the global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West; it was also a region in which East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc's antagonism toward Israel.\" While East Germany saw itself as an \"anti-fascist state\", it regarded Israel as a \"fascist state\", and East Germany strongly supported the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in its armed struggle against Israel. In 1974, the GDR government recognized the PLO as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\". The PLO declared the Palestinian state on 15 November 1988 during the First Intifada, and the GDR recognized the state prior to reunification. After becoming a member of the UN, East Germany \"made excellent use of the UN to wage political warfare against Israel [and was] an enthusiastic, high-profile, and vigorous member\" of the anti-Israeli majority of the General Assembly.\nBa'athist Iraq, due to its wealth of unexploited natural resources, was sought out as an ally of East Germany, with Iraq being the first Arab country to recognise East Germany on 10 May 1969, paving the way for other Arab League states to later do the same. East Germany attempted to play a decisive role in mediating the conflict between the Iraqi Communist Party and the Ba'ath Party and supported the creation of the National Progressive Front. The East German government also attempted to foster close relations with the Ba'athist regime of Hafez al-Assad during the early years of Assad's regime and, as it did in Iraq, used its influence to minimise tensions between the Syrian Communist Party and the Ba'athist regime.\nWestern Europe.\nDuring the Cold War, especially during its early years, the East German government attempted to build closer diplomatic relations and trade links between Iceland and East Germany. By the 1950s, East Germany had become Iceland's fifth largest trading partner. East German influence in Iceland significantly declined in the 1970s and 1980s following a schism between the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Icelandic Socialist Party over the Prague Spring, along with free market economic reforms implemented by Iceland during the 1960s.\nMilitary.\nThe government of East Germany controlled a large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the Cold War (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the Warsaw Pact. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\nNational People's Army.\nThe (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police (Volkspolizei), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the Ministry of National Defence. It was an all-volunteer force until an eighteen-month conscription period was introduced in 1962. NATO officers regarded it as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\nBorder troops.\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the , similar to the in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the Soviet Border Troops, and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\nVolkspolizei-Bereitschaft.\nAfter the NVA was separated from the in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the (VPB). These units were equipped as motorised infantry, like the , and in total numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\nStasi.\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only public-facing wing of the Stasi. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000\u201312,000 men.\nCombat groups of the working class.\nThe (Combat Groups of the Working Class; KdA) numbered around 400,000 men for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's . They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\nConscientious objection.\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of compulsory military service. For the medically unqualified and conscientious objectors, there were the (construction units) or the (People's Sanitation Service), both established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national Lutheran Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former construction soldiers and sanitation service soldiers were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\nTotalitarianism and repression.\nThere is general consensus among academics that the GDR fulfilled most of the criteria to be considered a totalitarian state. There is, however, ongoing debate as to whether the more positive aspects of the regime can sufficiently dilute the harsher aspects so as to make the totalitarian tag seem excessive. According to the historian Mary Fulbrook:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Even those who are most critical of the concept admit that the regime possessed most, if not all, of the objective traits associated with the term, i.e., rule by a single party or elite that dominated the state machinery; that centrally directed and controlled the economy; mass communication, and all forms of social and cultural organisation; that espoused an official, all-encompassing, utopian (or, depending on one's point of view, dystopian) ideology; and that used physical and mental terror and repression to achieve its goals, mobilise the masses, and silence opposition- all of which was made possible by the buildup of a vast state security service.\nThe Stasi was fundamental to the socialist leadership's attempts to reach their historical goal. It was an open secret in the GDR that the Stasi read people's mail and tapped phone calls. They also employed a vast network of informants (called \"unofficial collaborators\") who would spy on people more directly and report to their Stasi handlers. These collaborators were hired in all walks of life and had access to nearly every organisation in the country. At the end of the GDR in 1990 there were approximately 109,000 still-active informants at every grade. Repressive measures carried out by the Stasi can be roughly divided into two main chronological groupings: before 1971 and after 1971, when Honecker came to power. According to the historian Nessim Ghouas, \"There was a change in how the Stasi operated under Honecker in 1971. The more brutal aspects of repression seen in the Stalinist era (torture, executions, and physical repression descending from the GDR's earlier days) was changed with a more selective use of power.\"\nThe more direct forms of repression such as arrest and torture could mean significant international condemnation for the GDR. However, the Stasi still needed to paralyse and disrupt what it considered to be 'hostile-negative' forces (internal domestic enemies) if the socialist goal was to be properly realised. A person could be targeted by the Stasi for expressing politically, culturally, or religiously incorrect views; for performing hostile acts; or for being a member of a group which was considered sufficiently counter-productive to the socialist state to warrant intervention. As such, writers, artists, youth sub-cultures, and members of the church were often targeted. If after preliminary research the Stasi found an individual warranted action against them then they would open an \"operational case\" in regard to them. There were two desirable outcomes for each case: that the person was either arrested, tried, and imprisoned for an ostensibly justified reason, or, if this could not be achieved, that they were debilitated through the application of \"Zersetzung\" (\"decomposition\") methods. In the Honecker era, Zersetzung became the primary method of Stasi repression, due in large part to an ambition to avoid political fallout from wrongful arrest. Historian Mike Dennis says, \"Between 1985\u20131988, the Stasi conducted about 4,500 to 5,000 OVs (operational cases) per year.\"\nZersetzung methods varied and were tailored depending on the targeted individual. They are known to have included sending offensive mail to a person's house, the spreading of malicious rumours, banning them from traveling, sabotaging their career, and breaking into their house and moving objects around. These acts frequently led to unemployment, social isolation, and poor mental health. Many people had various forms of mental or nervous breakdown. Similarly to physical imprisonment, Zersetzung methods had the effect of paralysing a person's ability to operate but with the advantage of the source being unknown or at least unprovable. The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims considers that there are between 300,000 and 500,000 victims of direct physical torture, Zersetzung, and gross human rights violations due to the Stasi. Victims of historical Zersetzung can now draw a special pension from the German state.\nThe Stasi also did assassinations of GDR officials deemed a threat to the regime, among other things killing General Director of the German Reichsbahn Willi Kreikemeyer, finance minister Siegfried B\u00f6hm and attempting to kill deposed Central Committee employee Manfred Uschner with a car bomb.\nEconomy.\nThe East German economy began poorly due to the devastation caused by the Second World War - the loss of so many young soldiers, the disruption of business and transportation, the Allied bombing campaigns that decimated cities, and reparations owed to the USSR. The Red Army dismantled and transported lots of infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation to the Soviet Union. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and Lower Silesia, with its coal mines, and Szczecin, an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.\nThe socialist centrally planned economy of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the COMECON trade bloc. In 1985, collective (state) enterprises earned 97% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars) (this is based on an unreal official exchange rate). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was 5 percent. This made the East German economy the richest in all of the Soviet Bloc until reunification in 1990.\nNotable East German exports were photographic cameras (under the Praktica brand), automobiles (under the Trabant, Wartburg, and IFA brands), hunting rifles, sextants, typewriters, and wristwatches.\nUntil the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of imported basic foodstuffs such as sugar and coffee. East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a hard currency) and the necessary foreign currency account could afford West German products and export-quality East German products via Intershop. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish Jauerfood, and Genex companies.\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\". At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM). Economic issues would also persist in East Germany after the reunification of the West and the East. According to Manfred G\u00f6rtemaker, \"In 1991 alone, 153 billion DM had to be transferred to eastern Germany to secure incomes, support businesses and improve infrastructure. [...] From 1991 to 1999, this resulted in a total of 1.634 trillion [DM]. [...] The sums were so large that public debt in Germany more than doubled. [...]\"\nConsumption and jobs.\nLoyalty to the SED was a primary criterion for getting a good job \u2013 professionalism was secondary to political criteria in personnel recruitment and development.\nBeginning in 1963 with a series of secret international agreements, East Germany recruited workers from Poland, Hungary, Cuba, Albania, Mozambique, Angola, and North Vietnam. They numbered more than 100,000 by 1989. Many, such as future politician Zeca Schall (who emigrated from Angola in 1988 as a contract worker), stayed in Germany after the Wende.\nTelecommunications.\nBy the mid-1980s, East Germany possessed a well-developed communications system. There were approximately 3.6\u00a0million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 Telex stations. The Deutsche Post der DDR (East German Post Office) operated both these networks. East Germany was assigned telephone country code +37; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, direct distance dialing for long-distance calls was not possible. Although area codes were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for local calls and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at F\u00fcrstenwalde for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, Intersputnik.\nComputing.\nProduction of computers in the GDR began to accelerate dramatically in the 1980\u2019s. From 12,700 PCs manufactured in the years 1980-85, there were 57,400 produced in 1989. However, around 45% of these were exported, largely to the wider Soviet Union. This meant that only around 30,000 entered the GDR economy directly that year. This number was minute in comparison to many Western countries and so while the GDR was a relative forerunner in terms of the early implementation of computers it struggled to produce sufficient PCs to meet demand.\nImportation of Western made computers to the GDR was attempted by IBM from at least the early 1960s but they were only officially accepted from 1968. In some cases, these exported systems were found by the Stasi to contain espionage devices. In order to keep pace with the West, GDR manufacturers copied elements of both the hardware and software. VEB Robotron was the largest manufacturer of electronics and its PC designs were copied extensively from IBMs. GDR programmers were also of fundamental importance in the Soviet Union\u2019s ability to successfully copy an IBM architecture and use it in its own Unified System of Computer Electronics (ES EVM).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe East German population declined by three million people throughout its forty-one year history, from 19\u00a0million in 1948 to 16\u00a0million in 1990; of the 1948 population, some four million were deported from the lands east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line, which made the home of millions of Germans part of Poland and the Soviet Union. This was in contrast to Poland's population, which increased during that time from 24\u00a0million in 1950 (a little more than East Germany) to 38\u00a0million (more than twice of East Germany's population). This was primarily a result of emigration\u00a0\u2013 about one quarter of East Germans left the country before the Berlin Wall was completed in 1961, and after that time, East Germany had very low birth rates, except for a recovery in the 1980s when the birth rate in East Germany was considerably higher than in West Germany.\nReligion.\nReligion became contested ground in the GDR, with the governing communists promoting state atheism, although some people remained loyal to Christian communities. In 1957, the state authorities established a State Secretariat for Church Affairs to handle the government's contact with churches and with religious groups; the SED remained officially atheist.\nIn 1950, 85% of the GDR citizens were Protestants, while 10% were Catholics. In 1961, the renowned philosophical theologian Paul Tillich claimed that the Protestant population in East Germany had the most admirable Church in Protestantism, because the communists there had not been able to win a spiritual victory over them. By 1989, membership in the Christian churches had dropped significantly. Protestants constituted 25% of the population, Catholics 5%. The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.\nState atheism.\nWhen it first came to power, the Communist Party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism\u2013Leninism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first, the promotion of Marxist\u2013Leninist atheism received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced. This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.\nProtestantism.\nEast Germany, historically, was majority Protestant (primarily Lutheran) from the early stages of the Protestant Reformation onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the Nazi-oriented German Christians, Lutheran, Reformed, and United churches from most parts of Germany united as the Protestant Church in Germany (\"Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland\"; EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (\"Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach\").\nIn 1969, the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and East Berlin broke away from the EKD and formed the \"Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic\" (; BEK); the Moravian \"Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeinde\" also joined in 1970. In June 1991, following the German reunification, the BEK churches remerged with the EKD.\nBetween 1956 and 1971, the leadership of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation. From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the Church on the rising generation. The Church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, church leaders started to view the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. Still, churches reserved their right to reject state demands on matters that they felt were not in accordance with the will of God. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to church leaders that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.\nManfred Stolpe became a lawyer for the Brandenburg Protestant Church in 1959 before taking up a position at church headquarters in Berlin. In 1969 he helped found the (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\nApart from the Protestant state churches (, united in the EKD/BEK) and the Catholic Church, there were a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches () united in the Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic and the Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany, as well as the Free Lutheran Church, the Old Lutheran Church, and Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic. The Moravian Church also had its presence as the . There were also other Protestants such as Methodists, Adventists, Mennonites, and Quakers.\nCatholicism.\nThe smaller Catholic Church in eastern Germany had a fully functioning episcopal hierarchy in full accord with the Vatican. During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.\nAfter 1945, the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of Caritas, a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.\nWith a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns. The government responded by limiting international contacts for bishops.\nList of apostolic administrators:\nEducation.\nChildcare system.\nAbout 600,000 children and youth were involved in East German residential childcare system. Among the worst of the residential homes was Torgau penal institution, which housed juveniles until 1975. Life there was 'characterised by strict domineering control and harassment. Inmates were spied on by fellow prisoners and prison wardens. The prison was decrepit and overcrowded.'\nCulture.\nEast Germany's culture was deeply influenced by communist ideology and was characterized by efforts to distinguish itself from the West, particularly West Germany and the United States. The ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) implemented a comprehensive cultural policy (Kulturpolitik) aimed at promoting socialist values and suppressing dissenting views. All forms of artistic and literary expression were subject to state censorship to ensure alignment with socialist ideals.\nThe GDR leadership established institutions like the Gesellschaft zur Verbreitung wissenschaftlicher Kenntnisse (Society for the Dissemination of Scientific Knowledge), also known as Urania, to educate the population in science, technology, medicine, economics, and social sciences. This initiative reflected the state's commitment to advancing scientific knowledge and economic development.\nEducation in East Germany was designed to integrate vocational training with ideological instruction. The polytechnic secondary school (POS) system emphasized subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and political education, aiming to produce citizens aligned with Marxist-Leninist ideals.\nCultural production, including literature and music, was guided by state policies. The Aufbauliteratur movement (1949\u20131961) exemplified literature that aligned with the state's political program, aiming to educate citizens in loyalty to the socialist ideology. In music, the state supported education but imposed guidelines to ensure that artistic expressions conformed to socialist values. Musicians in genres like rock, blues, and folk navigated these restrictions, sometimes facing conflicts with the state.\nPublic perception of the state's ideals evolved over time. While some East Germans viewed their culture as embodying a more authentic and healthier mentality compared to that of West Germany, others became increasingly critical of the state's ideological commitments. Studies have shown that even decades after reunification, individuals from the former East Germany exhibit stronger preferences for state involvement in providing social welfare compared to their West German counterparts.\nMusic.\nA special feature of GDR culture is the broad spectrum of German rock bands. The Puhdys and Karat were some of the most popular mainstream bands in East Germany. Like most mainstream acts, they were members of the SED and appeared in state-run popular youth magazines such as \"Neues Leben\" and \"Magazin\". Other popular rock bands were Wir, City, Silly, and Pankow. Most of these artists recorded on the state-owned AMIGA label.\nThe schlager genre, which was very popular in the West, also gained a foothold early on in East Germany, and numerous musicians, such as Gerd Christian, Uwe Jensen, and Hartmut Schulze-Gerlach gained national fame. From 1962 to 1976, an international schlager festival was held in Rostock, garnering participants from between 18 and 22 countries each year. The city of Dresden held a similar international festival for schlager musicians from 1971 until shortly before reunification. There was a national schlager contest hosted yearly in Magdeburg from 1966 to 1971 as well.\nBands and singers from other socialist countries were popular, such as Czerwone Gitary from Poland known as the . Czech Karel Gott, the Golden Voice from Prague, was beloved in both German states. Hungarian band Omega performed in both German states, and Yugoslavian band Korni Grupa toured East Germany in the 1970s.\nWest German television and radio could be received in many parts of the East. The Western influence led to the formation of more \"underground\" groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands \u2013 the so-called \"Die anderen Bands\" (\"the other bands\") \u2013 were , Die Art, and Feeling B. Additionally, hip hop culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as \"Beat Street\" and \"Wild Style\", young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop culture of their own. East Germans accepted hip hop as more than just a music form. The entire street culture surrounding rap entered the region and became an outlet for oppressed youth.\nThe government of the GDR was invested in both promoting the tradition of German classical music, and in supporting composers to write new works in that tradition. Notable East German composers include Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Ernst Hermann Meyer, Rudolf Wagner-R\u00e9geny, and Kurt Schwaen.\nThe birthplace of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\u20131750), Eisenach, was rendered as a museum about him, featuring more than three hundred instruments, which, in 1980, received some 70,000 visitors. In Leipzig, the Bach archive contains his compositions and correspondence and recordings of his music.\nGovernmental support of classical music maintained some 168 publicly funded concert, opera, chamber, and radio orchestras, such as Gewandhausorchester and Thomanerchor in Leipzig; S\u00e4chsische Staatskapelle in Dresden; and Berliner Sinfonie Orchester and Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin. Kurt Masur was their prominent conductor.\nCensorship in the music sector.\nAll productions were subject to censorship. Texts had to be submitted and shows approved in advance; performances were watched. No one was exempt from this, not even famous artists with connections to the highest circles of the SED government. Under this pressure, strategies were developed to bring critical texts to the audience despite censorship. For example, Heinz Quermann always deliberately built an extreme gag into his entertainment programme so that the censors would have something to cut and the other gags would be less critically scrutinised. Tamara Danz of the band Silly founded the term \"green elephant\" (\"gr\u00fcner Elefant\") for such passages.\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, the music of the Beatles influenced GDR youth. Initially, this music was still tolerated and supported by the GDR leadership, especially with the help of the FDJ. The high point of this era was 1965, when GDR bands not only got radio and television appearances but were even allowed to make recordings. However, the SED realised that it could not control and steer this movement, which was basically rebellious and oriented towards the West. In response, most beat bands were therefore simply banned, the others were strictly controlled. For example, Thomas Natschinski's band had to change its English name \"Team 4\" to the German name \"Thomas Natschinski and his group\". Other bands were not so conformist. Renft in particular was repeatedly banned from performing and later also the blues rock band Freygang, whose members went into hiding and then played under pseudonyms. This crackdown led to the Leipzig Beat Revolt in October that year.\nEven convinced socialists were banned from performing if their ideas of socialism differed from those of the SED. In 1976, singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann was allowed to tour in the West; this was immediately taken as an opportunity to denaturalise him and refuse him permission to return. Numerous artists protested against this and were forced to leave the country \u2013 some after serving prison sentences \u2013 including members of Renft, as well as Manfred Krug and Nina Hagen. Other artists left voluntarily. Veronika Fischer, for example, did not return from a performance in West Berlin in 1981, whereupon her songs were no longer allowed to be played by GDR radio stations.\nWest German productions were also subject to censorship in East Germany. For example, the song by Udo J\u00fcrgens \"\" (\"Once Upon a Time There Was a Balloon\") was put on the Index because of the line, \"They know no borders, the balloons of the world\". It was not until 1987 that J\u00fcrgens was again allowed to perform in the GDR. Udo Lindenberg had similar problems. Despite all his efforts (such as his song \"\" (\"Special Train to Pankow\")), he was only allowed to perform once before the fall of the Berlin Wall, at the Palast der Republik on the occasion of the event \"\" (\"Rock for Peace\") on 25 October 1983.\nIn the 1980s, censorship seemed to loosen up. Lyrics about the longing for freedom (including \"Albatros\" by Karat) became possible. But it was only in the course of the peaceful revolution that songs by Veronika Fischer were heard on the radio again in October 1989.\nTheatre.\nEast German theatre was originally dominated by Bertolt Brecht, who brought back many artists out of exile and reopened the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm with his Berliner Ensemble. Alternatively, other influences tried to establish a \"working-class theatre\", played for the working class by the working class.\nAfter Brecht's death, conflicts began to arise between his family (around Helene Weigel) and other artists about Brecht's legacy, including Slatan Dudow, Erwin Geschonneck, Erwin Strittmatter, Peter Hacks, Benno Besson, Peter Palitzsch, and Ekkehard Schall.\nIn the 1950s, the Swiss director Benno Besson with the Deutsches Theater successfully toured Europe and Asia including Japan with \"The Dragon\" by Evgeny Schwartz. In the 1960s, he became the Intendant of the Volksb\u00fchne often working with Heiner M\u00fcller.\nIn the 1970s, a parallel theatre scene sprung up, creating theatre \"outside of Berlin\" in which artists played at provincial theatres. For example, Peter Sodann founded the Neues Theater in Halle/Saale and Frank Castorf at the theater Anklam.\nTheatre and cabaret had high status in the GDR, which allowed it to be very proactive. This often brought it into confrontation with the state. Benno Besson once said, \"In contrast to artists in the west, they took us seriously, we had a bearing.\"\nThe Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin was the last major building erected by the GDR, making it an exceptional architectural testimony to how Germany overcame its former division. Today, it is a major center for Berlin's revue tradition. Other important theatres include the Berliner Ensemble, the Deutsches Theater, the Maxim Gorki Theater, and the Volksb\u00fchne.\nTelevision and radio.\nTelevision and radio in East Germany were state-run industries; the \"Rundfunk der DDR\" was the official radio broadcasting organisation from 1952 until unification. The organization was based in the \"Funkhaus Nalepastra\u00dfe\" in East Berlin. \"Deutscher Fernsehfunk\" (DFF), from 1972 to 1990 known as \"Fernsehen der DDR\" or DDR-FS, was the state television broadcaster from 1952. Like all press organs, television and radio were under tight control and censorship of the SED's Agitation Department. Reception of Western broadcasts was widespread.\nCinema.\nThe prolific cinema of East Germany was headed by the \"Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft\" (DEFA), which was subdivided in different local groups whose local teams shot and produced films. The East German industry became known worldwide for its productions, especially children's movies (\"Das kalte Herz\", film versions of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and modern productions such as \"Das Schulgespenst\").\nFrank Beyer's \"Jakob der L\u00fcgner\" (\"Jacob the Liar\"), about the Holocaust, and \"F\u00fcnf Patronenh\u00fclsen\" (\"Five Cartridges\"), about resistance against fascism, became internationally famous.\nFilms about daily life, such as \"Die Legende von Paul und Paula\", by Heiner Carow, and \"Solo Sunny\", directed by Konrad Wolf and Wolfgang Kohlhaase, were very popular.\nThe film industry was remarkable for its production of \"Ostern\", or Western-like movies. In these films, Native Americans often took the role of displaced people who fight for their rights, in contrast to the North American westerns of the time, where they were often either not mentioned at all or portrayed as villains. Yugoslavs were often cast as Native Americans because of the small number of Native Americans in Europe. Gojko Miti\u0107 was well known in these roles, often playing the righteous, kindhearted, and charming chief (as in \"Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin\" directed by Josef Mach). He became an honorary Sioux chief when he visited the United States in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his movies. American actor and singer Dean Reed, an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several films. These films were part of the phenomenon of Europe producing alternative films about the colonization of the Americas.\nCinemas in the GDR also showed foreign films. Czechoslovak and Polish productions were more common, but certain Western movies were shown, though the numbers of these were limited because it cost foreign exchange to buy the licenses. Further, films representing or glorifying what the state viewed as capitalist ideology were not bought. Comedies enjoyed great popularity, such as the Danish \"Olsen Gang\" or movies with the French comedian Louis de Fun\u00e8s.\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall, several films depicting life in the GDR have been critically acclaimed. Some of the most notable were \"Good Bye Lenin!\" by Wolfgang Becker, \"Das Leben der Anderen\" (\"The Lives of Others\") by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (which won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film) in 2006, and \"Alles auf Zucker!\" (\"Go for Zucker\") by Dani Levi. Each film is heavily infused with cultural nuances of life in the GDR.\nSport.\nEast Germany was very successful in the sports of cycling, weightlifting, swimming, gymnastics, track and field, boxing, ice skating, and winter sports. The success is largely attributed to doping under the direction of Manfred H\u00f6ppner, a sports doctor, described as the architect of East Germany's state-sponsored drug program.\nAnabolic steroids were the most detected doping substances in IOC-accredited laboratories for many years. The development and implementation of a state-supported sports doping program helped East Germany, with its small population, to become a world leader in sport during the 1970s and 1980s, winning a large number of Olympic and world gold medals and records. Another factor for success was the furtherance system for young people in the GDR. Sports teachers at school were encouraged to look for certain talents in children of ages 6 to 10. For older pupils it was possible to attend grammar schools with a focus on sports (for example sailing, football and swimming).\nSports clubs were highly subsidized, especially sports in which international fame was possible. For example, the major leagues for ice hockey and basketball just included two teams each. Football was the most popular sport. Club football teams such as Dynamo Dresden, 1. FC Magdeburg, FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, and BFC Dynamo had successes in European competition. Many East German players such as Matthias Sammer and Ulf Kirsten became integral parts of the reunified national football team.\nThe East and the West also competed via sport. GDR athletes dominated several Olympic sports; the SV Dynamo club of the security agencies won more than 200 Olympic medals. Of special interest was the only football match between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, a first-round match during the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which the East won 1\u20130; but West Germany, the host, went on to win the World Cup.\nEast Germany had a revolutionary technology for two-stroke engines called the expansion chamber, allowing them to win motorcycle races with little competition. Racer Ernst Degner defected to Japan, taking the technology secret with him over to Suzuki. After the defection, East German motorcycle racing effectively ended.\nLegacy.\nDecrepit infrastructure.\nAt the time of reunification, almost all East German highways, railroads, sewage systems, and public buildings were in a state of disrepair, as little was done to maintain infrastructure in the GDR's last decades. Over the next 30 years, unified German public spending invested more than $2 trillion into former East Germany, to make up for the region's neglect and malaise and bring it up to a minimal standard.\nThe Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant narrowly avoided an incident in 1976. It was shut down after reunification, having been deemed not meet Western safety standards.\nAuthoritarianism.\nGerman historian J\u00fcrgen Kocka in 2010 summarized the consensus of most recent scholarship:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOstalgie.\nMany East Germans initially regarded the dissolution of the GDR positively, but this reaction partly turned sour. West Germans often acted as if they had \"won\" and East Germans had \"lost\" in unification, leading many East Germans (\"Ossis\") to resent West Germans (\"Wessis\"). In 2004, Deborah Ascher Barnstone wrote, \"East Germans resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West Germans see the East Germans as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing. East Germans find 'Wessis' arrogant and pushy, West Germans think the 'Ossis' are lazy good-for-nothings.\"\nIn addition, many East German women found the West more appealing, and left the region never to return, leaving behind an underclass of poorly educated and jobless men.\nIn 2009, a majority (57%) of the people who stayed in East Germany defended the GDR, with 49% of those polled saying that \"The GDR had more good sides than bad sides. There were some problems, but life was good there\", while 8% opposed all criticism of East Germany and said that \"Life there was happier and better than in reunified Germany today\".\nAs of 2014, the vast majority of residents in the former GDR prefer to live in a unified Germany. However, a feeling of nostalgia persists among some, termed \"Ostalgie\" (a blend of \"east\" and \"nostalgia\"). This was depicted in the Wolfgang Becker film \"Goodbye Lenin!\". According to Klaus Schroeder, a historian and political scientist at the Free University of Berlin, some of the original residents of the GDR \"still feel they don't belong or that they're strangers in unified Germany\" as life in the GDR was \"just more manageable\". He warns German society should watch out in case \"Ostalgie\" results in a distortion and romanticization of the past.\nIn 2023, a poll found that among Germans living in the former East Germany, 40% identified as \"East Germans\" and 52% identified as \"Germans\".\nElectoral consequences.\nThe divide between the East and the West can be seen in contemporary German elections. The left-wing populist Die Linke party (which has roots in the SED) continues to have a stronghold and occasionally wins a plurality in the east, such as in the state of Thuringia where it remains one of the major parties. The region also sees disproportionate support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a right-wing populist party, particularly in the state of Saxony and Thuringia. This is in stark distinction to the west where the more centrist parties such as the CDU/CSU, SPD, The Greens, and the FDP dominate.\nThe far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) was represented in the Saxon State Parliament from 2004 to 2014. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the NPD was represented from 2006 to 2016.\nDemographics.\nThere are more migrants in former West Germany than in former East Germany. In 2016, in every state of former East Germany, 90\u201395% of people did not have a migrant background.\nReligion.\nAs of 2009, more Germans are non-believers in the former East Germany than in the former West Germany. Eastern Germany is perhaps the least religious region in the world. An explanation for this, popular in other regions, is the aggressive state atheist policies of the SED. However, the enforcement of atheism existed only for the first few years. After that, the state allowed churches to have a relatively high level of autonomy. Atheism is embraced by Germans of all ages, though irreligion is particularly common among younger Germans.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nGeneral.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistoriography and memory.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Granville is located west of the Sydney central business district, split between the local government areas of Cumberland City Council and the City of Parramatta.\nSouth Granville is a separate suburb. Lisgar, Redfern, Heath and Mona Streets form the approximate border between Granville and South Granville. The Duck River provides a boundary with Auburn, to the east.\nHistory.\nIn 1855, the Granville area was known as Parramatta Junction, named after the final stop of the first railway line of New South Wales. The Sydney-Parramatta Line ran from Sydney terminus, just south from today's Central railway station to the Granville area which was originally known as 'Parramatta Junction'. This led to the development of this area, which attracted speculators and some local industries.\nIn the early days of European colonisation, timber was harvested to fuel the steam engines in Sydney and Parramatta. By the 1860s, the supply of timber was exhausted. The remainder was used by scavengers who made a living by collecting firewood. Wattle bark found use with tanners and the bark from stringybark trees was used for roofing of huts. In 1862, a major estate, \"Drainville\", became subject to a mortgagee sale and subdivided for villa homes, and small agricultures. At the end of the decade a Tweed Mill was established, which was steam powered using water from the Duck River. In 1878, the locality received its own post office, which was then part of the stationmasters house.\nThe name 'Parramatta Junction' remained until 1880, when two public meetings voted that the name be changed. Some very strange names were suggested including \"Drainwell\", \"Vauxhall\", \"Nobbsville\", and \"Swagsville\", but finally the name of Granville in honour of the British Foreign Secretary, the Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville. Even then the voice of protest was raised declaring the name was \"too French\", but the dissenter was ignored.\nAt this time, the place had a population of 372, of which 176 were male and 196 female. In this era some German settlers, Joseph Klein and P W Merkell, tried to establish vineyards in the area, but eventually found the land was not suited for this type of agriculture. More farmers discovered the limitations of the local soils and fruit growers complained about the damage from flying foxes. Thus, the only practical use for the grasslands, which replaced the original bushland, was for dairy cattle.\nThe Granville Municipality was formed in 1885 and the council carried on the local government of the area until 1948, when it became part of an enlarged City of Parramatta.\nOn Anzac Day of 1974, Granville was partially severed by flooding of the Duck Creek stormwater channel due to torrential rain that fell over the area. 135 millimetres of rain fell between 11.30\u00a0pm and 12.30\u00a0pm at Guildford, with the ensuing flood doing major damage through Granville. The nearby RSL was damaged and many of the club's old photographs and honour boards were destroyed.\nGranville is also the location of the Granville railway disaster, which occurred on 18 January 1977 when a commuter train derailed just before the Bold Street overpass and hit the stanchion, causing the bridge to collapse. 83 people perished, making it the worst rail disaster in Australian history.\nHeritage listings.\nGranville has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\nBuildings and places of interest.\nGranville has a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial developments. The commercial and residential developments are mostly around Granville railway station and Parramatta Road. Granville is primarily dominated by freestanding weatherboard, fibro and unrendered brick buildings. The area is no longer exactly \"typical\" quarter acre block territory, but blocks are reasonably common. Terraced houses are rare, but increasing in number. Apartment blocks, generally three to four storeys in height, are also becoming more common in the vicinity of the railway station.\nBuildings that deserve some attention are:\nCrest Theatre.\nThe \"Crest\" building on the corner of Blaxcell and Redfern Streets, was built by Hoyts in 1948 as a movie theatre and was used for screening films up until 1963. The structure of the building is of a Quonset hut design, while the facade and interior is of a post-Art Deco and post-Moderne eclectic style, influenced by the \"Picture Palace\" architecture popularly used for movie theatres. It is now used as a function hall.\nThe Crest Theatre is now listed in the NSW State Heritage Register as being of \"State significance\", being one of the few cinemas built in Australia in the 1940s. Externally and internally the building remains largely intact, though the signage on the external decorative pier now reads \"B-L-O-U-Z-A\", rather than the original \"H-O-Y-T-S\" (later it was \"B-I-N-G-O\").\nTransport.\nTrains.\nGranville railway station has traditionally been a major station on the Main Western railway line, though many services have now been removed due to prioritisation of Mountains trains over the needs of local residents. It is served by T1 Northern &amp; Western Lines and T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line Sydney Trains services. Granville's bus interchange, as well as a car park, are located adjacent to its train station.\nBus.\nGranville is serviced by Transdev NSW and features a newly built bus interchange. Transdev NSW operates three bus routes via Granville railway station:\nGranville station is served by one NightRide (Night Bus) route:\nRoad.\nParramatta Road has always been an important thoroughfare for Sydney from its earliest days, when it was known as \"Dog Trap Road,\" due to the outside of using small wheeled buggies - similar sleds - pulled by dogs at that time. From Parramatta the major western road for the state is the Great Western Highway.\nThe M4 Western Motorway, running parallel to the Great Western Highway has taken much of the traffic away from these roads, with entrance and exit ramps close to Parramatta.\nEducation.\nGranville has a major college of Technical and Further Education, which is part of the South Western Sydney Institute of TAFE. Schools include Granville Boys High School which was founded in 1926, Delany College, Granville Public School, Granville East Public School, Blaxcell Street Public School and Holy Family Catholic School. The suburb is also home to a Cumberland Council branch library.\nCulture.\nSport.\nGranville has an Olympic size pool and a football facility. Historic Garside Park is home to State Super League and Super Youth League club, Granville Rage.\nSydney Speedway is a dirt track speedway which opened in 1977 at the old Granville Showground as the Parramatta Speedway. The clay surface caters mainly to Sprintcars and has been home to some of Australia's greatest drivers including ten times Australian Sprintcar Champion Garry Rush, and multiple title holders George Tatnell, his son Brooke Tatnell, and Max Dumesny. The speedway is also the only venue not in North or Central America to host a round of the famous World of Outlaws sprintcar series.\nGranville Magpies Soccer Club entered the Sydney competition in the early 1880s and has continued to compete with distinction until the early 2000s. The club originally played matches at a paddock behind Hudson Brothers' Works in Clyde before relocating to Macarthur Park, known nowadays as F.S. Garside Park.\nDemographics.\n2011 Census.\nAt the 2011 census, there were 13,989 residents in Granville. More than half of people were born outside of Australia, with the top countries of birth being India, China and Lebanon. Three-quarters of people spoke a language other than English at home. The most common other languages spoken at home were Arabic 18.1%, Cantonese 5.5%, Mandarin 4.8%, Turkish 2.3% and Tongan 2.0%. The housing in Granville was evenly spread between detached houses and higher density units or apartments. 46.3% of residents were renting their home and this was higher than the national average of 29.6%.\n2016 Census.\nData from the 2016 census shows that the population of Granville was 15,332.

{"id": "13062", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13062", "title": "Georg Philipp Telemann", "text": "German Baroque composer (1681\u20131767)\nGeorg Philipp Telemann (; 24 March\u00a0[O.S. 14 March]\u00a01681 \u2013 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. He is one of the most prolific composers in history, at least in terms of surviving works. Telemann was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the leading German composers of the time, and he was compared favourably both to his friend Johann Sebastian Bach, who made Telemann the godfather and namesake of his son Carl Philipp Emanuel, and to George Frideric Handel, whom Telemann also knew personally.\nAlmost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of that city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died less than two years after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving him. As part of his duties, he wrote a considerable amount of music for educating organists under his direction. This includes 48 chorale preludes and 20 small fugues (modal fugues) to accompany his chorale harmonisations for 500 hymns. His music incorporates French, Italian, and German national styles, and he was at times even influenced by Polish popular music. He remained at the forefront of all new musical tendencies, and his music stands as an important link between the late Baroque and early Classical styles. The Telemann Museum in Hamburg is dedicated to him.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife.\nEarly life (1681\u20131712).\nTelemann was born in Magdeburg, then the capital of the semi-autonomous Duchy of Magdeburg within the Electorate of Brandenburg, in the Holy Roman Empire. His father Heinrich, deacon at the Heilig-Geist-Kirche (Magdeburg), died when Telemann was four. The future composer received his first music lessons at 10, from a local organist, and became immensely interested in music in general, and composition in particular. Despite opposition from his mother and relatives, who forbade any musical activities, Telemann found it possible to study and composed in secret, even creating an opera at the age of 12.\nIn 1697, after studies at the Domschule in Magdeburg and at a school in Zellerfeld, Telemann was sent to the famous Gymnasium Andreanum at Hildesheim, where his musical talent flourished, supported by school authorities, including the rector himself. Telemann was becoming equally adept both at composing and performing, teaching himself flute, oboe, violin, viola da gamba, recorder, double bass, and other instruments. In 1701 he graduated from the Gymnasium and went to Leipzig to become a student at the Leipzig University, where he intended to study law. He ended up becoming a professional musician, regularly composing works for the Nikolaikirche and even St. Thomas (Thomaskirche). In 1702 he became director of the municipal opera house \"Opernhaus auf dem Br\u00fchl\", and later music director at the Neukirche. Prodigiously productive, Telemann supplied a wealth of new music for Leipzig, including several operas, one of which was his first major opera, \"Germanicus\". However, he became engaged in a conflict with the cantor of the Thomaskirche, Johann Kuhnau. The conflict intensified when Telemann started employing numerous students for his projects, including those who were Kuhnau's, from the Thomasschule.\nTelemann left Leipzig in 1705 at the age of 24, after receiving an invitation to become \"Kapellmeister\" for the court of Count Erdmann II of Promnitz at Sorau (now \u017bary, Poland). His career there was cut short in early 1706 by the hostilities of the Great Northern War, and after a short period of travels he entered the service of Duke Johann Wilhelm, in Eisenach where Johann Sebastian Bach was born. He became \"Konzertmeister\" on 24 December 1708 and Secretary and \"Kapellmeister\" in August 1709. During his tenure at Eisenach, Telemann wrote a great deal of music: at least four annual cycles of church cantatas, dozens of sonatas and concertos, and other works. In 1709, he married Amalie Louise Juliane Eberlin, lady-in-waiting to the Countess of Promnitz and daughter of the musician Daniel Eberlin. Their daughter was born in January 1711. The mother died soon afterwards, leaving Telemann depressed and distraught.\nFrankfurt (1712\u20131721).\nAfter around a year he sought another position, and moved to Frankfurt on 18 March 1712 at the age of 31, to become city music director and \"Kapellmeister\" at the Barf\u00fc\u00dferkirche and St. Catherine's Church. In Frankfurt, he fully gained his mature personal style. Here, as in Leipzig, he was a powerful force in the city's musical life, creating music for two major churches, civic ceremonies, and various ensembles and musicians. By 1720 he had adopted the use of the da capo aria, which had been adopted by composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Operas such as \"Narciso\", which was brought to Frankfurt in 1719, written in the Italian idiom of composition, made a mark on Telemann's output.\nOn 28 August 1714, three years after his first wife had died, Telemann married again, Maria Catharina Textor, daughter of a Frankfurt council clerk. They eventually had nine children. This was a source of much personal happiness, and helped him produce compositions. Telemann continued to be extraordinarily productive and successful, even augmenting his income by working for Eisenach employers as a \"Kapellmeister\" \"von Haus aus\", that is, regularly sending new music while not actually living in Eisenach. Telemann's first published works also appeared during the Frankfurt period. His output increased rapidly, for he fervently composed overture-suites and chamber music, most of which is unappreciated. These works included his 6 Sonatas for solo violin, known as the \"Frankfurt Sonatas\", published in 1715. In the latter half of the Frankfurt period, he composed an innovative work, his Viola Concerto in G major, which is twice the length of his violin concertos. Also, here he composed his first choral masterpiece, his \"Brockes Passion\", in 1716.\nHamburg (1721\u20131767).\nTelemann accepted the invitation to work in Hamburg as \"Kantor\" of the Johanneum Lateinschule, and music director of the five largest churches in 1721. Soon after arrival, Telemann encountered some opposition from church officials who found his secular music and activities to be too much of a distraction for both Telemann himself and the townsfolk. The next year, when Johann Kuhnau died and the city of Leipzig was looking for a new \"Thomaskantor\", Telemann applied for the job and was approved, yet declined after Hamburg authorities agreed to give him a suitable raise. After another candidate, Christoph Graupner, declined, the post went to Johann Sebastian Bach.\nTelemann took a few small trips outside Germany at this time. However, later in the Hamburg period he travelled to Paris and stayed for eight months, 1737 into 1738. He heard and was impressed by \"Castor et Pollux\", an opera by French composer Jean-Philippe Rameau. From then on, he incorporated the French operatic style into his vocal works. Before then, his influence was primarily Italian and German. Apart from that, Telemann remained in Hamburg for the rest of his life. A vocal masterpiece of this period is his \"St Luke Passion\" from 1728, which is a prime example of his fully matured vocal style.\nHis first years there were plagued by marital troubles: his wife's infidelity, and her gambling debts, which amounted to a sum larger than Telemann's annual income. The composer was saved from bankruptcy by the efforts of his friends, and by the numerous successful music and poetry publications Telemann made during the years 1725 to 1740. By 1736 husband and wife were no longer living together because of their financial disagreements. Although still active and fulfilling the many duties of his job, Telemann became less productive in the 1740s, when he was in his 60s. He took up theoretical studies, as well as hobbies such as gardening and cultivating exotic plants, something of a fad in Hamburg at that time, and a hobby shared by Handel.\nMost of the music of the 1750s appears to have been parodied from earlier works. Telemann's eldest son Andreas died in 1755, and Andreas' son Georg Michael Telemann was raised by the aging composer. Troubled by health problems and failing eyesight in his last years, Telemann was still composing into the 1760s. He died, aged 86, on the evening of 25 June 1767 from what was recorded at the time as a \"chest ailment.\" He was succeeded in his Hamburg post by his godson, Johann Sebastian Bach's second son, Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach.\nLegacy and influence.\nTelemann was one of the most prolific major composers of all time: his all-encompassing oeuvre comprises more than 3,000 compositions, half of which have been lost, and most of which have not been performed since the 18th century. From 1708 to 1750, Telemann composed 1,043 sacred cantatas and 600 overture-suites, and types of concertos for combinations of instruments that no other composer of the time employed. The first accurate estimate of the number of his works was provided by musicologists only during the 1980s and 1990s, when extensive thematic catalogues were published. During his lifetime and the latter half of the 18th century, Telemann was very highly regarded by colleagues and critics alike. Numerous theorists (Marpurg, Mattheson, Quantz, and Scheibe, among others) cited his works as models, and major composers such as J.S. Bach and Handel bought and studied his published works. He was immensely popular not only in Germany but also in the rest of Europe: orders for editions of Telemann's music came from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, and Spain. It was only in the early 19th century that his popularity came to a sudden halt. Most lexicographers started dismissing him as a \"polygraph\" who composed too many works, a \"Vielschreiber\" for whom quantity came before quality. Such views were influenced by an account of Telemann's music by Christoph Daniel Ebeling, a late-18th-century critic who in fact praised Telemann's music and made only passing critical remarks of his productivity. After the Bach revival, Telemann's works were judged as inferior to Bach's and lacking in deep religious feeling. For example, by 1911, the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" lacked an article about Telemann, and in one of its few mentions of him referred to \"the vastly inferior work of lesser composers such as Telemann\" in comparison to Handel and Bach.\nParticularly striking examples of such judgements were produced by noted Bach biographers Philipp Spitta and Albert Schweitzer, who criticized Telemann's cantatas and then praised works they thought were composed by Bach, but which were composed by Telemann. The last performance of a substantial work by Telemann (\"Der Tod Jesu\") occurred in 1832, and it was not until the 20th century that his music started being performed again. The revival of interest in Telemann began in the first decades of the 20th century and culminated in the B\u00e4renreiter critical edition of the 1950s. Today each of Telemann's works is usually given a TWV number, which stands for \"Telemann-Werke-Verzeichnis\" (Telemann Works Catalogue).\nTelemann's music was one of the driving forces behind the late Baroque and the early Classical styles. Starting in the 1710s he became one of the creators and foremost exponents of the so-called German mixed style, an amalgam of German, French, Italian and Polish styles. Over the years, his music gradually changed and started incorporating more and more elements of the galant musical style, but he never completely adopted the ideals of the nascent Classical era: Telemann's style remained contrapuntally and harmonically complex, and already in 1751 he dismissed much contemporary music as too simplistic. Composers he influenced musically included pupils of J.S. Bach in Leipzig, such as Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach and Johann Friedrich Agricola, as well as those composers who performed under his direction in Leipzig (Christoph Graupner, Johann David Heinichen and Johann Georg Pisendel), composers of the Berlin \"lieder\" school, and finally, his numerous pupils, none of whom, however, became major composers.\nEqually significant for the history of music were Telemann's publishing activities. By pursuing exclusive publication rights for his works, he set one of the most important early precedents for regarding music as the intellectual property of the composer. The same attitude informed his public concerts, where Telemann frequently performed music originally composed for ceremonies attended only by a select few members of the upper class.\nPartial list of works.\nSonatas.\nSonata da chiesa, TWV 41:g5 (for Melodic instrument \u2013 Violin, Flute or Oboe, from \"Der getreue Musikmeister\")\nMedia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\nExternal links.\nFurther information on Telemann and his works\nModern editions\nFree sheet music"}

An 84th victim, an unborn child, was added to the fatality list in 2017.\nDisaster.\nThe train involved in the disaster consisted of eight wooden bodied Supplementary Interurban Passenger Carriages, which had been converted from country passenger stock by the PTC, which were hauled by 46 class electric locomotive 4620, which had commenced its journey towards Sydney from Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains at 6:09\u00a0a.m.\nAt approximately 8:10\u00a0a.m. it was approaching Granville railway station when the locomotive derailed and struck one of the steel-and-concrete pillars supporting the bridge carrying Bold Street over the railway cutting.\nThe derailed engine and first two carriages passed the bridge, with the first carriage being separated free from the other carriages and torn open when it collided with a severed overhead stanchion from beside the track, killing eight passengers instantly.\nThe remaining carriages (cars 2 to 8) came to a halt with the second carriage clear of the bridge, and the rear half of the third carriage, along with the forward half of the fourth carriage, coming to rest under the weakened bridge, whose weight was estimated at . Carriages 5, 6, 7 and 8 were clear of the bridge at the Harris Park (or country side) of the bridge and were not affected by the incident other than passengers suffering minor injuries or from the shock of being involved in the incident.\nWithin 15 seconds, with the majority of its supports demolished, the bridge including several motor cars that were driving across at the time, collapsed on top of the carriages, demolishing their wooden bodies and crushing the passengers inside.\nOf the total number of passengers travelling in the third and fourth carriages, half were killed instantly when the bridge fell on them, crushing them in their seats, some to the point where their head and shoulders were below the level of their knees.\nOf the 213 injured, some of the trapped were in the train for hours after the accident, with parts of the bridge, parts of the carriage body, broken carriage seating, or deceased passengers crushing them, hampering rescuers. Some of these injured had been conscious and lucid, talking to rescuers and explaining their experiences of the event, however, most died of crush syndrome soon after the weight was removed from their bodies.\nRescuers also faced the greater difficulty of the weight of the bridge, which was still crushing the affected carriages and reducing the available space in which they could work in to rescue survivors. At one stage of the rescue, a declaration was made by those in charge that no one was permitted to attempt further rescues until the collapsed bridge had been lifted clear of the site. Soon after however, the bridge settled a further onto the train, trapping two rescuers and crushing a portable generator \"like butter\".\nAnother major danger came from Liquid Petroleum Gas, as LPG cylinders were being kept year-round on board the train to be used in the winters for heating purposes.\nSeveral of the deceased were overcome by the gas leaking from ruptured cylinders, reducing the amount of available breathable air in the area underneath the bridge. This leaking gas also prevented the immediate use of powered rescue tools such as petrol powered saws and cutting equipment due to the risk of explosion. The NSW Fire Brigade provided enough ventilation equipment to dispel the gas, as well as a constant mist/film of water, sprayed over the accident site to prevent the possibility of the gas ignition.\nThe train driver, the assistant crewman (the \"second man\"), and the motorists including one motorcyclist driving on the fallen bridge all survived.\nThe operation lasted from 8:12\u00a0a.m. Tuesday until 6:00\u00a0a.m. Thursday. Ultimately, 84 people were killed in the accident, including an unborn child.\nAftermath.\nThe Bold Street Bridge was rebuilt as a single span without any intermediate support piers, and other bridges similar to the destroyed bridge had their piers reinforced.\nThe original inquiry into the accident found that the primary cause of the crash was \"the very unsatisfactory condition of the permanent way\", being the poor fastening of the track, causing the track to spread and allowing the left front wheel of the locomotive to come off the rail.\nHowever, it was found that there were other contributing factors that included the structure of the bridge itself, the condition of the track, and the condition of the locomotive.\nWhen built, the base of the Bold Street Bridge was found to be one metre lower than the road surface at each adjoining street. In order to bring the bridge road surface up to the same height as the street concrete was added on top to remove the difference. This additional weight, adding almost triple the originally designed weight of the bridge, significantly added to the destruction of the wooden train carriages.\nIt was found that the track immediately prior to the curve leading into the area of Bold Street Bridge had not been maintained correctly, leading to the locomotives' wheels to push the track out of gauge, which led to the front right-hand wheel to leave the track, effectively derailing the locomotive.\nLocomotive 4620 had been involved in a similar accident twelve years earlier, when it had derailed at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains when operating a freight service. 4620 jumped the tracks as it entered the loop at the western end (country side) of Wentworth Falls platform, resulting in the entire train derailing. The cause was found to be an irregular operation of the train brake pipe. After being recovered from this accident, 4620 had the dents and scratches repaired and placed back into service.\nThe carriages involved were wooden bodied Supplementary Interurban Passenger Carriages, which had been converted from Country Passenger Stock by the PTC to Interurban Passenger stock. This was done by removing the previous internal arrangement of individual compartments and making the carriages an open plan similar to how passenger stock is today. This left the cars with only the side and end walls supporting the roof instead of a number of internal walls bearing the weight of the roof. It is entirely possible that if the cars had been left as built, with individual compartments, then whilst the collapse of the bridge would have crushed the carriages, the internal walls could have prevented the cars from being completely destroyed, enabling passenger to survive in pockets rather than simply being crushed.\nThe disaster prompted substantial increases in rail-maintenance expenditure, something that had been experiencing a deficiency decline since the Second World War due to the reduction available of materials, finances, and labour forces. The Public Transport Commission of NSW soon after the accident immediately began a systematic process of track maintenance in order to prevent another incident like this from occurring.\nThe train driver, Edward Olencewicz, was exonerated by the inquiry due to the exhaustive investigation into the incident.\nDue to the Granville rail disaster and the number of victims who suffered from crush syndrome (a little understood medical condition at the time), a number of changes were made as to how crush injuries are dealt with by rescue personnel, not only at incidents such as this, but also for smaller rescues as well.\nOn 4 May 2017, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian apologised to the victims of the disaster, in Parliament House after extensive pushing for the apology.\nMemorial.\nFamilies and friends of the victims and survivors gather with surviving members of the rescue crews annually. The ceremony ends with the throwing of 84 roses on to the tracks to mark the number of passengers killed. In 2007, a plaque was placed on the bridge to mark the efforts of railway workers who assisted in rescuing survivors from the train.\nThe original group, known as 'the trust', made submissions on rail safety issues, including recommending that fines for safety breaches be dedicated to rail safety improvements, and campaigning for the establishment of an independent railway safety ombudsman.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13066", "revid": "49855342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13066", "title": "George Gershwin", "text": "American composer and pianist (1898\u20131937)\nGeorge Gershwin (; born Jacob Gershwine; September 26, 1898\u00a0\u2013 July 11, 1937) was an American composer and pianist whose compositions spanned jazz, popular and classical music. Among his best-known works are the songs \"Swanee\" (1919) and \"Fascinating Rhythm\" (1924), the orchestral compositions \"Rhapsody in Blue\" (1924) and \"An American in Paris\" (1928), the jazz standards \"Embraceable You\" (1928) and \"I Got Rhythm\" (1930) and the opera \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935), which included the hit \"Summertime\". His \"Of Thee I Sing\" (1931) was the first musical to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.\nGershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell, and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and with Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris, intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, but she refused him, afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style; Maurice Ravel voiced similar objections when Gershwin inquired about studying with him. He subsequently composed \"An American in Paris\", returned to New York City and wrote \"Porgy and Bess\" with Ira and DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure, it came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the 20th century and an American cultural classic.\nGershwin moved to Hollywood and composed several film scores. He died in 1937, only 38 years old, of a brain tumor. His compositions have been adapted for use in film and television, with many becoming jazz standards.\nBiography.\nAncestors.\nGershwin's parents were both Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. His paternal grandfather, Jakov Gershovitz, was born in Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), and had served for 25 years as a mechanic for the Imperial Russian Army to earn the right of free travel and residence as a Jew, finally retiring near Saint Petersburg, Russia. Jakov's teenage son, Moishe, George Gershwin's father, worked as a leather cutter for women's shoes. George's mother, Roza Bruskina, was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nMoishe met Roza in Vilna, Russian Empire (now Vilnius, Lithuania), where her father worked as a furrier. She and her family moved to New York because of increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, changing her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service if he remained in Russia, moved to America as soon as he could afford to (arrived on August 14, 1890). Once in New York, he changed his first name to Morris. Gershovitz lived with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn, working as a foreman in a women's shoe factory. He married Rose on July 21, 1895, and Gershovitz soon Anglicized his name to Gershwine. Their first child, Ira Gershwin, was born on December 6, 1896, after which the family moved into a second-floor apartment at 242 Snediker Avenue in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn.\nEarly life.\nGeorge was born on September 26, 1898, in the Snediker Avenue apartment. His birth certificate identifies him as Jacob Gershwine, with the surname pronounced \"Gershvin\" in the Yiddish-speaking community. He was named after his grandfather, and, contrary to the American practice, had no middle name. He soon became known as George, and changed the spelling of his surname to \"Gershwin\" around the time he became a professional musician; other family members followed suit after Ira and George, another boy, Arthur Gershwin (1900\u20131981), and a girl, Frances Gershwin (1906\u20131999), were born into the family. The family lived in many different residences, as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise in which he became involved. They grew up mostly in the Yiddish Theater District. George and Ira frequented the local Yiddish theaters, with George occasionally appearing onstage as an extra.\nGeorge lived a boyhood not unusual in New York tenements, which included running around with his friends, roller-skating and misbehaving in the streets. Until 1908, he cared nothing about music. Then, as a ten-year-old, he was intrigued upon hearing his friend Maxie Rosenzweig's violin recital. The sound, and the way his friend played, captivated him. At about the same time, George's parents had bought a piano for his older brother Ira. To his parents' surprise, though, and to Ira's relief, it was George who spent more time playing it as he continued to enjoy it.\nAlthough his younger sister Frances Gershwin was the first in the family to make a living through her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife, thus precluding spending any serious time on musical endeavors. Having given up her performing career, she settled upon painting as a creative outlet, which had also been a hobby George briefly pursued. Arthur Gershwin followed in the paths of George and Ira, also becoming a composer of songs, musicals, and short piano pieces. George studied with various piano teachers for about two years (circa 1911) before finally being introduced to Charles Hambitzer by Jack Miller (circa 1913), the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra. Until his death in 1918, Hambitzer remained Gershwin's musical mentor, taught him conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts.\nTin Pan Alley and Broadway: 1913\u20131923.\nIn 1913, Gershwin left school at the age of 15 to work as a \"song plugger\" on New York City's Tin Pan Alley. He earned $15 a week from Jerome H. Remick and Company, a Detroit-based publishing firm with a branch office in New York. His first published song was \"When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get 'Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em\" in 1916. It earned the 17-year-old 50 cents.\nIn 1916, Gershwin started working for Aeolian Company and Standard Music Rolls in New York City, recording and arranging. He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names (pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn). He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and Welte-Mignon reproducing pianos. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into vaudeville, accompanying both Nora Bayes and Louise Dresser on the piano. His first song to appear on Broadway was \"Making of a Girl\", written in 1916 with Sigmund Romberg and lyrics by Harold Atteridge. It was sung in The Passing Show of 1916. His 1917 novelty rag, \"Rialto Ripples\", was a commercial success. In addition to his musical activities, he took over the management of the popular and famous gay bathhouse Lafayette Baths together with his brother Ira.\nIn 1919, Gershwin scored his first big national hit with his song \"Swanee\", with words by Irving Caesar. Al Jolson, a Broadway star and former minstrel singer, heard Gershwin perform \"Swanee\" at a party and decided to sing it in one of his shows. In the late 1910s, Gershwin met songwriter and music director William Daly. The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals \"Piccadilly to Broadway\" (1920) and \"For Goodness' Sake\" (1922), and jointly composed the score for \"Our Nell\" (1923). This was the beginning of a long friendship. Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice.\nBeginning in the early 1920s, Gershwin frequently worked with the lyricist Buddy DeSylva. In 1922, they created the experimental one-act jazz opera \"Blue Monday\", set in Harlem. It is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking \"Porgy and Bess\" introduced in 1935.\nMusicals, Europe and classical music: 1924\u20131928.\nIn 1924, Gershwin composed his first major work, \"Rhapsody in Blue\", for orchestra and piano. It was orchestrated by Ferde Grof\u00e9 and premiered by Paul Whiteman's Concert Band, in New York. It subsequently went on to be his most popular work, and established Gershwin's signature style and genius in blending vastly different musical styles, including jazz and classical music, in revolutionary ways.\nIn the same year, George and Ira Gershwin collaborated on a stage musical comedy \"Lady Be Good\", which included such future standards as \"Fascinating Rhythm\" and \"Oh, Lady Be Good!\". They followed this with \"Oh, Kay!\" (1926), \"Funny Face\" (1927) and \"Strike Up the Band\" (1927 and 1930). Gershwin allowed the latter song, with a modified title, to be used as a football fight song, \"Strike Up The Band for UCLA\".\nIn the mid-1920s, Gershwin stayed in Paris for a short period, during which he applied to study composition with the noted Nadia Boulanger, who, along with several other prospective tutors such as Maurice Ravel, turned him down, afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. Maurice Ravel's rejection letter to Gershwin told him, \"Why become a second-rate Ravel when you're already a first-rate Gershwin?\" While there, Gershwin wrote the tone poem \"An American in Paris\". This work received mixed reviews upon its first performance at Carnegie Hall on December 13, 1928, but it quickly became part of the standard repertoire in Europe and the United States.\nNew York: 1929\u20131935.\nIn 1929, the Gershwin brothers created \"Show Girl\"; the following year brought \"Girl Crazy\", which introduced the standards \"Embraceable You\", sung by Ginger Rogers, and \"I Got Rhythm\". 1931's \"Of Thee I Sing\" became the first musical comedy to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; the winners were George S. Kaufman, Morrie Ryskind, and Ira Gershwin. Gershwin spent the summer of 1934 on South Carolina's Folly Island after he was invited to visit by DuBose Heyward, author of the novel \"Porgy\". It was there that he was inspired to write the music to his opera \"Porgy and Bess\". \"Porgy and Bess\" was considered another American classic by the composer of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" \u2014 even if critics could not quite figure out how to evaluate it, or decide whether it was opera or simply an ambitious Broadway musical. \"It crossed the barriers,\" per theater historian Robert Kimball. \"It wasn't a musical work per se, and it wasn't a drama per se \u2013 it elicited response from both music and drama critics. But the work has sort of always been outside category.\"\nLast years: 1936\u20131937.\nAfter the commercial failure of \"Porgy and Bess\", Gershwin moved to Hollywood, California. He befriended Arnold Schoenberg, with whom he played tennis. In 1936, he was commissioned by RKO Pictures to write the music for the film \"Shall We Dance\", starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Gershwin's score, which married ballet with jazz in a new way, runs over an hour. It took Gershwin several months to compose and orchestrate.\nGeorge and Ira also wrote the songs for \"A Damsel in Distress\", like \"Shall We Dance\" released in 1937, and some of the songs for \"The Goldwyn Follies\". After George's death in 1937 Ira continued working with Vernon Duke on the latter film and it was released in 1938.\nGeorge and Ira's songs for those three films included an extraordinary number of popular hits and future jazz standards: \"They All Laughed\", \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" and \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\" from \"Shall We Dance\", \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" and \"A Foggy Day\" from \"A Damsel in Distress\", and \"Love Is Here to Stay\" from \"The Goldwyn Follies\".\nIllness and death.\nEarly in 1937, Gershwin began to complain of blinding headaches and a recurring impression that he smelled burning rubber. As early as February 1934, he had said he smelled burning garbage at the Detroit railway station, though those with him did not. On February 11, 1937, he performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra under the direction of French maestro Pierre Monteux. Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance. He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in Beverly Hills. Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table. She suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg's empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller. The headaches and olfactory hallucinations continued.\nOn the night of July 9, 1937, Gershwin collapsed in Harburg's house, where he had been working on the score of \"The Goldwyn Follies\". His last words were \"Fred Astaire\". He was rushed to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, and fell into a coma. Only then did his doctors come to believe that he was suffering from a brain tumor. Leonore called George's close friend Emil Mosbacher and explained the dire need to find a neurosurgeon. Mosbacher immediately called pioneering neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in Boston, who, retired for several years by then, recommended Walter Dandy, who was on a boat fishing in the Chesapeake Bay with Harry Nice, the governor of Maryland. Mosbacher called the White House and had a Coast Guard cutter sent to find the governor's yacht and bring Dandy quickly to shore.\nMosbacher then chartered a plane and flew Dandy to Newark Airport, where he was to catch a plane to Los Angeles; by that time, Gershwin's condition was critical and the need for surgery was immediate. Before Dandy could arrive, in the early hours of Sunday, July 11, 1937, doctors at Cedars removed a large brain tumor, believed to have been a glioblastoma, but Gershwin died that morning at the age of 38. The fact that he had suddenly collapsed and become comatose after he stood up on July 9 has been interpreted as brain herniation with Duret hemorrhages.\nGershwin's friends and admirers were devastated. John O'Hara remarked: \"George Gershwin died on July 11, 1937, but I don't have to believe that if I don't want to.\" He was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. A memorial concert was held at the Hollywood Bowl on September 8, 1937, at which Otto Klemperer conducted his own orchestration of the second of Gershwin's \"Three Preludes\".\nRelationship with Kay Swift.\nGershwin had a ten-year affair with composer Kay Swift, whom he frequently consulted about his music. The two never married, although she eventually divorced her husband James Warburg to commit to the relationship. Swift's granddaughter, Katharine Weber, has suggested that the pair were not married because George's mother Rose was \"unhappy that Kay Swift wasn't Jewish\". The Gershwins' 1926 musical \"Oh, Kay!\" was named for her. After Gershwin's death, Swift arranged some of his music, transcribed several of his recordings, and collaborated with his brother Ira on several projects.\nMusical style and influence.\nRodney Greenberg writes of Gershwin: \"Rhythmic and melodious, Gershwin's music fuses popular elements from the American melting-pot: the flattened notes and syncopations of African-American blues and ragtime; Hispanic rhythms; the aching cadences of Hebrew chant. More classical ingredients range from the harmonies of Chopin, Liszt and Debussy to the sprightly patter of Gilbert and Sullivan. ... His passions in classical music ranged widely, from Bach to Alban Berg.\" Gershwin was influenced by French composers of the early twentieth century. In turn, Maurice Ravel was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, \"Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works and I find them intriguing.\" The orchestrations in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.\nGershwin asked to study with Ravel. When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, \"You should give \"me\" lessons.\" (Some versions of this story feature Igor Stravinsky rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel.)\nGershwin's own Concerto in F was criticized for being related to the work of Debussy, more than to the expected jazz style. The comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore French styles. The title of \"An American in Paris\" reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: \"The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and \"Les Six\", though the tunes are original.\"\nGershwin was intrigued by the works of Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Darius Milhaud and Berg. He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons. Schoenberg refused, saying \"I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you're such a good Gershwin already.\" (This quote is similar to one credited to Ravel during Gershwin's 1928 visit to France \u2013 \"Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?\") Gershwin was particularly impressed by the music of Berg, who gave him a score of the \"Lyric Suite\". He attended the American premiere of Berg's \"Wozzeck\", conducted by Leopold Stokowski in 1931, and was \"thrilled and deeply impressed\".\nRussian Joseph Schillinger's influence as Gershwin's teacher of composition (1932\u20131936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of \"Porgy and Bess\", Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend Vernon Duke, also a Schillinger student, in an article for \"the Musical Quarterly\" in 1947.\nWhat set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice. He took the jazz he discovered on Tin Pan Alley into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era. Although George Gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music, he believed that \"true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time. My people are Americans. My time is today.\"\nIn 1983, Broadway's Uris Theatre was renamed the Gershwin Theatre in honor of George and Ira Gershwin. In 2007, the Library of Congress named its Gershwin Prize for Popular Song after George and Ira Gershwin. Recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on culture, the prize is given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins. On March 1, 2007, the first Gershwin Prize was awarded to Paul Simon.\nRecordings and film.\nEarly in his career, under both his own name and pseudonyms, Gershwin recorded more than one hundred forty player piano rolls which were a main source of his income. The majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works. Once his musical theater-writing income became substantial, his regular roll-recording career became superfluous. He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the Aeolian Company's reproducing piano, including a complete version of his \"Rhapsody in Blue\". Compared to the piano rolls, there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin's playing. His first recording was his own \"Swanee\" with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919. The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed. The recording took place before \"Swanee\" became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920. Gershwin recorded an abridged version of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with Paul Whiteman and his orchestra for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1924, soon after the world premiere. Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927. However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Whiteman and he walked out on the session. Victor's staff conductor and arranger Nathaniel Shilkret led the orchestra, though Whiteman is still credited as conductor on the original record labels.\nGershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his \"Three Preludes\" for piano. In 1929, Gershwin \"supervised\" the world premiere recording of \"An American in Paris\" with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief celeste solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section. Gershwin also appeared on several radio programs, including Rudy Vallee's, and played some of his compositions. This included the third movement of the \"Concerto in F\" with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra. Some of these performances were preserved on transcription discs and have been released on LP and CD.\nIn 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled \"Music by Gershwin\". The show was broadcast on the NBC Blue Network from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers. Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his \"Variations on I Got Rhythm\", portions of the \"Concerto in F\", and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a run-through of his \"Second Rhapsody\", conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from \"Porgy and Bess\" with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935, RCA Victor asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from \"Porgy and Bess\"; these were his last recordings.\nRCA Victor issued a 5 record 12-inch 78 rpm Memorial Album (C-29) recorded from the RCA Magic Key program broadcast on July 10, 1938, over the NBC Radio Network. It featured the Victor Salon Group conducted by Nathaniel Shilkret and singer Jane Froman. A 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing \"I Got Rhythm\" has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The Ed Sullivan Theater) in August 1931. There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on Kodachrome color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer. In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing \"Mademoiselle from New Rochelle\" and \"Strike Up the Band\" on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of \"Strike Up the Band\". In the mid-30s, \"Strike Up The Band\" was given to UCLA to be used as a football fight song, \"Strike Up The Band for UCLA\". The comedy team of Clark and McCullough are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays.\nIn 1945, the film biography \"Rhapsody in Blue\" was made, starring Robert Alda as George Gershwin. The film contains many factual errors about Gershwin's life, but also features many examples of his music, including an almost complete performance of \"Rhapsody in Blue\". In 1965, Movietone Records released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the titled \"George Gershwin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions\". The B-side of the LP featured nine other recordings. In 1975, Columbia Records released an album featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of \"Rhapsody in Blue\", accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz band accompaniment, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. The B-side of the Columbia Masterworks release features Tilson Thomas leading the New York Philharmonic in \"An American in Paris\". In 1976, RCA Records reissued a collection of Gershwin's original recordings on the album \"Gershwin plays Gershwin, Historic First Recordings\" (RCA Victrola AVM1-1740). Included was the first LP release of the 1924 recording of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and Gershwin on piano; \"An American in Paris\", from 1929 conducted by Nathaniel Shilkret with Gershwin on celesta. Also included were \"Three Preludes\", \"Clap Yo' Hands\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", among others.\nThe soundtrack to Woody Allen's 1979 film \"Manhattan\" is composed entirely of Gershwin's compositions, including \"Rhapsody in Blue\", \"Love is Sweeping the Country\", and \"But Not for Me\", performed by both the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas. The film begins with a monolog by Allen, in the role of a writer, describing a character in his book: \"He adored New York City ... To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin.\" In 1993, two audio CDs featuring piano rolls recorded by Gershwin were issued by Nonesuch Records through the efforts of Artis Wodehouse, entitled \"\". In 2010, Brian Wilson released \"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\", consisting of ten George and Ira Gershwin songs, bookended by passages from \"Rhapsody in Blue\", with two new songs completed from unfinished Gershwin fragments by Wilson and band member Scott Bennett.\nCompositions.\n Orchestral \nSolo piano\nOperas\nLondon musicals\nBroadway musicals\nFilms for which Gershwin wrote original scores\nLegacy.\nEstate.\nGershwin died intestate, and his estate passed to his mother. The estate continues to collect royalties in the United States from licensing the copyrights on his post-\"Rhapsody in Blue\" work. The estate supported the Sonny Bono Copyright Term extension Act (that extended the U.S. 75-year copyright protection an additional 20 years) because its 1923 cutoff date was shortly before Gershwin had begun to create his most popular works. The copyrights on all Gershwin's solo works expired at the end of 2007 in the European Union, based on its life-plus-70-years rule, and in the U.S. on January 1, 2020, on Gershwin's pre-1925 work.\nIn 2005, \"The Guardian\" determined using \"estimates of earnings accrued in a composer's lifetime\" that George Gershwin was the wealthiest composer of all time.\nThe George and Ira Gershwin Collection, much of which was donated by Ira and the Gershwin family estates, resides at the Library of Congress.\nIn September 2013, a partnership between the estates of Ira and George Gershwin and the University of Michigan was created and will provide the university's School of Music, Theatre, and Dance access to Gershwin's entire body of work, which includes all of Gershwin's papers, compositional drafts, and scores. This direct access to all of his works provides opportunities to musicians, composers, and scholars to analyze and reinterpret his work with the goal of accurately reflecting the composers' vision to preserve his legacy. In 2023, \"The Gershwin Critical Edition\", \"the first-ever scholarly edition of the music and lyrics of George and Ira Gershwin\", was published.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13068", "revid": "48296011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13068", "title": "Grammatical gender", "text": "Linguistic system of noun classification\nIn linguistics, a grammatical gender system is a specific form of a noun class system, where nouns are assigned to gender categories that are often not related to the real-world qualities of the entities denoted by those nouns. In languages with grammatical gender, most or all nouns inherently carry one value of the grammatical category called \"gender\". The values present in a given language, of which there are usually two or three, are called the \"genders\" of that language. Determiners, adjectives, and pronouns also change their form depending on the noun to which they refer.\nAccording to one estimate, gender is used in approximately half of the world's languages.\nOverview.\nLanguages with grammatical gender usually have two to four different genders, but some are attested with up to 20.\nCommon gender divisions include masculine and feminine; masculine, feminine, and neuter; or animate and inanimate.\nDepending on the language and the specific word, the assignment of grammatical gender may correlate with the noun\u2019s meaning (e.g., \"woman\" is typically feminine) or may be entirely arbitrary.\nIn a few languages, the assignment of any particular noun (i.e., nominal lexeme, that set of noun forms inflectable from a common lemma) to one grammatical gender is solely determined by that noun's meaning, or attributes, like biological sex, humanness, or animacy. However, the existence of words that denote male and female, such as the difference between \"aunt\" and \"uncle\" is not enough to constitute a gender system.\nIn other languages, the division into genders usually correlates to some degree, at least for a certain set of nouns, such as those denoting humans, with some property or properties of the things that particular nouns denote. Such properties include animacy or inanimacy, \"humanness\" or non-humanness, and biological sex.\nHowever, in most languages, this semantic division is only partially valid, and many nouns may belong to a gender category that contrasts with their meaning, e.g. the word for \"manliness\" could be of feminine gender, as it is in French with \"la masculinit\u00e9\" and \"la virilit\u00e9\". In such a case, the gender assignment can also be influenced by the morphology or phonology of the noun, or in some cases can be apparently arbitrary.\nUsually each noun is assigned to one of the genders, and few or no nouns can occur in more than one gender.\nGender is considered an inherent quality of nouns, and it affects the forms of other related words, a process called \"agreement\". Nouns may be considered the \"triggers\" of the process, whereas other words will be the \"target\" of these changes.\nThese related words can be, depending on the language: determiners, pronouns, numerals, quantifiers, possessives, adjectives, past and passive participles, articles, verbs, adverbs, complementizers, and adpositions. Gender class may be marked on the noun itself, but will also always be marked on other constituents in a noun phrase or sentence. If the noun is explicitly marked, both trigger and target may feature similar alternations.\nFunctions.\nThree possible functions of grammatical gender include:\nMoreover, grammatical gender may serve to distinguish homophones. It is a quite common phenomenon in language development for two phonemes to merge, thereby making etymologically distinct words sound alike. In languages with gender distinction, however, these word pairs may still be distinguishable by their gender. For example, French (\"pot\") and (\"skin\") are homophones , but disagree in gender: vs. .\nGender contrasts.\nCommon systems of gender contrast include:\nMasculine\u2013feminine contrast.\nNouns that denote specifically male persons (or animals) are normally of masculine gender; those that denote specifically female persons (or animals) are normally of feminine gender; and nouns that denote something that does not have any sex, or do not specify the sex of their referent, have come to belong to one or other of the genders, in a way that may appear arbitrary. Examples of languages with such a system include most of the modern Romance languages, the Baltic languages, the Celtic languages, some Indo-Aryan languages (e.g., Hindustani), and the Afroasiatic languages.\nMasculine\u2013feminine\u2013neuter contrast.\nThis is similar to systems with a masculine\u2013feminine contrast, except that there is a third available gender, so nouns with sexless or unspecified-sex referents may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter. There are also certain exceptional nouns whose gender does not follow the denoted sex, such as the German , meaning \"girl\", which is neuter. This is because it is actually a diminutive of \"Magd\" and all diminutive forms with the suffix are neuter. Examples of languages with such a system include later forms of Proto-Indo-European &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;, Sanskrit, some Germanic languages, most Slavic languages, a few Romance languages (Romanian, Asturian and Neapolitan), Marathi, Latin, and Greek.\nAnimate\u2013inanimate contrast.\nHere nouns that denote animate things (humans and animals) generally belong to one gender, and those that denote inanimate things to another (although there may be some deviation from that principle). Examples include earlier forms of Proto-Indo-European and the earliest family known to have split off from it, the extinct Anatolian languages &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Modern examples include Algonquian languages such as Ojibwe.\nCommon\u2013neuter contrast.\nHere a masculine\u2013feminine\u2013neuter system previously existed, but the distinction between masculine and feminine genders has been lost in nouns (they have merged into what is called \"common gender\"), though not in pronouns that can operate under natural gender. Thus nouns denoting people are usually of common gender, whereas other nouns may be of either gender. Examples include Danish and Swedish&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;, and to some extent Dutch&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nThe dialect of the old Norwegian capital Bergen also uses common gender and neuter exclusively. The common gender in Bergen and in Danish is inflected with the same articles and suffixes as the masculine gender in Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l. This makes some obviously feminine noun phrases like \"a cute girl\", \"the well milking cow\" or \"the pregnant mares\" sound strange to most Norwegian ears when spoken by Danes and people from Bergen since they are inflected in a way that sounds like the masculine declensions in South-Eastern Norwegian dialects.\nThe same does not apply to Swedish common gender, as the declensions follow a different pattern from both the Norwegian written languages. Norwegian Nynorsk, Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l and most spoken dialects retain masculine, feminine and neuter even if their Scandinavian neighbors have lost one of the genders. As shown, the merger of masculine and feminine in these languages and dialects can be considered a reversal of the original split in Proto-Indo-European &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nOther types of division or subdivision of gender.\nSome gender contrasts are referred to as \"classes\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. In some of the Slavic languages, for example, within the masculine and sometimes feminine and neuter genders, there is a further division between animate and inanimate nouns\u2014and in Polish, also sometimes between nouns denoting humans and non-humans &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. A human\u2013non-human (or \"rational\u2013non-rational\") distinction is also found in Dravidian languages &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nHow gender contrasts can influence cognition.\nIt has been shown that grammatical gender causes a number of cognitive effects. For example, when native speakers of gendered languages are asked to imagine an inanimate object speaking, whether its voice is male or female tends to correspond to the grammatical gender of the object in their language. This has been observed for speakers of Spanish, French, and German, among others.\nCaveats of this research include the possibility of subjects \"using grammatical gender as a strategy for performing the task\", and the fact that even for inanimate objects the gender of nouns is not always random. For example, in Spanish, female gender is often attributed to objects that are \"used by women, natural, round, or light\", but male gender to objects \"used by men, artificial, angular, or heavy\". Apparent failures to reproduce the effect for German speakers has also led to a proposal that the effect is restricted to languages with a two-gender system, possibly because such languages are inclined towards a greater correspondence between grammatical and natural gender.\nAnother kind of test, the semantic differential, asks people to describe a noun, and attempts to measure whether it takes on gender-specific connotations depending on the speaker's native language. For example, one study found that German speakers describing a bridge (, f.) more often used the words 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'pretty', and 'slender', while Spanish speakers, whose word for 'bridge' is masculine (, m.), used 'big', 'dangerous', 'strong', and 'sturdy' more often. However, studies of this kind have been criticized on various grounds and yield an unclear pattern of results overall.\nRelated linguistic concepts.\nNoun classes.\nA noun may belong to a given class because of characteristic features of its referent, such as sex, animacy, shape, although in some instances a noun can be placed in a particular class based purely on its grammatical behavior. Some authors use the term \"grammatical gender\" as a synonym of \"noun class\", but others use different definitions for each.\nMany authors prefer the term \"noun class\" when none of the inflections in a language relate to sex, such as when an animate\u2013inanimate distinction is made. However, the word \"gender\" derives from Latin (also the root of \"genre\") which originally meant 'kind, type', so it does not necessarily have a sexual meaning.\nNoun classifiers.\nA classifier, or measure word, is a word or morpheme used in some languages together with a noun, principally to enable numbers and certain other determiners to be applied to the noun. They are not regularly used in English or other European languages, although they parallel the use of words such as \"piece(s)\" and \"head\" in phrases like \"three pieces of paper\" or \"thirty head of cattle\". They are a prominent feature of East Asian languages, where it is common for all nouns to require a classifier when being quantified\u2014for example, the equivalent of \"three people\" is often \"three classifier people\". A more general type of classifier (classifier handshapes) can be found in sign languages.\nClassifiers can be considered similar to genders or noun classes, in that a language which uses classifiers normally has a number of different ones, used with different sets of nouns. These sets depend largely on properties of the things that the nouns denote (for example, a particular classifier may be used for long thin objects, another for flat objects, another for people, another for abstracts, etc.), although sometimes a noun is associated with a particular classifier more by convention than for any obvious reason. However it is also possible for a given noun to be usable with any of several classifiers; for example, the Mandarin Chinese classifier () is frequently used as an alternative to various more specific classifiers.\nManifestation.\nGrammatical gender can be realized as inflection and can be conditioned by other types of inflection, especially number inflection, where the singular-plural contrast can interact with gender inflection.\nAs inflection.\nThe grammatical gender of a noun manifests itself in two principal ways: in the modifications that the noun itself undergoes, and in modifications of other related words (agreement).\nAs noun inflection.\nGrammatical gender manifests itself when words related to a noun like determiners, pronouns or adjectives change their form (\"inflect\") according to the gender of noun they refer to (\"agreement\"). The parts of speech affected by gender agreement, the circumstances in which it occurs, and the way words are marked for gender vary between languages. Gender inflection may interact with other grammatical categories like number or case. In some languages the declension pattern followed by the noun itself will be different for different genders.\nThe gender of a noun may affect the modifications that the noun itself undergoes, particularly the way in which the noun inflects for number and case. For example, a language like Latin, German or Russian has a number of different declension patterns, and which pattern a particular noun follows may be highly correlated with its gender.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt; A concrete example is provided by the German word , which has two possible genders: when it is masculine (meaning \"lake\") its genitive singular form is , but when it is feminine (meaning \"sea\"), the genitive is , because feminine nouns do not take the genitive \"-s\".\nGender is sometimes reflected in other ways. In Welsh, gender marking is mostly lost on nouns; however, Welsh has initial mutation, where the first consonant of a word changes into another in certain conditions. Gender is one of the factors that can cause one form of mutation (soft mutation). For instance, the word \"girl\" changes into \"ferch\" after the definite article. This only occurs with feminine singular nouns: \"son\" remains unchanged. Adjectives are affected by gender in a similar way.\nAdditionally, in many languages, gender is often closely correlated with the basic unmodified form (lemma) of the noun, and sometimes a noun can be modified to produce (for example) masculine and feminine words of similar meaning. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs agreement or concord.\nAgreement, or concord, is a grammatical process in which certain words change their form so that values of certain grammatical categories match those of related words. Gender is one of the categories which frequently require agreement. In this case, nouns may be considered the \"triggers\" of the process, because they have an inherent gender, whereas related words that change their form to match the gender of the noun can be considered the \"target\" of these changes.\nThese related words can be, depending on the language: determiners, pronouns, numerals, quantifiers, possessives, adjectives, past and passive participles, verbs, adverbs, complementizers, and adpositions. Gender class may be marked on the noun itself, but can also be marked on other constituents in a noun phrase or sentence. If the noun is explicitly marked, both trigger and target may feature similar alternations.\nAs an example, we consider Spanish, a language with two gender categories: \"natural\" vs \"grammatical\". \"Natural\" gender can be masculine or feminine, while \"grammatical\" gender can be masculine, feminine, or neuter. This third, or \"neuter\" gender is reserved for abstract concepts derived from adjectives: such as , (\"that which is good/bad\"). Natural gender refers to the biological sex of most animals and people, while grammatical gender refers to certain phonetic characteristics (the sounds at the end, or beginning) of a noun. Among other lexical items, the definite article changes its form according to this categorization. In the singular, the article is: (masculine), and (feminine). Thus, in \"natural gender\", nouns referring to sexed beings who are male beings carry the masculine article, and female beings the feminine article (agreement).\nGender inflection and number inflection.\nIn some languages the gender is distinguished only in singular number but not in plural. In terms of linguistic markedness, these languages neutralize the gender opposition in the plural, itself a marked category. So adjectives and pronouns have three forms in singular (e.g. Bulgarian , , or German , , ) but only one in plural (Bulgarian , German ) [all examples mean \"red\"]. As a consequence \"pluralia tantum\" nouns (lacking a singular form) cannot be assigned a gender. Example with Bulgarian: (, \"pincers\"), (, \"pants\"), (, \"spectacles\"), (, \"gills\").\nOther languages, e.g. Serbo-Croatian, allow doubly marked forms both for number and gender. In these languages, each noun has a definite gender no matter the number. For example, \"children\" is feminine \"singularia tantum\" and \"door\" is neuter \"pluralia tantum\".\nOn pronouns.\nPronouns may agree in gender with the noun or noun phrase to which they refer (their antecedent). Sometimes, however, there is no antecedent\u2014the referent of the pronoun is deduced indirectly from the context: this is found with personal pronouns, as well as with indefinite and dummy pronouns.\nPersonal pronouns.\nWith personal pronouns, the gender of the pronoun is likely to agree with the \"natural gender\" of the referent. Indeed, in most European languages, personal pronouns are gendered; for example English (the personal pronouns \"he\", \"she\" and \"it\" are used depending on whether the referent is male, female, or inanimate or non-human; this is in spite of the fact that English does not generally have grammatical gender). A parallel example is provided by the object suffixes of verbs in Arabic, which correspond to object pronouns, and which also inflect for gender in the second person (though not in the first):\nNot all languages have gendered pronouns. In languages that never had grammatical gender, there is normally just one word for \"he\" and \"she\", like in Malay and Indonesian, in Hungarian and in Turkish. These languages might only have different pronouns and inflections in the third person to differentiate between people and inanimate objects, but even this distinction is often absent. In written Finnish, for example, is used for \"he\" and \"she\" and for \"it\", but in the colloquial language is usually used for \"he\" and \"she\" as well.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIssues may arise in languages with gender-specific pronouns in cases when the gender of the referent is unknown or not specified; this is a matter that arises frequently in relation to gender-neutral language, as with English usage of Singular \"they\".\nIn some cases, the gender of a pronoun is not marked in the form of the pronoun itself, but is marked on other words by way of agreement. Thus the French word for 'I' is , regardless of who is speaking; but this word becomes feminine or masculine depending on the sex of the speaker, as may be reflected through adjective agreement: ('I am strong', spoken/written by a female); (the same but by a male).\nIn null-subject languages (and in some elliptical expressions in other languages), such agreement may take place even though the pronoun does not in fact appear. For example, in Portuguese:\nThe two sentences above mean literally 'much obliged'; the adjective agrees with the natural gender of the speaker, that is, with the gender of the first person pronoun which does not appear explicitly here.\nIndefinite and dummy pronouns.\nA dummy pronoun is a type of pronoun used when a particular verb argument (such as the subject) is nonexistent, but when a reference to the argument is nevertheless syntactically required. They occur mostly in non-pro-drop languages, such as English (because in pro-drop languages the position of the argument can be left empty). Examples in English are the uses of \"it\" in \"It's raining\" and \"It's nice to relax.\"\nWhen a language has gendered pronouns, the use of a particular word as a dummy pronoun may involve the selection of a particular gender, even though there is no noun to agree with. In languages with a neuter gender, a neuter pronoun is usually used, as in German (\"it rains, it's raining\"), where is the neuter third person singular pronoun. (English behaves similarly, because the word \"it\" comes from the Old English neuter gender.) In languages with only masculine and feminine genders, the dummy pronoun may be the masculine third person singular, as in the French for \"it's raining\": (where means \"he\", or \"it\" when referring to masculine nouns); although some languages use the feminine, as in the equivalent Welsh sentence: (where the dummy pronoun is , which means \"she\", or \"it\" when referring to feminine nouns).\nA similar, apparently arbitrary gender assignment may need to be made in the case of indefinite pronouns, where the referent is generally unknown. In this case the question is usually not which pronoun to use, but which gender to assign a given pronoun to (for such purposes as adjective agreement). For example, the French pronouns (\"someone\"), (\"no-one\") and (\"something\") are all treated as masculine\u2014this is in spite of the fact that the last two correspond to feminine nouns ( meaning \"person\", and meaning \"thing\"). &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGrammatical vs. natural gender.\nThe \"natural gender\" of a noun, pronoun or noun phrase is a gender to which it would be expected to belong based on relevant attributes of its referent. Although grammatical gender can coincide with natural gender, it does not need to.\nGrammatical gender can match natural gender.\nThis usually means masculine or feminine, depending on the referent's sex. For example, in Spanish, (\"woman\") is feminine whereas (\"man\") is masculine; these attributions occur solely due to the semantically inherent gender character of each noun.\nGrammatical gender need not match natural gender.\nThe \"grammatical gender\" of a noun does not always coincide with its natural gender. An example of this is the German word (\"girl\"); this is derived from (\"maiden\"), umlauted to with the diminutive suffix , and this suffix always makes the noun grammatically neuter. Hence the grammatical gender of is neuter, although its natural gender is feminine (because it refers to a female person).\nOther examples include:\nNormally, such exceptions are a small minority.\nWhen a noun with conflicting natural and grammatical gender is the antecedent of a pronoun, it may not be clear which gender of pronoun to choose. There is a certain tendency to keep the grammatical gender when a close back-reference is made, but to switch to natural gender when the reference is further away. For example, in German, the sentences \"The girl has come home from school. She is now doing her homework\" can be translated in two ways:\nThough the second sentence may appear grammatically incorrect (constructio ad sensum), it is common in speech. With one or more intervening sentences, the second form becomes even more likely. However, a switch to the natural gender is never possible with articles and \"attributive\" pronouns or adjectives. Thus it can never be correct to say (\"a girl\" \u2013 with female indefinite article) or (\"this little girl\" \u2013 with female demonstrative pronoun and adjective).\nThis phenomenon is quite popular in Slavic languages: for example Polish (deprecative \"creature\") is feminine but can be used to refer to both man (masculine gender), woman (feminine gender), child (neuter gender) or even animate nouns (e.g. a dog being masculine). Similarly with other deprecatory nouns as , , , , (\"wuss, klutz\"); (\"mute\") can be used deprecatively as described previously, and then can be used for verbs marked for the male and female genders.\nGender contrasts on human versus sentient referents.\nIn the case of languages which have masculine and feminine genders, the relation between biological sex and grammatical gender tends to be less exact in the case of animals than in the case of people. In Spanish, for instance, a cheetah is always (masculine) and a zebra is always (feminine), regardless of their biological sex. In Russian a rat and a butterfly are always () and () (feminine). In French, a giraffe is always , whereas an elephant is always . To specify the sex of an animal, an adjective may be added, as in (\"a female cheetah\"), or (\"a male zebra\"). Different names for the male and the female of a species are more frequent for common pets or farm animals, e.g. English \"cow\" and \"bull\", Spanish \"cow\" and \"bull\", Russian ' () \"ram\" and ' () \"ewe\".\nAs regards the pronouns used to refer to animals, these generally agree in gender with the nouns denoting those animals, rather than the animals' sex (natural gender). In a language like English, which does not assign grammatical gender to nouns, the pronoun used for referring to objects (\"it\") is often used for animals also. However, if the sex of the animal is known, and particularly in the case of companion animals, the gendered pronouns (\"he\" and \"she\") may be used as they would be for a human.\nIn Polish, a few general words such as (\"animal\") or (\"animal, one head of cattle\") are neuter, but most species names are masculine or feminine. When the sex of an animal is known, it will normally be referred to using gendered pronouns consistent with its sex; otherwise the pronouns will correspond to the gender of the noun denoting its species.\nSyntactic structure.\nThere are multiple theoretical approaches to the position and structure of gender in syntactic structures.\nCategorization of nouns into genders.\nThere are three main ways by which natural languages categorize nouns into genders:\nIn most languages that have grammatical gender, a combination of these three types of criteria is found, although one type may be more prevalent.\nForm-based morphological criteria.\nIn many languages, nouns are assigned to gender largely without any semantic basis\u2014that is, not based on any feature (such as animacy or sex) of the person or thing that a noun represents. In such languages there may be a correlation, to a greater or lesser degree, between gender and the form of a noun (such as the vowel or consonant or syllable with which it ends).\nFor example, in Portuguese and Spanish, nouns that end in are mostly masculine, whereas those that end in are mostly feminine, regardless of their meaning. Nouns that end in some other vowel or a consonant are assigned a gender either according to etymology, by analogy, or by some other convention. These rules may override semantics in some cases: for example, the noun / (\"member\") is always masculine, even when it refers to a girl or a woman, and / (\"person\") is always feminine, even when it refers to a boy or a man, a kind of form-meaning mismatch.\nIn other cases, meaning takes precedence: the noun \"communist\" is masculine when it refers or could refer to a man, even though it ends with . Nouns in Spanish and Portuguese, as in the other Romance languages such as Italian and French, generally follow the gender of the Latin words from which they are derived. When nouns deviate from the rules for gender, there is usually an etymological explanation: (\"problem\") is masculine in Spanish because it was derived from a Greek noun of the neuter gender, whereas (\"photo\") and (\"broadcast signal\") are feminine because they are clippings of and respectively, both grammatically feminine nouns.\nMost Spanish nouns in are feminine. They derive from Latin feminines in , accusative . The opposite is correct with Northern Kurdish language or Kurmanci. For example, the words (member) and (friend) can be masculine or feminine according to the person they refer to.\nSuffixes often carry a specific gender. For example, in German, diminutives with the suffixes and , meaning 'little, young', are always neuter, even if they refer to people, as with 'girl' and 'young woman' &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Similarly, the suffix , which makes countable nouns from uncountable nouns ( 'dough' \u2192 'piece of dough'), or personal nouns from abstract nouns ( 'teaching', 'punishment' \u2192 'apprentice', 'convict') or adjectives ( 'cowardly' \u2192 'coward'), always produces masculine nouns. And the German suffixes and (comparable with \"-hood\" and \"-ness\" in English) produce feminine nouns.\nIn Irish, most nouns ending with a broad consonant are masculine, those ending with a slender consonant are feminine (see Irish phonology), with significant exceptions: nouns ending in / and are always masculine, whereas those ending or are always feminine.\nIn Arabic, nouns whose singular form ends in a \"t\u0101\u02be marb\u016b\u1e6dah\" (traditionally a , becoming in pausa) are of feminine gender, the only significant exceptions being the word (\"caliph\") and certain masculine personal names (e.g. \u02beUs\u0101mah). However, many masculine nouns have a \"broken\" plural form ending in a \"t\u0101\u02be marb\u016b\u1e6da\"; for example \"\" (\"male professor\") has the plural , which might be confused for a feminine singular noun. Gender may also be predictable from the type of derivation: for instance, the verbal nouns of Stem II (e.g. , from ) are always masculine.\nIn French, nouns ending in tend to be feminine, whereas others tend to be masculine, but there are many exceptions to this (e.g. , , , , are masculine as , , , , are feminine), note the many masculine nouns ending in preceded by double consonants. Certain suffixes are quite reliable indicators, such as , which when added to a verb (e.g. \"to park\" \u2192 ; nettoyer \"to clean\" \u2192 \"cleaning\") indicates a masculine noun; however, when is part of the root of the word, it can be feminine, as in (\"beach\") or . On the other hand, nouns ending in , and are almost all feminine, with a few exceptions, such as , .\nNouns can sometimes vary their form to enable the derivation of differently gendered cognate nouns; for example, to produce nouns with a similar meaning but referring to someone of a different sex. Thus, in Spanish, means \"boy\", and means \"girl\". This paradigm can be exploited for making new words: from the masculine nouns \"lawyer\", \"member of parliament\" and \"doctor\", it was straightforward to make the feminine equivalents , , and .\nIn the same way, personal names are frequently constructed with affixes that identify the sex of the bearer. Common feminine suffixes used in English names are \"-a\", of Latin or Romance origin (cf. \"Robert\" and \"Roberta\"); and \"-e\", of French origin (cf. \"Justin\" and \"Justine\").\nAlthough gender inflection may be used to construct nouns and names for people of different sexes in languages that have grammatical gender, this alone does not constitute grammatical gender. Distinct words and names for men and women are also common in languages which do not have a grammatical gender system for nouns in general. English, for example, has feminine suffixes such as \"-ess\" (as in \"waitress\"), and also distinguishes male and female personal names, as in the above examples.\nDifferentiation of personal names.\nGiven names are proper nouns and they follow the same gender grammatical rules as common nouns. In most Indo-European languages female grammatical gender is created using an \"a\" or an \"e\" ending.\nClassical Latin typically made a grammatical feminine gender with ( \"forest\", \"water\") and this was reflected in feminine names originating in that period, like Emilia. Romance languages preserved this characteristic. For example, in Spanish, approximately 89% of nouns that end in \"-a\" or -\"\u00e1\" are classified as feminine; the same is true for 98% of given names with the \"-a\" ending.\nIn the Germanic languages the female names have been Latinized by adding \"-e\" and \"-a\": Brunhild, Kriemhild and Hroswith became Brunhilde, Kriemhilde and Hroswitha.\nSlavic feminine given names: Olga (Russian), Ma\u0142gorzata (Polish), Tetiana (Ukrainian), Oksana (Belarusian), Eli\u0161ka (Czech), Bronislava (Slovak), Milica (Serbian), Darina (Bulgarian), Lucja (Croatian), Lamija (Bosnian) and Zala (Slovenian).\nDifferentiation of nouns with human referents.\nIn some languages, nouns with human references have two forms, a male and a female one. This includes not only proper names, but also names for occupations and nationalities. Examples include:\nTo complicate matters, Greek often offers additional informal versions of these. The corresponding for English are the following: (), (), (), (), (). The formal forms come from the name () \"England\", while the less formal are derived from Italian .\nMeaning-based semantic criteria.\nIn some languages, gender is determined by strictly semantic criteria, but in other languages, semantic criteria only partially determine gender.\nStrict semantic criteria.\nIn some languages, the gender of a noun is directly determined by its physical attributes (sex, animacy, etc.), and there are few or no exceptions to this rule. There are relatively few such languages. The Dravidian languages use this system as described below.\nAnother example is the Dizi language, which has two asymmetrical genders. The feminine includes all living beings of female sex (e.g. woman, girl, cow...) and diminutives; the masculine encompasses all other nouns (e.g. man, boy, pot, broom...). In this language, feminine nouns are always marked with \"-e\" or \"-in\".\nAnother African language, Defaka, has three genders: one for all male humans, one for all female humans, and a third for all the remaining nouns. Gender is only marked in personal pronouns. Standard English pronouns &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt; are very similar in this respect, although the English gendered pronouns (\"he\", \"she\") are used for domestic animals if the sex of the animal is known, and sometimes for certain objects such as ships, e.g. \"What happened to the Titanic? She (or it) sank.\"\nMostly semantic criteria.\nIn some languages, the gender of nouns can mostly be determined by physical (semantic) attributes, although there remain some nouns whose gender is not assigned in this way (Corbett calls this \"semantic residue\"). The world view (e.g. mythology) of the speakers may influence the division of categories.\nContextual determination of gender.\nThere are certain situations where the assignment of gender to a noun, pronoun or noun phrase may not be straightforward. This includes in particular:\nIn languages with masculine and feminine gender, the masculine is usually employed by default to refer to persons of unknown gender and to groups of people of mixed gender. Thus, in French the feminine plural pronoun always designates an all-female group of people (or stands for a group of nouns all of feminine gender), but the masculine equivalent may refer to a group of males or masculine nouns, to a mixed group, or to a group of people of unknown genders. In such cases, one says that the feminine gender is semantically marked, whereas the masculine gender is unmarked.\nIn English, the problem of gender determination does not arise in the plural, because gender in that language is reflected only in pronouns, and the plural pronoun \"they\" does not have gendered forms. In the singular, however, the issue frequently arises when a person of unspecified or unknown gender is being referred to. In this case it the Singular \"they\" has been traditional. \nSince the 18th century it has been prescribed to use the masculine (\"he\"), but other solutions are now often preferred&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nIn languages with a neuter gender, such as Slavic and Germanic languages, the neuter is often used for indeterminate gender reference, particularly when the things referred to are not people. In some cases this may even apply when referring to people, particularly children. For example, in English, one may use \"it\" to refer to a child, particularly when speaking generically rather than about a particular child of known sex.\nIn Icelandic (which preserves a masculine\u2013feminine\u2013neuter distinction in both singular and plural), the neuter plural can be used for groups of people of mixed gender, when specific people are meant. For example:\nHowever, when referring to previously unmentioned groups of people or when referring to people in a generic way, especially when using an indefinite pronoun like 'some' or 'all', the masculine plural is used. For example:\nAn example contrasting the two ways to refer to groups is the following, taken from advertisements of Christian congregations announcing their meetings:\nThat the masculine is seen in Icelandic as the most generic or 'unmarked' of the three genders can also be seen in the fact that the nouns for most professions are masculine. Even feminine job descriptions historically filled by women, like 'nurse' and 'nursery school teacher' (both .), have been replaced with masculine ones as men have started becoming more represented in these professions: 'nurse' and 'nursery school teacher' (both .).\nIn Swedish (which has an overall common\u2013neuter gender system), masculinity may be argued to be a marked feature, because in the weak adjectival declension there is a distinct ending () for naturally masculine nouns (as in , \"my little brother\"). In spite of this, the third-person singular masculine pronoun would normally be the default for a person of unknown gender, although in practice the indefinite pronoun and the reflexive or its possessive forms usually make this unnecessary.\nIn Polish, where a gender-like distinction is made in the plural between \"masculine personal\" and all other cases &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;, a group is treated as masculine personal if it contains at least one male person.\nIn languages which preserve a three-way gender division in the plural, the rules for determining the gender (and sometimes number) of a coordinated noun phrase (\"... and ...\") may be quite complex. Czech is an example of such a language, with a division (in the plural) between masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine, and neuter. The rules for gender and number of coordinated phrases in that language are summarized at .\nArbitrary conventional criteria.\nIn some languages, any gender markers have been so eroded over time (possibly through deflexion) that they are no longer recognizable. Many German nouns, for example, do not indicate their gender through either meaning or form. In such cases a noun's gender must simply be memorized, and gender can be regarded as an integral part of each noun when considered as an entry in the speaker's lexicon. (This is reflected in dictionaries, which typically indicate the gender of noun headwords where applicable.)\nSecond-language learners are often encouraged to memorize a modifier, usually a definite article, in conjunction with each noun\u2014for example, a learner of French may learn the word for \"chair\" as (meaning \"the chair\"); this carries the information that the noun is , and that it is feminine (because is the feminine singular form of the definite article).\nGender shifts.\nIt is possible for a noun to have more than one gender. Such gender shifts are sometimes correlated with meaning shifts, and sometimes yield doublets with no difference in meaning. Moreover, gender shifts sometimes crosscut number contrasts, such that the singular form of a noun has one gender, and plural form of the noun has a different gender.\nMeaningful.\nGender shift may be associated with a difference in the sex of the referent, as with nouns such as in Spanish, which may be either masculine or feminine, depending on whether it refers to a male or a female. It may also correspond to some other difference in the meaning of the word. For example, the German word meaning \"lake\" is masculine, whereas the identical word meaning \"sea\" is feminine. The meanings of the Norwegian noun have diverged further: masculine is \"a thing\", whereas neuter is \"an assembly\". (The parliament is the , \"the Great \"; the other s like are the regional courts.)\nIt is a matter of analysis how to draw the line between a single polysemous word with multiple genders and a set of homonyms with one gender each. For example, Bulgarian has a pair of homonyms () which are etymologically unrelated. One is masculine and means \"finger\"; the other is feminine and means \"soil\".\nMeaningless.\nIn other cases, a word may be usable in multiple genders indifferently. For example, in Bulgarian the word , (, \"wilderness\") may be either masculine (definite form , ) or feminine (definite form , ) without any change in meaning and no preference in usage.\nIn Norwegian, many nouns can be either feminine or masculine according to the dialect, level of formality or whim of the speaker/writer. Even the two written forms of the language have many nouns whose gender is optional. Choosing the masculine gender will often seem more formal than using the feminine. This might be because before the creation of Norwegian Nynorsk and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l in the late 19th century, Norwegians wrote in Danish, which has lost the feminine gender, thus usage of the masculine gender (corresponding exactly to Danish common gender in conjugation in Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l) is more formal sounding to modern Norwegians.\nThe word for \"sun\" can be another example. One might decline it masculine: , or feminine: , in Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l. The same goes for a lot of common words like (book), (doll), (bucket) and so forth. Many of the words where it is possible to choose gender are inanimate objects that one might suspect would be conjugated with the neuter gender. Nouns conjugated with the neuter gender cannot normally be conjugated as feminine or masculine in Norwegian. There is also a slight tendency towards using the masculine indefinite article even when choosing the feminine conjugation of a noun in many eastern Norwegian dialects. For instance, the word for \"girl\" is declined: .\nAssociated with number contrasts.\nSometimes a noun's gender can change between its plural and singular forms, as with the French words (\"love\"), (\"delight\") and (\"organ\" as musical instrument), all of which are masculine in the singular but feminine in the plural. These anomalies may have a historical explanation ( used to be feminine in the singular too) or result from slightly different notions ( in the singular is usually a barrel organ, whereas the plural usually refers to the collection of columns in a church organ). Further examples are the Italian words (\"egg\") and (\"arm\"). These are masculine in the singular, but form the irregular plurals and , which have the endings of the feminine singular, but have feminine plural agreement. (This is related to the forms of the second declension Latin neuter nouns from which they derive: and , with nominative plurals and .) In other cases, the anomaly can be explained by the form of the noun, as is the case in Scottish Gaelic. Masculine nouns which form their plural by palatalization of their final consonant can change gender in their plural form, as a palatalized final consonant is often a marker of a feminine noun, e.g. (\"small boy\"), but (\"small boys\"), with the adjective showing agreement for both feminine gender (lenition of initial consonant) and plural number (suffixed ).\nGender across languages.\nRelated languages need not assign the same gender to a noun: this shows that gender can vary across related languages. Conversely, unrelated languages that are in contact can impact how a borrowed noun is assigned gender, with either the borrowing or the donor language determining the gender of the borrowed word.\nGender can vary across related languages.\nNouns which have the same meanings in different languages need not have the same gender. This is particularly so in the case of things with no natural gender, such as sexless objects. For example, there is, by all appearances, nothing about a table that should cause it to be associated with any particular gender, and different languages' words for \"table\" are found to have various genders: feminine, as with the French ; masculine, as with German ; or neuter, as with Norwegian . (Even within a given language, nouns that denote the same concept may differ in gender\u2014for example, of three German words for \"car\", is masculine whereas is neuter, and is feminine.)\nCognate nouns in closely related languages are likely to have the same gender, because they tend to inherit the gender of the original word in the parent language. For instance, in the Romance languages, the words for \"sun\" are masculine, being derived from the Latin masculine noun , whereas the words for \"moon\" are feminine, being derived from the Latin feminine . (This contrasts with the genders found in German, where \"sun\" is feminine, and \"moon\" is masculine, as well as in other Germanic languages.) However, there are exceptions to this principle. For instance, (\"milk\") is masculine in Italian (as are French and Portuguese ), whereas Spanish is feminine and Romanian is neuter. Likewise, the word for \"boat\" is neuter in German (), but common gender in Swedish ().\nSome more examples of the above phenomena are given below. (These come mostly from the Slavic languages, where gender largely correlates with the noun ending.)\nHow languages assign gender to borrowed words.\nBorrowed words are assigned gender in one of two ways:\nBorrowing language can determine gender.\nIbrahim identifies several processes by which a language assigns a gender to a newly borrowed word; these processes follow patterns by which even children, through their subconscious recognition of patterns, can often correctly predict a noun's gender.\nSometimes the gender of a word switches with time. For example, the Russian modern loanword () \"whisky\" was originally feminine, then masculine, and today it has become neuter.\nDonor language can determine gender.\nGhil'ad Zuckermann argues that the cross-lingual retention of grammatical gender can change not only the lexis of the target language but also its morphology. For example, gender can indirectly influence the productivity of noun-patterns in what he calls the \"Israeli\" language: the Israeli neologism (, transl.\u2009brush) is fitted into the \"feminine\" noun-pattern \"mi\u2302\u2302\u00e9\u2302et\" (each \u2302 represents a slot where a radical is inserted) because of the feminine gender of the matched words for \"brush\" such as Arabic , Yiddish , Russian , Polish (transl.\u2009painting brush) and , German and French , all feminine.\nSimilarly, argues Zuckermann, the Israeli neologism for \"library\", (), matches the feminine gender of the parallel pre-existent European words: Yiddish transl.\u2009yi\u00a0\u2013 transl.\u2009bibliot\u00e9k, Russian , Polish , German and French , as well as of the pre-existent Arabic word for \"library\": (, also feminine. The result of this neologism might have been, more generally, the strengthening of Israeli () as a productive feminine locative suffix (combined with the influence of Polish and Russian ()).\nDistribution of gender in the world's languages.\nGrammatical gender is a common phenomenon in the world's languages. A typological survey of 174 languages revealed that over one fourth of them had grammatical gender. Gender systems rarely overlap with numerical classifier systems. Gender and noun class systems are usually found in fusional or agglutinating languages, whereas classifiers are more typical of isolating languages. Thus, according to Johanna Nichols, these characteristics correlate positively with the presence of grammatical gender in the world's languages:\nGrammatical gender is found in many Indo-European languages (including Spanish, Portuguese, French, Russian, and German\u2014but not English, Bengali, Armenian or Persian, for example), Afroasiatic languages (which includes the Semitic and Berber languages, etc.), and in other language families such as Dravidian and Northeast Caucasian, as well as several Australian Aboriginal languages such as Dyirbal, and Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Most Niger\u2013Congo languages also have extensive systems of noun classes, which can be grouped into several grammatical genders.\nConversely, grammatical gender is usually absent from the Koreanic, Japonic, Tungusic, Turkic, Mongolic, Austronesian, Sino-Tibetan, Uralic and most Native American language families.\nModern English makes use of gender in pronouns, which are generally marked for natural gender, but lacks a system of gender concord within the noun phrase which is one of the central elements of grammatical gender in most other Indo-European languages.\nIndo-European.\nMany Indo-European languages, but not English, provide examples of grammatical gender.\nResearch indicates that the earliest stages of Proto-Indo-European had two genders (animate and inanimate), as did Hittite, the earliest attested Indo-European language. The classification of nouns based on animacy and inanimacy and the lack of gender are today characteristic of Armenian. According to the theory, the animate gender, which (unlike the inanimate) had independent vocative and accusative forms, later split into masculine and feminine, thus originating the three-way classification into masculine, feminine and neuter.\nMany Indo-European languages retained the three genders, including most Slavic languages, Latin, Sanskrit, Ancient and Modern Greek, German, Icelandic, Romanian and Asturian (two Romance language exceptions). In them, there is a high but not absolute correlation between grammatical gender and declensional class. Many linguists believe that to be true of the middle and late stages of Proto-Indo-European.\nHowever, many languages reduced the number of genders to two. Some lost the neuter, leaving masculine and feminine as in Vulgar Latin then most Romance languages; a few traces of the Latin neuter remain, such as the distinct Spanish pronoun and Italian nouns with so-called \"mobile gender\"). Hindustani and the Celtic languages also dropped neuter. Others merged feminine and masculine into a common gender but retained the neuter, as in Swedish and Danish, and to some extent in Dutch. Finally, some languages, such as English and Afrikaans, have nearly completely lost grammatical gender (retaining only some traces, such as the English pronouns \"he\", \"she\", \"they\", and \"it\"\u2014Afrikaans , , , and ); Armenian, Bengali, Persian, Sorani Kurdish, Ossetic, Odia, Khowar, and Kalasha-mun have lost it entirely.\nOn the other hand, some Slavic languages can be argued to have added new genders to the classical three &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nGermanic: English.\nAlthough grammatical gender was a fully productive inflectional category in Old English, Modern English has a much less pervasive gender system, primarily based on natural gender and reflected essentially in pronouns only.\nThere are a few traces of gender marking in Modern English:\nHowever, these are relatively insignificant features compared with a typical language with full grammatical gender. English nouns are not generally considered to belong to gender classes in the way that French, German or Russian nouns are. There is no gender agreement in English between nouns and their modifiers (articles, other determiners, or adjectives, with the occasional exception such as \"blond/blonde\", a spelling convention borrowed from French). Gender agreement applies in effect only to pronouns, with the choice of pronoun determined through semantics and/or pragmatics rather than on any conventional assignment of particular nouns to particular genders.\nOnly a relatively small number of English nouns have distinct male and female forms; many of them are loanwords from non-Germanic languages (the suffixes \"-rix\" and \"-ress\" in words such as \"aviatrix\" and \"waitress\", for instance, derive directly or indirectly from Latin). English has no live productive gender markers. An example of such a marker might be the suffix \"-ette\" (of French provenance), but this is seldom used today, surviving mostly in either historical contexts or with disparaging or humorous intent.\nThe gender of an English pronoun typically coincides with the natural gender of its referent, rather than with the grammatical gender of its antecedent. The choice between \"she\", \"he\", \"they\", and \"it\" comes down to whether the pronoun is intended to designate a woman, a man, or someone or something else. There are certain exceptions, however:\nProblems arise when selecting a personal pronoun to refer to someone of unspecified or unknown gender &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. In the past and to some degree still in the present, the masculine has been used as the \"default\" gender in English. The use of the plural pronoun \"they\" with singular reference is common in practice. The neuter \"it\" may be used for a baby but not normally for an older child or adult. Other genderless pronouns exist, such as the impersonal pronoun \"one\", but they are not generally substitutable for a personal pronoun.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSlavic languages.\nThe Slavic languages mostly continue the Proto-Indo-European system of three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter. Gender correlates largely with noun endings (masculine nouns typically end in a consonant, feminines in and neuters in or ) but there are many exceptions, particularly in the case of nouns whose stems end in a soft consonant. However, some of the languages, including Russian, Czech, Slovak and Polish, also make certain additional grammatical distinctions between animate and inanimate nouns: Polish in the plural, and Russian in the accusative case, differentiate between human and non-human nouns.\nIn Russian, the different treatment of animate nouns involves their accusative case (and that of adjectives qualifying them) being formed identically to the genitive rather than to the nominative. In the singular that applies to masculine nouns only, but in the plural it applies in all genders.\nA similar system applies in Czech, but the situation is somewhat different in the plural: Only masculine nouns are affected, and the distinctive feature is a particular inflective ending for masculine animate nouns in the nominative plural, and for adjectives and verbs agreeing with those nouns.\nPolish morphology might be said to distinguish five genders: personal masculine (referring to male humans), animate non-personal masculine, inanimate masculine, feminine, and neuter. The animate\u2013inanimate opposition for the masculine gender applies in the singular, and the personal\u2013impersonal opposition, which classes animals along with inanimate objects, applies in the plural. (A few nouns denoting inanimate things are treated grammatically as animate and vice versa.) The manifestations of the differences are as follows:\nA few nouns have both personal and impersonal forms, depending on meaning for example, may behave as an impersonal noun when it refers to a client in the computing sense. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDravidian.\nIn Tamil and some other Dravidian languages, nouns are classified primarily on the basis of their semantic properties. The highest-level classification of nouns is often described as being between \"rational\" and \"nonrational\". Nouns representing humans and deities are considered rational, and other nouns (those representing animals and objects) are treated as nonrational. Within the rational class there are further subdivisions into masculine, feminine and collective nouns.\nAustronesian.\nIn the Austronesian Wuvulu-Aua language, vocative words used when addressing a relative often specify the speaker's gender. For example, means 'sister of female', means opposite-gender sibling, and means female's father's sister or female's brother's daughter.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The earliest known LGBTQ rights organization was the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, founded in Berlin in 1897.\nCommon goals of LGBTQ movements is equal rights for LGBTQ people. Specific goals include the decriminalization of homosexuality, legal recognition of same-sex relationships, protections against discrimination, and access to gender-affirming healthcare. Some branches of these movements also emphasize cultural visibility, community-building, and liberation from societal systems seen as oppressive, such as heteronormativity and cisnormativity.\nModern LGBTQ movements encompass a wide range of strategies, including political lobbying, street marches and protests, mutual aid, academic research, and artistic expression. These movements are internally diverse, with ongoing debates over tactics, identity, inclusion, and the intersections of gender, sexuality, race, and class.\nOverview.\nSociologist Mary Bernstein writes: For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity, homophobia, and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual nuclear family (heteronormativity). Political goals include changing laws and policies to gain new rights, benefits, and protections from harm.Bernstein emphasizes that LGBTQ activists often pursue both cultural and political goals across the civil and legal spheres.\nLike other social movements, LGBTQ movements experience internal conflict over strategy, representation, and direction\u2014particularly regarding education reform and who speaks for the broader community. There is ongoing debate over how much common ground exists among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and other queer individuals, and whether they should pursue shared political goals.\nIn the 1970s through the 1990s, leaders of the lesbian and gay rights movement sometimes downplayed or excluded masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals, creating rifts within LGBTQ communities. Research by Roffee and Waling (2016) found that LGBTQ individuals often face microaggressions and exclusionary behaviors from others within their own community. These tensions stem from misconceptions and differing beliefs about what constitutes LGBTQ identity.\nFor example, transgender individuals have reported that other LGBTQ members may dismiss or misunderstand their specific needs, leading to harmful assumptions and potential health risks. Similarly, bisexual people have often felt that their identities are invalidated by both straight and gay communities. Even when individuals align with the broader values of LGBTQ advocacy, inconsistencies and internal prejudice can persist.\nMany LGBTQ movements have adopted forms of identity politics that position gay, bisexual, and transgender people as fixed minority groups. This approach has helped secure rights and visibility, but it has also drawn criticism from within the community. Critics within the queer movement argue that fixed categories such as gay and lesbian are restrictive and fail to reflect the fluidity of sexuality and gender. These categories, they suggest, \"reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that always marks non-heterosexual identities as inferior.\"\nDespite differences in approach, many activists share liberal political goals of equality and freedom, seeking to integrate into the political mainstream alongside other marginalized groups. LGBTQ movements widely oppose \"conversion therapy\" efforts to change sexual orientation or gender identity, emphasizing that these traits are innate and immutable. Such practices are often rooted in religious doctrines that view non-heterosexual activity as immoral. While religious institutions have historically condemned LGBTQ identities, opposition has never been universal. Attitudes vary widely between denominations, cultures, and eras.\nToday, numerous religious communities and individual believers openly support LGBTQ rights.\nHistorically, anticlerical sentiment in Catholic countries after the French Revolution\u2014combined with the liberalizing effects of the Napoleonic Code\u2014led to the repeal of sodomy laws in many areas. In contrast, Protestant countries, where church authority was less centralized, often retained religiously inspired statutes well into the 20th century. Some laws persist even today; for example, a 2008 court case in India was based on a 150-year-old colonial-era law criminalizing sodomy.\nHistory.\nEnlightenment era.\nIn eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe, same-sex sexual behavior and cross-dressing were widely considered to be socially unacceptable, and were serious crimes under sodomy and sumptuary laws. There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th-century cross-dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of William Shakespeare's plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in Elizabethan theater were always performed by males, usually prepubescent boys).\nThomas Cannon wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, \"Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify'd\" (1749). Although only fragments of his work have survived, it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy, written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject. It contains the argument: \"Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts: Are not they, however, constructed, and consequently impelling Nature?\"\nSocial reformer Jeremy Bentham wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, at a time when the legal penalty for buggery was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his utilitarian philosophy, in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being.\nHe argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings. However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his essay was not published until 1978.\nThe emerging currents of secular humanist thought that had inspired Bentham also informed the French Revolution, and when the newly formed National Constituent Assembly began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant \"sodomite-citizens\" in Paris petitioned the Assembl\u00e9e nationale, the governing body of the French Revolution, for freedom and recognition.\nIn 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to Jean Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s, who was one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code. With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in 1808, the Duchy of Warsaw also decriminalized homosexuality.\nIn 1830, the new Penal Code of the Brazilian Empire did not repeat the title XIII of the fifth book of the \"Ordena\u00e7\u00f5es Philipinas\", which made sodomy a crime. In 1833, an anonymous English-language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls, who had been sentenced to death in London for sodomy:\n&lt;poem&gt;Whence spring these inclinations, rank and strong?\nAnd harming no one, wherefore call them wrong?&lt;/poem&gt;\nThree years later in Switzerland, Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of \"Eros: Die M\u00e4nnerliebe der Griechen\" (English: \"Eros: The Male Love of the Greeks\"), another defense of same-sex love.\nEmergence of LGBTQ movement.\nIn many ways, social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late Victorian era. In 1885, the Labouchere Amendment was included in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which criminalized 'any act of gross indecency with another male person'; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright Oscar Wilde in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.\nThe first person known to describe himself as a drag queen was William Dorsey Swann, born enslaved in Hancock, Maryland. Swann was the first American on record who pursued legal and political action to defend the LGBTQ community's right to assemble. During the 1880s and 1890s, Swann organized a series of drag balls in Washington, D.C. Swann was arrested in police raids numerous times, including in the first documented case of arrests for female impersonation in the United States, on April 12, 1888.\nKarl Heinrich Ulrichs was one of the earliest men to publicly state their homosexuality. He wrote many essays defending homosexuality, establishing scientific terms and categories for the groups that now make up the LGBTQ+ community. Homosexual men were Urnings or Uranians, while homosexual women were Dionings. In 1867, he staged the first public gay rights protest.\nThe Uranian poets and prose writers, who sought to rehabilitate the love between men and boys and in doing so often appealed to Ancient Greece, formed a rather cohesive group with a well-expressed philosophy.\nA secret British society called the Order of Chaeronea campaigned for the legalization of homosexuality. The society was founded in 1897 by George Cecil Ives, one of the earliest gay rights campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the \"Cause\". Members included Oscar Wilde, Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson.\nIves met Wilde at the Authors' Club in London in 1892. Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his mustache, and once kissed him passionately in the Travellers' Club. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit.\nJohn Addington Symonds was a poet and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote \"A Problem in Greek Ethics\", a work of what would later be called \"gay history.\" Although the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" credits the medical writer C.G. Chaddock for introducing \"homosexual\" into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in \"A Problem in Greek Ethics\".\nSymonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as \"Eudiades\", which has been called \"the most famous of his homoerotic poems\". While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality, his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male-male sexual love in English literature.\nBy the end of his life, Symonds' homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds' memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form one of the earliest known works of self-conscious homosexual autobiography in English. The recently decoded autobiographies of Anne Lister are an earlier example in English.\nAnother friend of Ives was the English socialist poet Edward Carpenter. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offense. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, \"The Intermediate Sex\", would become a foundational text of the LGBTQ movements of the 20th century. Scottish anarchist John Henry Mackay also wrote in defense of same-sex love and androgyny.\nEnglish sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called \"Sexual Inversion\", it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a pathology or a crime and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society.\nHe also studied what he called 'inter-generational relationships' and that these also broke societal taboos on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term 'homosexual', but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of Greek and Latin.\nThese early proponents of LGBTQ rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as 'free love'; a critique of Victorian sexual morality and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, also spoke in defense of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.\nAn early LGBTQ movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer Magnus Hirschfeld. In 1897 he formed the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee campaign publicly against the notorious law \"Paragraph 175\", which made sex between men illegal. Adolf Brand later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld's medical view of the \"intermediate sex\", seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use \"outing\" as a political strategy, claiming that German Chancellor Bernhard von B\u00fclow engaged in homosexual activity.\nThe 1901 book \"Sind es Frauen? Roman \u00fcber das Dritte Geschlecht\" (English: \"Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex\") by Aim\u00e9e Duc was as much a political treatise as a novel, criticizing pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women. Anna R\u00fcling, delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld, became the first female Uranian activist. R\u00fcling, who also saw \"men, women, and homosexuals\" as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women's and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause.\nWomen only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader Helene St\u00f6cker became a prominent figure in the movement. Friedrich Radszuweit published LGBTQ literature and magazines in Berlin (e.g., \"Die Freundin\").\nHirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women's rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be drastically reversed with the rise of Nazism, and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933. The Swiss journal Der Kreis was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era.\nUSSR's Criminal Code of 1922 decriminalized homosexuality. This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time \u2013 which was very backward economically and socially, and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed. This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women's rights \u2013 including legalizing abortion, granting divorce on demand, equal rights for women, and attempts to socialize housework. During Stalin's era, however, USSR reverted all these progressive measures \u2013 re-criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion.\nIn 1928, English writer Radclyffe Hall published a novel titled \"The Well of Loneliness\". Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\", and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted. Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud's theory that same-sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was curable.\nIn the United States, several secret or semi-secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century, but little is known about them. A better documented group is Henry Gerber's Society for Human Rights formed in Chicago in 1924, which was quickly suppressed.\nHomophile movement (1945\u20131969).\nImmediately following World War II, a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the Western world, in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term \"homophile\" to \"homosexual\", emphasizing love over sex.\nThe homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, France, Britain and elsewhere. ONE, Inc., the first public homosexual organization in the U.S., was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man Reed Erickson. A U.S. transgender rights journal, \"Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress\", also published two issues in 1952.\nThe homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability. Radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being assimilationist. Any demonstrations were orderly and polite. By 1969, there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U.S., and a national organization had been formed, but they were largely ignored by the media.\nA 1965 gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBTQ youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April\u2013July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, Gene Compton's Cafeteria.\nThe Wolfenden Report was published in Britain on September 4, 1957, after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well-known men, including Edward Montagu-Scott, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day, the committee recommended that \"homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence\".\nAll but James Adair were in favor of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses' evidence at that time, found that \"homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects.\" The report added, \"The law's function is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others ... It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behavior.\"\nThe report eventually led to the introduction of the Sexual Offences Bill 1967 supported by Labour MP Roy Jenkins, then the Labour Home Secretary. When passed, the Sexual Offenses Act decriminalized homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age \"in private\" in England and Wales. The seemingly innocuous phrase 'in private' led to the prosecution of participants in sex acts involving three or more men, e.g. the Bolton 7 who were so convicted as recently as 1998.\nBisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the 1960s in the United States. In 1966 bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (also known as Donny the Punk) founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group.\nActivism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967. Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBTQ people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time.\nGay Liberation movement (1969\u20131974).\nThe new social movements of the sixties, such as the Black Power and anti-Vietnam war movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and Women's Liberation throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBTQ activists to become more radical, and the Gay Liberation movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the Stonewall riots of 1969, when a group of gay men, lesbians, drag queens and transgender women at a bar in New York City resisted a police raid.\nImmediately after Stonewall, such groups as the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and the Gay Activists' Alliance (GAA) were formed. Their use of the word \"gay\" represented a new unapologetic defiance\u2014as an antonym for \"straight\" (\"respectable sexual behavior\"), it encompassed a range of non-normative sexuality and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone, rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual.\nAccording to Gay Lib writer Toby Marotta, \"their Gay political outlooks were not homophile but liberationist\". \"Out, loud and proud,\" they engaged in colorful street theater. The GLF's \"A Gay Manifesto\" set out the aims for the fledgling gay liberation movement, and influential intellectual Paul Goodman published \"The Politics of Being Queer\" (1969). Chapters of the GLF were established across the U.S. and in other parts of the Western world. The Front homosexuel d'action r\u00e9volutionnaire was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France.\nThe Gay liberation movement overall, like the gay community generally and historically, has had varying degrees of gender nonconformity and assimilationist platforms among its members. Early marches by the Mattachine society and Daughters of Bilitis stressed looking \"respectable\" and mainstream, and after the Stonewall Uprising the Mattachine Society posted a sign in the window of the club calling for peace. Gender nonconformity has always been a primary way of signaling homosexuality and bisexuality, and by the late 1960s and mainstream fashion was increasingly incorporating what by the 1970s would be considered \"unisex\" fashions.\nIn 1970, the drag queen caucus of the GLF, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, formed the group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), which focused on providing support for gay prisoners, housing for homeless gay youth and street people, especially other young \"street queens\". In 1969, Lee Brewster and Bunny Eisenhower formed the Queens Liberation Front (QLF), partially in protest to the treatment of the drag queens at the first Christopher Street Liberation Day March.\nOne of the values of the movement was gay pride. Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots, Craig Rodwell, proprietor of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop in lower Manhattan, persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. Liberation groups, including the Gay Liberation Front, Queens, the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR) all took part in the first Gay Pride Week. Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day. Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.\nIn the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the London School of Economics on October 13, 1970. Bob Mellors and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle.\nBy 1971, the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press, holding weekly meetings of 200 to 300 people. The GLF Manifesto was published, and a series of high-profile direct actions, were carried out.\nThe disruption of the opening of the 1971 Festival of Light was the best organized of GLF action. The Festival of Light, whose leading figures included Mary Whitehouse, met at Methodist Central Hall. Groups of GLF members in drag invaded and spontaneously kissed each other; others released mice, sounded horns, and unveiled banners, and a contingent dressed as workmen obtained access to the basement and shut off the lights.\nIn 1972, Sweden became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by legislation to surgically change their sex and provide free hormone replacement therapy. Sweden also permitted the age of consent for same-sex partners to be at age 15, making it equal to heterosexual couples.\nBisexuals became more visible in the LGBTQ rights movement in the 1970s. In 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the \"Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality\" supporting bisexuals. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Statement, which may have been \"the first public declaration of the bisexual movement\" and \"was certainly the first statement on bisexuality issued by an American religious assembly,\" appeared in the Quaker \"Friends Journal\" and \"The Advocate\" in 1972. In that same year the National Bisexual Liberation Group formed in New York. In 1976 the San Francisco Bisexual Center opened.tzerland started with Rosa von Praunheims movie It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives.\nEaster 1972 saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Undergraduates Union (students union) building at the University of Birmingham.\nIn May 1974 the American Psychiatric Association, after years of pressure from activists, changed the wording concerning homosexuality in the Sixth printing of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders from a \"mental disorder\" to that of a \"sexual orientation disturbance\", which took gay people out of the category of being automatically considered mentally ill simply for their sexual orientation.\nBy 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement's splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, \"Gay News\", and Icebreakers. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources.\nGLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local \"Gayline\", which is still active today and has received funding from the National Lottery. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the \"Leicester Mercury\", which refused to advertise Gayline's services at the time.\nIn Japan, LGBTQ groups were established in the 1970s. In 1971, ran for the Upper House election.\nLGBTQ rights movement (1974\u2013present).\n1974\u20131986.\nFrom the radical Gay Liberation movement of the early 1970s arose a more reformist and single-issue Gay Rights movement, which portrayed gays and lesbians as a minority group and used the language of civil rights\u2014in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period. In Berlin, for example, the radical Homosexual Action West Berlin was eclipsed by the General Homosexual Working Group.\nGay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one's sexual orientation does not reflect on one's gender; that is, \"you can be a man and desire a man... without any implications for your gender identity as a man,\" and the same is true if you are a woman.\nGays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices, and butch \"bar dykes\" and flamboyant \"street queens\" were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays. Veteran activists such as Sylvia Rivera and Beth Elliot were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender.\nIn 1974, Maureen Colquhoun came out as the first Lesbian Member of Parliament (MP) for the Labour Party in the UK. When elected she was married in a heterosexual marriage.\nIn 1975, the groundbreaking film portraying homosexual gay icon Quentin Crisp's life, \"The Naked Civil Servant\", was transmitted by Thames Television for the British Television channel ITV. The British journal \"Gay Left\" also began publication. After British Home Stores sacked an openly gay trainee Tony Whitehead, a national campaign subsequently picketed their stores in protest.\nIn 1977, Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors becoming the first openly gay man in the State of California to be elected to public office. Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor Dan White in 1978.\nIn 1977, a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson, Anita Bryant, began a campaign \"Save Our Children\", in Dade County, Florida (greater Miami), which proved to be a major setback in the Gay Liberation movement. Essentially, she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual.\nIn 1979, a number of people in Sweden called in sick with a case of \"being homosexual,\" in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness. This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the National Board of Health and Welfare. Within a few months, Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness.\nBetween 1980 and 1988, the international gay community rallied behind Eliane Morissens, a Belgian lesbian who had been fired from her teaching post for coming out on television and bringing attention to employment discrimination. The case prompted protests, articles, and fundraising events throughout Europe and the Americas.\nArticles were carried in Toronto's \"The Body Politic\", the \"Gay Community News\" of Boston; and the \"San Francisco Sentinel\". The French magazine \"Gai pied\" created a support network to organize demonstrations and launched a petition drive for subscribers and members of the International Gay Association (IGA) to call on the Council of Europe to renounce discrimination against homosexuals. The International Lesbian Information Service (ILIS) published information in their newsletter about letter-writing campaigns, and organized fund-raisers and solidarity protests to help pay for Morissens' legal and personal expenses and bring attention to the case. Both ILIS and IGA lobbied European teachers' unions in support of Morissens.\nThough Morissens appealed the school board decision to the local council; the highest court in Belgium, Council of State; and the European Court of Human Rights, her termination was upheld at every level. The LGBTQ community was disappointed in the outcome because each court of appeal refused to recognize or examine whether employment discrimination had occurred, accepting the employer's version of events, and narrowly examining freedom of expression.\nLesbian feminism, which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. As with Gay Liberation, this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement.\nMany women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed \"lesbian separatism,\" influenced by writings such as Jill Johnston's 1973 book \"Lesbian Nation\". Organizers at the time focused on this issue. Diane Felix, also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene, is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA. She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women, especially in Latino American community.\nThese places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors. Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the lesbian sex wars, clashing in particular over views on sadomasochism, prostitution and transsexuality. The term \"gay\" came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.\nIn Canada, the coming into effect of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.\nMark Segal, often referred to as the dean of American gay journalism, disrupted the CBS evening news with Walter Cronkite in 1973, an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60% of American households, many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time.\nAnother setback in the United States occurred in 1986, when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case \"Bowers v. Hardwick\". (This ruling would be overturned two decades later in \"Lawrence v. Texas\").\n1987\u20132000.\nAIDS pandemic.\nSome historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of AIDS. As gay men became seriously ill and died in ever-increasing numbers, and many lesbian activists became their caregivers, the leadership of many organizations was decimated. Other organizations shifted their energies to focus their efforts on AIDS.\nThis era saw a resurgence of militancy with direct action groups like AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots Queer Nation (1990) and the Lesbian Avengers (1992). Some younger activists, seeing \"gay and lesbian\" as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using \"queer\" as a defiant statement of all sexual minorities and gender variant people\u2014just as the earlier liberationists had done with \"gay\". Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various acronyms like \"LGBT\", \"LGBTQ\", and \"LGBTI\", where the \"Q\" and \"I\" stand for \"queer\" or \"questioning\" and \"intersex\", respectively.\nWarrenton \"War Conference\".\nA \"War Conference\" of 200 gay leaders was held in Warrenton, Virginia, in 1988. The closing statement of the conference set out a plan for a media campaign:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;First, we recommend a nation-wide media campaign to promote a positive image of gays and lesbians. Every \u2014national, state, and local\u2014must accept the responsibility. We must consider the media in every project we undertake. We must, in addition, take every advantage we can to include public service announcements and paid advertisements, and to cultivate reporters and editors of newspapers, radio, and television. To help facilitate this we need national media workshops to train our leaders. And we must encourage our gay and lesbian press to increase coverage of the national process. Our media efforts are fundamental to the full acceptance of us in American life. But they are also a way for us to increase the funding of our movement. A media campaign costs money, but ultimately it may be one of our most successful fund-raising devices.\nThe statement also called for an annual planning conference \"to help set and modify our national agenda.\" The Human Rights Campaign lists this event as a milestone in gay history and identifies it as where National Coming Out Day originated.\nOn June 24, 1994, the first Gay Pride march was celebrated in Asia in the Philippines. In the Middle East, LGBTQ organizations remain illegal, and LGBTQ rights activists face extreme opposition from the state. The 1990s also saw the emergence of many LGBTQ youth movements and organizations such as LGBTQ youth centers, gay\u2013straight alliances in high schools, and youth-specific activism, such as the National Day of Silence. Colleges also became places of LGBTQ activism and support for activists and LGBTQ people in general, with many colleges opening LGBTQ centers.\nThe 1990s also saw a rapid push of the transgender movement, while at the same time a \"sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual.\" In the English-speaking world, Leslie Feinberg published \"Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come\" in 1992. Gender-variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements. Hijra activists campaigned for recognition as a third sex in India and Travesti groups began to organize against police brutality across Latin America while activists in the United States formed direct-confrontation groups such as the Transexual Menace.\n21st century.\nSame-sex marriage.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], same-sex marriages are recognized in Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.\nThe Netherlands was the first country to allow same-sex marriage in 2001. Following with Belgium in 2003 and Spain and Canada in 2005. South Africa became the first African nation to legalize same-sex marriage in 2006, and is currently the only African nation where same-sex marriage is legal.\nDespite this uptick in tolerance of the LGBTQ community in South Africa, so-called corrective rapes have become prevalent in response, primarily targeting the poorer women who live in townships and those who have no recourse in responding to the crimes because of the notable lack of police presence and prejudice they may face for reporting assaults.\nOn October 22, 2009, the assembly of the Church of Sweden, voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples, including the use of the term marriage, (\"matrimony\").\nIceland became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage through a unanimous vote: 49\u20130, on June 11, 2010. A month later, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage.\nOn June 26, 2015, in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 that the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live in the United States. With this ruling, the United States became the 17th country to legalize same-sex marriages entirely.\nBetween September 12 and November 7, 2017, Australia held a national survey on the subject of same sex marriage; 61.6% of respondents supported legally recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide. This cleared the way for a private member's bill to be debated in the federal parliament.\nIn 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriage. There has been a legal movement attempting to recognise marriage equality in Japan.\nOther rights.\nIn 2003, in the case \"Lawrence v. Texas\", the Supreme Court of the United States struck down sodomy laws in fourteen states, making consensual homosexual sex legal in all 50 states, a significant step forward in LGBTQ activism and one that had been fought for by activists since the inception of modern LGBTQ social movements.\nFrom November 6 to 9, 2006, The Yogyakarta Principles on application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted by an international meeting of 29 specialists in Yogyakarta, the International Commission of Jurists and the International Service for Human Rights.\nDuring this same period, some municipalities have been enacting laws against homosexuality. For example, Rhea County, Tennessee, unsuccessfully tried to \"ban homosexuals\" in 2006.\nThe 1993 \"Don't ask, don't tell\" law, forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military, was repealed in 2010. This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation. In 2012, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs. The new regulations ensure that the department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\nThe UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity gathered 66 signatures in the United Nations General Assembly on December 13, 2008.\nIn early 2014 a series of protests organized by Add The Words, Idaho, and former state senator Nicole LeFavour, some including civil disobedience and concomitant arrests, took place in Boise, Idaho, which advocated adding the words \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" to the state's Human Rights act.\nOn September 6, 2018, consensual gay sex was legalized in India by their Supreme Court.\nIn June 2020, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act could protect gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination. The Bostock v. Clayton County decision found that protections guaranteed on the basis of sex could extend to sexual orientation and identity in areas like housing and employment. Democrats such as then-presidential candidate Joe Biden praised the decision.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Today, by affirming that sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination are prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect and dignity. Due to a lack of federal protections, discrimination against LGBTQ people in public accommodation or the sale of goods and services by private businesses remains legal, leaving vulnerable those in more than half the states in the U.S.\nIn October 2020, the Council of Europe's Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Unit, along with the European Court of Human Rights, held a conference to mark the 70th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights on October 8, 2020. The entity announced launching an event called \"A 'Living Instrument' for Everyone: The Role of the European Convention on Human Rights in Advancing Equality for LGBTI persons\", focused on the progress achieved in equality for LGBTQ persons in Europe through the European Convention mechanism.\nPresident Biden signed an executive order barring LGBTQ discrimination on his first day in office. Later the same year, Biden reversed a Trump-era policy of banning transgender people from the military, authorized embassies to fly the pride flag, and officially recognized June as Pride Month.\nLGBTQ and human rights.\nSome people worry that gay rights conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, and the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations that hold opposing social and cultural views to LGBTQ rights. There is also concern that religious organizations might be forced to accept and perform same-sex marriages or risk losing their tax-exempt status.\nFreedom of religion may, however, also protect LGBTQ people. As pointed out at the United Nations Human Rights Council in the 2023 formal report of the United Nations Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity on the basis of the explanation in a 2020 article by human rights expert Dag \u00d8istein Endsj\u00f8, adherents of denominations and belief systems who embrace LGBTQ-equality \"can claim that anti-LGBT manifestations of religion (such as criminalization and discrimination) not only impinge upon the right of LGBT people to be free from violence and discrimination based on SOGI [sexual orientation and gender identity], but also violate the [pro-LGBTQ] denominations' own rights of freedom of religion\".\nAs pointed out in this article, freedom of religion also generally protects LGBTQ people against religious oppression, as freedom of religion also protects the \"freedom ... not to hold religious beliefs and ... not to practise a religion\". As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief noted in 2017, \"in certain States where religion has been given 'official' or privileged status, other fundamental rights of individuals \u2013 especially women, religious minorities and members of the LGBTI community \u2013 are disproportionately restricted or vitiated under threat of sanctions as a result of obligatory observation of State-imposed religious orthodoxy.\"\nPublic opinion.\nLGBTQ movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations. They may have a personal, political or religious prejudice to gay rights, homosexual relations or gay people. Opponents say same-sex relationships are not marriages, that legalization of same-sex marriage will open the door for the legalization of polygamy, that it is unnatural and that it encourages unhealthy behavior.\nSome social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermines the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. As society in some countries (mostly in Western Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan) has become more accepting of homosexuality, there therefore has also been the emergence of many groups that desire to end homosexuality; during the 1990s, one of the best known groups that was established with this goal is the ex-gay movement.\nEric Rofes, author of the book \"A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?\", argues that the inclusion of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals. As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality. According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that \"something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur. \"The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti-gay rights activists such as John Briggs. Former California senator, John Briggs proposed Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be \"the corruption of the children's minds\".\nThe exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation. Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth, stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.\nDavid Campos, author of the book, \"Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook\", illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them.\nHowever, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBTQ youth. It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.\nMany opponents of LGBTQ social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals. In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely.\nIn her book entitled \"Gay and Lesbian Movement,\" Margaret Cruikshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelovich polls which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.\nIt had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards same-sex marriage as it does on white attitudes.\nEducational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.\nLocation also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of rural and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges, including: sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas, generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas, and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas.\nIn order to combat this problem that the LGBTQ community faces, social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for \"LGBT individuals with like-minds\" that are \"enabled to connect, share, and feel the heartbeat of the community as one.\"\nIn a study conducted by Darren E. Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the Southern Illinois University Carbondale, researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LGBTQ rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals.\nThey also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage\u2014generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.\nStudies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than Protestants; 63% of African Americans claim that they are Baptist or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. Religion, as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality.\nThe most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by Jews, liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not \"systematically condemned homosexual behaviors\" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by Evangelical Protestants.\nMoreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He named the desert after the then-reigning monarch, Queen Victoria. In 1891, David Lindsey's expedition travelled across this area from north to south. Frank Hann was looking for gold in this area between 1903 and 1908. Len Beadell explored the area in the 1960s.\nLocation and description.\nThe Great Victoria is the largest desert in Australia, and consists of many small sandhills, grassland plains, areas with a closely packed surface of pebbles (called desert pavement or gibber plains), and salt lakes. It is over wide (from west to east) and covers an area of from the Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia to the Gawler Ranges in South Australia. The Western Australian mulga shrublands ecoregion lies to the west, the Little Sandy Desert to the northwest, the Gibson Desert and the Central Ranges xeric shrublands to the north, the Tirari-Sturt stony desert to the east, and the Nullarbor Plain to the south separates it from the Southern Ocean. Average annual rainfall is low and irregular, ranging from per year. Thunderstorms are relatively common in the Great Victoria Desert, with an average of 15\u201320 thunderstorms yearly. Summer daytime temperatures range from , while in winter, this falls to .\nThe Great Victoria desert is a World Wildlife Fund ecoregion and an Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia region of the same name.\nHabitation.\nThe majority of people living in the region are Indigenous Australians from different groups, including the Kogara, the Mirning and the Pitjantjatjara. Aboriginal populations have been increasing in this region. Young Indigenous adults from the Great Victoria Desert region work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture.\nDespite its isolated location, the Great Victoria is bisected by very rough tracks, including the Connie Sue Highway and the Anne Beadell Highway. Human activity has included some mining and nuclear weapons testing.\nFlora.\nOnly the hardiest of plants can survive in much of this environment. Between the sand ridges, the areas of wooded steppe consist of \"Eucalyptus gongylocarpa\", \"Eucalyptus youngiana\", and \"Acacia aneura\" (mulga) shrubs scattered over areas of resilient spinifex grasses, particularly \"Triodia basedowii\".\nFauna.\nThe wildlife that adapted to these harsh conditions include a few large birds or mammals such as emus and red kangaroos. However, the desert does sustain many types of lizards, including the vulnerable great desert skink (\"Egernia kintorei\"), the Central Ranges taipan (discovered in 2007), and a number of small marsupials, including the endangered sandhill dunnart \"(Sminthopsis psammophila)\" and the crest-tailed mulgara \"(Dasycercus cristicauda)\". One way to survive here is to burrow into the sands, as a number of the desert's animals, including the southern marsupial mole \"(Notoryctes typhlops)\", and the water-holding frog do. Birds include the chestnut-breasted whiteface (\"Aphelocephala pectoralis\") found on the eastern edge of the desert and the malleefowl of Mamungari Conservation Park. Predators of the desert include the dingo (as the desert is north of the Dingo Fence) and two large monitor lizards, the perentie \"(Varanus giganteus)\" and the sand goanna \"(Varanus gouldii)\".\nConservation and threats.\nAs this area has had very limited use for agriculture, many habitats remain largely undisturbed. 31% of the desert is in protected areas, including Mamungari Conservation Park (formerly known as Unnamed Conservation Park) in South Australia, a large area of pristine arid zone wilderness, which possesses cultural significance and is one of the 14 World Biosphere Reserves in Australia. Habitat is also preserved in the large Aboriginal local government area of Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara in South Australia and in the Great Victoria Desert Nature Reserve of Western Australia. Protected areas include:\nThe nuclear weapons trials carried out by the United Kingdom at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and early 1960s have left areas contaminated with plutonium-239 and other radioactive material.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13073", "revid": "1126265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13073", "title": "GNU Lesser General Public License", "text": "Free-software license\nThe GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a free-software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The license allows developers and companies to use and integrate a software component released under the LGPL into their own (even proprietary) software without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own components. However, any developer who modifies an LGPL-covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library, so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL is primarily used for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications.\nThe LGPL was developed as a compromise between the strong copyleft of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and more permissive licenses such as the BSD licenses and the MIT License. The word \"Lesser\" in the title shows that the LGPL does not guarantee the end user's complete freedom in the use of software; it only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL, but not for any proprietary components.\nHistory.\nThe license was originally called the GNU Library General Public License and was first published in 1991, and adopted the version number 2 for parity with GPL version 2. The LGPL was revised in minor ways in the 2.1 point release, published in 1999, when it was renamed the GNU Lesser General Public License to reflect the FSF's position that not all libraries should use it. Version 3 of the LGPL was published in 2007 as a list of additional permissions applied to GPL version 3.\nIn addition to the term \"work based on the Program\" of GPL, LGPL version 2 introduced two additional clarification terms \"work based on the library\" and \"work that uses the library\". LGPL version 3 partially dropped these terms.\nDifferences from the GPL.\nThe main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with (in the case of a library, \"used by\") a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is licensed under a license of GPL family or other licenses. In LGPL 2.1, the non-(L)GPLed program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a derivative work. If it is a derivative work, then the program's terms must allow for \"modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\". Whether a work that uses an LGPL program is a derivative work or not is a legal issue. A standalone executable that dynamically links to a library through a .so, .dll, or similar medium is generally accepted as not being a derivative work as defined by the LGPL. It would fall under the definition of a \"work that uses the Library\". Paragraph 5 of the LGPL version 2.1 states:\nA program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\nEssentially, if it is a \"work that uses the library\", then it must be possible for the software to be linked with a newer version of the LGPL-covered program. The most commonly used method for doing so is to use \"a suitable shared library mechanism for linking\". Alternatively, a statically linked library is allowed if either source code or linkable object files are provided.\nCompatibility.\nFree Software Foundation's https:// explains the compatibility with many open source licenses.\nGPL.\nOne feature of the LGPL is the permission to sublicense under the GPL any piece of software which is received under the LGPL (see section 3 of the LGPL version 2.1, and section 2 option b of the LGPL version 3). This feature allows for direct reuse of LGPLed code in GPLed libraries and applications.\nVersion 3 of the LGPL is not inherently compatible with version 2 of the GPL. However, works using the latter that have given permission to use a later version of the GPL are compatible: a work released under the GPLv2 \"or any later version\" may be combined with code from a LGPL version 3 library, with the combined work as a whole falling under the terms of the GPLv3.\nExpat/X11/MIT.\nAll LGPL versions are compatible with the Expat license and the X11 license (MIT license) because all GPL versions are compatible and LGPL gives more rights than GPL.\nApache.\nLGPL 3.0 is compatible with Apache License 2.0.\nLGPL 2.0 and LGPL 2.1 are incompatible with Apache License 2.0. However, if the license condition is either LGPL-2.0-or-later or LGPL-2.1-or-later then LGPL 3.0 can be chosen to be compatible.\nAll LGPL versions are incompatible with Apache License version 1.0 and 1.1.\nFSF recommendations on library licensing.\nThe former name \"GNU Library General Public License\" gave some the impression that the FSF recommended that all software libraries should use the LGPL and programs should use the GPL. In the 1999 essay \"Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library\", Richard Stallman explained that while the LGPL had not been deprecated, one should not necessarily use the LGPL for all libraries, as using GPL can give advantage to free-software developers.\nProgramming language specifications.\nThe license uses terminology which is mainly intended for applications written in the C programming language or its family. Franz Inc., the developers of Allegro Common Lisp, published their own preamble to the license to clarify terminology in the Lisp context. The LGPL with this preamble is sometimes referred to as the LLGPL.\nIn addition, Ada has a special feature, , which may prompt the use of the GNAT Modified General Public License (GMGPL): it allows code to link against or instantiate GMGPL-covered units without the code itself becoming covered by the GPL.\nC++ templates and header-only libraries have the same problem as Ada generics. Version 3 of the LGPL addresses such cases in section 3.\nClass inheritance.\nSome concern has risen about the suitability of object-oriented classes in LGPL-licensed code being inherited by non-(L)GPL code. Clarification is given on the official GNU website:\nThe LGPL does not contain special provisions for inheritance, because none are needed. Inheritance creates derivative works in the same way as traditional linking, and the LGPL permits this type of derivative work in the same way as it permits ordinary function calls.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Gosford Waterfront is known for its boating and scenic views on the shores of Brisbane Water. Gosford is the main commercial hub and gateway of the Central Coast. It is situated approximately north of Sydney and south of Newcastle. Gosford is located in the local government area of the Central Coast Council.\nGosford, locally nicknamed 'Gossie', is located in the north-eastern part of the Sydney Basin in the traditional Darkinjung Country.\nThe regional city is one of the two shared administrative hubs of the Central Coast Council, along with Wyong. Gosford is the central business district of the Central Coast region and is the third largest urban area in the state of New South Wales after Sydney and Newcastle. Gosford has been deemed a vital CBD spine under the NSW Metropolitan Strategy following the merging of City of Gosford Council and Wyong Shire Council in 2016, forming the current Central Coast Council administration. The population of the Gosford area was 169,053 in 2016.\nHistory.\nUntil white settlement, the area around Gosford was inhabited by the Guringai peoples, who were principally coastal-dwellers, and the Darkinjung people that inhabited the hinterland.\nAlong with the other land around the Hawkesbury River estuary, the Brisbane Water district was explored during the early stages of the settlement of New South Wales.\nGosford itself was explored by State Governor Arthur Phillip between 1788 and 1789. The area was difficult to access and settlement began around 1823. By the late 19th century the agriculture in the region was diversifying, with market gardens and citrus orchards occupying the rich soil left after the timber harvest. As late as 1850, the road between Hawkesbury (near Pittwater) and Brisbane Water was a cart wheel track.\nEast Gosford was the first centre of settlement. Gosford was named in 1839 after Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford \u2013 a friend of the then Governor of New South Wales George Gipps. Acheson's title derives its name from Gosford, a townland (sub-division) of Markethill in County Armagh in Northern Ireland.\nIn 1887, the Main Northern railway line to Sydney was completed, requiring a bridge over the Hawkesbury River and a tunnel through the sandstone ridge west of Woy Woy. The introduction of this transport link and then the Pacific Highway in 1930 accelerated the development of the region. Electification of the line reached Gosford on 23 January 1960.\nGosford became a town in 1885 and was declared a municipality in 1886. It was then declared a Shire in 1947, and a City on 1 January 1980. \nDemographics.\nAs of the 2021 census, there were 4,873 people in Gosford CBD. 58.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 5.0%, and Nepal 4.1%. 64.0% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Nepali at 3.8% and Mandarin at 3.3%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.1% and Catholic 15.8%.\nThe Gosford Statistical Area, which incorporates the whole of Gosford's city and suburbs, includes Avoca Beach, Erina, Ettalong Beach, Kariong, Kincumber, Narara, Terrigal, Woy Woy, and Wyoming, and at the 2021 census had a population of 178,427.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nGosford has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa) with warm summers and mild winters. In summer, temperatures average about 27\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C in the day with high humidity and about 17\u201318\u00a0\u00b0C at night. Winters are mild with cool overnight temperatures and mild to occasionally warm daytime temperatures with lower humidity. Records range from a maximum of on 18 January 2013, to a low of on 16 July 1970.\nAverage rainfall is 1314.3\u00a0mm, much of which falls in the late summer and autumn. Rainfall is less common in late winter and early spring because of the foehn effect, as the city is located on the leeward side of the Great Dividing Range. The reason for the relatively high amount of annual rainfall compared to other places in the vicinity is the shape and orientation of the coastline which makes Gosford (and the Central Coast region in general) slightly more prone to rain from southerly winds.\nCentral business district.\nGosford proper is located in a valley with President's Hill on the city's western border, Rumbalara Reserve on its eastern border, and Brisbane Water to the city's south. Mann Street, Gosford's main street and part of the Pacific Highway, runs north\u2013south and contains the frontage for much of the commercial district.\nIn the centre of Gosford is a shopping and community precinct, including Kibble Park, William Street Mall, Gosford City Library, the Imperial Shopping Centre and a full range of shops, cafes, banks and services.\nA renewed period of optimism has followed demolition of several derelict buildings and several infrastructure investment projects including the full fibre optic telecommunications rollout of the National Broadband Network in 2012 in the city's CBD as well as the so-called Kibbleplex project, announced in 2013 that plans to house the new regional library, tertiary teaching rooms and associated organisations.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nGosford is situated along an identified business growth corridor between Erina, the West Gosford light industrial zone and Somersby. Connectivity of main roads and rail travel times between Sydney, the Central Coast and the Hunter region are key issues for corporate business relocation to the region. Aged and personal care and retail are major employers in Gosford.\nAs an entertainment hub, Mann Street enjoys relatively good public transport links and is one of the Central Coast's most popular spots for pubs and clubs and in close proximity to cultural and sporting events.\nYacht and other boat building has been undertaken by East Coast Yachts since 1964 in West Gosford.\nFacilities.\nGosford is home to:\nTransport.\nBus services in Gosford are operated by Busways and Red Bus CDC NSW.\nThe Central Coast Highway cuts through Gosford's waterfront area, while its predecessor the Pacific Highway, takes on several names through the CBD itself.\nMann Street contains the main public transport links for Gosford, including Gosford railway station, with NSW TrainLink services twice an hour in the off-peak to Sydney Central and Newcastle Interchange, with more frequent services in the morning and evening peaks.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nAll major digital-only television channels are available in Gosford. The networks and the channels they broadcast are listed as follows:\nOf the three main commercial networks:\nRadio.\nRadio stations that broadcast to the city are:\nSport.\nGosford formerly had a professional team in the National Rugby League from 2000 until 2002, the Northern Eagles. The club, formed as a merger between the previously Gosford-bound North Sydney Bears and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, played its allocation of Gosford home matches at the purpose-built Central Coast Stadium. The club licence however reverted to Manly in 2003 and the club was dissolved.\nThe Central Coast Mariners professional football club was formed in 2005 to participate in the A-League. The club has won two titles to date, most recently defeating Melbourne City in the 2023 A-League Men Grand Final.\nLocally, Gosford is the headquarters of the Central Coast Division Rugby League, which owns the Central Coast League Club in downtown Gosford. The suburb of Gosford has one current club, the St. Edwards Bears, and one junior club, the Gosford Kariong Storm. The Storm were initially a senior club as well, formed from the merger of the Gosford Townies/Giants and the nearby Kariong Kookaburras.\nThe Central Coast Rugby Union features eight first grade clubs and is one of the strongest local rugby union competitions in the state.\nThe city also has local Australian rules and cricket clubs as well as basketball and Netball teams.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13076", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13076", "title": "Gordon Brown", "text": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2007 to 2010\nJames Gordon Brown (born 20 February 1951) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2010. Previously, he was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1997 to 2007 under Tony Blair. Brown was Member of Parliament (MP) for Dunfermline East from 1983 to 2005 and for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath from 2005 to 2015. He has served as United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education since 2012, and he was appointed as World Health Organization Ambassador for Global Health Financing in 2021.\nA doctoral graduate, Brown studied history at the University of Edinburgh. He spent his early career as a lecturer at a further education college and as a television journalist. Brown was elected to the House of Commons at the 1983 general election as the MP for Dunfermline East. He was appointed to Neil Kinnock's shadow cabinet in 1989 and was named Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer by John Smith in 1992. Following Labour's victory in the 1997 general election, Brown was appointed as chancellor, becoming the longest-serving in modern history. Brown's time as chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting to the Bank of England, extending the powers of the Treasury to cover much domestic policy, and transferring banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Brown presided over the longest period of economic growth in British history. He outlined five economic tests, which resisted the UK adopting the euro. Controversial moves included the abolition of advance corporation tax (ACT) relief in his first budget, the sale of UK gold reserves from 1999 to 2002, and the removal in his final budget of the 10% starting rate of income tax that he had introduced in the 1999 budget.\nFollowing Blair's resignation in 2007, Brown was elected unopposed to succeed him as prime minister and party leader. The party continued as New Labour, though Brown's style of government differed from Blair's. He remained committed to close ties with the United States and to the war in Iraq, although he established an inquiry into the reasons for Britain's participation in the conflict. Brown's government introduced rescue packages to keep banks afloat during the 2008 financial crisis, and so national debt increased. The government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, which had experienced severe financial difficulties, and injected public money into other banks. In 2008, Brown's government passed the world's first Climate Change Act, and he also introduced the Equality Act 2010. Despite poll rises just after Brown became prime minister, when he failed to call a snap election in 2007, his popularity fell and Labour's popularity declined with the Great Recession. Labour lost 91 seats in the 2010 general election, resulting in a hung parliament in which the Conservative Party won the most seats. After the Conservatives formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, Brown was succeeded as prime minister by Conservative leader David Cameron, and as Labour leader by Ed Miliband.\nAfter leaving office, Brown returned to the backbenches, continuing to serve as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until he gave up his seat in 2015. He has since made occasional political interventions and has published political-themed books. Brown played a prominent role in the campaign to maintain the union during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and he wrote a report on devolution in 2022 for Labour leader Keir Starmer. Brown has served as the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, as well as the World Health Organization's Ambassador for Global Health Financing. He was awarded the Order of the Companions of Honour by King Charles III in the 2024 Birthday Honours for public and charitable services in the UK and abroad. As chancellor, Brown had high approval ratings; a poll of political scientists rated him the most successful post-war chancellor in terms of economic stability, working independently from the prime minister and leaving a lasting legacy on the British economy. His premiership has been viewed less favourably; although public opinion of Brown has improved since he left office, his premiership has been viewed as average in historical rankings and public opinion of British prime ministers.\nEarly life.\nJames Gordon Brown was born at the Orchard Maternity Nursing Home in Giffnock, Renfrewshire, Scotland. His father was John Ebenezer Brown (1914\u20131998), a minister of the Church of Scotland and a strong influence on Brown. His mother was Jessie Elizabeth \"Bunty\" Brown (\"n\u00e9e\" Souter; 1918\u20132004); she was the daughter of John Souter, a timber merchant. The family moved to Kirkcaldy \u2013 then the largest town in Fife, across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh \u2013 when Gordon was three. Brown was brought up there with his elder brother John and younger brother Andrew in a manse; he is therefore often referred to as a \"son of the manse\", an idiomatic Scottish phrase, similar to the American phrase \"preacher's kid\".\nEducation.\nBrown was educated first at Kirkcaldy West Primary School, where he was selected for an experimental fast stream education programme, which took him two years early to Kirkcaldy High School for an academic hothouse education taught in separate classes. Aged 16, he wrote that he loathed and resented this \"ludicrous\" experiment on young lives.\nHe was accepted by the University of Edinburgh to study history at the same early age of 16. During an end-of-term rugby union match at his old school, he received a kick to the head and experienced a retinal detachment. This left him blind in his left eye, despite treatment including several operations and weeks spent lying in a darkened room. Later at Edinburgh, while playing tennis, he noticed the same symptoms in his right eye. Brown underwent experimental surgery at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and his right eye was saved by a young eye surgeon, Hector Chawla. Brown graduated from Edinburgh with an undergraduate MA degree with First-Class Honours in history in 1972. He stayed on to obtain his PhD degree in history, which he gained ten years later in 1982, defending a thesis titled \"The Labour Party and Political Change in Scotland 1918\u20131929\".\nIn his youth at the University of Edinburgh, Brown was involved in a romantic relationship with Margarita, Crown Princess of Romania. Margarita said about it: \"It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't seem right anymore, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing.\" An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: \"She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, but they seemed made for each other.\"\nIn 1972, while still a student, Brown was elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh, the convener of the University Court. He served as Rector until 1975, and also edited the document \"The Red Paper on Scotland\".\nCareer before Parliament.\nFrom 1976 to 1980 Brown was employed as a lecturer in politics at Glasgow College of Technology. He also worked as a tutor for the Open University. In the 1979 general election, Brown stood for the Edinburgh South constituency, losing to the Conservative candidate, Michael Ancram.\nFrom 1980, he worked as a journalist at Scottish Television, later serving as current affairs editor until his election to Parliament in 1983.\nElection to Parliament and opposition.\nBrown was elected to Parliament as a Labour MP at his second attempt, for Dunfermline East in the 1983 general election. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency, Tony Blair. Brown became an opposition spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a biography of the Independent Labour Party politician James Maxton, the subject of his doctoral thesis. Brown was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992 following Labour's fourth consecutive defeat in the general election that year. Having led the \"Labour Movement Yes\" campaign, refusing to join the cross-party \"Yes for Scotland\" campaign, during the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, while other senior Labour politicians \u2013 including Robin Cook, Tam Dalyell and Brian Wilson \u2013 campaigned for a \"No\" vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, signing the Claim of Right for Scotland in 1989.\nLabour leader John Smith died suddenly in May 1994. Brown did not contest the leadership after Tony Blair became the favourite to win the 1994 leadership election, deciding to make way for Blair to avoid splitting the pro-modernising vote in the leadership ballot. It has long been rumoured a deal was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita restaurant in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to the fortunes of New Labour, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.\nAs Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting was seen as a good choice by business and the middle class. During his tenure as chancellor, the rate of inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target; the Governor of the Bank of England, under the rules governing the Bank's role, wrote an explanatory letter to the Chancellor on each occasion inflation exceeded three per cent. Following a reorganisation of Westminster constituencies in Scotland in 2005, Brown became MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath at the general election.\nChancellor of the Exchequer (1997\u20132007).\nIn the 1997 general election, Labour defeated the Conservatives by a landslide to end their 18-year exile from government, and when Tony Blair, the new prime minister, announced his ministerial team on 2 May 1997, he appointed Brown as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Brown would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history. Some achievements from Brown's decade as chancellor included making the Bank of England independent and delivering an agreement on poverty and climate change at the G8 summit in 2005.\nEarly economic reforms.\nOn taking office as chancellor, Brown gave the Bank of England operational independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At the same time, he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2008 financial crisis.\nTaxation and spending.\nDuring the 1997 election campaign and subsequently, Brown pledged not to increase the basic or higher rates of income tax. Over his Chancellorship he reduced the basic rate from 23% to 20%; however, in all budgets but his final one, he increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation rather than with earnings, resulting in fiscal drag. Under Brown, corporation tax fell from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for small businesses. In 1999, he introduced a lower income tax band of 10%. He abolished this 10% tax band in his last budget in 2007 to reduce the basic rate from 22% to 20%, increasing tax for 5 million people and, according to the calculations of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, leaving those earning between \u00a35,000 and \u00a318,000 as the biggest losers. To backbench cheers, Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus: \"Having put in place more focused ways of incentivising work and directly supporting children and pensioners at a cost of \u00a33bn a year, I can now return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non-savings income\". Brown also implemented the Windfall Tax in 1997 on the privatised utilities. The tax produced an estimated one-off income to the government of \u00a35 billion, which was used to fund the New Deal for Young People, a welfare-to-work program that sought to tackle long-term unemployment.\nAccording to the OECD, UK taxation increased from a 39.3% share of gross domestic product in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than that of Germany. This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing \"stealth taxes\". A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the dividends on stock investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK.\nBrown's 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of government spending, particularly on health and education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance to pay for health spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as chancellor, Brown gave an extra \u00a33\u00a0billion in pension allowances, an increase in the child tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another \u00a31\u00a0billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.\nUnder Brown, the tax code, the standard guide to tax, doubled in length to 17,000 pages.\nEuropean single currency.\nIn October 1997, Brown announced that the Treasury would set five economic tests to determine whether the economic case had been made for the United Kingdom to adopt the European single currency. The Treasury indicated that the tests had not been passed in June 2003.\nOther issues.\nIn 2000, Brown was accused of starting a political row about higher education (referred to as the Laura Spence affair) when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures, describing its decision not to offer a place to state school pupil Laura Spence as \"absolutely outrageous\". Lord Jenkins, then Oxford Chancellor and himself a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, said \"nearly every fact he used was false.\"\nBetween 1999 and 2002 Brown sold 60% of the UK's gold reserves shortly before gold entered a protracted bull market, since nicknamed by dealers as the Brown Bottom or Brown's Bottom. The official reason for selling the gold reserves was to reduce the portfolio risk of the UK's reserves by diversifying away from gold. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5\u00a0billion. By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19 billion, leading to Brown's decision to sell the gold being widely criticised. As of August 2024 the gold prize is approximately \u00a31,905 per ounce, which would value the reserves sold at \u00a326.5 billion.\nAs Chancellor, Brown argued against renationalising the railways, saying at the Labour conference in 2004 that it would cost \u00a322\u00a0billion.\nDuring his time as chancellor, Brown reportedly believed that it was appropriate to remove most, but not all, of the unpayable Third World debt. On 20 April 2006, in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors, Brown outlined a \"Green\" view of global development.\nLabour leadership bid.\nIn October 2004, Blair announced he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year.\nBrown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; he was the only candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become prime minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as prime minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds in the war on terror as key priorities.\nOn 11 May 2007, after months of speculation, Brown formally announced his bid for the Labour leadership. He launched his campaign website the same day as formally announcing his bid for leadership, titled \"Gordon Brown for Britain\". On 16 May, Channel 4 News announced that Andrew MacKinlay had nominated Brown, giving him 308 nominations\u2014enough to avoid a leadership contest. A BBC report states that the decisive nomination was made by Tony Wright with MacKinlay yet to nominate at that point. Brown replaced Blair as Leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007.\nPrime minister (2007\u20132010).\nAfter Blair tendered his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II, Brown was invited by the queen to form a government and become prime minister on 27 June 2007. In his first speech as prime minister, Brown said \"This will be a new government with new priorities and I have been privileged to have been granted the great opportunity to serve my country. And at all times I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action, in the service of what matters to the British people, meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country.\"\nBrown rescinded some of the policies which had been introduced or were planned by Blair's administration. He remained committed to close ties with the United States and to the war in Iraq, although he established an inquiry into the reasons for Britain's participation in the conflict. He proposed a \"government of all the talents\" which would involve co-opting leading personalities from industry and professional occupations into government positions. Brown also appointed Jacqui Smith as the UK's first female Home Secretary, while Brown's former position as chancellor of the exchequer was taken over by Alistair Darling. He proposed moving some traditional prime ministerial powers conferred by royal prerogative to the realm of Parliament, such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions. Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight of the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form \"citizens' juries\", easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted that the attorney general should not have the right to decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the loans for peerages scandal.There was speculation during September and early October 2007 about whether Brown would call a snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not flash, just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as prime minister; however, Brown announced on 6 October that there would be no election any time soon \u2013 despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either. Brown has since claimed that Labour would have won the 2007 election but he did not believe an early election was in the national interest.\nHis political opponents accused him of being indecisive, which Brown denied. In July 2008, he supported a new bill extending the pre-charge detention period to 42 days. The bill was met with opposition on both sides of the House and backbench rebellion. In the end, the bill passed by just nine votes. The House of Lords defeated the bill, with Lords characterising it as \"fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary\", stating that \"it seeks to further erode fundamental legal and civil rights\".\nBrown was mentioned by the press in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner; however, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim. Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a \u00a3153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.\nDomestic policy.\nDuring his Labour leadership campaign Brown proposed some policy initiatives, which he called the \"manifesto for change\".\nThe manifesto included a clampdown on corruption and a new Ministerial Code, which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers. He also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that he wanted a \"better constitution\" that is \"clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today\". He planned to set up an all-party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at rebalancing powers between Whitehall and local government. Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops were sent into action in future.\nHe said he wanted to release more land and ease access to ownership with shared equity schemes. He backed a proposal to build new eco-towns, each housing between 10,000 and 20,000 homeowners \u2013 up to 100,000 new homes in total.\nBrown also said he wanted to have doctors' surgeries open at the weekends, and GPs on call in the evenings. Doctors were given the right of opting out of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, which awarded them a 22 per cent pay rise in 2006.\nOn 5 June 2007, just three weeks before he was due to take the post of prime minister, Brown made a speech promising \"British Jobs for British workers\". Brown reiterated that promise at the Labour Party's annual conference in September, which caused controversy as he coupled this with a commitment to crack down on migrant workers. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, promptly pointed out that such a commitment was illegal under EU law. Other controversial statements made by Brown about migration included him stating that English lessons and taking mandatory community service should be prerequisites for being granted UK citizenship.\nDuring the Queen's Speech to Parliament on 3 December 2008, the Brown government unveiled plans to introduce lie detector tests, based on voice recognition technology, in order to determine whether to accept benefit claims. Despite having spent \u00a32.4 million on these tests, trials performed by the Department for Work and Pensions showed that they were inaccurate approximately four of every seven times they were used.\nForeign policy.\nBrown had been committed to the Iraq War, but said in a speech in June 2007 that he would \"learn the lessons\" from the mistakes made in Iraq. Brown said in a letter published on 17 March 2008 that the United Kingdom would hold an inquiry into the war.\nBrown went to great lengths to empathise with those who lost family members in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. He has often said \"War is tragic\", echoing Blair's quote, \"War is horrible\". Nonetheless, in November 2007 Brown was accused by some senior military figures of not adhering to the Military Covenant, a convention within British politics ensuring adequate safeguards, rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to orders derived from the policy of the elected government.\nBrown did not attend the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics on 8 August 2008 in Beijing; instead, he attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to send a message to China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.\nIn a speech in July 2007, Brown clarified his position regarding Britain's relationship with the United States: \"We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America in dealing with the common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have got to remember that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as Tony Blair did, very closely with the American administration.\"\nBrown and the Labour party had pledged to allow a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony for the Treaty of Lisbon. Brown's opponents on both sides of the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give the British public a referendum on the original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. Most notably the Supremacy Clause was removed and replaced with a substantially weaker declaration. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.\nDrug policy.\nDuring Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain classified as a Class C drug. Acting against the advice of the council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had \"made up his mind\" to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, \"I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people\u2014this is not acceptable\". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, \"Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view\u00a0... When that happens, then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice\".\nGlobal recession.\nBrown's premiership coincided with the global recession, during which Brown called for fiscal action in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. Domestically, Brown's administration introduced measures including a bank rescue package worth around \u00a3500\u00a0billion (approximately $850\u00a0billion), a temporary 2.5 percentage point cut in value-added tax and a \"car scrappage\" scheme.\nChallenges to leadership.\nIn mid-2008, Brown's leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest; however, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, an MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position. While she did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour Party to hold a leadership election. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterward, on 12 September. She was supported in making clear her desire for a contest by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government.\nIn the face of this speculation over Brown's future, his ministers backed him to lead the party, and Harriet Harman and David Miliband denied that they were preparing leadership bids. After Labour lost the Glasgow East by-election in July, Harman, the deputy leader of the party, said that Brown was the \"solution\", not the \"problem\"; Home Secretary Smith, Justice Secretary Jack Straw, Schools Secretary Ed Balls and Cabinet Office Minister Ed Miliband all re-affirmed their support for Brown. The deputy prime minister under Blair, John Prescott, also pledged his support. Foreign Secretary David Miliband then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid, when on 30 July, an article written by him in \"The Guardian\" was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown. In the article, Miliband outlined the party's future, but neglected to mention the prime minister. Miliband, responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election, and that his article was an attack against the fatalism in the party since the loss of Glasgow East. Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in the face of the challenge that emerged in September, as did Business Secretary John Hutton, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn, and Chief Whip Geoff Hoon.\nOn 4 June 2009 James Purnell resigned from the Cabinet, and called for Brown's resignation as prime minister.\nOn 6 January 2010, Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of Brown's leadership. The call received little support, and the following day Hoon said that it appeared to have failed and was \"over\". Brown later referred to the call for a secret ballot as a \"form of silliness\".\nBy-elections and 2009 local and EU elections.\nIn the local elections on 1 May 2008, Labour suffered its worst results in 40 years, finishing in third place with a projected 24% share of the national vote. Subsequently, the party saw the loss of by-elections in Crewe and Nantwich and Henley as well as slumps in the polls. A by-election in Glasgow East triggered by the resignation of David Marshall saw Labour struggle to appoint a candidate, eventually settling for Margaret Curran, a sitting MSP in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats all derided Labour for their disorganised nature, with Alex Salmond commenting \"This is their 'lost weekend'\u2014they don't have a leader in Scotland, they don't have a candidate in Glasgow East, and they have a prime minister who refuses to come to the constituency\". Labour lost the constituency to the Scottish National Party's John Mason who took 11,277 votes, with Labour just 365 behind. The seat experienced a swing of 22.54%.\nIn the European elections, Labour polled 16% of the vote, finishing in third place behind the Conservatives and UK Independence Party (UKIP). Voter apathy was reflected in the historically low turnout of around thirty-three per cent. In Scotland, voter turnout was only twenty-eight per cent. In the local elections, Labour polled 23% of the vote, finishing in third place behind Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, with Labour losing control of the four councils it had held prior to the election. In a vote widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal, the share of the votes was down for all the major parties; Labour was down one per cent, the Conservative share was down five per cent. The beneficiary of the public backlash was generally seen to be the minor parties, including the Green Party and UKIP. These results were Labour's worst since World War II. Brown was quoted in the press as having said that the results were \"a painful defeat for Labour\", and that \"too many good people doing so much good for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own.\"\n2010 general election.\nIn April 2010, Brown asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament. The general election campaign included the first televised leadership debates in Britain. The result of the election on 6 May was a hung parliament. Brown was re-elected as MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath with 29,559 votes.\n2010 government formation and resignation.\nBrown announced on 10 May 2010 that he would stand down as Labour Leader, with a view to a successor being chosen before the next Labour Party Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed, and a Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition agreement was reached. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as prime minister to Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.\nPost-premiership (2010\u2013present).\nReturn to the backbenches (2010\u20132015).\nOn 13 May 2010, in his first public appearance since leaving 10 Downing Street, two days after resigning as prime minister and Leader of the Labour Party, Brown confirmed he intended to stay on in Parliament, serving as a Labour backbencher, to serve the people of his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency. He continued to serve as the MP of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until 2015.\nTowards the end of May 2010, Brown began writing \"Beyond the Crash\", completing it after 14 weeks. The book discusses the 2008 financial crisis and Brown's recommendations for future co-ordinated global action.\nHe played a prominent role in the lead-up to, and the aftermath of, the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, campaigning for Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom. \"Our vision for the future of Scotland \u2013 yes a Scottish parliament for fairness, battling for equality across the UK\", he told voters in an impassioned speech on the eve of polling. \"But our vision is bigger than that \u2013 at every point, particularly through our membership of the UK, to fight for what is our dream, what is our demand. A world not of a separate state, but a world of social justice people can believe in. What kind of message does Scotland send to the world if, tomorrow, we said we are going to give up on sharing, we are going to smash our partnership, we are going to abandon co-operation and we are going to throw the idea of solidarity into the dust. This is not the Scotland I know and recognise.\"\nOn 1 December 2014, Brown announced that he would not be seeking re-election to parliament. He stood down at the general election in May 2015.\nIMF speculation.\nIn April 2011, media reports linked Brown with the role of managing director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Brown's successor and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, supported Brown for the role, while the prime minister, David Cameron, voiced opposition to this. Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced. Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde \u2013 the eventual successful candidate \u2013 for the post.\nOther appointments.\nSir Tim Berners-Lee, who had worked with the government during Brown's premiership to publish government data on the internet in the data.gov.uk project, invited Brown to become a board director of the World Wide Web Foundation to \"advise the Web Foundation on ways to involve disadvantaged communities and global leaders in the development of sustainable programs that connect humanity and affect positive change\", and he was elected to the board of directors in September 2010.\nOn 22 April 2011, it was announced that Brown would be taking on an unpaid advisory role at the World Economic Forum. Brown was also appointed as the inaugural 'Distinguished Leader in Residence' by New York University and took part in discussions and lectures relating to the 2008 financial crisis and globalisation.\nIn July 2012, Brown was named by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education. He chaired the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity. The position is unpaid.\nIn December 2015, Brown took his first large-scale role in the private sector since standing down as prime minister in 2010, becoming an advisor to PIMCO. Any money earned from the role is to go to the Gordon and Sarah Brown Foundation to support charitable work.\nOn 7 November 2017, Brown released his memoir \"My Life, Our Times\".\nIn September 2020, Brown was a co-author of a letter to the journal \"Nature\" highlighting the importance of EU funding in the fight against COVID-19. The letter was organised by Scientists for Labour, an organisation of which he is a patron.\nOn 10 June 2021, Brown released the book \"Seven Ways to Change the World: How To Fix The Most Pressing Problems We Face.\" The book features Brown's forensic examination of seven areas where global reform and action are essential.\nIn September 2021, Brown was appointed by the World Health Organization as Goodwill Ambassador for Global Health Financing.\nOn 5 December 2022, having led development of a Labour party blueprint on constitutional reform, Brown announced the publication of these proposals alongside future Labour prime minister Keir Starmer. These proposals included plans for the replacement of the House of Lords with a \"Assembly of the Nations and Regions\", electing around 200 members on a different electoral cycle to that of the House of Commons. Other measures include the \"strengthening of the Sewel Convention\" such that the ability of devolved administrations to veto UK Parliament legislation affecting devolved issues is \"constitutionally protected\", plans to grant the Scottish Parliament greater powers over foreign affairs \"so that Scotland could sign up to international groups or agreements within devolved areas\" such as Erasmus, and plans to transfer powers to English regions and local mayors. The proposals were criticised by the SNP who described them as \"underwhelming\", and the Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle who described plans to replace the Lords with an elected chamber as weakening the supremacy of the Commons. Following Labour's landslide victory in the 2024 general election, Brown congratulated Starmer on his victory, saying: \"My best wishes to all the new Labour MPs and, above all, I congratulate the British people who have chosen not just change, but hope.\"\nOn 28 September 2023, Brown released the book \"Permacrisis: A Plan to Fix a Fractured World,\" which he co-wrote with Michael Spence and Mohamed A. El-Erian. In 2024 Brown co-authored a pamphlet on child poverty demanding a multibillion-pound package to solve what he dubbed 'a social crisis'.\nIn November 2024, Brown wrote an article in opposition to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill arguing that the UK needed to improve its palliative care provision instead of legalising assisted dying.\nPersonal life.\nBrown's early girlfriends included journalist Sheena McDonald and Princess Margarita, the eldest daughter of exiled King Michael of Romania. At the age of 49, Brown married Sarah Macaulay in a private ceremony at his home in North Queensferry, Fife, on 3 August 2000. A daughter, Jennifer Jane, was born prematurely on 28 December 2001; she died on 7 January 2002, one day after experiencing a brain haemorrhage. The couple have two sons, John Macaulay (born 17 October 2003) and (James) Fraser (born on 18 July 2006). In November 2006, Fraser was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. \"The Sun\" had learned of the situation in 2006 and published the story. In 2011, Brown stated he had wanted the details of his son's condition kept private and that the publication had left him \"in tears\". The \"Sun\" said they approached Brown and that discussion occurred with his colleagues who provided quotes to use in the article.\nSarah Brown rarely made official appearances, whether with or without her husband. She is patron of several charities and has written articles for national newspapers related to this. At the 2008 Labour Party Conference, Sarah caused surprise by taking to the stage to introduce her husband for his keynote address. After that, her public profile increased.\nBrown has two brothers, John Brown and Andrew Brown. Andrew has been Head of Media Relations in the UK for the French-owned utility company EDF Energy since 2004.

Named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, the \"Galileo\" spacecraft consisted of an orbiter and an atmospheric entry probe. It was delivered into Earth orbit on October 18, 1989, by Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\" on the STS-34 mission, and arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after gravity assist flybys of Venus and Earth, and became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. The spacecraft then launched the first probe to directly measure its atmosphere. Despite suffering major antenna problems, \"Galileo\" achieved the first asteroid flyby, of 951 Gaspra, and discovered the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, around 243 Ida. In 1994, \"Galileo\" observed Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9's collision with Jupiter.\nJupiter's atmospheric composition and ammonia clouds were recorded, as were the volcanism and plasma interactions on Io with Jupiter's atmosphere. The data \"Galileo\" collected supported the theory of a liquid ocean under the icy surface of Europa, and there were indications of similar liquid-saltwater layers under the surfaces of Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede was shown to possess a magnetic field and the spacecraft found new evidence for exospheres around Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. \"Galileo\" also discovered that Jupiter's faint ring system consists of dust from impact events on the four small inner moons. The extent and structure of Jupiter's magnetosphere was also mapped.\nThe primary mission concluded on December 7, 1997, but the \"Galileo\" orbiter commenced an extended mission known as the \"Galileo\" Europa Mission (GEM), which ran until December 31, 1999. By the time GEM ended, most of the spacecraft was operating well beyond its original design specifications, having absorbed three times the radiation exposure that it had been built to withstand. Many of the instruments were no longer operating at peak performance, but were still functional, so a second extension, the \"Galileo\" Millennium Mission (GMM) was authorized. On September 20, 2003, after 14 years in space and 8 years in the Jovian system, \"Galileo\"'s mission was terminated by sending the orbiter into Jupiter's atmosphere at a speed of over to eliminate the possibility of contaminating the moons with bacteria.\nBackground.\nJupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with more than twice the mass of all the other planets combined. Consideration of sending a probe to Jupiter began as early as 1959, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed four mission concepts:\nTwo missions to Jupiter, \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\", were approved in 1969, with NASA's Ames Research Center given responsibility for planning the missions. \"Pioneer 10\" was launched in March 1972 and passed within of Jupiter in December 1973. It was followed by \"Pioneer 11\", which was launched in April 1973, and passed within of Jupiter in December 1974, before heading on to an encounter with Saturn. They were followed by the more advanced \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" spacecraft, which were launched on 5 September and 20 August 1977 respectively, and reached Jupiter in March and July 1979.\nPlanning.\nInitiation.\nFollowing the approval of the \"Voyager\" missions, NASA's Scientific Advisory Group for Outer Solar System Missions considered the requirements for Jupiter orbiters and atmospheric probes. It noted that the technology to build a heat shield for an atmospheric probe did not yet exist, and indeed facilities to test one under the conditions found on Jupiter would not be available until 1980. There was also concern about the effects of radiation on spacecraft components, which would be better understood after \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\" had conducted their flybys. \"Pioneer 10\"'s flyby in December 1973 indicated that the effects were not as severe as had been feared. NASA management designated JPL as the lead center for the Jupiter Orbiter Probe (JOP) Project. John R. Casani, who had headed the \"Mariner\" and \"Voyager\" projects, became the first project manager. The JOP would be the fifth spacecraft to visit Jupiter, but the first to orbit it, and the probe the first to enter its atmosphere.\nAmes and JPL decided to use a \"Mariner\" spacecraft for the Jupiter orbiter like the ones used for \"Voyager\" rather than a \"Pioneer\" spacecraft. \"Pioneer\" was stabilized by spinning the spacecraft at 60 rpm, which gave a 360-degree view of the surroundings, and did not require an attitude control system. By contrast, \"Mariner\" had an attitude control system with three gyroscopes and two sets of six nitrogen jet thrusters. Attitude was determined with reference to the Sun and Canopus, which were monitored with two primary and four secondary star tracker sensors. There was also an inertial reference unit and an accelerometer. The attitude control system allowed the spacecraft to take high-resolution images, but the functionality came at the cost of increased weight: a \"Mariner\" weighed compared to just for a \"Pioneer\".\nThe increase in weight had implications. The Voyager spacecraft had been launched by Titan IIIE rockets with a \"Centaur\" upper stage, but Titan was retired afterwards. In the late 1970s, NASA was focused on the development of the reusable Space Shuttle, which was expected to make expendable rockets obsolete. In late 1975, NASA decreed that all future planetary missions would be launched by the Space Shuttle. The JOP would be the first to do so. The Space Shuttle was supposed to have the services of a space tug to launch payloads requiring something more than a low Earth orbit, but this was never approved. The United States Air Force (USAF) instead developed the solid-fueled Interim Upper Stage (IUS), later renamed the Inertial Upper Stage (with the same acronym), for the purpose.\nThe IUS was constructed in a modular fashion, with two stages, a large one with of propellant, and a smaller one with . This was sufficient for most satellites. It could also be configured with two large stages to launch multiple satellites. A configuration with three stages, two large and one small, would be enough for a planetary mission, so NASA contracted with Boeing for the development of a three-stage IUS. A two-stage IUS was not powerful enough to launch a payload to Jupiter without resorting to using a series of gravity-assist maneuvers around planets to garner additional speed. Most engineers regarded this solution as inelegant and planetary scientists at JPL disliked it because it meant that the mission would take months or even years longer to reach Jupiter. Longer travel times meant that the spacecraft's components would age and possibly fail, and the onboard power supply and propellant would be depleted. Some of the gravity assist options also involved flying closer to the Sun, which would induce thermal stresses that also might cause failures.\nIt was estimated that the JOP would cost $634 million (equivalent to $ billion in 2024), and it had to compete for fiscal year 1978 funding with the Space Shuttle and the Hubble Space Telescope. A successful lobbying campaign secured funding for both JOP and Hubble over the objections of Senator William Proxmire, the chairman of the Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. The United States Congress approved funding for the Jupiter Orbiter Probe on July 19, 1977, and JOP officially commenced on October 1, 1977, the start of the fiscal year. Project manager Casani solicited suggestions for a more inspirational name for the project from people associated with it. The most votes went to \"Galileo\", after Galileo Galilei, the first person to view Jupiter through a telescope, and the discoverer of what are now known as the Galilean moons in 1610. It was noted at the time that the name was also that of a spacecraft in the \"\" television show. In February 1978, Casani officially announced the choice of the name \"Galileo\".\nPreparation.\nTo enhance reliability and reduce costs, the project engineers decided to switch from a pressurized atmospheric probe to a vented one, so the pressure inside the probe would be the same as that outside, thus extending its lifetime in Jupiter's atmosphere, but this added to its weight. Another was added in structural changes to improve reliability. This required additional fuel in the IUS, but the three-stage IUS was itself overweight with respect to its design specifications, by about . Lifting \"Galileo\" and the three-stage IUS required a special lightweight version of the Space Shuttle external tank, the Space Shuttle orbiter stripped of all non-essential equipment, and the Space Shuttle main engines (SSME) running at full power level\u2014109 percent of their rated power level. Running at this power level necessitated the development of a more elaborate engine cooling system. Concerns were raised over whether the engines could be run at 109 percent by the launch date, so a gravity-assist maneuver using Mars was substituted for a direct flight.\nPlans called for the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" to launch \"Galileo\" on the STS-23 mission, tentatively scheduled for sometime between January 2 and 12, 1982, this being the launch window when Earth, Mars and Jupiter were aligned to permit Mars to be used for the gravity-assist maneuver. By 1980, delays in the Space Shuttle program pushed the launch date for \"Galileo\" back to 1984. While a Mars slingshot was still possible in 1984, it would no longer be sufficient.\nNASA decided to launch \"Galileo\" on two separate missions, launching the orbiter in February 1984 with the probe following a month later. The orbiter would be in orbit around Jupiter when the probe arrived, allowing the orbiter to perform its role as a relay. This configuration required a second Space Shuttle mission and a second carrier spacecraft to be built for the probe to take it to Jupiter, and was estimated to cost an additional $50 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024), but NASA hoped to be able to recoup some of this through competitive bidding. The problem was that while the atmospheric probe was light enough to launch with the two-stage IUS, the Jupiter orbiter was too heavy to do so, even with a gravity assist from Mars, so the three-stage IUS was still required.\nBy late 1980, the price tag for the IUS had risen to $506 million (equivalent to $ billion in 2024). The USAF could absorb this cost overrun on the development of the two-stage IUS (and indeed anticipated that it might cost far more), but NASA was faced with a quote of $179 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) for the development of the three-stage version, which was $100 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) more than it had budgeted for. At a press conference on January 15, 1981, Robert A. Frosch, the NASA Administrator, announced that NASA was withdrawing support for the three-stage IUS, and going with a Centaur G Prime upper stage because \"no other alternative upper stage is available on a reasonable schedule or with comparable costs.\"\nCentaur provided many advantages over the IUS. The main one was that it was far more powerful. The probe and orbiter could be recombined, and the probe could be delivered directly to Jupiter in two years' flight time. The second was that, despite this, it was gentler than the IUS, because it had lower thrust. This reduced the chance of damage to the payload. Thirdly, unlike solid-fuel rockets which burned to completion once ignited, a Centaur could be switched off and on again. This gave it flexibility, which increased the chances of a successful mission, and permitted options like asteroid flybys. Centaur was proven and reliable, whereas the IUS had not yet flown. The only concern was about safety; solid-fuel rockets were considered safer than liquid-fuel ones, especially ones containing liquid hydrogen. NASA engineers estimated that additional safety features might take up to five years to develop and cost up to $100 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024).\nIn February 1981, JPL learned that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was planning major cuts to NASA's budget, and was considering cancelling \"Galileo\". The USAF intervened to save \"Galileo\" from cancellation. JPL had considerable experience with autonomous spacecraft that could make their own decisions. This was a necessity for deep space probes, since a signal from Earth takes from 35 to 52 minutes to reach Jupiter, depending on the relative position of the planets in their orbits. The USAF was interested in providing this capability for its satellites, so that they would be able to determine their attitude using onboard systems rather than relying on ground stations, which were not \"hardened\" against nuclear weapons, and could take independent evasive action against anti-satellite weapons. It was also interested in the manner in which JPL was designing \"Galileo\" to withstand the intense radiation of the magnetosphere of Jupiter, as this could be used to harden satellites against the electromagnetic pulse of nuclear explosions. On February 6, 1981 Strom Thurmond, the President pro tem of the Senate, wrote directly to David Stockman, the director of the OMB, arguing that \"Galileo\" was vital to the nation's defense.\nIn December 1984, Casani proposed adding a flyby of asteroid 29 Amphitrite to the \"Galileo\" mission. In plotting a course to Jupiter, the engineers wanted to avoid asteroids. Little was known about them at the time, and it was suspected that they could be surrounded by dust particles. Flying through a dust cloud could damage the spacecraft's optics and possibly other parts of the spacecraft as well. To be safe, JPL wanted to avoid asteroids by at least . Most of the asteroids in the vicinity of the flight path like 1219 Britta and 1972 Yi Xing were only a few kilometers in diameter and promised little scientific value when observed from a safe distance, but 29 Amphitrite was one of the largest, and a flyby at even could have great value. The flyby would delay the spacecraft's arrival in Jupiter orbit from August 29 to December 10, 1988, and the expenditure of propellant would reduce the number of orbits of Jupiter from eleven to ten. This was expected to add $20 to $25 million (equivalent to $ to $ million in 2024) to the cost of the \"Galileo\" project. The 29 Amphitrite flyby was approved by NASA Administrator James M. Beggs on December 6, 1984.\nDuring testing, contamination was discovered in the system of metal slip rings and brushes used to transmit electrical signals around the spacecraft, and they were returned to be refabricated. The problem was traced back to a chlorofluorocarbon used to clean parts after soldering. It had been absorbed, and was then released in a vacuum environment. It mixed with debris generated as the brushes wore down, and caused intermittent problems with electrical signal transmission. Problems were also detected in the performance of memory devices in an electromagnetic radiation environment. The components were replaced, but then a read disturb problem arose, in which reads from one memory location disturbed the contents of adjacent locations. This was found to have been caused by the changes made to make the components less sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. Each component had to be removed, retested, and replaced. All of the spacecraft components and spare parts received a minimum of 2,000 hours of testing. The spacecraft was expected to last for at least five years\u2014long enough to reach Jupiter and perform its mission. On December 19, 1985, it departed JPL in Pasadena, California, on the first leg of its journey, a road trip to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The \"Galileo\" mission was scheduled for STS-61-G on May 20, 1986, using Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\".\nSpacecraft.\nJPL built the Galileo spacecraft and managed the Galileo program for NASA, but West Germany's Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm supplied the propulsion module, and Ames managed the atmospheric probe, which was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company. At launch, the orbiter and probe together had a mass of and stood tall. There were twelve experiments on the orbiter and seven on the atmospheric probe. The orbiter was powered by a pair of general-purpose heat source radioisotope thermoelectric generators (GPHS-RTGs) fueled by plutonium-238 that generated 570\u00a0watts at launch. The atmospheric probe had a lithium\u2013sulfur battery rated at 730\u00a0watt-hours.\nProbe instruments included sensors for measuring atmospheric temperature and pressure. There was a mass spectrometer and a helium-abundance detector to study atmospheric composition, and a whistler detector for measurements of lightning activity and Jupiter's radiation belt. There were magnetometer sensors, a plasma-wave detector, a high-energy particle detector, a cosmic and Jovian dust detector, and a heavy ion counter. There was a near-infrared mapping spectrometer for multispectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis, and an ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases.\nReconsideration.\nOn January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" lifted off on the STS-51-L mission. A failure of the solid rocket booster 73 seconds into flight tore the spacecraft apart, resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members. The Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster was America's worst space disaster up to that time. The immediate impact on the \"Galileo\" project was that the May launch date could not be met because the Space Shuttles were grounded while the cause of the disaster was investigated. When they did fly again, \"Galileo\" would have to compete with high-priority Department of Defense launches, the tracking and data relay satellite system, and the Hubble Space Telescope. By April 1986, it was expected that the Space Shuttles would not fly again before July 1987 at the earliest, and \"Galileo\" could not be launched before December 1987.\nThe Rogers Commission into the \"Challenger\" disaster handed down its report on June 6, 1986. It was critical of NASA's safety protocols and risk management. In particular, it noted the hazards of a Centaur-G stage. On June 19, 1986, NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher canceled the Shuttle-Centaur project. This was only partly due to the NASA management's increased aversion to risk in the wake of the \"Challenger\" disaster; NASA management also considered the money and manpower required to get the Space Shuttle flying again, and decided that there were insufficient resources to resolve lingering issues with Shuttle-Centaur as well. The changes to the Space Shuttle proved more extensive than anticipated, and in April 1987, JPL was informed that \"Galileo\" could not be launched before October 1989. The \"Galileo\" spacecraft was shipped back to JPL.\nWithout Centaur, it looked like there was no means of getting \"Galileo\" to Jupiter. For a time, \"Los Angeles Times\" science reporter Usha Lee McFarling noted, \"it looked like \"Galileo\"'s only trip would be to the Smithsonian Institution.\" The cost of keeping it ready to fly in space was reckoned at $40 to $50 million per year (equivalent to $ to $ million in 2024), and the estimated cost of the whole project had blown out to $1.4 billion (equivalent to $ billion in 2024).\nAt JPL, the \"Galileo\" Mission Design Manager and Navigation Team Chief, Robert Mitchell, assembled a team that consisted of Dennis Byrnes, Louis D'Amario, Roger Diehl and himself, to see if they could find a trajectory that would get \"Galileo\" to Jupiter using only a two-stage IUS. Roger Diehl came up with the idea of using a series of gravity assists to provide the additional velocity required to reach Jupiter. This would require \"Galileo\" to fly past Venus, and then past Earth twice. This was referred to as the Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist (VEEGA) trajectory.\nThe reason no one had considered the VEEGA trajectory before was that the second encounter with Earth would not give the spacecraft any extra energy. Diehl realised that this was not necessary; the second encounter would merely change its direction to put it on a course for Jupiter. In addition to increasing the flight time, the VEEGA trajectory had another drawback from the point of view of NASA Deep Space Network (DSN): \"Galileo\" would arrive at Jupiter when it was at the maximum range from Earth, and maximum range meant minimum signal strength. It would have a declination of 23 degrees south instead of 18 degrees north, so the tracking station would be the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex in Australia, with its two 34-meter and one 70-meter antennae. A northerly declination could have been supported by two sites, at Goldstone and Madrid. The Canberra antennae were supplemented by the 64-meter antenna at the Parkes Observatory.\nInitially it was thought that the VEEGA trajectory demanded a November launch, but D'Amario and Byrnes calculated that a mid-course correction between Venus and Earth would permit an October launch as well. Taking such a roundabout route meant that \"Galileo\" would require sixty months to reach Jupiter instead of just thirty, but it would get there. Consideration was given to using the USAF's Titan IV launch system with its Centaur G Prime upper stage. This was retained as a backup for a time, but in November 1988 the USAF informed NASA that it could not provide a Titan IV in time for the May 1991 launch opportunity, owing to the backlog of high priority Department of Defense missions. However, the USAF supplied IUS-19, which had originally been earmarked for a Department of Defense mission, for use by the \"Galileo\" mission.\nNuclear concerns.\nAs the launch date of \"Galileo\" neared, anti-nuclear groups, concerned over what they perceived as an unacceptable risk to the public's safety from the plutonium in \"Galileo\"'s GPHS-RTG modules, sought a court injunction prohibiting \"Galileo\"'s launch. RTGs were necessary for deep space probes because they had to fly distances from the Sun that made the use of solar energy impractical. They had been used for years in planetary exploration without mishap: the Department of Defense's Lincoln Experimental Satellites 8/9 had 7 percent more plutonium on board than \"Galileo\", and the two \"Voyager\" spacecraft each carried 80 percent of \"Galileo\"'s load of plutonium. By 1989, plutonium had been used in 22 spacecraft.\nActivists remembered the crash of the Soviet Union's nuclear-powered Kosmos 954 satellite in Canada in 1978, and the \"Challenger\" disaster, while it did not involve nuclear fuel, raised public awareness about spacecraft failures. No RTGs had ever done a non-orbital swing past the Earth at close range and high speed, as \"Galileo\"'s VEEGA trajectory required it to do. This created the possibility of a mission failure in which Galileo struck Earth's atmosphere and dispersed plutonium. Planetary scientist Carl Sagan, a strong supporter of the \"Galileo\" mission, wrote that \"there is nothing absurd about either side of this argument.\"\nBefore the \"Challenger\" disaster, JPL had conducted shock tests on the RTGs that indicated that they could withstand a pressure of without a failure, which would have been sufficient to withstand an explosion on the launch pad. The possibility of adding additional shielding was considered but rejected, mainly because it would add an unacceptable amount of extra weight. After the \"Challenger\" disaster, NASA commissioned a study on the possible effects if such an event occurred with \"Galileo\" on board. Angus McRonald, a JPL engineer, concluded that what would happen would depend on the altitude at which the Space Shuttle broke up. If the \"Galileo\"/IUS combination fell free from the orbiter at , the RTGs would fall to Earth without melting, and drop into the Atlantic Ocean about from the Florida coast. On the other hand, if the orbiter broke up at an altitude of it would be traveling at and the RTG cases and GPHS modules would melt before falling into the Atlantic off the Florida coast.\nNASA concluded that the chance of a disaster was 1 in 2,500, although anti-nuclear groups thought it might be as high as 1 in 430. NASA assessed the risk to an individual at 1 in 100 million, about two orders of magnitude less than the danger of being killed by lightning. The prospect of an inadvertent re-entry into the atmosphere during the VEEGA maneuvers was reckoned at less than 1 in 2 million, but an accident might have released a maximum of . This could result in up to 9 fatalities from cancer per 10 million exposed people.\nLaunch.\nSTS-34 was the mission designated to launch \"Galileo\", scheduled for October 12, 1989, in the Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\". The spacecraft was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center by a high-speed truck convoy that departed JPL in the middle of the night. There were fears that the trucks might be hijacked by anti-nuclear activists or terrorists after the plutonium, so the route was kept secret from the drivers beforehand, and they drove through the night and the following day and only stopped for food and fuel.\nLast-minute efforts by three environmental groups (the Christic Institute, the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice and the Foundation on Economic Trends) to halt the launch were rejected by the District of Columbia Circuit on technical grounds rather than the merits of the case, but in a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Patricia Wald wrote that while the legal challenge was not frivolous, there was no evidence of the plaintiffs' claim that NASA had acted improperly in compiling the mission's environmental assessment. On October 16, eight protesters were arrested for trespassing at the Kennedy Space Center; three were jailed and the remaining five released. Federal judge Oliver Gasch ruled on October 21 that the launch was in the public interest, as canceling it would cost the public $164 million and increased knowledge of the Solar system.\nThe launch was twice delayed; first by a faulty main engine controller that forced a postponement to October 17, and then by inclement weather, which necessitated a postponement to the following day, but this was not a concern since the launch window extended until November 21. \"Atlantis\" finally lifted off at 16:53:40 UTC on October 18, and went into a orbit. \"Galileo\" was successfully deployed at 00:15 UTC on October 19. Following the IUS burn, the \"Galileo\" spacecraft adopted its configuration for solo flight, and separated from the IUS at 01:06:53 UTC on October 19. The launch was perfect, and \"Galileo\" was soon headed towards Venus at over . \"Atlantis\" returned to Earth safely on October 23.\nVenus encounter.\nThe encounter with Venus on February 9 was in view of the DSN's Canberra and Madrid Deep Space Communications Complexes. \"Galileo\"'s closest approach to Venus came at 05:58:48 UTC on February 10, 1990, at a range of . Due to the Doppler effect, the spacecraft's velocity relative to Earth could be computed by measuring the change in carrier frequency of the spacecraft's transmission compared to the nominal frequency. Doppler data collected by the DSN allowed JPL to verify that the gravity-assist maneuver had been successful, and the spacecraft had obtained the expected increase in speed. Unfortunately, three hours into the flyby, the tracking station at Goldstone had to be shut down due to high winds, and Doppler data was lost.\nBecause Venus was much closer to the Sun than the spacecraft had been designed to operate, great care was taken to avoid thermal damage. In particular, the X-band high gain antenna (HGA) was not deployed, but was kept folded up like an umbrella and pointed away from the Sun to keep it shaded and cool. This meant that the two small S-band low-gain antennae (LGAs) had to be used instead. They had a maximum bandwidth of 1,200 bits per second (bit/s) compared to the 134,000 bit/s expected from the HGA. As the spacecraft moved further from Earth, reception necessitated the use of the DSN's 70-meter dishes, to the detriment of other users, who had lower priority than \"Galileo\". Even so, the downlink telemetry rate fell to 40 bit/s within a few days of the Venus flyby, and by March it was down to just 10 bit/s.\nVenus had been the focus of many automated flybys, probes, balloons and landers, most recently the 1989 \"Magellan\" spacecraft, and \"Galileo\" had not been designed with Venus in mind. Nonetheless, there were useful observations that it could make, as it carried some instruments that had never flown on spacecraft to Venus, such as the near-infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS). Telescopic observations of Venus had revealed that there were certain parts of the infrared spectrum that the greenhouse gases in the Venusian atmosphere did not block, making them transparent on these wavelengths. This permitted the NIMS to both view the clouds and obtain maps of the equatorial- and mid-latitudes of the night side of Venus with three to six times the resolution of Earth-based telescopes. The ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) was also deployed to observe the Venusian clouds and their motions.\nAnother set of observations was conducted using Galileo's energetic-particles detector (EPD) when \"Galileo\" moved through the bow shock caused by Venus's interaction with the solar wind. Earth's magnetic field causes the bow shock to occur at around from its center, but Venus's weak magnetic field causes it to occur nearly on the surface, so the solar wind interacts with the atmosphere. A search for lightning on Venus was conducted using the plasma-wave detector, which noted nine bursts likely to have been caused by lightning, but efforts to capture an image of lightning with the solid-state imaging system (SSI) were unsuccessful.\nEarth encounters.\nFlybys.\n\"Galileo\" made two course corrections on April 9 to 12 and May 11 to 12, 1990, to alter its velocity by . The spacecraft flew by Earth twice; the first time at a range of at 20:34:34\u00a0UTC on December 8, 1990. This was higher than predicted, and the time of the closest approach was within a second of the prediction. It was the first time that a deep space probe had returned to Earth from interplanetary space. A second flyby of Earth was at at 15:09:25\u00a0UTC on December 8, 1992. This time the spacecraft passed within a kilometer of its aiming point over the South Atlantic. This was so accurate that a scheduled course correction was cancelled, thereby saving of propellant.\nEarth's bow shock and the solar wind.\nThe Earth encounters provided an opportunity for a series of experiments. A study of Earth's bow shock was conducted as \"Galileo\" passed by Earth's day side. The solar wind travels at and is deflected by Earth's magnetic field, creating a magnetic tail on Earth's dark side over a thousand times the radius of the planet. Observations were made by \"Galileo\" when it passed through the magnetic tail on Earth's dark side at a distance of from the planet. The magnetosphere was quite active at the time, and \"Galileo\" detected magnetic storms and whistlers caused by lightning strikes.\nThe NIMS was employed to look for mesospheric clouds, which were thought to be caused by methane released by industrial processes. The water vapor in the clouds breaks down the ozone in the upper atmosphere. Normally the clouds are only seen in September or October, but \"Galileo\" was able to detect them in December, an indication of possible damage to Earth's ozone layer.\nRemote detection of life on Earth.\nCarl Sagan, pondering the question of whether life on Earth could be easily detected from space, devised a set of experiments in the late 1980s using \"Galileo\"'s remote sensing instruments during the mission's first Earth flyby in December 1990. After data acquisition and processing, Sagan published a paper in \"Nature\" in 1993 detailing the results of the experiment. \"Galileo\" had indeed found what are now referred to as the \"Sagan criteria for life\". These included strong absorption of light at the red end of the visible spectrum (especially over continents) by chlorophyll in photosynthesizing plants; absorption bands of molecular oxygen as a result of plant activity; infrared bands caused by the approximately 1 micromole per mole of methane (a gas which must be replenished by volcanic or biological activity) in the atmosphere; and modulated narrowband radio wave transmissions uncharacteristic of any known natural source. \"Galileo\"'s experiments were thus the first scientific controls in the newborn science of astrobiological remote sensing.\nLunar observations.\nEn route to \"Galileo\"'s second gravity-assist flyby of Earth, the spacecraft flew over the lunar north pole on December 8, 1992, at an altitude of . The north pole had been photographed before, by \"Mariner 10\" in 1973, but \"Galileo\"'s cameras, with their per pixel imagery, provided new information about a region that still held some scientific mysteries. The infrared spectromer surveyed the surface minerals and revealed that the region was more minerallogically diverse than expected. There was evidence that the Moon had been volcanically active earlier than originally thought, and the spectrometer clearly distinguished different lava flows on the Mare Serenitatis. Areas where titanium-rich material had been blasted from vents, like the one sampled by Apollo 17, showed up clearly.\n\"Galileo\" Optical Experiment.\nDuring the second Earth flyby, another experiment was performed. Optical communications in space were assessed by detecting light pulses from powerful lasers with \"Galileo\"'s CCD. The experiment, dubbed \"Galileo\" Optical Experiment or GOPEX, used two separate sites to beam laser pulses to the spacecraft, one at Table Mountain Observatory in California and the other at the Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico. The Table Mountain site used a operating at a frequency-doubled wavelength of 532\u00a0nm, with a repetition rate of 15 to 30\u00a0Hertz and a pulse power full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the tens of megawatts range, which was coupled to a Cassegrain reflector telescope for transmission to \"Galileo\". The Starfire range site used a similar setup with a larger transmitting telescope. Long-exposure (~0.1 to 0.8\u00a0s) images using \"Galileo\"'s 560\u00a0nm centered green filter produced images of Earth clearly showing the laser pulses even at distances of up to .\nAdverse weather conditions, restrictions placed on laser transmissions by the U.S. Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) and a pointing error caused by the scan platform on the spacecraft not being able to change direction and speed as quickly as expected (which prevented laser detection on all frames with less than 400\u00a0ms exposure times) contributed to a reduction in the number of successful detections of the laser transmission to 48 of the total 159 frames taken. Nonetheless, the experiment was considered a resounding success and the data acquired were used to design laser downlinks to send large volumes of data very quickly from spacecraft to Earth. The scheme was studied in 2004 for a data link to a future Mars-orbiting spacecraft. On December 5, 2023, NASA's Deep Space Optical Communications experiment on the \"Psyche\" spacecraft used infrared lasers for two-way communication between Earth and the spacecraft.\nHigh-gain antenna problem.\nAfter the Venus flyby and \"Galileo\" passing beyond Earth\u2019s orbit, it was no longer risky to employ the HGA, so on April 11, 1991, \"Galileo\" was ordered to unfurl it. This was done using two small dual drive actuator (DDA) motors to drive a worm gear, and was expected to take 165 seconds, or 330 seconds if one actuator failed. The antenna had 18 graphite-epoxy ribs; when the driver motor started and put pressure on the ribs, they were supposed to pop out of the cup their tips were held in, and the antenna would unfold like an umbrella. When it reached the fully deployed configuration, redundant microswitches would shut down the motors. Otherwise they would run for eight minutes before being automatically shut down to prevent them from overheating.\nThrough telemetry from \"Galileo\", investigators determined that the electric motors had stalled at 56 seconds. The spacecraft's spin rate had decreased due to an increase in its moment of inertia and its wobble increased, indicative of an asymmetric unfolding. Only 15 ribs had popped out, leaving the antenna looking like a lop-sided, half-open umbrella. It was not possible to re-fold the antenna and try the opening sequence again; although the motors were capable of running in reverse, the antenna was not designed for this, and human assistance was required when it was done on Earth to ensure that the wire mesh did not snag.\nThe first thing the \"Galileo\" team tried was to rotate the spacecraft away from the Sun and back again on the assumption that the problem was with friction holding the pins in their sockets. If so, then heating and cooling the ribs might cause them to pop out of their sockets. This was done seven times, but with no result. They then tried swinging LGA-2 (which faced in the opposite direction to the HGA and LGA-1) 145 degrees to a hard stop, thereby shaking the spacecraft. This was done six times with no effect. Finally, they tried shaking the antenna by pulsing the DDA motors at 1.25 and 1.875 Hertz. This increased the torque by up to 40 percent. The motors were pulsed 13,000 times over a three-week period in December 1992 and January 1993, but only managed to move the ballscrew by one and a half revolutions beyond the stall point.\nInvestigators concluded that during the 4.5 years that \"Galileo\" spent in storage after the \"Challenger\" disaster, the lubricants between the tips of the ribs and the cup were eroded. They were then worn down by vibration during the three cross-country journeys by truck between California and Florida for the spacecraft. The failed ribs were those closest to the flat-bed trailers carrying \"Galileo\" on these trips. The use of land transport was partly to save costs\u2014air transport would have cost an additional $65,000 () or so per trip\u2014but also to reduce the amount of handling required in loading and unloading the aircraft, which was considered a major risk of damage. The spacecraft was also subjected to severe vibration in a vacuum environment by the IUS. Experiments on Earth with the test HGA showed that having a set of stuck ribs all on one side reduced the DDA torque produced by up to 40 percent.\nThe antenna lubricants were applied only once, nearly a decade before launch. Furthermore, the HGA was not subjected to the usual rigorous testing, because there was no backup unit that could be installed in \"Galileo\" in case of damage. The flight-ready HGA was never given a thermal evaluation test, and was unfurled only a half dozen or so times before the mission. Testing might not have revealed the problem in any case; the Lewis Research Center was never able to replicate the problem on Earth, and it was assumed to be the combination of loss of lubricant during transportation, vibration during launch by the IUS, and a prolonged period of time in the vacuum of space where bare metal touching could undergo cold welding. Whatever the cause, the HGA was rendered useless.\nThe two LGAs were capable of transmitting information back to Earth, but since it transmitted its signal over a cone with a 120-degree half-angle, allowing it to communicate even when not pointed at Earth, its bandwidth was significantly less than that of the HGA would have been, as the HGA transmitted over a half-angle of one-sixth of a degree. The HGA was to have transmitted at 134\u00a0kilobits per second, whereas LGA-1 was only intended to transmit at about 8 to 16\u00a0bits per second. LGA-1 transmitted with a power of about 15 to 20\u00a0watts, which by the time it reached Earth and had been collected by one of the large aperture 70-meter DSN antennas, had a total power of about 10\u201120\u00a0watts. The change to mission plan required a series of software changes to be uploaded.\nImage data collected was buffered and collected in \"Galileo\"'s Command and Data Subsystem (CDS) memory. This represented 192 kilobytes of the 384 kilobyte CDS storage, and had been added late, out of concern that the 6504 Complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) memory devices might not be reliable during a VEEGA mission. As it happened, they gave no trouble, but the CDS memory could store up to 31 minutes of data from the Radio Relay Hardware (RRH) channels. To conserve bandwidth, data-compression software was implemented. Image compression used an integer approximation of the discrete cosine transform, while other data were compressed with variant of the Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch algorithm. Using compression, the arraying of several Deep Space Network antennas, and sensitivity upgrades to the receivers used to listen to \"Galileo\"'s signal, data throughput was increased to a maximum of 160\u00a0bits per second. By further using data compression, the effective bandwidth could be raised to 1,000\u00a0bits per second.\nThe data collected on Jupiter and its moons were stored in the spacecraft's onboard tape recorder, and transmitted back to Earth during the long apoapsis portion of the probe's orbit using the low-gain antenna. At the same time, measurements were made of Jupiter's magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth. The reduction in available bandwidth reduced the total amount of data transmitted throughout the mission, but William J. O'Neil, \"Galileo\"'s project manager from 1992 to 1997, expressed confidence that 70 percent of \"Galileo\"'s science goals could still be met. The decision to use magnetic tape for storage was a conservative one, taken in the late 1970s when the use of tape was common. Conservatism was not restricted to engineers; a 1980 suggestion that the results of \"Galileo\" could be distributed electronically instead of on paper was regarded as ridiculous by geologists, on the grounds that storage would be prohibitively expensive; some of them thought that taking measurements on a computer involved putting a wooden ruler up to the screen.\nAsteroid encounters.\n951 Gaspra.\nTwo months after entering the asteroid belt, \"Galileo\" performed the first asteroid encounter by a spacecraft. \"Galileo\" passed 951 Gaspra, an S-type asteroid, at a distance of at 22:37\u00a0UTC on October 29, 1991, at a relative speed of about . Fifty-seven images of Gaspra were taken with the SSI, covering about 80 percent of the asteroid. Without the HGA, the bit rate was only about 40 bit/s, so an image took up to 60 hours to transmit back to Earth. The \"Galileo\" project was able to secure 80 hours of Canberra's 70-meter dish time between 7 and 14 November 1991, but most of images taken, including low-resolution images of more of the surface, were not transmitted to Earth until November 1992.\nThe imagery revealed a cratered and irregular body, measuring about . Its shape was not remarkable for an asteroid of its size. Measurements were taken using the NIMS to indicate the asteroid's composition and physical properties. While Gaspra has plenty of small craters\u2014over 600 of them ranging in size from \u2014it lacks large ones, hinting at a relatively recent origin, although it is possible that some of the depressions were eroded craters. Several relatively flat planar areas were found, suggesting that Gaspra was formed from another body by a collision. Measurements of the solar wind in the vicinity of the asteroid showed it changing direction a few hundred kilometers from Gaspra, which hinted that Gaspra might have a magnetic field, but this was not certain.\n243 Ida and Dactyl.\nFollowing the second Earth encounter, \"Galileo\" performed close observations of another asteroid, 243 Ida. A slight trajectory correction was made to enable this on August 26, 1993. With four hours to go before the encounter with Ida, \"Galileo\" spontaneously abandoned the observation configuration and resumed its cruise configuration. Engineers were able to correct the problem and have the instruments ready by 16:52:04\u00a0UTC on August 28, 1993, when \"Galileo\" flew past Ida at a range of . High-resolution images were taken to create a color mosaic of one side of the asteroid, with the highest resolution image taken at a range of . Measurements were taken using SSI and NIMS.\nTransmission was still limited to the 40 bit/s data rate available during the Gaspra flyby. At that rate, it took thirty hours to send each of the five frames. In September, the line of sight between \"Galileo\" and Earth was close to the Sun, so there was only time to send one mosaic before it was blocked by the Sun on September 29, 1993; the rest of the mosaics were transmitted in February and March, after Earth had come around the Sun. \"Galileo\"'s tape recorder was used to store the images, but tape space was also required for the primary Jupiter mission. A technique was developed whereby only image fragments of two or three lines out of every 330 were initially sent. A determination could then be made as to whether the image was of 243 Ida or of empty space. Ultimately, only about 16 percent of the SSI data recorded could be sent back to Earth.\nWhen astronomer Ann Harch examined the images on February 17, 1994, she found that Ida had a small moon measuring around in diameter, which appeared in 47 images. A competition was held among \"Galileo\" project members to select a name for the moon, which was ultimately dubbed Dactyl after the legendary Dactyls, mythical beings which lived on Mount Ida, the geographical feature on Crete the asteroid was named for. Craters on Dactyl were named after individual dactyloi. Regions on 243 Ida were named after cities where Johann Palisa, the discover of 243 Ida, made his observations, while ridges on 243 Ida were named in honor of deceased \"Galileo\" team members.\nDactyl was the first asteroid moon to be discovered. Moons of asteroids had been assumed to be rare, but the discovery of Dactyl hinted that they might in fact be quite common. From subsequent analysis of this data, Dactyl appeared to be an S-type asteroid, and spectrally different from 243 Ida, although Ida is also an S-type asteroid. It was hypothesized that both may have been produced by the breakup of a Koronis parent body.\nVoyage to Jupiter.\nComet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9.\n\"Galileo\"'s prime mission was a two-year study of the Jovian system, but on March 26, 1993, while it was en route, astronomers Carolyn S. Shoemaker, Eugene M. Shoemaker and David H. Levy discovered fragments of a comet orbiting Jupiter, the remains of a comet that had passed within Jupiter's Roche limit and had been torn apart by tidal forces. It was named Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9. Calculations indicated that it would crash into the planet sometime between July 16 and 24, 1994. Although \"Galileo\" was still away, Jupiter was 66 pixels wide in its camera, and it was perfectly positioned to observe this event. Terrestrial telescopes had to wait to see the impact event sites as they rotated into view because it would occur on Jupiter's night side.\nInstead of burning up in Jupiter's atmosphere as expected, the first of the 21 comet fragments struck the planet at around and exploded with a fireball high, easily discernible to Earth-based telescopes even though it was on the night side of the planet. The impact left a series of dark scars on the planet, some two or three times as large as the Earth, that persisted for weeks. When \"Galileo\" observed an impact in ultraviolet light, the fireballs lasted for about ten seconds, but in the infrared they persisted for 90 seconds or more. When a fragment hit the planet, it increased Jupiter's overall brightness by about 20 percent. The NIMS observed one fragment create a fireball in diameter that burned with a temperature of , which was hotter than the surface of the Sun.\nProbe deployment.\nThe \"Galileo\" probe separated from the orbiter at 03:07\u00a0UTC on July 13, 1995, five months before its rendezvous with the planet on December 7. At this point, the spacecraft was from Jupiter, but from Earth, and telemetry from the spacecraft, transmitted at the speed of light, took 37 minutes to reach JPL. A tiny frequency change in the radio signal indicated that the separation had been accomplished. The \"Galileo\" orbiter was still on a collision course with Jupiter. Previously, course corrections had been made using the twelve thrusters, but with the probe on its way, the \"Galileo\" orbiter could now fire its Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm main engine which had been covered by the probe until then. At 07:38 UTC on July 27, it was fired for the first time to place the \"Galileo\" orbiter on course to enter orbit around Jupiter, whence it would act as a communications relay for the \"Galileo\" probe. The \"Galileo\" probe's project manager, Marcie Smith at the Ames Research Center, was confident that the LGAs could be used as relays. The burn lasted for five minutes and eight seconds, and changed the velocity of the \"Galileo\" orbiter by .\nDust storms.\nIn August 1995, the \"Galileo\" orbiter encountered a severe dust storm from Jupiter that took several months to traverse. Normally the spacecraft's dust detector picked up a dust particle every three days; now it detected up to 20,000 particles a day. Interplanetary dust storms had previously been encountered by the \"Ulysses\" probe, which had passed by Jupiter three years before on its mission to study the Sun's polar regions, but those encountered by \"Galileo\" were more intense. The dust particles were 5 to 10\u00a0nm in size, about the same as those in cigarette smoke, and had speeds ranging from depending on their size. The existence of the dust storms had come as a complete surprise to scientists when \"Ulysses\" encountered them. While data from both \"Ulysses\" and \"Galileo\" hinted that they originated somewhere in the Jovian system, it was a mystery how they had been created and how they had escaped from Jupiter's strong gravitational and electromagnetic fields.\nTape recorder anomaly.\nThe failure of \"Galileo\"'s high-gain antenna meant that data storage to the tape recorder for later compression and playback was crucial in order to obtain any substantial information from the flybys of Jupiter and its moons. The four-track, 114-megabyte digital tape recorder was manufactured by Odetics Corporation. On October 11, it was stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and were able to send commands to shut it off. Although the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction had possibly damaged a length of tape at the end of the reel. This section of tape was declared \"off limits\" to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before \"Galileo\" entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the Io and Europa observations during the orbit insertion phase in order to focus on recording data sent from the atmospheric probe during its descent.\nJupiter.\nArrival.\nThe \"Galileo\" orbiter's magnetometers reported that the spacecraft had encountered the bow shock of Jupiter's magnetosphere on November 16, 1995, when it was from Jupiter. The bow shock moved to and fro in response to solar wind gusts, and was therefore crossed multiple times between 16 and 26 November, by which time \"Galileo\" was from Jupiter.\nOn December 7, 1995, the orbiter arrived in the Jovian system. That day it made a flyby of Europa at 11:09 UTC, and then an flyby of Io at 15:46 UTC, using Io's gravity to reduce its speed, and thereby conserve propellant for use later in the mission. At 19:54 it made its closest approach to Jupiter. The orbiter's electronics had been heavily shielded against radiation, but the radiation surpassed expectations, and nearly exceeded the spacecraft's design limits. One of the navigational systems failed, but the backup took over. Most robotic spacecraft respond to failures by entering safe mode and awaiting further instructions from Earth, but this was not possible for \"Galileo\" during the arrival sequence due to the great distance and consequent long turnaround time.\nAtmospheric probe.\nThe descent probe awoke in response to an alarm at 16:00 UTC and began powering up its instruments. It passed through the rings of Jupiter and encountered a previously undiscovered radiation belt ten times as strong as Earth's Van Allen radiation belt above Jupiter's cloud tops. It had been predicted that the probe would pass through three layers of clouds; an upper one consisting of ammonia-ice particles at a pressure of ; a middle one of ammonium hydrosulfide ice particles at a pressure of ; and one of water vapor at . The atmosphere through which the probe descended was much denser and hotter than expected. Jupiter was also found to have only half the amount of helium expected and the data did not support the three-layered cloud structure theory: only one significant cloud layer was measured by the probe, at a pressure of around but with many indications of smaller areas of increased particle densities along the whole length of its trajectory.\nThe descent probe entered Jupiter's atmosphere, defined for the purpose as being above the pressure level, without any braking at 22:04 UTC on December 7, 1995. At this point it was moving at relative to Jupiter. This was by far the most difficult atmospheric entry yet attempted by any spacecraft; the probe had to withstand a peak deceleration of . The rapid flight through the atmosphere produced a plasma with a temperature of about , and the probe's carbon phenolic heat shield lost more than half of its mass, , during the descent. As the probe passed through Jupiter's cloud tops, it started transmitting data to the orbiter, above. The data was not immediately relayed to Earth, but a single bit was transmitted from the orbiter as a notification that the signal from the probe was being received and recorded, which would then take days to be transmitted using the LGA.\nThe atmospheric probe deployed its parachute fifty-three seconds later than anticipated, resulting in a small loss of upper-atmospheric readings. This was attributed to wiring problems with an accelerometer that determined when to begin the parachute deployment sequence. The probe then dropped its heat shield, which fell into Jupiter's interior. The parachute reduced the probe's speed to . The signal from the probe was no longer detected by the orbiter after 61.4 minutes, at an elevation of below the cloud tops and a pressure of . It was believed that the probe continued to fall at terminal velocity, as the temperature increased to and the pressure to , destroying it.\nThe probe detected less lightning, less water, but stronger winds than expected. Scientists had expected to find wind speeds of up to , but winds of up to were detected. The implication was that the winds are not produced by heat generated by sunlight (as Jupiter gets less sunlight than Earth) or the condensation of water vapor (the main causes on Earth), but are due to an internal heat source. It was already well known that the atmosphere of Jupiter was mainly composed of hydrogen, but the clouds of ammonia and ammonium sulfide were much thinner than expected, and clouds of water vapor were not detected. This was the first observation of ammonia clouds in another planet's atmosphere. The atmosphere creates ammonia-ice particles from material coming up from lower depths.\nThe atmosphere was more turbulent than expected. Wind speeds in the outermost layers were , in agreement with previous measurements from afar, but those wind speeds increased dramatically at pressure levels of , then remaining consistently high at around . The abundance of nitrogen, carbon and sulfur was three times that of the Sun, raising the possibility that they had been acquired from other bodies in the Solar system, but the low abundance of water cast doubt on theories that Earth's water had been acquired from comets.\nThere was far less lightning activity than expected, only about a tenth of the level of activity on Earth, but this was consistent with the lack of water vapor. More surprising was the high abundance of noble gases (argon, krypton and xenon), with abundances up to three times that found in the Sun. For Jupiter to trap these gases, it would have had to be much colder than today, around , which suggested that either Jupiter had once been much further from the Sun, or that the interstellar debris that the Solar system had formed from was much colder than had been thought.\nOrbiter.\nWith the probe data collected, the \"Galileo\" orbiter's next task was to slow down in order to avoid heading off into the outer solar system. A burn sequence commencing at 00:27 UTC on December 8 and lasting 49 minutes reduced the spacecraft's speed by and it entered a parking orbit with an orbital period of 198 days. The \"Galileo\" orbiter thus became the first artificial satellite of Jupiter. Most of its initial orbit was occupied transmitting the data from the probe back to Earth. When the orbiter reached its apojove on March 26, 1996, the main engine was fired again to increase the orbit from four times the radius of Jupiter to ten times. By this time the orbiter had received half the radiation allowed for in the mission plan, and the higher orbit was to conserve the instruments for as long as possible by limiting the radiation exposure.\nThe spacecraft traveled around Jupiter in elongated ellipses, each orbit lasting about two months. The differing distances from Jupiter afforded by these orbits allowed \"Galileo\" to sample different parts of the planet's extensive magnetosphere. The orbits were designed for close-up flybys of Jupiter's largest moons. A naming scheme was devised for the orbits: a code with the first letter of the moon being encountered on that orbit (or \"J\" if none was encountered) plus the orbit number.\nMission extension.\nAfter the primary mission concluded on December 7, 1997, most of the mission staff departed, including O'Neil, but about a fifth of them remained. The \"Galileo\" orbiter commenced an extended mission known as the \"Galileo\" Europa Mission (GEM), which ran until December 31, 1999. This was a low-cost mission, with a budget of $30 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024). The reason for calling it as the \"Europa\" mission rather than the \"Extended\" mission was political; although it was wasteful to scrap a spacecraft that was still functional and capable of performing a continuing mission, Congress took a dim view of requests for more money for projects that had already been fully funded. This was avoided through rebranding.\nThe smaller GEM team did not have the resources to deal with problems, but when they arose it was able to temporarily recall former team members for intensive efforts to solve them. The spacecraft performed several flybys of Europa, Callisto and Io. On each one the spacecraft collected only two days' worth of data instead of the seven it had collected during the prime mission. The radiation environment near Io, which \"Galileo\" approached to within on November 26, 1999, on orbit I25, was very unhealthy for \"Galileo\"'s systems, and so these flybys were saved for the extended mission when loss of the spacecraft would be more acceptable.\nBy the time GEM ended, most of the spacecraft was operating well beyond its original design specifications, having absorbed more than 600 kilorads in between 1995 and 2002, three times the radiation exposure that it had been built to withstand. Many of the instruments were no longer operating at peak performance, but were still functional, so a second extension, the \"Galileo\" Millennium Mission (GMM) was authorized. This was intended to run until March 2001, but it was subsequently extended until January 2003. GMM included return visits to Europa, Io, Ganymede and Callisto, and for the first time to Amalthea. The total cost of the original \"Galileo\" mission was about US$ (equivalent to $ billion in 2024). Of this, US$ (equivalent to $ million in 2024) was spent on spacecraft development. Another $110 million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) was contributed by international agencies.\nIo.\nThe innermost of the four Galilean moons, Io is roughly the same size as Earth's moon, with a mean radius of . It is in orbital resonance with Ganymede and Europa, and tidally locked with Jupiter, so just as the Earth's Moon always has the same side facing Earth, Io always has the same side facing Jupiter. It has a faster orbit though, with a rotation period of 1.769 days. As a result, the rotational and tidal forces on Io are 220 times as great as those on Earth's moon. These frictional forces are sufficient to melt rock, creating volcanoes and lava flows. Although only a third of the size of Earth, Io generates twice as much heat. While geological events occur on Earth over periods of thousands or even millions of years, cataclysmic events are common on Io. Visible changes occurred between orbits of \"Galileo\". The colorful surface is a mixture of red, white and yellow sulfur compounds.\n\"Galileo\" flew past Io, but in the interest of protecting the tape recorder, O'Neil decided to forego collecting images. To use the SSI camera meant operating the tape recorder at high speed, with sudden stops and starts, whereas the fields and particles instruments only required the tape recorder to run continuously at slow speeds, and it was believed that it could handle this. This was a crushing blow to scientists, some of whom had waited years for the opportunity. No other Io encounters were scheduled during the prime mission because it was feared that the high radiation levels close to Jupiter would damage the spacecraft. However, valuable information was still obtained; Doppler data used to measure Io's gravitational field revealed that Io had a core of molten iron and iron sulfide.\nAnother opportunity to observe Io arose during the \"Galileo\" Europa Mission (GEM), when \"Galileo\" flew past Io on orbits I24 and I25, and it would revisit Io during the \"Galileo\" Millennium Mission (GMM) on orbits I27, I31, I32 and I33. As \"Galileo\" approached Io on I24 at 11:09 UTC on October 11, 1999, it entered safe mode. Apparently, high-energy electrons had altered a bit on a memory chip. When it entered safe mode, the spacecraft turned off all non-essential functions. Normally it took seven to ten days to diagnose and recover from a safe mode incident; this time the \"Galileo\" Project team at JPL had nineteen hours before the encounter with Io. After a frantic effort, they managed to diagnose a problem that had never been seen before, and restore the spacecraft systems with just two hours to spare. Not all of the planned activities could be carried out, but \"Galileo\" obtained a series of high-resolution color images of the Pillan Patera, and Zamama, Prometheus, and Pele volcanic eruption centers.\nWhen \"Galileo\" next approached Io on I25 at 03:40 UTC on November 26, 1999, JPL were eating their Thanksgiving dinner at the \"Galileo\" Mission Control Center when, with the encounter with Io just four hours away, the spacecraft again entered safe mode. This time the problem was traced to a software patch implemented to bring \"Galileo\" out of safe mode during I24. Fortunately, the spacecraft had not shut down as much as it had on I24, and the team at JPL were able to bring it back online. During I24 they had done so with two hours to spare; this time, they had just three minutes. Nonetheless, the flyby was successful, with \"Galileo\"'s NIMS and SSI camera capturing an erupting volcano that generated a long plume of lava that was sufficiently large and hot to have also been detected by the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. While such events were more common and spectacular on Io than on Earth, it was extremely fortuitous to have captured it; planetary scientist Alfred McEwen estimated the odds at 1 in 500.\nThe safe-mode incidents on I24 and I25 left some gaps in the data, which I27 targeted. This time \"Galileo\" passed over the surface of Io. At this time, the spacecraft was nearly at the maximum distance from Earth, and there was a solar conjunction, a period when the Sun blocked the line of sight between Earth and Jupiter. As a consequence, three quarters of the observations had to be taken over a period of three hours. NIMS images revealed fourteen active volcanoes in a region thought to contain just four. Images of Loki Patera showed that in the four and half months between I24 and I27, some had been covered in fresh lava. A series of observations of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) had to be cancelled due to yet another safe-mode event. Radiation exposure caused a transient bus reset, a computer hardware error resulting in a safe mode event. A software patch implemented after the Europa encounter on orbit E19 guarded against this when the spacecraft was within 15 Jupiter radii of the planet, but this time it occurred at 29 Jupiter radii. The safe mode event also caused a loss of tape playback time, but the project managers decided to carry over some Io data into orbit G28, and play it back then. This limited the amount of tape space available for that Ganymede encounter, but the Io data was considered to be more valuable.\nThe discovery of Io's iron core raised the possibility that it had a magnetic field. The I24, I25 and I27 encounters had involved passes over Io's equator, which made it difficult to determine whether Io had its own magnetic field or one induced by Jupiter. Accordingly, on orbit I31, \"Galileo\" passed within of the surface of the north pole of Io, and on orbit I32 it flew over the south pole. After examining the magnetometer results, planetary scientist Margaret G. Kivelson, announced that Io had no intrinsic magnetic field, which meant that its molten iron core did not have the same convective properties as that of Earth.\nOn I31 \"Galileo\" sped through an area that had been in the plume of the Tvashtar Paterae volcano, and it was hoped that the plume could be sampled. This time, Tvashtar was quiet, but the spacecraft flew through the plume of another, previously unknown, volcano away. What had been assumed to be hot ash from the volcanic eruption turned out to be sulfur dioxide snowflakes, each consisting of 15 to 20 molecules clustered together. \"Galileo\"'s final return to Io on orbit I33 was marred by another safe mode incident, and much of the hoped-for data was lost.\nEuropa.\nAlthough the smallest of the four Galilean moons, with a radius of , Europa is the sixth-largest moon in the solar system. Observations from Earth indicated that it was covered in ice. Like Io, Europa is tidally locked with Jupiter. It is in orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede, with its 85-hour orbit being twice that of Io, but half that of Ganymede. Conjunctions with Io always occur on the opposite side of Jupiter to those with Ganymede. Europa is therefore subject to tidal effects. There is no evidence of volcanism like on Io, but \"Galileo\" revealed that the surface ice was covered in cracks.\nSome observations of Europa were made during orbits G1 and G2. On C3, \"Galileo\" conducted a \"nontargeted\" encounter of Europa\u2014meaning a secondary flyby at a distance of up to \u2014on November 6, 1996. During E4 from December 15 to 22, 1996, \"Galileo\" flew within of Europa, but data transmission was hindered by a Solar occultation that blocked transmission for ten days.\n\"Galileo\" returned to Europa on E6 in January 1997, this time at a height of , to analyze oval-shaped features in the infrared and ultraviolet spectra. Occultations by Europa, Io and Jupiter provided data on the atmospheric profiles of them, and measurements were made of Europa's gravitational field. On E11 from November 2 to 9, 1997, data was collected on the magnetosphere. Due to the problems with the HGA, only about two percent of the anticipated number of images of Europa were obtained by the primary mission. On the GEM, the first eight orbits (E12 through E19) were all dedicated to Europa, and \"Galileo\" paid it a final visit on E26 during the GMM.\nImages of Europa also showed few impact craters. It seemed unlikely that it had escaped the meteor and comet impacts that scarred Ganymede and Callisto, so this indicated Europa has an active geology that renews the surface and obliterates craters. Astronomer Clark Chapman argued that, assuming a crater occurs in Europa once every million years, and given only about twenty have been spotted on Europa, the implication is that the surface must only be about 10 million years old. With more data on hand, in 2003 a team led by Kevin Zahle at NASA's Ames Research Center arrived at a figure of 30 to 70 million years. Tidal flexing of up to per day was the most likely culprit. But not all scientists were convinced; Michael Carr, a planetologist from the US Geological Survey, argued that, on the contrary, Europa's surface age was closer to a billion years. He compared the craters on Ganymede with those on Earth's moon, and concluded that the satellites of Jupiter were not subject to the same amount of cratering.\nEvidence of surface renewal hinted at the possibility of a viscous layer below the surface of warm ice or liquid water. NIMS observations by \"Galileo\" indicated that the surface of Europa appeared to contain magnesium- and sodium-based salts. A likely source was brine below the ice crust. Further evidence was provided by the magnetometer, which reported that the magnetic field was induced by Jupiter. This could be explained by the existence of a spherical shell of conductive material like salt water. Since the surface temperature on Europa was , any water breaching the surface ice would instantly freeze over. Heat required to keep water in a liquid state could not come from the Sun, which at that distance had only 4 percent of the intensity it had on Earth, but ice is a good insulator, and the heat could be provided by the tidal flexing. \"Galileo\" also yielded evidence that the crust of Europa had slipped over time, moving south on the hemisphere facing Jupiter, and north on the far side.\nThere was acrimonious debate among scientists over the thickness of the ice crust, and those who presented results indicating that it might be thinner than the proposed by the accredited scientists on the \"Galileo\" Imaging Team faced intimidation, scorn, and reduced career opportunities. The \"Galileo\" Imaging Team was led by Michael J. Belton from the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Scientists who planned imaging sequences had the exclusive right to the initial interpretation of the \"Galileo\" data, most which was performed by their research students. The scientific community did not want a repetition of the 1979 Morabito incident, when Linda A. Morabito, an engineer at JPL working on \"Voyager 1\", discovered the first active extraterrestrial volcano on Io. The Imaging Team controlled the manner in which discoveries were presented to the scientific community and the public through press conferences, conference papers and publications.\nObservations by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 reported that Europa had a thin oxygen atmosphere. This was confirmed by \"Galileo\" in six experiments on orbits E4 and E6 during occultations when Europa was between \"Galileo\" and the Earth. This allowed Canberra and Goldstone to investigate the ionosphere of Europa by measuring the degree to which the radio beam was diffracted by charged particles. This indicated the presence of water ions, which were most likely water molecules that had been dislodged from the surface ice and then ionized by the Sun or the Jovian magnetosphere. The presence of an ionosphere was sufficient to deduce the existence of a thin atmosphere on Europa.\nOn December 11, 2013, NASA reported, based on results from the \"Galileo\" mission, the detection of \"clay-like minerals\" (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic materials, on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet.\nGanymede.\nThe largest of the Galilean moons with a radius of , Ganymede is larger than Earth's moon, the dwarf planet Pluto or the planet Mercury. It is the largest of the moons in the Solar system that are characterized by large amounts of water ice, which also includes Saturn's moon Titan, and Neptune's moon Triton. Ganymede has three times as much water for its mass as Earth has.\nWhen \"Galileo\" entered Jovian orbit, it did so at an orbital inclination to the Jovian equator, and therefore in the orbital plane of the four Galilean moons. To transfer orbit while conserving propellant, two slingshot maneuvers were performed. On G1, the gravity of Ganymede was used to slow the spacecraft's orbital period from 210 to 72 days to allow for more encounters and to take \"Galileo\" out of the more intense regions of radiation. On G2, the gravity assist was employed to put it into a coplanar orbit to permit subsequent encounters with Io, Europa and Callisto.\nAlthough the primary purpose of G1 and G2 was navigational, the opportunity to make some observations was not missed. The plasma-wave experiment and the magnetometer detected a magnetic field with a strength of about , more than strong enough to create a separate magnetosphere within that of Jupiter. This was the first time that a magnetic field had ever been detected on a moon contained within the magnetosphere of its host planet. This discovery led naturally to questions about its origin. The evidence pointed to an iron or iron sulfide core and mantle below the surface, encased in ice. Margaret Kivelson, the scientist in charge of the magnetometer experiment, contended that the induced magnetic field required an iron core, and speculated that an electrically conductive layer was required, possibly a brine ocean below the surface.\n\"Galileo\" returned to Ganymede on orbits G7 and G9 in April and May 1997, and on G28 and G29 in May and December 2000 on the GMM. Images of the surface revealed two types of terrain: highly cratered dark regions and grooved terrain sulcus. Images of the Arbela Sulcus taken on G28 made Ganymede look more like Europa, but tidal flexing could not provide sufficient heat to keep water in liquid form on Ganymede, although it may have made a contribution. One possibility was radioactivity, which might provide sufficient heat for liquid water to exist below the surface. Another possibility was volcanism. Slushy water or ice reaching the surface would quickly freeze over, creating areas of a relatively smooth surface.\nCallisto.\nCallisto is the outermost of the Galilean moons, and the most pockmarked, indeed the most of any body in the Solar system. So many craters must have taken billions of years to accumulate, which gave scientists the idea that its surface was as much as four billion years old, and provided a record of meteor activity in the Solar system. \"Galileo\" visited Callisto on orbits C3, C9 and C100 during the prime mission, and then on C20, C21, C22 and C23 during the GEM. When the cameras observed Callisto close up, there was a puzzling absence of small craters. The surface features appeared to have been eroded, indicating that they had been subject to active geological processes.\n\"Galileo\"'s flyby of Callisto on C3 marked the first time that the Deep Space Network operated a link between its antennae in Canberra and Goldstone that allowed them to operate as a gigantic array, thereby enabling a higher bit rate. With the assistance of the antenna at Parkes, this raised the effective bandwidth to as much as 1,000 bits per second.\nData accumulated on C3 indicated that Callisto had a homogeneous composition, with heavy and light elements intermixed. This was estimated to be composed of 60 percent silicate, iron and iron sulfide rock and 40 percent water ice. This was overturned by further radio Doppler observations on C9 and C10, which indicated that rock had settled towards the core, and therefore that Callisto indeed has a differentiated internal structure, although not as much so as the other Galilean moons.\nObservations made with \"Galileo\"'s magnetometer indicated that Callisto had no magnetic field of its own, and therefore lacked an iron core like Ganymede's, but that it did have an induced field from Jupiter's magnetosphere. Because ice is too poor a conductor to generate this effect, it pointed to the possibility that Callisto, like Europa and Ganymede, might have a subsurface ocean of brine. \"Galileo\" made its closest encounter with Callisto on C30, when it made a pass over the surface, during which it photographed the Asgard, Valhalla and Bran craters. This was used for slingshot maneuvers to set up the final encounters with Io on I31 and I32.\nAmalthea.\nAlthough \"Galileo\"'s main mission was to explore the Galilean moons, it also captured images of four of the inner moons, Thebe, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Metis. Such images were only possible from a spacecraft; to Earth-based telescopes they were merely specks of light. Two years of Jupiter's intense radiation took its toll on the spacecraft's systems, and its fuel supply was running low in the early 2000s. \"Galileo\"'s cameras were deactivated on January 17, 2002, after they had sustained irreparable radiation damage.\nNASA engineers were able to recover the damaged tape-recorder electronics, and \"Galileo\" continued to return scientific data until it was deorbited in 2003, performing one last scientific experiment: a measurement of Amalthea's mass as the spacecraft swung by it. This was tricky to arrange; to be useful, \"Galileo\" had to fly within of Amalthea, but not so close as to crash into it. This was complicated by its irregular potato-like shape. It was tidally locked, pointing its long axis towards Jupiter. A successful flyby meant knowing which direction the asteroid was pointed in relation to \"Galileo\" at all times.\n\"Galileo\" flew by Amalthea on November 5, 2002, during its 34th orbit, allowing a measurement of the moon's mass as it passed within of its surface. The results startled the scientific team; they revealed that Amalthea had a mass of , and with a volume of , it therefore had a density of 857 \u00b1 99 kilograms per cubic meter, less than that of water.\nA final discovery occurred during the last two orbits of the mission. When the spacecraft passed the orbit of Amalthea, the star scanner detected unexpected flashes of light that were reflections from seven to nine moonlets. None of the individual moonlets was reliably sighted twice, so no orbits were determined. It is believed that they were most likely debris ejected from Amalthea that formed a tenuous, and perhaps temporary, ring around Jupiter.\nStar scanner.\n\"Galileo\"'s star scanner was a small optical telescope that provided an absolute attitude reference, but it made several scientific discoveries serendipitously. In the prime mission, it was found that the star scanner was able to detect high-energy particles as a noise signal. This data was eventually calibrated to show the particles were predominantly &gt; electrons that were trapped in the Jovian magnetic belts, and released to the Planetary Data System.\nA second discovery occurred in 2000. The star scanner was observing a set of stars that included the second magnitude star Delta Velorum. At one point, this star dimmed for 8 hours below the star scanner's detection threshold. Subsequent analysis of \"Galileo\" data and work by amateur and professional astronomers showed that Delta Velorum is the brightest known eclipsing binary, brighter at maximum than Algol. It has a primary period of 45 days and the dimming is just visible with the naked eye.\nRadiation-related anomalies.\nJupiter's uniquely harsh radiation environment caused over 20 anomalies over the course of \"Galileo\"'s mission, in addition to the incidents expanded upon below. Despite having exceeded its radiation design limit by at least a factor of three, the spacecraft survived all these anomalies. Work-arounds were found eventually for all of these problems, and \"Galileo\" was never rendered entirely non-functional by Jupiter's radiation. The radiation limits for \"Galileo\"'s computers were based on data returned from \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\", since much of the design work was underway before the two \"Voyagers\" arrived at Jupiter in 1979.\nA typical effect of the radiation was that several of the science instruments suffered increased noise while within about of Jupiter. The SSI camera began producing totally white images when the spacecraft was hit by the exceptional Bastille Day coronal mass ejection in 2000, and did so again on subsequent close approaches to Jupiter. The quartz crystal used as the frequency reference for the radio suffered permanent frequency shifts with each Jupiter approach. A spin detector failed, and the spacecraft gyro output was biased by the radiation environment.\nThe most severe effects of the radiation were current leakages somewhere in the spacecraft's power bus, most likely across brushes at a spin bearing connecting rotor and stator sections of the orbiter. These current leakages triggered a reset of the onboard computer and caused it to go into safe mode. The resets occurred when the spacecraft was either close to Jupiter or in the region of space magnetically downstream of Jupiter. A change to the software was made in April 1999 that allowed the onboard computer to detect these resets and autonomously recover, so as to avoid safe mode.\nTape recorder problems.\nRoutine maintenance of the tape recorder involved winding the tape halfway down its length and back again to prevent it sticking. In November 2002, after the completion of the mission's only encounter with Jupiter's moon Amalthea, problems with playback of the tape recorder again plagued \"Galileo\". About 10 minutes after the closest approach of the Amalthea flyby, \"Galileo\" stopped collecting data, shut down all of its instruments, and went into safe mode, apparently as a result of exposure to Jupiter's intense radiation environment. Though most of the Amalthea data was already written to tape, it was found that the recorder refused to respond to commands telling it to play back data.\nAfter weeks of troubleshooting of an identical flight spare of the recorder on the ground, it was determined that the cause of the malfunction was a reduction of light output in three infrared Optek OP133 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) located in the drive electronics of the recorder's motor encoder wheel. The gallium arsenide LEDs had been particularly sensitive to proton-irradiation-induced atomic lattice displacement defects, which greatly decreased their effective light output and caused the drive motor's electronics to falsely believe the motor encoder wheel was incorrectly positioned.\n\"Galileo\"'s flight team then began a series of \"annealing\" sessions, where current was passed through the LEDs for hours at a time to heat them to a point where some of the crystalline lattice defects would be shifted back into place, thus increasing the LED's light output. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful.\nEnd of mission and deorbit.\nWhen the exploration of Mars was being considered in the early 1960s, Carl Sagan and Sidney Coleman produced a paper concerning contamination of the red planet. In order that scientists could determine whether native life forms existed before the planet became contaminated by micro-organisms from Earth, they proposed that space missions should aim at a 99.9 percent chance that contamination should not occur. This figure was adopted by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the International Council of Scientific Unions in 1964, and was subsequently applied to all planetary probes.\nThe danger was highlighted in 1969 when the Apollo 12 astronauts returned components of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft that had landed on the Moon three years before, and it was found that microbes were still viable even after three years in that harsh climate. An alternative was the Prime Directive, a philosophy of non-interference with alien life forms enunciated by the that prioritized the interests of the life forms over those of scientists. Given the (admittedly slim) prospect of life on Europa, scientists Richard Greenberg and Randall Tufts proposed that a new standard be set of no greater chance of contamination than that which might occur naturally by meteorites.\n\"Galileo\" had not been sterilized prior to launch and could conceivably have carried bacteria from Earth. Therefore, a plan was formulated to send the probe directly into Jupiter, in an intentional crash to eliminate the possibility of an impact with Jupiter's moons, particularly Europa, and prevent a forward contamination. On April 14, 2003, the \"Galileo\" orbiter reached its greatest orbital distance from Jupiter for the entire mission since orbital insertion, , before plunging back towards the gas giant for its final impact. At the completion of J35, its final orbit around the Jovian system, \"Galileo\" struck Jupiter in darkness just south of the equator on September 21, 2003, at 18:57\u00a0UTC. Its impact speed was approximately .\nFollow-on missions.\nThere was a spare \"Galileo\" spacecraft that was considered by the NASA\u2013ESA Outer Planets Study Team in 1983 for a mission to Saturn, but it was passed over in favor of a newer design, which became \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\". While \"Galileo\" was operating, \"Ulysses\" passed by Jupiter in 1992 on its mission to study the Sun's polar regions, and \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" coasted by the planet in 2000 and 2001 en route to Saturn. \"New Horizons\" passed close by Jupiter in 2007 for a gravity assist en route to Pluto, and it too collected data on the planet.\n\"Juno\".\nThe next mission to orbit Jupiter was NASA's \"Juno\" spacecraft, which was launched on August 5, 2011, and entered Jovian orbit on July 4, 2016. Although intended for a two-year mission, it is still active in 2024 and expected to continue until September 2025. \"Juno\" provided the first views of Jupiter's north pole and new insights into Jupiter's aurorae, magnetic field, and atmosphere. Information gathered about Jovian lightning prompted revision of earlier theories, and analysis of the frequency of interplanetary dust impacts (primarily on the backs of the solar panels), as \"Juno\" passed between Earth and the asteroid belt, indicated that this dust comes from Mars, rather than from comets or asteroids, as was previously thought.\nJupiter Icy Moons Explorer.\nThe European Space Agency is planning to return to the Jovian system with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE). This was launched from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana on April 14, 2023, and is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031.\n\"Europa Clipper\".\nEven before \"Galileo\" concluded, NASA considered the Europa Orbiter, but it was canceled in 2002. A lower-cost version was then studied, which led to \"Europa Clipper\" being approved in 2015. This mission launched from Kennedy Space Center on October 14, 2024 and is expected to reach Jupiter in April 2030.\n\"Europa Lander\".\nA lander, simply called \"Europa Lander\" was assessed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As of 2024[ [update]], this mission remains a concept, although some funds were released for instrument development and maturation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13078", "revid": "42681389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13078", "title": "Garden of Eden", "text": "Biblical garden of God\nIn Abrahamic religions, the Garden of Eden (; ; ) or Garden of God ( and ), also called the Terrestrial Paradise, is the biblical paradise described in Genesis 2\u20133 and Ezekiel 28 and 31.\nThe location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis as the source of four tributaries. Various suggestions have been made for its location: at the head of the Persian Gulf, in southern Mesopotamia where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers run into the sea; and in Armenia. Others theorize that Eden was the entire Fertile Crescent or a region substantial in size in Mesopotamia, where its native inhabitants still exist in cities such as Telassar.\nLike the Genesis flood narrative, the Genesis creation narrative and the account of the Tower of Babel, the story of Eden echoes the Mesopotamian myth of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life. Scholars note that the Eden narrative shows parallels with aspects of Solomon's Temple and Jerusalem, attesting to its nature as a sacred place. Mentions of Eden are also made in the Bible elsewhere in Genesis 13:10, in Isaiah 51:3, Ezekiel 36:35, and Joel 2:3; Zechariah 14 and Ezekiel 47 use paradisical imagery without naming Eden.\nThe name derives from the Akkadian , from a Sumerian word meaning 'plain' or 'steppe', closely related to an Aramaic root word meaning 'fruitful, well-watered'. Another interpretation associates the name with a Hebrew word for 'pleasure'; thus the Vulgate reads in Genesis 2:8, and the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible, following, has the wording \"And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure\".\nBiblical narratives.\nGenesis.\nThe second part of the Genesis creation narrative, Genesis 2:4\u20133:24, opens with YHWH-Elohim (translated here \"the LORD God\") creating the first man (Adam), whom he placed in a garden that he planted \"eastward in Eden\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.\u2014\u200a\nThe man was free to eat from any tree in the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was taboo. Last of all, God made a woman (Eve) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man. In Genesis 3, the man and the woman were seduced by the serpent into eating the forbidden fruit, and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the tree of life, and thus living forever. Cherubim were placed east of the garden, \"and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life\".\nGenesis 2:10\u201314 lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: Pishon, Gihon, Tigris (Hiddekel in Hebrew), and the Euphrates (Perath in Hebrew). It also refers to the land of Cush\u2014translated/interpreted as Ethiopia, but thought by some to equate to \"Cossaea\", a Greek name for the land of the Kassites. These lands lie north of Elam, immediately to the east of ancient Babylon, which, unlike Ethiopia, does lie within the region being described. In \"Antiquities of the Jews\", the first-century Jewish historian Josephus identifies the Pishon as what \"the Greeks called Ganges\" and the Geon (Gehon) as the Nile.\nEzekiel.\nIn Ezekiel 28:12\u201319, the prophet Ezekiel the \"son of man\" sets down God's word against the king of Tyre: the king was the \"seal of perfection\", adorned with precious stones from the day of his creation, placed by God in the garden of Eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cherub. However, the king sinned through wickedness and violence, and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth, where now he is consumed by God's fire: \"All those who knew you in the nations are appalled at you, you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.\" (Ezekiel 28:19).\nProposed locations.\nThe location of Eden is described in Genesis 2:10\u201314:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\nSuggestions for the location of Eden include the head of the Persian Gulf, as argued by Juris Zarins, in southern Mesopotamia where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers run into the sea; and in the Armenian Highlands or Armenian National Plateau. British archaeologist David Rohl locates it in Iran, and in the vicinity of Tabriz, but this suggestion has not been adopted by mainstream academia.\nOthers theorize that Eden was merely a region of \"considerable size\" in Mesopotamia, where its native inhabitants still exist in cities such as Telassar, based on verses such as Isaiah 37:12, or that it encompassed the entire Fertile Crescent.\nAccording to Terje Stordalen, the Book of Ezekiel places Eden in Lebanon. \"[I]t appears that the Lebanon is an alternative placement in Phoenician myth (as in Ez 28,13, III.48) of the Garden of Eden\", and there are connections between paradise, the Garden of Eden and the forests of Lebanon (possibly used symbolically) within prophetic writings. Edward Lipinski and Peter Kyle McCarter have suggested that the garden of the gods, the oldest Sumerian analog of the Garden of Eden, relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges.\nSome religious groups have believed the location of the garden to be local to them, outside of the Middle East. Some early leaders of Mormonism held that it was located in Jackson County, Missouri. The 20th-century Panacea Society believed it was located at the site of their home town of Bedford, England, while preacher Elvy E. Callaway believed it was on the Apalachicola River in Florida, near the town of Bristol. Some suggested that the location is in Jerusalem.\nOn his third voyage to the Americas in 1498, Christopher Columbus thought he may have reached the Earthly Paradise upon first seeing the South American mainland.\nFollowing its acceptance of Christianity in 1491, leaders of the Kingdom of Kongo came to believe that the Terrestrial Paradise, and thus the Garden of Eden was in Central Africa. Following logic of medieval European maps, Portuguese cartographers claimed that both the Congo River and the Zambezi flowed out from the Paradise, and Kongolese intellectuals, perhaps students in Lisbon, accepted that its location in maps drawn in Mediterranean Europe showed Kongo's eastern border of the Paradise. The idea was fully accepted, as Italian missionary Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi, reported in 1687 that the Kongolese \"constantly assert that in the creation of the Universe, God assigned to the angels and his other ministerial confidants the task of putting the rest of the earth in order, reserving for himself alone, according to his sublime idea and his genius, the forming of the countries of Ethiopia, and especially the kingdoms of Congo. All the rest were extracted from nothing in the dark night of shapeless Chaos, and only this one part, with singular privilege received its most perfect form in the serenely bright light of a beautiful afternoon.\"\nIn his book \"The Creation, the Garden of Eden and the Origin of the Chinese\", Tse Tsan-tai argued that the Garden of Eden was located in modern-day Xinjiang.\nBlissful garden concept.\nScholars have identified and proposed connections to similar concepts from ancient religions and mythologies, and have studied the post-scriptural evolution of the concept in religion and arts.\nSumeria and ancient Greece; Renaissance.\nA number of parallel concepts to the biblical Garden of Eden exist in various other religions and mythologies. Dilmun in the Sumerian story of \"Enki and Ninhursag\" is a paradisaical abode of the immortals, where sickness and death were unknown. The garden of the Hesperides in Greek mythology was also somewhat similar to the Jewish concept of the Garden of Eden, and by the 16th century a larger intellectual association was made in the Cranach painting.\nCanaanite origin theory.\nBy studying late-13th-century BCE clay tablets from Ugarit, Hebrew Bible scholars M.J.A. Korpel and J.C. de Moor reconstructed close Canaanite parallels, which they posit as being the origin of the biblical creation myth from the first chapters of Genesis including the Garden of Eden and Adam narrative. Their reconstructed texts talk about the creator deity El, who lived in a vineyard or garden together with his wife Asherah on Mount Ararat. Another god, Horon, tries to depose El and when thrown down from the mountain, he transforms the Tree of Life from the garden into a Tree of Death. Horon also spreads around a poisonous fog, Adam is sent from the mountain to restore life on earth, Horon takes the shape of a large serpent and bites him, which leads to Adam and his wife losing their immortality. However, John Day argues that these stories are not explicitly attested in the Ugaritic texts but are reconstructed on the basis of speculative and dubious suppositions.\nEvolution of Old Iranian \"paradise\" concept.\nThe word \"paradise\" entered English from the French , inherited from the Latin , from the Greek (). The Greek, in turn, was derived from an Old Iranian form, ultimately from Proto-Iranian \"*paridayjah\", which also derived Old Persian (p-r-d-y-d-a-m, , and Avestan , . The literal meaning of this word is 'walled enclosure', from *\"pari-\" 'around' (cognate with the Greek and the English \"peri-\", of identical meaning), and *\"d\u00e1yjah\", \"to make, form (a wall), build\" (cognate with the Greek , 'wall'). The word's etymology is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European root 'around', and the word , 'something that is formed'.\nBy the 6th/5th century BCE, the Old Iranian word had been borrowed into the Akkadian language as , 'domain'. It subsequently came to indicate the expansive walled gardens of the First Persian Empire, and was later borrowed into a number of languages: into Greek as (), 'park for animals', cf. \"Anabasis\", the most famous work of Xenophon; into Aramaic as , 'royal park'; and into Hebrew (see below).\nThe idea of a walled enclosure was not preserved in most Iranian usage, and generally came to refer to a plantation or other cultivated area, not necessarily walled. For example, the Old Iranian word survives as in New Persian, as well as its derivative (or ), which denotes a vegetable patch.\nHebrew Bible and Jewish literature.\nThe word entered the Hebrew language with the meaning of pardes (), 'orchard', appearing thrice in the Tanakh: in the Song of Solomon (), Ecclesiastes (), and Nehemiah ().\nThe word occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the Song of Solomon : \"Thy plants are an orchard () of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard\"; Ecclesiastes : \"I made me gardens and orchards (), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits\"; and in Nehemiah : \"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city\". In these examples, clearly means 'orchard' or 'park', but in the Jewish apocalyptic literature and in the Talmud \"paradise\" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, a meaning also present in the New Testament.\nItalian historian Mario Liverani argues that the Garden of Eden was modeled on Persian royal gardens, while John Day argues that linguistic and other evidence indicates that the yahwistic Eden story was composed before the Persian period. US archaeologist Lawrence Stager posits that the biblical Eden narrative drew from aspects of Solomon's palace and temple compound and Jerusalem.\nSeptuagint and New Testament.\nIn the Septuagint (3rd\u20131st centuries BCE), the Greek () was used to translate both the Hebrew () and (), meaning 'garden' (e.g. , ): it is from this usage that the use of \"paradise\" to refer to the Garden of Eden derives.\nIn the New Testament \"paradise\" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary Hellenistic influences.\nQuran.\nThe same usage as in the Septuagint also appears in Arabic and in the Quran as .\nOther views.\nJewish eschatology.\nIn the Talmud and the Jewish Kabbalah, the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called \"Garden in Eden\". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the \"lower Eden\" ( meaning garden). The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the \"higher Eden\". The rabbis differentiate between and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the , whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.\nAccording to Jewish eschatology, the higher Eden is called the \"Garden of Righteousness\". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are \"clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life\" (Enoch 58,3) near to God and his anointed ones. This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms and , figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from heaven.\nSome modern Orthodox Jews believe that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.\n\"Legends of the Jews\".\nIn the 1909 book \"Legends of the Jews\", Louis Ginzberg compiled Jewish legends found in rabbinic literature. Among the legends are ones about the two Gardens of Eden. Beyond Paradise is the higher Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Eden contains three hundred and ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one's merit. The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for \"Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,\" the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.\nIn chapter two, \"Legends of the Jews\" gives a brief description of the lower Eden. The tree of knowledge is a hedge around the tree of life, which is so vast that \"it would take a man five hundred years to traverse a distance equal to the diameter of the trunk\". From beneath the trees flow all the world's waters in the form of four rivers: Tigris, Nile, Euphrates, and Ganges. After the fall of man, the world was no longer irrigated by this water. While in the garden, though, Adam and Eve were served meat dishes by angels and the animals of the world understood human language, respected mankind as God's image, and feared Adam and Eve. When one dies, one's soul must pass through the lower Eden in order to reach the higher Eden. The way to the garden is the Cave of Machpelah that Adam guards. The cave leads to the gate of the garden, guarded by a cherub with a flaming sword. If a soul is unworthy of entering, the sword annihilates it. Within the garden is a pillar of fire and smoke that extends to the higher Eden, which the soul must climb in order to reach the higher Eden.\nChristian views.\nAtemporal fall view.\nFor some Christians, especially in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, Eden is considered a reality outside of empirical history that affects the entire history of the universe as seen in the idea of an atemporal fall which separates humanity's current reduced form of time from the divine life enjoyed in Eden. This idea of an atemporal separation from Eden has been most recently defended by theologians David Bentley Hart, John Behr, and Sergei Bulgakov as well as having roots in the writings of several early church fathers, especially Origen and Maximus the Confessor.\nIslamic view.\nThe term \u062c\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0639\u062f\u0646 (\"Gardens of Eden\" or \"Gardens of Perpetual Residence\") is used in the Quran for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of \"the Garden\" in the Quran, while the Garden of Eden, without the word , is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic heaven and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of Adam. The Quran refers frequently over various Surah about the first abode of Adam and his spouse (told to be Hawwa or Eve, her name is never given in the Quran), including surah Sad, which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71\u201388), surah al-Baqara, surah al-A'raf, and surah al-Hijr although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Adam and his spouse after they were tempted by Iblis (Satan).\nDespite the biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, from which God specifically forbade Adam and his spouse. Some exegesis added an account, about Satan, disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and his spouse did so, resulting in disobeying God. These stories are also featured in the hadith collections, including al-Tabari.\nQuranic verses Q. 2:35\u201338, are believed to tell the story of Adam disobeying God's command and eating the Forbidden Fruit, and of God ordered him out of the Garden. One translation (the Clear Quran) that indicates that the Garden of Eden was in Heaven goes: \nQuranic verses describe Adam was being expelled from \"al-Jannah\", \"the garden\", which is the commonly used word for paradise in Islam. However, according to Ibn Kathir (d. 1372) and Ar-Razi (d. 1209), (exegetes of the Quran), four interpretations of the location of the garden prevailed among early Muslims: \nAccording to T. O. Shanavas however, contextual analysis of Quranic verses suggests the Garden of Eden could not have been in Paradise and must have been on earth. (For example, a sahih hadith reports Muhammad said: \"Allah says: I have prepared for my righteous servants that which has neither been seen by eyes, nor heard by ears, nor ever conceived by any man.\" i.e. no man has ever seen Paradise. Since Adam was a man, he could not have seen paradise, therefore he could not have lived there.)\nIslamic exegesis does not regard Adam and his spouse's expulsion from paradise as punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part.171 Instead, ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292\u20131350) writes, God's wisdom (\"\u1e25ikma\") destined humanity to leave the garden and settle on earth. This is because God wants to unfold the full range of his attributes.171 If humans were not to live on earth, God could not express his love, forgiveness, and power to his creation. Further, if humans were not to experience suffering, they could neither long for paradise nor appreciate its delights. Khwaja Abdullah Ansari (1006\u20131088) describes Adam and his spouse's expulsion as ultimately caused by God.252 Nonetheless, despite the paradoxical notion that man has no choice but to comply to God's will, this does not mean that humans should not blame themselves for their \"sin\" of complying.252 This is exemplified by Adam and his spouse in the Quran (Q. 7:23 \"Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be losers\"), in contrast to Iblis (Satan) who blames God for leading him astray (Q. 15:37).\nLatter Day Saints.\nFollowers of the Latter Day Saint movement believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as Adam-ondi-Ahman, located in present-day Daviess County, Missouri. It is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants that Adam blessed his posterity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the final judgment in fulfillment of a prophecy set forth in the Bible.\nNumerous early leaders of the Church, including Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and George Q. Cannon, taught that the Garden of Eden itself was located in nearby Jackson County, but there are no surviving first-hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by Joseph Smith himself. LDS doctrine is unclear as to the exact location of the Garden of Eden, but tradition among Latter-Day Saints places it somewhere in the vicinity of Adam-ondi-Ahman, or in Jackson County.\nGnosticism.\nThe 2nd-century Gnostic teacher Justin held that there were three original divinities, a transcendental being called the Good, an intermediate male figure known as Elohim and Eden who is an Earth-mother. The world is created from the love of Elohim and Eden, but evil later is brought into the universe when Elohim learns of the existence of the Good above him and ascends trying to reach it.\nArt and literature.\nArt.\nOne of oldest depictions of Garden of Eden is made in Byzantine style in Ravenna, while the city was still under Byzantine control. A preserved blue mosaic is part of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Circular motifs represent flowers of the garden of Eden. The Garden of Eden motifs most frequently portrayed in illuminated manuscripts and paintings are the \"Sleep of Adam\" (\"Creation of Eve\"), the \"Temptation of Eve\" by the Serpent, the \"Fall of Man\" where Adam takes the fruit, and the \"Expulsion\". The idyll of \"Naming Day in Eden\" was less often depicted. Michelangelo depicted at the Garden of Eden on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.\nLiterature.\nFor many medieval writers, the image of the Garden of Eden also creates a location for human love and sexuality, often associated with the classic and medieval trope of the locus amoenus.\nIn the \"Divine Comedy\", Dante Alighieri places the Garden at the top of Mt. Purgatory. Dante, the pilgrim, emerges into the Garden of Eden in Canto 28 of \"Purgatorio\". Here he is told that God gave the Garden of Eden to man \"in earnest, or as a pledge of eternal life,\" but man was only able to dwell there for a short time because he soon fell from grace. In the poem, the Garden of Eden is both human and divine: while it is located on earth at the top of Mt. Purgatory, it also serves as the gateway to the heavens.\nMuch of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" occurs in the Garden of Eden.\nThe first act of Arthur Miller's 1972 play \"Creation of the World and Other Business\" is set in the Garden of Eden.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nBiblical citations in this article generally refer to the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 translation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

English has a voiceless glottal transition spelled \"h\". This sound is produced by keeping the vocal folds spread somewhat, resulting in non-turbulent airflow through the glottis. In many accents of English the glottal stop (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant allophone of the phoneme (and in some dialects, occasionally of and ); in some languages, this sound is a phoneme of its own. \nSkilled players of the Australian didgeridoo restrict their glottal opening in order to produce the full range of timbres available on the instrument.\nThe vibration produced is an essential component of \"voiced\" consonants as well as vowels.

{"id": "13080", "revid": "51038841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13080", "title": "Gurmukhi", "text": "Script used to write the Punjabi language\nGurmukh\u012b ( , ) is an abugida developed from the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts, standardized and used by the second Sikh guru, Guru Angad (1504\u20131552). Commonly regarded as a Sikh script, Gurmukhi is used in Punjab, India as the official script of the Punjabi language.\nThe primary scripture of Sikhism, the Guru Granth Sahib, is written in Gurmukh\u012b, in various dialects and languages often subsumed under the generic title \"Sant Bhasha\" or \"saint language\", in addition to other languages like Persian and various phases of Indo-Aryan languages.\nModern Gurmukh\u012b has thirty-five original letters, hence its common alternative term \"paint\u012b\" or \"the thirty-five\", plus six additional consonants, nine vowel diacritics, two diacritics for nasal sounds, one diacritic that geminates consonants and three subscript characters.\nHistory and development.\nAntecedents.\nThe Gurmukh\u012b script is generally believed to have roots in the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet by way of the Brahmi script, which developed further into the Northwestern group (Sharada-based), the Central group (Nagari-based) and the Eastern group (Siddha\u1e43-based), as well as several prominent writing systems of Southeast Asia, in addition to scripts used historically in Central Asia for extinct languages like Saka and Tocharian. Gurmukhi is derived from Sharada in the Northwestern group, of which it is the only major surviving member, with full modern currency.\nNotable features include:\nGurmukhi evolved in cultural and historical circumstances notably different from other regional scripts, for the purpose of recording scriptures of Sikhism, a far less Sanskritized cultural tradition than others of the subcontinent. This independence from the Sanskritic model allowed it the freedom to evolve unique orthographical features. These include: \nand other features.\n From the 10th century onwards, regional differences started to appear between the Sharada script used in Punjab, the Hill States (partly Himachal Pradesh) and Kashmir. Sharada proper was eventually restricted to very limited ceremonial use in Kashmir, as it grew increasingly unsuitable for writing the Kashmiri language. With the last known inscription dating to 1204 C.E., the early 13th century marks a milestone in the development of Sharada. The regional variety in Punjab continued to evolve from this stage through the 14th century; during this period it starts to appear in forms closely resembling Gurmukh\u012b and other Landa scripts. By the 15th century, Sharada had evolved so considerably that epigraphists denote the script at this point by a special name, \"D\u0113v\u0101\u015b\u0113\u1e63a\". Tarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) prefers the name \"pritham\u0103 gurmukh\u012b\", or Proto-Gurmukh\u012b. \nMeanwhile, the mercantile scripts of Punjab known as the La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were normally not used for literary purposes. \"La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101\" means alphabet \"without tail\", implying that the script did not have vowel symbols. In Punjab, there were at least ten different scripts classified as La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, Mahajani being the most popular. The La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101 scripts were used for household and trade purposes. In contrast to La\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, the use of vowel diacritics was made obligatory in Gurmukh\u012b for increased accuracy and precision, due to the difficulties involved in deciphering words without vowel signs.\nThe Sikh gurus adopted Proto-Gurmukh\u012b to write the Guru Granth Sahib, the religious scriptures of the Sikhs. It was through its recording in Gurmukhi that knowledge of the pronunciation and grammar of the Old Punjabi language (c. 10th\u201316th century) was preserved for modern philologists. It has been described as being \"tailor-made\" to writing the Punjabi language as it existed in the 16th century.\nSikhism.\nThe original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script, for which the script is revered by Sikhs. Guru Angad is credited in the Sikh tradition with the creation and standardization of Gurmukhi script from earlier \u015a\u0101rad\u0101-descended scripts native to the region. Whilst the creation of the Gurmukhi script is commonly attributed to the second guru of the Sikhs, Guru Angad, according to Mangat Bhardwaj the Gurmukhi script or its antecedents pre-date the development of Sikhism by several centuries. Sikh scholars themselves, such as Kahn Singh of Nabha (1930), G. B. Singh (1950), Piara Singh Padam (1954), and G. S. Sidhu (2004), have documented Gurmukhi prior to the arising of Sikhism. The glyphs and symbols employed in Gurmukhi pre-date Sikhism and it is more likely that Guru Angad standardized the pre-existing scripts around 1530\u20131535 to create the standard Gurmukhi script under the purview of Guru Nanak.\nIn the following epochs, Gurmukh\u012b became the primary script for the literary writings of the Sikhs. Playing a significant role in Sikh faith and tradition, it expanded from its original use for Sikh scriptures and developed its own orthographical rules, spreading widely under the Sikh Empire and used by Sikh kings and chiefs of Punjab for administrative purposes. In seventeenth and eighteenth-century Punjab, the script was also employed to write scientific and poetic literature from both Sanskritic and Persian traditions in the Braj language. Helping to foster a distinct Sikh culture and contributing to the consolidation of the Sikh religion, expanding from its original role as the vehicle of Sikh religious literature, Gurmukhi became particularly important in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when the Sikhs established political hegemony over Punjab and Kashmir. Also playing a major role in consolidating and standardizing the Punjabi language, it served as the main medium of literacy in Punjab and adjoining areas for centuries when the earliest schools were attached to \"gurdwaras\". \nIn Jammu Division, Takri, which developed through the \"D\u0113v\u0101\u015b\u0113\u1e63a\" stage of Sharada from the 14th-18th centuries developed into Dogri, which was a \"highly imperfect\" script later consciously influenced in part by Gurmukhi during the late 19th century, possibly to provide it an air of authority by having it resemble scripts already established in official and literary capacities, though not displacing Takri.\nThe first natively produced grammars of the Punjabi language were written in the 1860s in Gurmukhi. The Singh Sabha Movement of the late 19th century, a movement to revitalize Sikh institutions which had declined during colonial rule after the fall of the Sikh Empire, also advocated for the usage of the Gurmukhi script for mass media, with print media publications and Punjabi-language newspapers established in the 1880s. \nModern times.\nOfficial recognition of Gurmukh\u012b was made a prerequisite by the Akali Dal for political partnership in the 1940s leading up to the 1947 partition, including in failed talks with the Muslim League. Later in the 1960s, after the struggle of the Punjabi Suba movement, the script was given the authority as the official state script of the Punjab, India, where it is used in all spheres of culture, arts, education, and administration, with a firmly established common and secular character, and is now the standard writing script for the Punjabi language in India.\nWith technological advances introduced in the 1970s, including the computer and the offset press, Gurmukh\u012b usage would flourish in news media. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic, and is currently the 14th most used script in the world.\nEtymology.\nThe prevalent view among Punjabi linguists is that as in the early stages the Gurmukh\u012b letters were primarily used by the Guru's followers, \"gurmukhs\" (literally, those who face, or follow, the Guru); the script thus came to be known as \"gurmukh\u012b\", \"the script of those guided by the Guru.\"\nAlthough the word Gurmukh\u012b has been commonly translated as \"from the mouth of the Guru\", the term used for the Punjabi script has somewhat different connotations. This usage of the term may have gained currency from the use of the script to record the utterances of the Sikh Gurus as scripture, which were often referred to as Gurmukh\u012b, or from the \"mukh\u0103\" (face, or mouth) of the Gurus. Consequently, the script that was used to write the resulting scripture may have also been designated with the same name.\nThe name for the Perso\u2013Arabic alphabet for the Punjabi language, \"Shahmukhi\", was modeled on the term \"Gurmukh\u012b\".\nCharacters.\nLetters.\nThe Gurmukh\u012b alphabet contains thirty-five base letters (\"akkhar\u0103\"), traditionally arranged in seven rows of five letters each. The first three letters, or \"m\u0101tar\u0101 v\u0101hak\u0103\" (\"vowel bearer\"), are distinct because they form the basis for independent vowels and are not consonants, or \"vianjan\u0103\", like the remaining letters are, and except for the second letter \"ai\u1e5b\u0101\" are never used on their own; see for further details. The pair of fricatives, or \"m\u016bl\u0103 varg\u0103\" (\"base class\"), share the row, which is followed by the next five sets of consonants, with the consonants in each row being homorganic, the rows arranged from the back (velars) to the front (labials) of the mouth, and the letters in the grid arranged by place and manner of articulation. The arrangement, or \"var\u1e47\u0103m\u0101ll\u0101\", is completed with the \"antim\u0103 \u1e6doll\u012b\", literally \"ending group.\" The names of most of the consonants are based on their reduplicative phonetic values. The \"var\u1e47\u0103m\u0101ll\u0101\" is as follows:\nThe nasal letters \u0a19 \"\u1e45a\u1e45\u1e45\u0101\" and \u0a1e \"\u00f1a\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\" have become marginal as independent consonants in modern Gurmukh\u012b. The sounds they represent occur most often as allophones of [] in clusters with velars and palatals respectively.\nThe pronunciation of \u0a35 can vary allophonically between preceding front vowels, and elsewhere.\nThe most characteristic feature of the Punjabi language is its tone system. The script has no separate symbol for tones, but they correspond to the tonal consonants that once represented voiced aspirates as well as older *\"h\". To differentiate between consonants, the Punjabi tonal consonants of the fourth column, \u0a18 \"k\u00e0\", \u0a1d \"c\u00e0\", \u0a22 \"\u1e6d\u00e0\", \u0a27 \"t\u00e0\", and \u0a2d \"p\u00e0\", are often transliterated in the way of the voiced aspirate consonants \"gha\", \"jha\", \"\u1e0dha\", \"dha\", and \"bha\" respectively, although Punjabi lacks these sounds. Tones in Punjabi can be either rising, neutral, or falling: \nThe letters now always represent unaspirated consonants, and are unvoiced in onset positions and voiced elsewhere.\nSupplementary letters.\nIn addition to the 35 original letters, there are six supplementary consonants in official usage, referred to as the \"nav\u012bn\u0103 \u1e6doll\u012b\" or \"nav\u012bn\u0103 varg\u0103\", meaning \"new group\", created by placing a dot (\"bind\u012b\") at the foot (\"pair\u0103\") of the consonant to create \"pair\u012d bind\u012b\" consonants. These are not present in the Guru Granth Sahib or old texts. These are used most often for loanwords, though not exclusively, and their usage is not always obligatory.\nThe letter \u0a38\u0a3c, already in use by the time of the earliest Punjabi grammars produced, along with \u0a1c\u0a3c and \u0a32\u0a3c, enabled the previously unmarked distinction of /s/ and the well-established phoneme /\u0283/, which is used even in native echo doublets e.g. \"r\u014d\u0306\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012b-\u015b\u014d\u0306\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012b\" \"stuff to eat\"). The loansounds \"f\", \"z\", \"x\", and \"\u0121\" as distinct phonemes are less well-established, decreasing in that order and often dependent on exposure to Hindi-Urdu norms.\nThe character \u0a32\u0a3c (\"\u1e37a\"), the only character not representing a fricative consonant, was only recently officially added to the Gurmukh\u012b alphabet. It was not a part of the traditional orthography, as the distinctive phonological difference between /l\u0259/ and /\u026d\u0259/, while both native sounds, was not reflected in the script, and its inclusion is still not currently universal. Previous usage of another glyph to represent this sound, [\u0a32\u0a4d\u0a30], has also been attested. The letters \u0a32\u0a3c \"\u1e37a\", like \u0a19 \"\u1e45\", \u0a1e \"\u00f1,\" \u0a23 \"\u1e47\", and \u0a5c \"\u1e5b\", do not occur word-initially, except in some cases their names.\nOther characters, like the more recent [\u0a15\u0a3c] //, are also on rare occasion used unofficially, chiefly for transliterating old writings in Persian and Urdu, the knowledge of which is less relevant in modern times.\nSubscript letters.\nThree \"subscript\" letters, called \u0a26\u0a41\u0a71\u0a24 \u0a05\u0a71\u0a16\u0a30 \"dutt\u0103 akkhar\u0103\" (\"joint letters\") or \u0a2a\u0a48\u0a30\u0a40\u0a02 \u0a05\u0a71\u0a16\u0a30 \"pair\u012b\u0303 akkhar\u0103\" (\"letters at the feet\") are utilised in modern Gurmukh\u012b: forms of \u0a39 \"ha\", \u0a30 \"ra\", and \u0a35 \"va\".\nThe subscript \u0a30 \"ra\" and \u0a35 \"va\" are used to make consonant clusters and behave similarly; subjoined \u0a39 \"ha\" introduces tone.\nIn addition to the three standard subscript letters, another subscript character representing the subjoined /j/, the \u0a2f\u0a15\u0a38\u0a3c \"yaka\u015b\u0103\" or \"pair\u012b\u0303 yayy\u0101\" ( \u0a75 U+0A75), is utilized specifically in archaized \"sahaskrit\u012b\"-style writings in Sikh scripture, where it is found 268 times for word forms and inflections from older phases of Indo-Aryan, as in the examples \u0a30\u0a16\u0a75\u0a3e /\u027e\u0259k\u02b0\u02d0ja\u02d0/ \"(to be) protected\", \u0a2e\u0a3f\u0a25\u0a75\u0a70\u0a24 /m\u026at\u032a\u02b0j\u0259n\u032at\u032a\u0259/ \"deceiving\", \u0a38\u0a70\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a30\u0a38\u0a75 /s\u0259nsa\u02d0\u027e\u0259sj\u0259/ \"of the world\", \u0a2d\u0a3f\u0a16\u0a75\u0a3e /p\u026a\u0300k\u02b0\u02d0ja\u02d0/ \"(act of) begging\", etc. There is also a conjunct form of the letter \"yayy\u0101\", \u0a2f\u2192\u0a4d\u0a2f, a later form, which functions similarly to the \"yaka\u015b\u0103\", and is used exclusively for Sanskrit borrowings, and even then rarely. In addition, miniaturized versions of the letters \u0a1a, \u0a1f, \u0a24, and \u0a28 are also found in limited use as subscript letters in Sikh scripture.\nOnly the subjoined /\u027e\u0259/ and /h\u0259/ are commonly used; usage of the subjoined /\u028b\u0259/ and conjoined forms of /j\u0259/, already rare, is increasingly scarce in modern contexts.\nVowel diacritics.\nTo express vowels (\u0a38\u0a41\u0a30 \"sur\u0103\"), Gurmukh\u012b, as an abugida, makes use of obligatory diacritics called \u0a32\u0a17\u0a3e\u0a02 \"lag\u0101\u0303\". Gurmukh\u012b is similar to Brahmi scripts in that all consonants are followed by an inherent schwa sound. This inherent vowel sound can be changed by using dependent vowel signs which attach to a bearing consonant. In some cases, dependent vowel signs cannot be used\u00a0\u2013 at the beginning of a word or syllable for instance\u00a0\u2013 and so an independent vowel character is used instead.\nIndependent vowels are constructed using the three vowel-bearing characters: \u0a73 \"\u016b\u1e5b\u0101\" , \u0a05 \"ai\u1e5b\u0101\", and \u0a72 \"\u012b\u1e5b\u012b\". With the exception of \"ai\u1e5b\u0101\" (which in isolation represents the vowel ), the bearer vowels are never used without additional vowel diacritics.\nVowels are always pronounced after the consonant they are attached to. Thus, \"si\u0101\u0300r\u012b\" is always written to the left, but pronounced after the character on the right. When constructing the independent vowel for , \"\u016b\u1e5b\u0101\" takes an irregular form instead of using the usual \"h\u014d\u1e5b\u0101\".\nOrthography.\nGurmukh\u012b orthography prefers vowel sequences over the use of semivowels (\"y\" or \"w\") intervocally and in syllable nuclei, as in the words \u0a26\u0a3f\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a07\u0a06 \"dis\u0101i\u0101\" \"caused to be visible\" rather than \"dis\u0101y\u0101\", \u0a26\u0a3f\u0a06\u0a30 \"di\u0101r\u0103\" \"cedar\" rather than \"dy\u0101r\u0103\", and \u0a38\u0a41\u0a06\u0a26 \"su\u0101d\u0103\" \"taste\" rather than \"sw\u0101d\u0103\", permitting vowels in hiatus.\nIn terms of tone orthography, the short vowels [\u026a] and [\u028a], when paired with [h] to yield /\u026ah/ and /\u028ah/, represent [\u00e9] and [\u00f3] with high tones respectively, e.g. \u0a15\u0a3f\u0a39\u0a5c\u0a3e \"kih\u1e5b\u0101\" () 'which?' \u0a26\u0a41\u0a39\u0a30\u0a3e \"duhr\u0101\" () \"repeat, reiterate, double.\" The compounding of [\u0259\u0266] with [\u026a] or [\u028a] yield [\u025b\u0301\u02d0] and [\u0254\u0301\u02d0] respectively, e.g. \u0a2e\u0a39\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a17\u0a3e \"mahing\u0101\" () \"expensive\", \u0a35\u0a39\u0a41\u0a1f\u0a40 \"vahu\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012b\" () \"bride.\"\nOther signs.\nThe diacritics for gemination and nasalization are together referred to as \u0a32\u0a17\u0a3e\u0a16\u0a30 \"lag\u0101kkhar\u0103\" (\"applied letters\").\nGemination.\nThe diacritic \u0a05\u0a71\u0a27\u0a15 \"\u00e1ddak\u0103\" ( \u0a71 ) indicates that the following consonant is geminated, and is placed above the consonant preceding the geminated one. Consonant length is distinctive in the Punjabi language and the use of this diacritic can change the meaning of a word, as below:\nIt has not been standardized to be written in all instances of gemination; there is a strong tendency, especially in rural dialects, to also geminate consonants following a long vowel (/a:/, /e:/, /i:/, /o:/, /u:/, /\u025b:/, /\u0254\u02d0/, which triggers shortening in these vowels) in the penult of a word, e.g. \u0a14\u0a16\u0a3e \"aukkh\u0101\" \"difficult\", \u0a15\u0a40\u0a24\u0a40 \"k\u012b\u0306tt\u012b\" \"did\", \u0a2a\u0a4b\u0a24\u0a3e \"p\u014d\u0306tt\u0101\" \"grandson\", \u0a2a\u0a70\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a2c\u0a40 \"panj\u0101\u0306bb\u012b\" \"Punjabi\", \u0a39\u0a3e\u0a15 \"h\u0101k\u0103\" \"call, shout\", but plural \u0a39\u0a3e\u0a15\u0a3e\u0a02 \"h\u0101\u0306kk\u0101\u0303\".\nExcept in this case, where this unmarked gemination is often etymologically rooted in archaic forms, and has become phonotactically regular, the usage of the \"\u00e1ddak\u0103\" is obligatory.\nIt is also sometimes used to indicate second-syllable stress, e.g. \u0a2c\u0a71\u0a1a\u0a3e \"ba'c\u0101\", \"save\".\nNasalisation.\nThe diacritics \u0a1f\u0a3f\u0a71\u0a2a\u0a40 \"\u1e6dipp\u012b\" ( \u0a70 ) and \u0a2c\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a26\u0a40 \"bind\u012b\" ( \u0a02 ) are used for producing a nasal phoneme depending on the following obstruent or a nasal vowel at the end of a word. All short vowels are nasalized using \"\u1e6dipp\u012b\" and all long vowels are nasalized using \"bind\u012b\" except for \"dulai\u1e45ka\u1e5b\u0103\" ( \u0a42 ), which uses \"\u1e6dipp\u012b\" instead. \nOlder texts may follow other conventions.\nVowel suppression.\nThe \u0a39\u0a32\u0a70\u0a24 \"halant\u0103\", or \u0a39\u0a32\u0a70\u0a26 \"haland\u0103\", ( \u0a4d U+0A4D) character is not used when writing Punjabi in Gurmukh\u012b. However, it may occasionally be used in Sanskritised text or in dictionaries for extra phonetic information. When it is used, it represents the suppression of the inherent vowel.\nThe effect of this is shown below:\n\u0a15\u00a0\u2013 \n\u0a15\u0a4d\u00a0\u2013 \nPunctuation.\nThe \u0a21\u0a70\u0a21\u0a40 \"\u1e0da\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b\" (\u0964) is used in Gurmukh\u012b to mark the end of a sentence. A doubled \"\u1e0da\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b\", or \u0a26\u0a4b\u0a21\u0a70\u0a21\u0a40 \"do\u1e0da\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b\" (\u0965) marks the end of a verse.\nThe \"visarga\" symbol (\u0a03 U+0A03) is used very occasionally in Gurmukh\u012b. It can represent an abbreviation, as the period is used in English, though the period for abbreviation, like commas, exclamation points, and other Western punctuation, is freely used in modern Gurmukh\u012b.\nNumerals.\nGurmukh\u012b has its own set of digits, or \u0a05\u0a70\u0a17\u0a5c\u0a47 \"a\u1e45g\u0103\u1e5b\u0113\", which function exactly as in other versions of the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system. These are used extensively in older texts. In modern contexts, they are sometimes replaced by standard Western Arabic numerals.\nGlyphs.\nThe scriptural symbol for the Sikh term (\u0a74 U+0A74) is formed from \u0a67 (\"1\") and \u0a13 (\"\u014d\").\nPalaeography.\nVowels.\nThe length of the \"kann\u0101\" diacritic, used to indicate the \"\u0101\" vowel, in historical manuscripts is often considered when roughly estimating their ages. In earlier Gurmukh\u012b texts, the is often indicated by a \"mere dot.\" As the orthographic tradition developed, the \"kann\u0101\" became a longer mark that starts at the top of the line where the words are connected and moving down to cover the top half of the letter space. Shorter \"kann\u0101\" marks are indicative of a work dating to an earlier period.\nSpacing.\nBefore the 1970s, Gurbani and other Sikh scriptures were written in the traditional \"scriptio continua\" method of writing the Gurmukh\u012b script known as \u0a32\u0a5c\u0a40\u0a35\u0a3e\u0a30 \"la\u1e5b\u012bv\u0101r\u0103\", where there were no spacing between words in the texts. This is opposed to the comparatively more recent method of writing in Gurmukh\u012b known as \u0a2a\u0a26 \u0a1b\u0a47\u0a26 \"pad\u0103 ch\u0113d\u0103\", or \"verse perforation,\" which breaks the words by inserting spacing between them.\nFirst line of the Guru Granth Sahib, the \"Mul Mantar,\" in \"la\u1e5b\u012bv\u0101r\u0103\" (continuous form) and \"pad\u0103 ch\u0113d\u0103\" (spaced form):\n\"la\u1e5b\u012bv\u0101r\u0103:\" \u0a74\u0a38\u0a24\u0a3f\u0a28\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a41\u0a15\u0a30\u0a24\u0a3e\u0a2a\u0a41\u0a30\u0a16\u0a41\u0a28\u0a3f\u0a30\u0a2d\u0a09\u0a28\u0a3f\u0a30\u0a35\u0a48\u0a30\u0a41\u0a05\u0a15\u0a3e\u0a32\u0a2e\u0a42\u0a30\u0a24\u0a3f\u0a05\u0a1c\u0a42\u0a28\u0a40\u0a38\u0a48\u0a2d\u0a70\u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a26\u0a3f\u0965\n\"pad\u0103 ch\u0113d\u0103:\" \u0a74 \u0a38\u0a24\u0a3f \u0a28\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a41 \u0a15\u0a30\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a2a\u0a41\u0a30\u0a16\u0a41 \u0a28\u0a3f\u0a30\u0a2d\u0a09 \u0a28\u0a3f\u0a30\u0a35\u0a48\u0a30\u0a41 \u0a05\u0a15\u0a3e\u0a32 \u0a2e\u0a42\u0a30\u0a24\u0a3f \u0a05\u0a1c\u0a42\u0a28\u0a40 \u0a38\u0a48\u0a2d\u0a70 \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30 \u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a26\u0a3f \u0965\nTransliteration: \"ikku \u014da\u1e45k\u0101ru sati n\u0101mu karat\u0101 purakhu nirap\u00e0u niravairu ak\u0101la m\u016brati aj\u016bn\u012b saip\u00e0\u1e45 gura pras\u0101di\"\nStyles.\nVarious historical styles and fonts, or \u0a38\u0a3c\u0a48\u0a32\u0a40 \"\u015bail\u012b\", of Gurmukh\u012b script have evolved and been identified.

Founded in 1848 in Northwood, Ohio, the college moved to its present location in 1880. It enrolls about 1,400 undergraduates in over 30 majors, as well as graduate students in a handful of master's programs. The undergraduate curriculum emphasizes the humanities and the formation of a Reformed Christian worldview. It is the only undergraduate institution affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America.\nHistory.\nGeneva College was founded in 1848 in Northwood, Logan County, Ohio, by John Black Johnston, a minister of the RPCNA. The college was founded as \"Geneva Hall\", and was named after the Swiss center of the Reformed faith movement. After briefly closing during the American Civil War, the college continued operating in Northwood until 1880. By that time, the college leadership had begun a search for alternate locations that were closer to urban areas. After considering several locations in the Midwest, the denomination chose the College Hill neighborhood of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. The college constructed its current campus on land donated by the Harmony Society. Old Main, the oldest building on campus, was completed in 1881.\nThe Rapp Technical Design Center was completed in 2002. A major project to reroute Pennsylvania Route 18, which runs through the campus, was completed in November 2007. Improvements to Reeves Stadium and the construction of a campus entrance and pedestrian mall were completed in 2009.\nAdministration.\nTwo bodies oversee the administration of the college, the Board of Corporators and the Board of Trustees; while the Corporators are the legal owners of the college, in practice most authority is delegated to the Trustees, who are elected by the Corporators. Both Boards drafted the philosophical basis on which the college rests, known as the Foundational Concepts of Higher Education. The RPCNA still takes an active sponsorship and oversight role in the college: the college president, chaplain, and chairman of the Department of Biblical Studies must be members of the RPCNA, and all members of the Board of Corporators and the majority of the Board of Trustees must be RPCNA members. All professors and lecturers in the Department of Biblical Studies must subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith, and all full-time faculty and staff members must submit a written statement confessing faith in Jesus Christ and the Christian religion.\nThe university was granted an exception to Title IX in 2014 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students.\nAcademics.\nGeneva offers undergraduate degree programs in the arts and sciences, such as elementary education, business, engineering, student ministry, biology, and psychology. In 2006, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) rated the Business and Accounting undergraduates in the 95th percentile amongst American colleges.\nHistorically, Geneva offered a Degree Completion Program (DCP) for degrees in Human Resource Management, Community Ministry or Organizational Development for adult students mainly at off-campus locations. Geneva also established the Center for Urban Theological Studies in Philadelphia and has sister colleges in Taiwan (Christ College) and South Korea (Chong Shin College and Theological Seminary).\nGeneva also offers graduates studies in several fields and degrees including a Master of Business Administration, Master of Arts in Higher Education, Master of Arts in Counseling, and a Master of Science in Cybersecurity.\nGeneva established the Center for Technology Development in 1986 for providing research, prototyping and technical support to local industries and entrepreneurs. The center was awarded first prize in the Consolidated Natural Gas Company's Annual Award of Excellence competition in 1990.\nOnline courses.\nGeneva offers online degree programs for adult students. Currently, Geneva offers online Bachelor of Professional Studies degrees in Child and Family Services, Human Resources, Management, and Organization Leadership. The College also offers an online Associate's Degree in general studies.\nGeneva partners with Portage Learning to offer online college courses on their platform. These online college courses are offered to visiting students seeking to transfer courses to their home institution where they intend to pursue a degree. Courses completed prior to matriculation may be used by Geneva students to fulfill degree requirements.\nAffiliations and accreditations.\nGeneva College is a member institution of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, Council of Independent Colleges, and National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. Accreditations include the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs, and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. The chemistry degree is certified by the American Chemical Society.\nAthletics.\nGeneva's sports teams are called the Golden Tornadoes. The college is a dual member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III and National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) Division I.\nThe Golden Tornadoes compete as a member of the Presidents' Athletic Conference. Geneva was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) for many years and competed in the now-defunct American Mideast Conference. Geneva joined the NCAA as a provisional member in 2007 and during the transition process was not eligible for post season play or conference Player of the Week honors until gaining membership in July 2011.\nThe school offers a range of men's and women's varsity sports, including football, baseball, softball, basketball, volleyball, track and field, cross country, tennis, and soccer. Geneva has also offered rugby as a club sport since 1994.\nThe football program began in 1890 under head coach William McCracken. Over the years, the football team has amassed an all-time record of 496 wins, 437 losses, and 48 ties with five appearances in the Victory Bowl. The current football coach is Geno DeMarco.\nCulture and traditions.\nStudents must attend a designated number of weekly college-sponsored chapels to qualify for graduation. Alcohol is banned from the campus, and tobacco use is restricted from the entire campus. Greek letter fraternities and sororities are not permitted.\nOne of the earliest college basketball games in the United States occurred at Geneva College on April 8, 1893, when the Geneva College Covenanters defeated the New Brighton YMCA. Geneva commemorates this event through the athletic slogan of \"The Birthplace of College Basketball\". Geneva also has one of the oldest basketball courts in collegiate sports in the Johnston Gymnasium.\nGeneva was founded by Scottish and Scots-Irish immigrants. Many names of campus buildings and areas bear Scottish names:\nGeneva sports teams were nicknamed the \"Covenanters\" until the 1950s. Members of the RPCNA are sometimes referred to as Covenanters because the denomination traces its roots to the Covenanting tradition of Reformation era Scotland. The modern sports nickname of \"Golden Tornadoes\" commemorates the \"Golden Tornado\" of May 11, 1914, when a major tornado struck the college, most notably taking the gold colored roof from the top of Old Main, which was the origin of the associated color. Although the storm caused significant damage to the campus, there were no serious injuries. College students and faculty rejoiced at what they believed was a sign of God's mercy.\nGeneva's traditional sports rivalry is with Westminster College in nearby New Wilmington, Pennsylvania.\nHomosexual behavior is prohibited in the student handbook; students must confess and change their behavior or be suspended.\nFacilities.\nResidence halls.\nFull-time undergraduate students between ages 17 and 23 are required to live in college housing, with the exception of commuters and some seniors. Six dormitories \u2014 Clarke, Geneva Arms, McKee, Memorial, Pearce, and Young \u2014 house resident students. Geneva Arms and Young are apartment-style options divided into women's and men's wings. The college also owns a few smaller houses nearby campus, primarily for upperclassmen, that are available depending on residential need.\nLegal actions.\nCareerLink.\nOn December 15, 2006, the college filed a federal lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, alleging that a decision by the state to block the college from participating in the state sponsored CareerLink job service amounted to a violation of the college's First Amendment rights. Although the state argued that the college's requirement that faculty and staff members subscribe to the Christian religion amounted to discrimination, the lawsuit was settled. Geneva's right to access to CareerLink was restored and the college retains a statement on its employment applications stating \"Compliance with Geneva's Christian views is considered a bona fide occupational qualification ... and will have a direct impact on employment consideration.\"\nObamacare.\nIn 2012, the college sued the federal government over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\") contraceptive mandate, which requires employers to provide health insurance coverage for their employees that includes contraception, which Geneva College \"considers abortion, abortifacients and embryo-harming pharmaceuticals\" and objects to on religious grounds. The college, represented by Alliance Defending Freedom in the litigation, prevailed in its case, obtaining a permanent injunction in 2018.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13084", "revid": "50935875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13084", "title": "Gorillaz", "text": "British virtual band\nGorillaz are both an English virtual and a non-virtual band created by the musician Damon Albarn and the artist Jamie Hewlett in 1998. The band primarily consists of four fictional members: 2-D (vocals, keyboards, melodica), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards, backup vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums). Their universe is presented in media such as music videos, interviews, comic strips and short cartoons. Gorillaz's music has featured collaborations with a wide range of musicians and featured artists, with Albarn as the only permanent musical contributor.\nWith Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop sound of his band Blur, exploring a variety of musical styles including hip hop, electronic and world music. The band's 2001 debut album, \"Gorillaz\", which features dub, Latin and punk influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in Europe, with sales driven by the success of the lead single, \"Clint Eastwood\". Their second studio album, \"Demon Days\" (2005), went six times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the US, and spawned the successful lead single \"Feel Good Inc.\", along with other hits such as \"DARE\", \"Dirty Harry\" and \"El Ma\u00f1ana\". The band's third album, \"Plastic Beach\" (2010), featured environmentalist themes, synth-pop elements and an expanded roster of featured artists such as Bobby Womack, Lou Reed and Little Dragon. Their fourth album, \"The Fall\", was recorded on the road (mainly on Damon Albarn's iPad) during the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour and released on 25 December 2010.\nIn 2015, after over 10 years providing the voice of Russel, Remi Kabaka Jr became a permanent music producer for the band. Their fifth album, \"Humanz\" (2017) was the band's first in seven years and featured a wide array of guest artists, while its follow-up, \"The Now Now\" (2018), focused musically on Albarn. In 2020 Gorillaz started the \"Song Machine\" project, a music-based web series with episodes that consisted of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests, which culminated with their seventh studio album, \"\" (2020). The band's eighth studio album, \"Cracker Island\" (2023), met generally positive reviews as a refinement of their usual style.\nGorillaz has presented itself live in a variety of different ways throughout its history, such as hiding the touring band from the audience's view in the early years of the project, projecting animated band members on stage via computer graphics and, since 2010, traditional live touring featuring a fully visible live band. They have won a Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and four MTV Europe Music Awards. They have also been nominated for 11 Brit Awards and won Best British Group at the 2018 Brit Awards.\nHistory.\nCreation and \"Gorillaz\" (1998\u20132002).\nThe musician Damon Albarn and the comic artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, which Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in \"Deadline\", home of Hewlett's comic strip \"Tank Girl\". Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \"arsey, a wanker\". Though Hewlett became acquaintances with the band, he and Albarn often clashed, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's former girlfriend, Jane Oliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Oliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.\nThe idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, \"If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell\u00a0\u2013 there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a virtual band, something that would be a comment on that.\" Albarn said: \"This was the beginning of the boy band sort of explosion... and it just felt so manufactured. And we were like, well let's make a manufactured band but make it kind of interesting.\" The band originally identified themselves as \"Gorilla\" and the first song they recorded was \"Ghost Train\", which was later released as a B-side on their single \"Rock the House\". The band's visual style is thought to have evolved from \"The 16s\", a rejected comic strip Hewlett conceived with the \"Tank Girl\" co-creator Alan Martin. Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that \"one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes\" was Blur's 1997 single \"On Your Own\", which was released for their fifth studio album \"Blur\".\nFrom 1998 to 2000 Albarn recorded Gorillaz' self-titled debut album at his newly opened Studio 13 in London as well as at Geejam Studios in Jamaica. The sessions resulted in the first Gorillaz release, the EP \"Tomorrow Comes Today\", released on 27 November 2000. This EP consisted mostly of tracks which later appeared on the album, and it also included the band's first music video for \"Tomorrow Comes Today\", which introduced the virtual band members for the first time. With \"Gorillaz\", Albarn explored genres he had not explored with Blur, such as hip-hop, dub and Latin music, a process he described as liberating: \"One of the reasons I began Gorillaz is I had a lot of rhythms I never thought I could use with Blur. A lot of that stuff never really seemed to manifest itself in the music we made together as Blur.\"\nAlbarn began work on the album by himself, but eventually invited the American hip-hop producer Dan \"the Automator\" Nakamura. He said: \"I called Dan the Automator in after I'd done more than half of it and felt it would benefit from having somebody else's focus. So I just rang him and asked whether he was interested in helping me finish it off.\" Nakamura and Albarn had recently collaborated on \"Deltron 3030\", the debut album by the hip-hop supergroup of the same name featuring rapper Del the Funky Homosapien and DJ Kid Koala, both of whom Nakamura recruited to assist in finishing Gorillaz material. Del featured on two tracks on the album, including the lead single \"Clint Eastwood\", while Kid Koala contributed turntables to various tracks. The album featured additional collaborations with Ibrahim Ferrer of Buena Vista Social Club, Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto and Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, representing a pattern of collaboration with a wide range of artists which later became a staple of Gorillaz.\n\"Gorillaz\" was released on 26 March 2001 and was a major commercial success, debuting at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 14 on the US Billboard 200, going on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide, powered by the success of the \"Clint Eastwood\" single. The album was promoted with the singles \"Clint Eastwood\", \"19-2000\" and \"Rock the House\", in addition to the previously released \"Tomorrow Comes Today\", with each single featuring a music video directed by Hewlett starring the virtual members. Hewlett also helmed the design of the band's website, which was presented as an interactive tour of the band's fictional \"Kong Studios\" home and recording studio, featuring interactive games and explorative elements. Following the release of the album, the band embarked on a brief tour of Europe, Japan and the United States to support the album in which a touring band featuring Albarn played completely obscured behind a giant screen on which Hewlett's accompanying visuals were projected. The virtual band member's voice actors were also present at some shows and spoke live to the audience to give the impression that the fictional band was present on stage. In later interviews, Albarn described the band's first tour as difficult due to the limitations imposed by the band playing behind a screen: \"For someone who had just spent the last ten years out front being a frontman [with Blur], it was a really weird experience. And I have to say, some nights I just wanted to get a knife and just cut [the screen] and stick my head through.\" The album was followed by the B-sides compilation \"G-Sides\" released in December 2001.\nOn 7 December 2001 the band released the single \"911\", a collaboration with the hip-hop group D12 (without Eminem) and the singer Terry Hall of the Specials about the September 11 attacks. At the 2002 Brit Awards the virtual members of Gorillaz \"performed\" for the first time, appearing in 3D animation on four large screens along with rap accompaniment by Phi Life Cypher, a production which reportedly cost \u00a3300,000 to create. The band were nominated for four Brit Awards, including Best British Group, Best British Album and British Breakthrough Act, but did not win any awards.\nOn 1 July 2002 a remix album titled \"Laika Come Home\" was released, containing most of the tracks from \"Gorillaz\" remixed in dub and reggae style by the DJ group Spacemonkeyz. On 18 November 2002 the band released the DVD \"\", which contained all of the band's released visual content up to that point along with other extras. After the success of the debut album, Albarn and Hewlett briefly explored the possibility of creating a Gorillaz theatrical film, but Hewlett claimed the duo later lost interest: \"We lost all interest in doing it as soon as we started meeting with studios and talking to these Hollywood executive types, we just weren't on the same page. We said, fuck it, we'll sit on the idea until we can do it ourselves, and maybe even raise the money ourselves.\"\n\"Demon Days\" (2005\u20132006).\nAlbarn spent the majority of 2003 on tour with Blur in support of their newly released album \"Think Tank\"; however, upon completion of the tour, he decided to return to Gorillaz, reuniting with Hewlett to prepare for a second album. Hewlett explained that the duo chose to continue Gorillaz to prove that the project was not \"a gimmick\": \"If you do it again, it's no longer a gimmick, and if it works then we've proved a point.\" The resulting album \"Demon Days\", released on 11 May 2005, was another major commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on the UK Albums Charts and No. 6 on the US Billboard 200, and has since gone six times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and triple platinum in Australia, outperforming sales of the first album and becoming the band's most successful album to date. The album's success was partially driven by the success of the lead single \"Feel Good Inc.\" featuring the hip-hop group De La Soul, which topped \"Billboard\"'s Alternative Songs chart in the US for eight consecutive weeks and was featured in a commercial for Apple's iPod. The album was also supported by the later singles \"Dare\", \"Dirty Harry\", and the double A-side \"Kids with Guns\" / \"El Ma\u00f1ana\".\n\"Demon Days\" found the band taking a darker tone, partially influenced by a train journey Albarn had taken with his family through impoverished rural China. Albarn described the album as a concept album: \"The whole album kind of tells the story of the night \u2014 staying up during the night \u2014 but it's also an allegory. It's what we're living in basically, the world in a state of night.\" Believing that the album needed \"a slightly different approach\" compared to the first album, Albarn enlisted American producer Brian Burton, better known by his stage name Danger Mouse, to produce the album, whom Albarn praised as \"one of the best young producers in the world\" after hearing his 2004 mashup album \"The Grey Album\". Burton felt he and Albarn had a high degree of affinity with each other, stating in an interview on the creation of the album: \"We never had any arguments. We even have that finish-each-other's-sentences thing happening. There are a lot of the same influences between us, like Ennio Morricone and psychedelic pop-rock, but he has 10 years on me, so I have some catching up to do. Where he can school me on new wave and punk of the late '70s/early '80s, I can school him on a lot of hip-hop. We're very competitive and pushed each other.\" Similar to the first album, \"Demon Days\" features collaborations with several different artists, including Bootie Brown, Shaun Ryder, Ike Turner, MF Doom (who was recording with Danger Mouse as Danger Doom at the time) and Martina Topley-Bird, among others.\n The band chose to forgo traditional live touring in support of \"Demon Days\", instead limiting live performance during the album cycle to a five night residency in November 2005 at the Manchester Opera House billed as Demon Days Live. The concerts saw the band performing the album in full each night with most featured artists from the album present. Unlike the debut album's tour, the touring band was visible on stage in view of the audience but obscured by lighting in such a way that only their silhouettes were visible, with a screen above the band displaying Hewlett's visuals alongside each song. The residency was later repeated in April 2006 at New York City's Apollo Theater and the Manchester performances were later released on DVD as \"Demon Days: Live at the Manchester Opera House\". As part of their promotion of the album in Latin America, the band was interviewed in September 2005 on the live-action Mexican show \"Rebelde\". This episode also included the Latin American premiere of the music video for \"Dare\".\nThe virtual Gorillaz members \"performed\" at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2005 and again at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2006, appearing to perform on stage via Musion Eyeliner technology. Albarn later expressed disappointment at the execution of the performance, citing the low volume level required so as to not disturb the technology: \"That was tough... They started and it was so quiet cause they've got this piece of film that you've got to pull over the stage so any bass frequencies would just mess up the illusion completely.\" At the Grammys, the band won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \"Feel Good Inc.\", which was also nominated for Record of the Year. Albarn and Hewlett explored the idea of producing a full \"live holographic tour\" featuring the virtual Gorillaz appearing on stage with Musion Eyeliner technology after the Grammys performance, but the tour was ultimately never realised due to the tremendous expense and logistical issues that would have resulted.\nIn October 2006 the band released the book \"Rise of the Ogre\". Presented as an autobiography of the band ostensibly written by the fictional members and expanding on the band's fictional backstory and universe, the book was actually written by official Gorillaz script writer and live drummer Cass Browne and featured new artwork by Hewlett. Later the same month, the band released another DVD, \"\", compiling much of the band's visual content from the album cycle. A second B-sides compilation, \"D-Sides\" was released in November 2007, featuring B-sides and remixes associated with \"Demon Days\" as well as unreleased tracks from the sessions for the album. In 2008 the documentary film \"Bananaz\" was released. Directed by Ceri Levy, it documents the behind-the-scenes history of the band from 2000 to 2006.\n\"Plastic Beach\" and \"The Fall\" (2010\u20132012).\nAlbarn and Hewlett's next project together was the opera \"\" based on the classical Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\", which premiered at the 2007 Manchester International Festival. While not officially a Gorillaz project, Albarn mentioned in an interview that the project was \"Gorillaz, really but we can't call it that for legal reasons\".\nAfter completing work on \"Monkey\" in late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on a new Gorillaz project entitled \"Carousel\", described by Albarn as being about \"the mystical aspects of Britain\". Hewlett described \"Carousel\" in a 2008 interview as \"even bigger and more difficult than \"Monkey\"... It's sort of like a film but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles. Originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well. Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals.\" The \"Carousel\" concept was eventually dropped with Albarn and Hewlett's work evolving into the third Gorillaz studio album, \"Plastic Beach\".\nDrawing upon environmentalist themes, \"Plastic Beach\" was inspired by the idea of a \"secret floating island deep in the South Pacific... made up of the detritus, debris and washed up remnants of humanity\" inspired by marine pollution such as plastic that Albarn had found in a beach near one of his homes in Devon as well as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Unlike previous Gorillaz albums, Albarn made the decision to produce \"Plastic Beach\" by himself, with no co-producer. The album was recorded throughout 2008 and 2009 in London, New York City and Syria although production of the album was briefly interrupted so that Albarn could join Blur for a reunion tour in the summer of 2009, with Albarn explaining \"there's no way you can do that and that [Blur and Gorillaz] at the same time.\" \"Plastic Beach\" saw Gorillaz move into a more electronic pop sound, with Albarn describing the album as \"the most pop record I've ever made\" and saying that he took special care to make the album's lyrics and melodies clear and focused compared to previous albums. \"Plastic Beach\" also featured the largest cast of collaborators featured yet on a Gorillaz album, fulfilling Albarn's goal of \"work[ing] with an incredibly eclectic, surprising cast of people\" including artists such as Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Little Dragon, the former Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed and Gruff Rhys among others, and also included orchestral contributions from Sinfonia Viva and the Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music. Albarn explained the expanded roster of featured artists represented his and Hewlett's new vision of Gorillaz as a project, explaining in a July 2008 interview that \"Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more \u2013 it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects... That's my ideal model.\"\nReleased on 3 March 2010, \"Plastic Beach\" debuted at No. 2 on both the UK Albums Chart and the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, the band's highest placing debut chart position. The album was supported by the lead single \"Stylo\" featuring Mos Def and Bobby Womack (with Bruce Willis appearing in the music video) released in January 2010 and the later singles \"On Melancholy Hill\" and \"Rhinestone Eyes\". To promote the album, the band embarked on the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour, the band's first world tour and also their first live performances in which the touring band performed fully in view of the audience on stage with no visual obstructions. The tour, which featured many of the collaborative artists from \"Plastic Beach\" and saw the touring band wearing naval attire, was later described by Albarn as having been extremely costly to produce, with the band barely breaking even on the shows, saying \"I loved doing it, but economically it was a fucking disaster.\" The tour was preceded by headline performances at several international music festivals, including the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals. On 21 November 2010, while still on tour, the band released the non-album single \"Doncamatic\" featuring British singer Daley.\nDuring the North American leg of the Escape to Plastic Beach tour in the autumn of 2010, Albarn continued recording Gorillaz songs entirely on his iPad. The recordings were later released as the album \"The Fall\", first released digitally on Christmas Day 2010 and later given a physical release on 19 April 2011. \"The Fall\" is also co-produced by Stephen Sedgwick, the mixer engineer of the band. Albarn said the album served as a diary of the American leg of the tour, explaining that the tracks were presented exactly as they were on the day they were written and recorded with no additional production or overdubs: \"I literally made it on the road. I didn't write it before, I didn't prepare it. I just did it day by day as a kind of diary of my experience in America. If I left it until the New Year to release it then the cynics out there would say, 'Oh well, it's been tampered with', but if I put it out now they'd know that I haven't done anything because I've been on tour ever since.\" The band later released a \"Gorillaz edition\" of the Korg iElectribe music production app for iPad, featuring many of the same samples and sounds used by Albarn to create \"The Fall\".\nOn 23 February 2012 Gorillaz released \"DoYaThing\", a single to promote a Gorillaz-branded collection of Converse shoes which were released shortly after. The song was a part of Converse's \"Three Artists, One Song\" project, with the two additional collaborators being James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem and Andr\u00e9 3000 of Outkast. Two different edits of the song were released: a four-and-a-half minute radio edit released on Converse's website and the full 13-minute version of the song released on the Gorillaz website. Hewlett returned to direct the single's music video, featuring fictionalised animated versions of Murphy and Andr\u00e9 interacting with Gorillaz' virtual members. The song received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise given to Andr\u00e9 3000's contributions to the track.\nIn April 2012 Albarn told \"The Guardian\" that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were \"unlikely\". Tension between the two had been building, partly due to a belief held by Hewlett that his contributions to Gorillaz were being minimised. Speaking to \"The Guardian\" in April 2017, Hewlett explained: \"Damon had half the Clash on stage, and Bobby Womack and Mos Def and De La Soul, and fucking Hypnotic Brass Ensemble and Bashy and everyone else. It was the greatest band ever. And the screen on stage behind them seemed to get smaller every day. I'd say, 'Have we got a new screen?' and the tour manager was like, 'No, it's the same screen.' Because it seemed to me like it was getting smaller.\" Albarn gave his side of the story in a separate interview, saying \"I think we were at a cross purposes somewhat on that last record [\"Plastic Beach\"], which is a shame. It was one of those things, the music and the videos weren't working as well together, but I felt we'd made a really good record and I was into it.\" On 25 April 2012, in an interview with Metro, Albarn was more optimistic about Gorillaz' future, saying that once he had worked out his differences with Hewlett, he was sure that they would make another record. In June 2013, Hewlett confirmed that he and Albarn planned to someday continue Gorillaz and record a follow-up album to \"Plastic Beach\", saying \"We'll come back to it when the time is right.\"\nHiatus and return with \"Humanz\" (2012\u20132018).\nFollowing the release of \"DoYaThing\" and the making public of Albarn and Hewlett's fall-out in 2012, Gorillaz entered a multiyear hiatus. During the hiatus, Albarn released a solo album, \"Everyday Robots\", scored stage productions and continued to record and tour with Blur, while Hewlett held art exhibitions and attempted to create a film project which was ultimately never realised. While on tour in support of \"Everyday Robots\" in 2014, Albarn signaled openness to returning to Gorillaz, telling \"The National Post\" that he \"wouldn't mind having another stab at a Gorillaz record\". Two months later he reported that he had \"been writing quite a lot of songs on the road for Gorillaz\". and at the end of 2014 confirmed in an interview with \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" that he was planning to record another Gorillaz album. Speaking about his relationship with Hewlett, Albarn said that the pair's well-publicised fall-out had helped their relationship in the long term. Hewlett described the moment when he and Albarn agreed to continue Gorillaz at an afterparty after one of Albarn's solo shows in 2014: \"We'd had a bit to drink, and he said, 'Do you want to do another one?' And I said, 'Do you?' and he said, 'Do you?' And I said, 'Yeah, sure.' I started work on it straight away, learning to draw the characters again. I played around by myself for eight months while he was performing with Blur in 2015.\"\nRecording sessions for the band's fifth studio album, \"Humanz\", began in late 2015 and continued through 2016, taking place in London, New York City, Paris and Jamaica. Albarn enlisted the American hip-hop and house producer Anthony Khan, known by his stage name the Twilite Tone, to co-produce the album. Albarn chose Khan from a list of possible producers compiled by Parlophone, the band's record label after Albarn and Khan spoke via Skype. \"Humanz\" was also co-produced by Remi Kabaka Jr, a friend of Albarn who had worked with him in the non-profit musical organisation Africa Express and also has been the voice actor for the Gorillaz virtual band member Russel Hobbs since 2000. In conceptualising the album, Albarn and Khan envisioned \"Humanz\" as being the soundtrack for \"a party for the end of the world\", with Albarn specifically imagining a future in which Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election as context for the album's narrative, explaining, \"Let's use that as a kind of dark fantasy for this record, let's imagine the night Donald Trump wins the election and how we're all going to feel that night.\" Khan stated that \"The idea of Donald Trump being president allowed us to create a narrative together. I suggested that the album should be about joy, pain and urgency. That was to be our state of mind before we even touched a keyboard or an MPC. Especially in American music, dare I say black music, there's a way of communicating joy that at the same time allows you to feel the struggle the person has been through. And the urgency is there because something needs to be done. So that was the mantra. I wanted to blend Damon, a Briton, with the joy and pain and struggle that African-American music can express.\" \"Humanz\" again featured a large cast of featured artists, including Popcaan, Vince Staples, DRAM, Jehnny Beth, Pusha T, Peven Everett, Danny Brown, Grace Jones and Mavis Staples, among others. The first track from the album released publicly was \"Hallelujah Money\" featuring Benjamin Clementine, released on 20 January 2017 with an accompanying video featuring Clementine. While not an official single, Albarn explained that the band chose to release the track on the day of Trump's inauguration because \"It was meant to be something sung at the imaginary inauguration of Donald Trump, which turned out to be the real inauguration of Donald Trump, so we released it because we had imagined that happening and it did happen.\"\n\"Humanz\" was released on 28 April 2017, the band's first new studio album in 7 years. Featuring a \"modern-sounding urban hip-hop/R&amp;B sensibility\", the album debuted at #2 on both the UK Album charts and the US \"Billboard\" 200. \"Humanz\" received generally positive reviews from critics, although received some criticism from fans and critics for what was perceived as a diminished presence from Albarn in contrast to the abundance of featured artists. The album was released in both standard and deluxe editions, with the deluxe edition featuring an additional 6 bonus tracks and was promoted by the lead single \"Saturnz Barz\" featuring Popcaan and the later single \"Strobelite\" featuring Peven Everett. The Hewlett-directed music video for \"Saturnz Barz\" made use of YouTube's 360-degree video format and reportedly cost $800,000 to create.\nThe band embarked on the Humanz Tour to support the album from the summer of 2017 to early 2018. Like the band's previous tour, the Humanz Tour featured the touring band in full view of the audience with a large screen behind them displaying Hewlett-created visuals and featured several of the different collaborative artists from the band's history. The tour was preceded by a handful of European warm-up shows, including the first Demon Dayz Festival held on 10 June 2017 at the Dreamland Margate theme park, a Gorillaz curated music festival which was later repeated in Los Angeles in October 2018. On 8 June 2017 the band released the non-album single \"Sleeping Powder\" with an accompanying music video and on 3 November 2017 a \"Super Deluxe\" version of \"Humanz\", featuring an additional 14 unreleased tracks from the album's sessions, including alternative versions of previously released songs as well as the single \"Garage Palace\" featuring Little Simz.\n\"The Now Now\" (2018\u20132019).\nAlbarn continued recording while on the road during the Humanz Tour, and mentioned in an interview with \"Q Magazine\" in September 2017 that he was planning on releasing the material as a future Gorillaz album. Comparing the production of the album to \"The Fall\", which was also recorded while the band was on tour, Albarn mentioned that \"It will be a more complete record than \"The Fall\", but hopefully have that spontaneity.\" Albarn signaled his desire to complete and release the album quickly, adding that \"I really like the idea of making new music and playing it live almost simultaneously\" and \"If we're going to do more Gorillaz we don't want to wait seven years because, y'know, we're getting on a bit now. During a September 2017 concert in Seattle, the band debuted a new song, \"Ode to Idaho\", which was later included on the album as \"Idaho\". During the performance Albarn stated it had been written in the days prior.\nDuring a break in the Humanz Tour in February 2018, Albarn returned to London, where he worked with the producer James Ford, known for his work with Arctic Monkeys and Florence and the Machine, and Kabaka Jr. to finish the newly written material, resulting in the band's sixth studio album, \"The Now Now\", released on 29 June 2018. Featuring \"simple, mostly upbeat songs\" and 1980s new wave influences, the album was noted for its distinctly small list of featured artists compared to previous Gorillaz work, with only two tracks featuring any outside artists (the album's lead single \"Humility\" featuring George Benson and \"Hollywood\" featuring Snoop Dogg and Jamie Principle). Albarn mentioned that the few numbers of featured artists was partially due to the album's quick production, which in turn was a result of Albarn wanting to finish the album before the band's touring schedule resumed: \"We've been very lucky to be offered all the festivals this year on the back of the last record [\"Humanz\"]... but I didn't want to do that unless I had something new to work with, so the only option was to make another record really quickly and not have lots of guests on it, because that takes a long time to organize; just do it all myself, really.\" Albarn also explained that with \"The Now Now\" he sought to make a Gorillaz album \"where I'm just singing for once\" and that the album is \"pretty much just me singing, very sort of in the world of 2-D.\"\nIn the fictional Gorillaz storyline, the band introduced Ace from Cartoon Network's animated series \"The Powerpuff Girls\" as a temporary bassist of the band during \"The Now Now\" album cycle, filling in for the imprisoned Murdoc Niccals. Explaining the crossover in an interview with the BBC, Albarn said \"We were massive fans of \"The Powerpuff Girls\" when they came out, the energy of that cartoon was really cool, and we kind of know the creator of it (Craig McCracken). It was a very organic thing.\"\nThe band's remaining 2018 live dates were billed as The Now Now Tour to support the album, and included a performance in Tokyo on 22 June 2018 billed as \"The Now Now World Premiere\" in which the band played the full album live for the first and only time, a performance which was later broadcast by Boiler Room. On 16 December 2019 the documentary \"Gorillaz: Reject False Icons\" was screened worldwide on a one-day theatrical release. Filmed and directed by Hewlett's son Denholm, the documentary showcases a behind-the-scenes look at the production of \"Humanz\" and \"The Now Now\" as well as the album's associated tours. One week after the film's theatrical release, a \"Director's Cut\" version of the film featuring additional footage was released on the official Gorillaz YouTube channel in three parts. In the credits for \"Reject False Icons\", Kabaka Jr was listed as an official member of the band (labeled as \"A&amp;R/Producer\") alongside Albarn and Hewlett for the first time.\n\"Song Machine\" project and \"Meanwhile EP\" (2020\u20132021).\nOn 29 January 2020 the band announced its new project \"Song Machine\". Eschewing the typical album format of releasing music, Song Machine is instead a web series that sees the band releasing one new song a month as \"episodes\" to the series, with 11 episodes released to comprise the first \"season\". Elaborating on the idea behind \"Song Machine\" in a radio interview shortly after the announcement of the project, Albarn explained that \"We no longer kind of see ourselves as constrained to making albums. We can now make episodes and seasons.\" Each episode features previously unannounced guest musicians on new Gorillaz material, with the first being \"Momentary Bliss\", which was released on 31 January and features both the British rapper Slowthai and the Kent-based punk-rock duo Slaves. Upon the premiere of \"Momentary Bliss\", Albarn revealed that the group had been in the studio with Schoolboy Q and Sampa the Great among others, although he did say that these songs were likely to be saved for future episodes of \"Song Machine\". The group also teased a possible collaboration with the Australian band Tame Impala on Instagram.\nOn 27 February the band released the second episode of \"Song Machine\" entitled \"D\u00e9sol\u00e9\". The song features the Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara. The third episode, \"Aries\", released on 9 April and featured Peter Hook and Georgia. The fourth track \"How Far?\" featuring Tony Allen and Skepta was released 2 May. This song was released without an accompanying music video as a tribute to Allen, who died on 30 April. On 26 May Gorillaz announced the release of a new book titled \"Gorillaz Almanac\". The book comes in three editions: standard, deluxe and super deluxe, all of which were set to release on 23 October but has since been delayed to 22 December with a physical release of season one of \"Song Machine\" included with each copy. On 9 June the band released \"Friday 13th\", the fourth episode of \"Song Machine\". The track features the French-British rapper Octavian. On 20 July the band released \"Pac-Man\", the fifth episode of \"Song Machine\", in honour of Pac-Man's 40th anniversary. The track features the American rapper Schoolboy Q.\nOn 9 September the band released \"Strange Timez\", the sixth episode of \"Song Machine\". The track features Robert Smith, from the Cure. Gorillaz also announced the title and tracklist for \"\", released on 23 October 2020, featuring further guest appearances from Elton John, 6lack, JPEGMafia, Kano, Roxani Arias, Moonchild Sanelly and Chai, among others. On 1 October the band released \"The Pink Phantom\", the seventh episode of \"Song Machine\". The track features John and the American R&amp;B recording artist 6lack. Before the release of \"Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez\", Gorillaz started a radio show on Apple Music called \"Song Machine Radio\" where each virtual character has a turn to invite special guests and play some of their favourite tunes. A few days ahead of the release of \"Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez\", Albarn revealed that he had written a song for the project's second season.\nOn 5 November the band released \"The Valley of the Pagans\", the eighth episode of \"Song Machine\". The track features the American singer Beck. The music video is known for being the first major studio production filmed in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". The video ends with a reference to previous album, \"Plastic Beach\". For unknown reasons, the music video on the official Gorillaz YouTube channel was set to private just a few days after its initial premiere. On 9 March 2021 Gorillaz uploaded an alternative version of the music video to their official YouTube channel, which does not feature any gameplay from \"Grand Theft Auto V\". On 24 December the band released \"The Lost Chord\", the ninth and final episode of the first season of \"Song Machine\". The track features the British musician Leee John.\nOn 26 March 2021 the band celebrated its debut album's 20th anniversary with oncoming reissues of their catalogue and teases of non-fungible tokens; due to its impact on climate change, the latter was met with criticism by various sources and fans\u2014some noting that the act contradicts the environmental themes of \"Plastic Beach\". No non-fungible tokens have since released. The band also announced a boxset, the \"G Collection,\" containing six of their studio albums\u2014excluding \"The Fall\"\u2014for Record Store Day. On 10 August 2021 Gorillaz debuted three new songs, \"Meanwhile\" (featuring British rapper Jelani Blackman), \"Jimmy Jimmy\" (featuring the British rapper AJ Tracey), and \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" (featuring the Jamaican-British singer Alica\u00ec Harley), during a free concert at the O2 Arena in London, England exclusively for National Health Service employees and their families. They then performed them again at the subsequent concert open to the public the next day (both of which served as the first live audience concerts of the Song Machine Tour). These three songs were announced to be tracks from a new EP entitled \"Meanwhile\", with the cover originally published on TikTok.\nWorld Tour and \"Cracker Island\" (2022\u20132024).\nOn 17 September 2021 Albarn revealed that he had recorded a new Gorillaz song with Bad Bunny whilst in Jamaica, and, at the time, said it would be the first single for a new album, influenced by Latin America, released in 2022. The concept for the album would later change, with the song being announced at a later date. On 31 August 2022 the name of this song was revealed to be \"Tormenta\". In November 2021 Albarn announced that an animated film based on the band was being produced at Netflix, but by February 2023 it had been cancelled.\nThroughout 2022 Gorillaz went on a world tour in South America, Europe, Australia and North America, where they debuted new material. In June 2022 the band began teasing the release of new material, with promotional displays and websites surfacing encouraging fans to sign up to be a part of \"The Last Cult\". The band released a new single (regularly performed on tour) called \"Cracker Island\", featuring Thundercat and produced with Greg Kurstin, on 22 June, with the music video being released on 28 July. Their scheduled performance at the first Splendour in the Grass festival in Queensland, Australia on 22 July was cancelled owing to torrential rain. In July 2022 they played at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre as part of Illuminate Adelaide, supported by Moonchild Sanelly. In August 2022 the band performed the new song \"New Gold\" (featuring Tame Impala and Bootie Brown) at All Points East in London, and released it as their second single for their eighth studio album, announced on the same day to be titled \"Cracker Island\" (released on 24 February 2023). The album, produced with Kurstin, also features appearances from Stevie Nicks, Bad Bunny, Beck, and Adeleye Omotayo. On 4 November the band released the third single from \"Cracker Island\", \"Baby Queen\" (previously released on the \"FIFA 23\" soundtrack). On 8 December the band released the album's fourth single, \"Skinny Ape\", alongside the announcement of two virtual shows in Times Square and Piccadilly Circus on 17 and 18 December, respectively. On 27 January 2023 the album's fifth single, \"Silent Running\" featuring Adeleye Omotayo, was released, with a music video following on 8 February. The album received mostly positive reviews, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine describing it as \"less an exploration of new sonic territory so much as it is a reaffirmation of [Albarn's] strengths\" with \"a clean, efficient energy\".\nOn 27 February 2023 a deluxe version of \"Cracker Island\" was released with five bonus tracks. The previous collaborators Del the Funky Homosapien and De La Soul appeared on the deluxe version, as well as the Brazilian artist MC Binn. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album for the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024.\n25th anniversary and \"The Mountain\" (2025\u2013present).\nTo celebrate their 25th anniversary, Gorillaz released a video on 29 January 2025 titled \"NOSTALGIAZ\", featuring clips from their music videos set to \"Pirate's Progress\" from \"Plastic Beach\". In March, during an interview with the French magazine \"Les Inrockuptibles\", Albarn said he was finishing a new Gorillaz album. On 8 August 2025 the band launched an exhibition at London's Copper Box called \"House of Kong\", which ran until 3 September. This included a set of daily live performances where they performed their first three albums and a fourth \"mystery\" show; their self-titled debut album on 29 August, \"Demon Days\" on 30 August, and \"Plastic Beach\" on 2 September. On 26 August the band were added to the video game \"Fortnite Festival\" as part of the game's tenth season. For the closing \"mystery\" show of the \"House Of Kong\" exhibition on 3 September, the band revealed the new album in full, playing 15 songs from the album with no encores. The performance had multiple guests, including Sparks, Yasiin Bey, Omar Souleyman, Asha Bhosle and Johnny Marr, but the title of the album was not disclosed.\nOn 11 September 2025 the band officially announced their upcoming album titled \"The Mountain\" with a release date of 20 March 2026. Its lead single, \"The Happy Dictator\", featuring Sparks, was released concurrently with the announcement. The album will be promoted during The Mountain Tour, with concerts in Europe between March and June 2026.\nStyle and legacy.\nWriters and critics have variously described Gorillaz as art pop, alternative rock, hip hop, electronic, trip hop, pop, dark pop, alternative hip hop, rap rock, indie rock, bedroom pop, dance-rock, new wave, funk, worldbeat and experimental rock. The band's aesthetic and general approach have been described as postmodern. According to AllMusic, Gorillaz blend Britpop and hip-hop, while \"The Guardian\" described the band as \"a sort of dub/hip-hop/lo-fi indie/world music hybrid\". According to \"PopMatters\", the band's early work foreshadowed \"the melding of hip-hop, rock, and electronic elements in pop music\" that grew in significance in the next decade. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"[Influencing] to us, is the greatest achievement of Gorillaz. It's that we know that a very large percentage of our audience are kids, who go on gorillaz.com, who go on gorillaz-unofficial.com, and through seeing the cartoons and hearing the tune, buying the record, are finding out about this stuff that they knew nothing about. So they're learning about Vlad The Impaler, or Ronald Searle, or The Specials... so it's like an education. They really get into it. And they discover it, the music we grew up on.\"\n\u2013 Jamie Hewlett, \nGorillaz\u2019 main musical influences include Fishmans, Massive Attack, the Specials, Big Audio Dynamite, Public Image Ltd, Tom Tom Club, Fun Boy Three, Unkle, A Tribe Called Quest, and their fellow collaborators De La Soul, as well as The Human League, The Kinks, XTC, Simple Minds, Sonic Youth, Pavement, Ween, Portishead, Beck, Wire, Fela Kuti, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth Wind and Fire, Augustus Pablo, Zapp and DJ Kool Herc. Gorillaz\u2019 primary visual influences include Hanna-Barbera, \"Looney Tunes\", \"Mad\" magazine, \"The Simpsons\", \"2000 AD\" and \"M\u00e9tal hurlant\" (\"Heavy Metal\"). Furthermore, Hewlett has also cited European artists such as Carl Giles, Ronald Searle, Moebius, Tanino Liberatore, Mike McMahon and Brendan McCarthy. The idea for Gorillaz was inspired by the many cartoon bands that came before them in the 1960s such as the Banana Splits, the Archies, Josie and the Pussycats, and Alvin and the Chipmunks, and real bands with fictional stage personas like ABC (circa \"How to Be a ... Zillionaire!\") and Silicon Teens.\nMusical artists and bands who have been influenced by Gorillaz's work include Major Lazer, Dethklok, Rat Boy, Chromeo, Flume, Foster the People, The 1975, 5 Seconds of Summer, Awolnation, Paramore, Grimes, Kesha, A.G. Cook, Finneas, Oliver Tree, Flatbush Zombies, Vic Mensa, IDK, Trippie Redd, The Internet, ASAP Rocky, Lupe Fiasco, Brockhampton, Odd Future, Machine Gun Kelly and Billie Eilish, who was joined by Albarn to sing her song, \"Getting Older\", and Gorillaz' song, \"Feel Good Inc.\" with Posdnuos of De La Soul.\nBand members.\nVirtual members.\nMurdoc Faust Niccals (born Murdoc Alphonce Niccals) is the bassist for the band. He is voiced by Phil Cornwell and was created by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. Murdoc is based on the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, Victor Frankenstein and Creeper from \"Scooby-Doo\". In particular, he was inspired by a photograph of the Rolling Stones taken in 1968 by the photographer David Bailey. Once described by Hewlett as being the \"unpleasant villain of the band\". Murdoc is a Satanist who is often depicted wearing an inverted cross necklace, with \"Hail Satan\" being a common catchphrase of his. He was created by Hewlett and Albarn in 1998, with his first official appearance being Gorillaz' debut EP, \"Tomorrow Comes Today\", in 2000.\nStuart Harold \"2-D\" Pot provides the lead vocals and plays the keyboard for the band. 2-D's singing voice is provided by Albarn; his speaking voice was provided by the actor Nelson De Freitas in various Gorillaz direct-to-video projects such as ' and '. In 2017 Kevin Bishop was cast as the new speaking voice of 2-D. 2-D was created by Albarn and Hewlett in 1998.\nNoodle provides the lead guitar and keyboards, as well as some occasional vocals for the band. Like all other band members of Gorillaz, she was created in 1998 by Albarn and Hewlett. Originally from Japan, Noodle has been voiced by Haruka Kuroda, Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto, and Haruka Abe. Noodle was originally conceptualised by Hewlett as a 17-year-old girl named Paula Cracker, but Albarn noted that the character was too similar to the characters that Hewlett is typically known for drawing, and recommended he should attempt to create \"something different\". Taking Albarn's advice, Hewlett designed an illustration of a 10-year-old Japanese girl named Noodle who is a martial arts expert. In October 2016, Noodle became the global ambassador for Jaguar Racing, appearing in a short commercial advertising the company.\nRussel Hobbs was originally conceptualised by Hewlett and Albarn in 1998 as a metafictional representation of the hip-hop aspects of Gorillaz, embodying the spirit of the bands' collaborations with various rappers over the years. He is referenced in the lyrics to the \"Gorillaz\" track \"Clint Eastwood\". He was originally inspired by Hewlett's love for hip-hop artists like Ice Cube (the cousin of the rapper Del the Funky Homosapien, who raps on \"Clint Eastwood\" and \"Rock The House\" as Del the Ghost Rapper). Russel's speaking voice is provided by the percussionist and DJ Remi Kabaka Jr, who has been an actual percussionist and producer for Gorillaz since \"Humanz\" in 2017. Russel's fictional backstory of being possessed by the spirits of dead musicians is what originally inspired the usage of collaborators and guests on Gorillaz' albums.\nAdditional members include Ace, a \"Powerpuff Girls\" character from the Gangreen Gang, a green-skinned gang making part of this universe, and the bassist recording with the band on \"The Now Now\" (2018) and Murdoc's substitute, while the latter was arrested in prison until he returns with the band 1 year later. Cyborg Noodle, Noodle's substitute on guitar and a robotic version of herself, while the latter was lost somewhere in Japan. Cyborg Noodle's appearance is only used for the Plastic Beach phase. Del the Ghost Rapper, a fictionalised version of the real rapper Del the Funky Homosapien, Russel's spirit, and the band's current rapper from 1998 to 2001, until he was back in 2023 during the sessions of \"Cracker Island\", and Paula Cracker, the band's earlier guitarist and 2-D's former girlfriend, when the band was named Gorilla, until Noodle's arrival on guitar.\nTours.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "13087", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13087", "title": "GW-BASIC", "text": "Dialect of the BASIC programming language\nGW-BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language developed by Microsoft from IBM BASICA. Functionally identical to BASICA, its BASIC interpreter is a fully self-contained executable and does not need the Cassette BASIC ROM found in the original. It was bundled with MS-DOS operating systems on IBM\u00a0PC\u2013compatibles by Microsoft.\nThe language is suitable for simple games, business programs and the like. Since it was included with most versions of MS-DOS, it was also a low-cost way for many aspiring programmers to learn the fundamentals of computer programming. Microsoft also sold a BASIC compiler, BASCOM, compatible with GW-BASIC, for programs needing more speed.\nAccording to Mark Jones Lorenzo, given the scope of the language, \"GW-BASIC is arguably the \"ne plus ultra\" of Microsoft's family of line-numbered BASICs stretching back to Altair BASIC\u00a0\u2014 and perhaps even of line-numbered BASIC in general.\"\nWith the release of MS-DOS 5.0, GW-BASIC's place was taken by QBasic, a slightly abridged version of the interpreter part of the separately available QuickBASIC interpreter and compiler package.\nOn May 21, 2020, Microsoft released the 8088 assembler source code for GW-BASIC\u00a01.0 on GitHub under the MIT License.\nFeatures.\nIBM BASICA and GW-BASIC are largely ports of MBASIC version 5.x, but with added features specifically for the IBM\u00a0PC hardware. Common features of BASIC-80\u00a05.x and BASICA/GW-BASIC include:\nThe ability to \"crunch\" program lines by omitting spaces, a common feature of earlier Microsoft BASIC implementations, was removed from BASIC-80\u00a05.x and BASICA/GWBASIC.\nBASIC-80 programs not using codice_7/codice_8 statements run under GW-BASIC. BASICA adds many features for the IBM\u00a0PC such as sound, graphics, and memory commands. Features not present in BASIC-80 include the ability to execute the codice_9 function with no parameters and the ability to also save programs in a \"protected\" format, preventing them from being codice_10ed. BASICA also allows double-precision numbers to be used with mathematical and trigonometric functions such as codice_11, codice_12, and codice_13, which wasn't allowed in 8-bit versions of BASIC. This feature was normally not enabled and required the optional parameter codice_14 at startup, i.e., codice_15. BASIC's memory footprint was slightly increased if it was used.\nMicrosoft did not offer a generic version of MS-DOS until v3.20 in 1986; before then, all variants of the operating system were OEM versions. Depending on the OEM, BASIC was distributed as either BASICA.EXE or GWBASIC.EXE. The former should not be confused with IBM BASICA, which always came as a COM file. Some variants of BASIC has extra features to support a particular machine. For example, the AT&amp;T and Tandy versions of DOS include a special GW-BASIC that supports their enhanced sound and graphics capabilities.\nThe initial version of GW-BASIC is the one included with Compaq DOS 1.13, released with the Compaq Portable in 1983, and was analogous to IBM BASICA 1.10. It uses the CP/M-derived file control blocks for disk access and does not support subdirectories. Later versions support subdirectories, improved graphics, and other capabilities.\nGW-BASIC 3.20 (1986) adds EGA graphics support (no version of BASICA or GW-BASIC had VGA support) and is the last major new version released before it was superseded by QBasic.\nBuyers of Hercules Graphics Cards received a special version of GW-BASIC on the card's utility disk that is called HBASIC, which adds support for its 720\u00d7348 monochrome graphics. Other versions of BASICA/GW-BASIC do not support Hercules graphics and can only display graphics on that card through the use of third-party CGA emulation, such as SIMCGA.\nGW-BASIC has a command-line-based integrated development environment (IDE) based on Dartmouth BASIC. Using the cursor movement keys, any line displayed on the screen can be edited. It also includes function key shortcuts at the bottom of the screen. Like other early microcomputer versions of BASIC, GW-BASIC lacks many of the structures needed for structured programming, such as local variables. GW-BASIC programs executed relatively slowly because it was an interpreted language. All program lines must be numbered; all non-numbered lines are considered to be commands in direct mode to be executed immediately. Program source files are normally saved in binary compressed format with tokens replacing keywords, with an option to save in ASCII text form.\nThe GW-BASIC command-line environment has commands to codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_10 the current program, or quit to the operating codice_20; these commands can also be used as program statements. There is little support for structured programming in GW-BASIC. All codice_21/codice_22/codice_23 conditional statements must be written on one line, although codice_24/codice_25 statements may group multiple lines. Functions can only be defined using the single line codice_26 statement (e.g., ). The data type of variables can be specified with a character at the end of the variable name: codice_27 is a string of characters, codice_28 is an integer, etc. Groups of variables can also be set to default types based on the initial letter of their name by use of the codice_29, codice_30, etc., statements. The default type for undeclared variables not identified by such typing statements is single-precision floating-point (32-bit MBF).\nGW-BASIC allows use of joystick and light pen input devices. GW-BASIC can read from and write to files and COM ports; it can also do event trapping for ports. Since the cassette tape port interface of the original IBM\u00a0PC was never implemented on compatibles, cassette operations are not supported. GW-BASIC can play simple music using the codice_31 statement, needing a string of notes represented in a music macro language, e.g., codice_32. More low-level control is possible with the codice_33 statement, which takes the arguments of a frequency in hertz and a length in clock ticks for the standard internal PC\u00a0speaker in IBM machines. Consequently, sound is limited to single channel beeps and whistles as befits a \"business\" machine. GW-BASIC for the Tandy\u00a01000 allows up to three channels of sound for the codice_33 and codice_31 commands.\nName.\nThere are several theories on what the initials \"GW\" represent. Greg Whitten, an early Microsoft employee who developed the standards in the company's BASIC compiler line, says that Bill Gates picked the name GW-BASIC. Whitten refers to it as \"Gee-Whiz\" BASIC and is unsure whether Gates named the program after him. The \"Microsoft User Manual\" from Microsoft Press also refers to it by the \"Gee-Whiz\" BASIC name. It may have also been nicknamed \"Gee-Whiz\" because of its numerous graphics commands. Other common theories as to the initials' origins include \"Graphics and Windows\", \"Gates, William\" (Microsoft's president at the time), or \"Gates\u2013Whitten\" (the two main designers of the program).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "13088", "revid": "34669967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13088", "title": "Granite", "text": "Type of igneous rock\nGranite (, ) is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase. It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions. These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters across to batholiths exposed over hundreds of square kilometers.\nGranite is typical of a larger family of granitic rocks, or granitoids, that are composed mostly of coarse-grained quartz and feldspars in varying proportions. These rocks are classified by the relative percentages of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase (the QAPF classification), with true granite representing granitic rocks rich in quartz and alkali feldspar. Most granitic rocks also contain mica or amphibole minerals, though a few (known as leucogranites) contain almost no dark minerals.\nGranite is nearly always massive (lacking any internal structures), hard (falling between 6 and 7 on the Mohs hardness scale), and tough. These properties have made granite a widespread construction stone throughout human history.\nDescription.\nThe word \"granite\" comes from the Latin \"granum\", a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a completely crystalline rock. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. Granitic rocks mainly consist of feldspar, quartz, mica, and amphibole minerals, which form an interlocking, somewhat equigranular matrix of feldspar and quartz with scattered darker biotite mica and amphibole (often hornblende) peppering the lighter color minerals. Occasionally some individual crystals (phenocrysts) are larger than the groundmass, in which case the texture is known as porphyritic. A granitic rock with a porphyritic texture is known as a granite porphyry. Granitoid is a general, descriptive field term for lighter-colored, coarse-grained igneous rocks. Petrographic examination is required for identification of specific types of granitoids. The alkali feldspar in granites is typically orthoclase or microcline and is often perthitic. The plagioclase is typically sodium-rich oligoclase. Phenocrysts are usually alkali feldspar.\nGranitic rocks are classified according to the QAPF diagram for coarse grained plutonic rocks and are named according to the percentage of quartz, alkali feldspar (orthoclase, sanidine, or microcline) and plagioclase feldspar on the A-Q-P half of the diagram. True granite (according to modern petrologic convention) contains between 20% and 60% quartz by volume, with 35% to 90% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar. Granitic rocks poorer in quartz are classified as syenites or monzonites, while granitic rocks dominated by plagioclase are classified as granodiorites or tonalites. Granitic rocks with alkali feldspar comprising over 90% of the total feldspar are classified as alkali feldspar granites. Granitic rock with more than 60% quartz, which is uncommon, is classified simply as quartz-rich granitoid or, if composed almost entirely of quartz, as quartzolite.\nTrue granites are further classified by the percentage of their total feldspar that is alkali feldspar. A granite containing 15% to 25% quartz and whose feldspar is 65% to 90% alkali feldspar is syenogranite, while the feldspar in monzogranite is 35% to 65% alkali feldspar. A granite containing both muscovite and biotite micas is called a binary or \"two-mica\" granite. Two-mica granites are typically high in potassium and low in plagioclase, and are usually S-type granites or A-type granites, as described below.\nAnother aspect of granite classification is the ratios of metals that potentially form feldspars. Most granites have a composition such that almost all their aluminum and alkali metals (sodium and potassium) are combined as feldspar. This is the case when K2O + Na2O + CaO &gt; Al2O3 &gt; K2O + Na2O. Such granites are described as \"normal\" or \"metaluminous\". Granites in which there is not enough aluminum to combine with all the alkali oxides as feldspar (Al2O3 &lt; K2O + Na2O) are described as \"peralkaline\", and they contain unusual sodium amphiboles such as riebeckite. Granites in which there is an excess of aluminum beyond what can be taken up in feldspars (Al2O3 &gt; CaO + K2O + Na2O) are described as \"peraluminous\", and they contain aluminum-rich minerals such as muscovite.\nPhysical properties.\nThe average density of granite is between , its compressive strength usually lies above 200 MPa (29,000 psi), and its viscosity near STP is 3\u20136\u00b71020 Pa\u00b7s.\nThe melting temperature of dry granite at ambient pressure is ; it is strongly reduced in the presence of water, down to 650\u00a0\u00b0C at a few hundred megapascals of pressure.\nGranite has poor primary permeability overall, but strong secondary permeability through cracks and fractures if they are present.\nChemical composition.\nA worldwide average of the chemical composition of granite, by mass percent, based on 2485 analyses:\nThe medium-grained equivalent of granite is microgranite. The extrusive igneous rock equivalent of granite is rhyolite.\nOccurrence.\nGranitic rock is widely distributed throughout the continental crust. Much of it was intruded during the Precambrian age; it is the most abundant basement rock that underlies the relatively thin sedimentary veneer of the continents. Outcrops of granite tend to form tors, domes or bornhardts, and rounded massifs. Granites sometimes occur in circular depressions surrounded by a range of hills, formed by the metamorphic aureole or hornfels. Granite often occurs as relatively small, less than 100\u00a0km2 stock masses (stocks) and in batholiths that are often associated with orogenic mountain ranges. Small dikes of granitic composition called aplites are often associated with the margins of granitic intrusions. In some locations, very coarse-grained pegmatite masses occur with granite.\nOrigin.\nGranite forms from silica-rich (felsic) magmas. Felsic magmas are thought to form by addition of heat or water vapor to rock of the lower crust, rather than by decompression of mantle rock, as is the case with basaltic magmas. It has also been suggested that some granites found at convergent boundaries between tectonic plates, where oceanic crust subducts below continental crust, were formed from sediments subducted with the oceanic plate. The melted sediments would have produced magma intermediate in its silica content, which became further enriched in silica as it rose through the overlying crust.\nEarly fractional crystallisation serves to reduce a melt in magnesium and chromium, and enrich the melt in iron, sodium, potassium, aluminum, and silicon. Further fractionation reduces the content of iron, calcium, and titanium. This is reflected in the high content of alkali feldspar and quartz in granite.\nThe presence of granitic rock in island arcs shows that fractional crystallization alone can convert a basaltic magma to a granitic magma, but the quantities produced are small. For example, granitic rock makes up just 4% of the exposures in the South Sandwich Islands. In continental arc settings, granitic rocks are the most common plutonic rocks, and batholiths composed of these rock types extend the entire length of the arc. There are no indication of magma chambers where basaltic magmas differentiate into granites, or of cumulates produced by mafic crystals settling out of the magma. Other processes must produce these great volumes of felsic magma. One such process is injection of basaltic magma into the lower crust, followed by differentiation, which leaves any cumulates in the mantle. Another is heating of the lower crust by underplating basaltic magma, which produces felsic magma directly from crustal rock. The two processes produce different kinds of granites, which may be reflected in the division between S-type (produced by underplating) and I-type (produced by injection and differentiation) granites, discussed below.\nAlphabet classification system.\nThe composition and origin of any magma that differentiates into granite leave certain petrological evidence as to what the granite's parental rock was. The final texture and composition of a granite are generally distinctive as to its parental rock. For instance, a granite that is derived from partial melting of metasedimentary rocks may have more alkali feldspar, whereas a granite derived from partial melting of metaigneous rocks may be richer in plagioclase. It is on this basis that the modern \"alphabet\" classification schemes are based.\nThe letter-based Chappell &amp; White classification system was proposed initially to divide granites into I-type (igneous source) granite and S-type (sedimentary sources). Both types are produced by partial melting of crustal rocks, either metaigneous rocks or metasedimentary rocks.\nI-type granites are characterized by a high content of sodium and calcium, and by a strontium isotope ratio, 87Sr/86Sr, of less than 0.708. 87Sr is produced by radioactive decay of 87Rb, and since rubidium is concentrated in the crust relative to the mantle, a low ratio suggests origin in the mantle. The elevated sodium and calcium favor crystallization of hornblende rather than biotite. I-type granites are known for their porphyry copper deposits. I-type granites are orogenic (associated with mountain building) and usually metaluminous.\nS-type granites are sodium-poor and aluminum-rich. As a result, they contain micas such as biotite and muscovite instead of hornblende. Their strontium isotope ratio is typically greater than 0.708, suggesting a crustal origin. They also commonly contain xenoliths of metamorphosed sedimentary rock, and host tin ores. Their magmas are water-rich, and they readily solidify as the water outgasses from the magma at lower pressure, so they less commonly make it to the surface than magmas of I-type granites, which are thus more common as volcanic rock (rhyolite). They are also orogenic but range from metaluminous to strongly peraluminous.\nAlthough both I- and S-type granites are orogenic, I-type granites are more common close to the convergent boundary than S-type. This is attributed to thicker crust further from the boundary, which results in more crustal melting.\nA-type granites show a peculiar mineralogy and geochemistry, with particularly high silicon and potassium at the expense of calcium and magnesium and a high content of high field strength cations (cations with a small radius and high electrical charge, such as zirconium, niobium, tantalum, and rare earth elements.) They are not orogenic, forming instead over hot spots and continental rifting, and are metaluminous to mildly peralkaline and iron-rich. These granites are produced by partial melting of refractory lithology such as granulites in the lower continental crust at high thermal gradients. This leads to significant extraction of hydrous felsic melts from granulite-facies resitites. A-type granites occur in the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica. The rhyolites of the Yellowstone Caldera are examples of volcanic equivalents of A-type granite.\nM-type granite was later proposed to cover those granites that were clearly sourced from crystallized mafic magmas, generally sourced from the mantle. Although the fractional crystallisation of basaltic melts can yield small amounts of granites, which are sometimes found in island arcs, such granites must occur together with large amounts of basaltic rocks.\nH-type granites were suggested for hybrid granites, which were hypothesized to form by mixing between mafic and felsic from different sources, such as M-type and S-type. However, the big difference in rheology between mafic and felsic magmas makes this process problematic in nature.\nGranitization.\nGranitization is an old, and largely discounted, hypothesis that granite is formed in place through extreme metasomatism. The idea behind granitization was that fluids would supposedly bring in elements such as potassium, and remove others, such as calcium, to transform a metamorphic rock into granite. This was supposed to occur across a migrating front. However, experimental work had established by the 1960s that granites were of igneous origin. The mineralogical and chemical features of granite can be explained only by crystal-liquid phase relations, showing that there must have been at least enough melting to mobilize the magma.\nHowever, at sufficiently deep crustal levels, the distinction between metamorphism and crustal melting itself becomes vague. Conditions for crystallization of liquid magma are close enough to those of high-grade metamorphism that the rocks often bear a close resemblance. Under these conditions, granitic melts can be produced in place through the partial melting of metamorphic rocks by extracting melt-mobile elements such as potassium and silicon into the melts but leaving others such as calcium and iron in granulite residues. This may be the origin of \"migmatites\". A migmatite consists of dark, refractory rock (the \"melanosome\") that is permeated by sheets and channels of light granitic rock (the \"leucosome\"). The leucosome is interpreted as partial melt of a parent rock that has begun to separate from the remaining solid residue (the melanosome). If enough partial melt is produced, it will separate from the source rock, become more highly evolved through fractional crystallization during its ascent toward the surface, and become the magmatic parent of granitic rock. The residue of the source rock becomes a granulite.\nThe partial melting of solid rocks requires high temperatures and the addition of water or other volatiles which lower the solidus temperature (temperature at which partial melting commences) of these rocks. It was long debated whether crustal thickening in orogens (mountain belts along convergent boundaries) was sufficient to produce granite melts by radiogenic heating, but recent work suggests that this is not a viable mechanism. In-situ granitization requires heating by the asthenospheric mantle or by underplating with mantle-derived magmas.\nAscent and emplacement.\nGranite magmas have a density of 2.4 Mg/m3, much less than the 2.8 Mg/m3 of high-grade metamorphic rock. This gives them tremendous buoyancy, so that ascent of the magma is inevitable once enough magma has accumulated. However, the question of precisely how such large quantities of magma are able to shove aside country rock to make room for themselves (the \"room problem\") is still a matter of research.\nTwo main mechanisms are thought to be important:\nOf these two mechanisms, Stokes diapirism has been favoured for many years in the absence of a reasonable alternative. The basic idea is that magma will rise through the crust as a single mass through buoyancy. As it rises, it heats the wall rocks, causing them to behave as a power-law fluid and thus flow around the intrusion allowing it to pass without major heat loss. This is entirely feasible in the warm, ductile lower crust where rocks are easily deformed, but runs into problems in the upper crust which is far colder and more brittle. Rocks there do not deform so easily: for magma to rise as a diapir it would expend far too much energy in heating wall rocks, thus cooling and solidifying before reaching higher levels within the crust.\nFracture propagation is the mechanism preferred by many geologists as it largely eliminates the major problems of moving a huge mass of magma through cold brittle crust. Magma rises instead in small channels along self-propagating dykes which form along new or pre-existing fracture or fault systems and networks of active shear zones. As these narrow conduits open, the first magma to enter solidifies and provides a form of insulation for later magma.\nThese mechanisms can operate in tandem. For example, diapirs may continue to rise through the brittle upper crust through stoping, where the granite cracks the roof rocks, removing blocks of the overlying crust which then sink to the bottom of the diapir while the magma rises to take their place. This can occur as piecemeal stopping (stoping of small blocks of chamber roof), as cauldron subsidence (collapse of large blocks of chamber roof), or as roof foundering (complete collapse of the roof of a shallow magma chamber accompanied by a caldera eruption.) There is evidence for cauldron subsidence at the Mt. Ascutney intrusion in eastern Vermont. Evidence for piecemeal stoping is found in intrusions that are rimmed with \"igneous breccia\" containing fragments of country rock.\nAssimilation is another mechanism of ascent, where the granite melts its way up into the crust and removes overlying material in this way. This is limited by the amount of thermal energy available, which must be replenished by crystallization of higher-melting minerals in the magma. Thus, the magma is melting crustal rock at its roof while simultaneously crystallizing at its base. This results in steady contamination with crustal material as the magma rises. This may not be evident in the major and minor element chemistry, since the minerals most likely to crystallize at the base of the chamber are the same ones that would crystallize anyway, but crustal assimilation is detectable in isotope ratios. Heat loss to the country rock means that ascent by assimilation is limited to distance similar to the height of the magma chamber.\nWeathering.\nPhysical weathering occurs on a large scale in the form of exfoliation joints, which are the result of granite's expanding and fracturing as pressure is relieved when overlying material is removed by erosion or other processes.\nChemical weathering of granite occurs when dilute carbonic acid, and other acids present in rain and soil waters, alter feldspar in a process called hydrolysis. As demonstrated in the following reaction, this causes potassium feldspar to form kaolinite, with potassium ions, bicarbonate, and silica in solution as byproducts. An end product of granite weathering is grus, which is often made up of coarse-grained fragments of disintegrated granite.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;2 KAlSi3O8 + 2 H2CO3 + 9 H2O \u2192 Al2Si2O5(OH)4 + 4 H4SiO4 + 2 K+ + 2 HCO3\u2212\nClimatic variations also influence the weathering rate of granites. For about two thousand years, the relief engravings on Cleopatra's Needle obelisk had survived the arid conditions of its origin before its transfer to London. Within two hundred years, the red granite has drastically deteriorated in the damp and polluted air there.\nSoil development on granite reflects the rock's high quartz content and dearth of available bases, with the base-poor status predisposing the soil to acidification and podzolization in cool humid climates as the weather-resistant quartz yields much sand. Feldspars also weather slowly in cool climes, allowing sand to dominate the fine-earth fraction. In warm humid regions, the weathering of feldspar as described above is accelerated so as to allow a much higher proportion of clay with the Cecil soil series a prime example of the consequent Ultisol great soil group.\nFires can also contribute to the weathering of granite. The high temperatures reached during a fire\u2014often exceeding 1000\u00a0\u00b0C\u2014can cause significant physical and chemical processes that alter the rock. Among the physical processes, the differential thermal expansion of individual mineral grains, the anisotropic expansion of certain minerals, and polymorphic transformations, such as the alpha-beta quartz transition, induce substantial volume changes and generate internal stresses that damage the granite. Additionally, the decomposition of certain granite constituents, such as phyllosilicates, at specific temperatures further contributes to granite degradation. As a result, granite becomes micro-fractured, its total porosity increases, and its mechanical strength is significantly reduced.\nNatural radiation.\nGranite is a natural source of radiation, like most natural stones. Potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope of weak emission, and a constituent of alkali feldspar, which in turn is a common component of granitic rocks, more abundant in alkali feldspar granite and syenites. Some granites contain around 10 to 20 parts per million (ppm) of uranium. By contrast, more mafic rocks, such as tonalite, gabbro and diorite, have 1 to 5 ppm uranium, and limestones and sedimentary rocks usually have equally low amounts.\nMany large granite plutons are sources for palaeochannel-hosted or roll front uranium ore deposits, where the uranium washes into the sediments from the granite uplands and associated, often highly radioactive pegmatites.\nCellars and basements built into soils over granite can become a trap for radon gas, which is formed by the decay of uranium. Radon gas poses significant health concerns and is the number two cause of lung cancer in the US behind smoking.\nThorium occurs in all granites. Conway granite has been noted for its relatively high thorium concentration of 56\u00b16 ppm.\nThere is some concern that some granite sold as countertops or building material may be hazardous to health. Dan Steck of St. Johns University has stated that approximately 5% of all granite is of concern, with the caveat that only a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of granite slab types have been tested. Resources from national geological survey organizations are accessible online to assist in assessing the risk factors in granite country and design rules relating, in particular, to preventing accumulation of radon gas in enclosed basements and dwellings.\nA study of granite countertops was done (initiated and paid for by the Marble Institute of America) in November 2008 by National Health and Engineering Inc. of USA. In this test, all of the 39 full-size granite slabs that were measured for the study showed radiation levels well below the European Union safety standards (section 4.1.1.1 of the National Health and Engineering study) and radon emission levels well below the average outdoor radon concentrations in the US.\nIndustry and uses.\nGranite and related marble industries are considered one of the oldest industries in the world, existing as far back as Ancient Egypt. Major modern exporters of granite include China, India, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Spain and the United States.\nAntiquity.\nThe Red Pyramid of Egypt (c.\u20092590 BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed limestone surfaces, is the third largest of Egyptian pyramids. Pyramid of Menkaure, likely dating 2510 BC, was constructed of limestone and granite blocks. The Great Pyramid of Giza (c. 2580 BC) contains a granite sarcophagus fashioned of \"Red Aswan Granite\". The mostly ruined Black Pyramid dating from the reign of Amenemhat III once had a polished granite pyramidion or capstone, which is now on display in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (see Dahshur). Other uses in Ancient Egypt include columns, door lintels, sills, jambs, and wall and floor veneer. How the Egyptians worked the solid granite is still a matter of debate. Tool marks described by the Egyptologist Anna Serotta indicate the use of flint tools on finer work with harder stones, e.g. when producing the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Patrick Hunt has postulated that the Egyptians used emery, which has greater hardness.\nThe Seokguram Grotto in Korea is a Buddhist shrine and part of the Bulguksa temple complex. Completed in 774 AD, it is an artificial grotto constructed entirely of granite. The main Buddha of the grotto is a highly regarded piece of Buddhist art, and along with the temple complex to which it belongs, Seokguram was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995.\nRajaraja Chola I of the Chola Dynasty in South India built the world's first temple entirely of granite in the 11th century AD in Tanjore, India. The Brihadeeswarar Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva was built in 1010. The massive Gopuram (ornate, upper section of shrine) is believed to have a mass of around 81 tonnes. It was the tallest temple in south India.\nImperial Roman granite was quarried mainly in Egypt, and also in Turkey, and on the islands of Elba and Giglio. Granite became \"an integral part of the Roman language of monumental architecture\". The quarrying ceased around the third century AD. Beginning in Late Antiquity the granite was reused, which since at least the early 16th century became known as spolia. Through the process of case-hardening, granite becomes harder with age. The technology required to make tempered metal chisels was largely forgotten during the Middle Ages. As a result, Medieval stoneworkers were forced to use saws or emery to shorten ancient columns or hack them into discs. Giorgio Vasari noted in the 16th century that granite in quarries was \"far softer and easier to work than after it has lain exposed\" while ancient columns, because of their \"hardness and solidity have nothing to fear from fire or sword, and time itself, that drives everything to ruin, not only has not destroyed them but has not even altered their colour.\"\nModern.\nSculpture and memorials.\nIn some areas, granite is used for gravestones and memorials. Granite is a hard stone and requires skill to carve by hand. Until the early 18th century, in the Western world, granite could be carved only by hand tools with generally poor results.\nA key breakthrough was the invention of steam-powered cutting and dressing tools by Alexander MacDonald of Aberdeen, inspired by seeing ancient Egyptian granite carvings. In 1832, the first polished tombstone of Aberdeen granite to be erected in an English cemetery was installed at Kensal Green Cemetery. It caused a sensation in the London monumental trade and for some years all polished granite ordered came from MacDonald's. As a result of the work of sculptor William Leslie, and later Sidney Field, granite memorials became a major status symbol in Victorian Britain. The royal sarcophagus at Frogmore was probably the pinnacle of its work, and at 30 tons one of the largest. It was not until the 1880s that rival machinery and works could compete with the MacDonald works.\nModern methods of carving include using computer-controlled rotary bits and sandblasting over a rubber stencil. Leaving the letters, numbers, and emblems exposed and the remainder of the stone covered with rubber, the blaster can create virtually any kind of artwork or epitaph.\nThe stone known as \"black granite\" is usually gabbro, which has a completely different chemical composition.\nBuildings.\nGranite has been extensively used as a dimension stone and as flooring tiles in public and commercial buildings and monuments. Aberdeen in Scotland, which is constructed principally from local granite, is known as \"The Granite City\". Because of its abundance in New England, granite was commonly used to build foundations for homes there. The Granite Railway, America's first railroad, was built to haul granite from the quarries in Quincy, Massachusetts, to the Neponset River in the 1820s.\nEngineering.\nEngineers have traditionally used polished granite surface plates to establish a plane of reference, since they are relatively impervious, inflexible, and maintain good dimensional stability. Sandblasted concrete with a heavy aggregate content has an appearance similar to rough granite, and is often used as a substitute when use of real granite is impractical. Granite tables are used extensively as bases or even as the entire structural body of optical instruments, CMMs, and very high precision CNC machines because of granite's rigidity, high dimensional stability, and excellent vibration characteristics. A most unusual use of granite was as the material of the tracks of the Haytor Granite Tramway, Devon, England, in 1820. Granite block is usually processed into slabs, which can be cut and shaped by a cutting center. In military engineering, Finland planted granite boulders along its Mannerheim Line to block invasion by Russian tanks in the Winter War of 1939\u201340.\nPaving.\nGranite is used as a pavement material. This is because it is extremely durable, permeable and requires little maintenance. For example, in Sydney, Australia black granite stone is used for the paving and kerbs throughout the Central Business District. Granite can be crushed using industrial equipment such as VSI or cone crusher.\nCurling stones.\nCurling stones are traditionally fashioned of Ailsa Craig granite. The first stones were made in the 1750s, the original source being Ailsa Craig in Scotland. Because of the rarity of this granite, the best stones can cost as much as US$1,500. Between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from Ailsa Craig granite. Although the island is now a wildlife reserve, it is still quarried under license for Ailsa granite by Kays of Scotland for curling stones.\nCountertops.\nIn the United States, granite is a popular choice for countertops due to its affordability, aesthetic appeal, and convenience.\nRock climbing.\nGranite is one of the rocks most prized by climbers, for its steepness, soundness, crack systems, and friction. Well-known venues for granite climbing include the Yosemite Valley, the Bugaboos, the Mont Blanc massif (and peaks such as the Aiguille du Dru, the Mourne Mountains, the Adamello-Presanella Alps, the Aiguille du Midi and the Grandes Jorasses), the Bregaglia, Corsica, parts of the Karakoram (especially the Trango Towers), the Fitzroy Massif and the Paine Massif in Patagonia, Baffin Island, Ogawayama, the Cornish coast, the Cairngorms, Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the Stawamus Chief, British Columbia, Canada.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The GCC was the largest industry group active in climate policy and the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations. The GCC was involved in opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, and played a role in blocking ratification by the United States. The coalition knew it could not deny the scientific consensus, but sought to sow doubt over the scientific consensus on climate change and create manufactured controversy. \nThe Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was formed in 1989 as a project under the auspices of the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to represent the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming and to challenge the science behind global warming.\nThe GCC was dissolved in 2001 after membership declined in the face of improved understanding of the role of greenhouse gases in climate change and of public criticism. It declared that its primary objective had been achieved: U.S. President George W. Bush withdrew the U.S., which alone accounted for nearly a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, from the Kyoto Protocol process through the Senate voting to not ratify the treaty. Thus, this rendered mandatory global reductions unreachable.\nFounding.\nThe Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was formed in 1989 as a project under the auspices of the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to represent the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the science behind global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.\nAccording to GCC's mission statement on the home page of its website, GCC was established: \"to coordinate business participation in the international policy debate on the issue of global climate change and global warming,\" and GCC's executive director in a 1993 press release said GCC was organized \"as the leading voice for industry on the global climate change issue.\"\nGCC reorganized independently in 1992, with the first chairman of the board of directors being the director of government relations for the Phillips Petroleum Company. Exxon, later ExxonMobil, was a founding member, and a founding member of the GCC's board of directors; the energy giant also had a leadership role in coalition. The American Petroleum Institute (API) was a leading member of the coalition. API's executive vice president was a chairman of the coalition's board of directors. Other GCC founding members included the National Coal Association, United States Chamber of Commerce, American Forest &amp; Paper Association, and Edison Electric Institute. GCC's executive director John Shlaes was previously the director of government relations at the Edison Electric Institute. GCC was run by Ruder Finn, a public relations firm. GCC's comprehensive PR campaign was designed by E. Bruce Harrison, who had been creating campaigns for the US industry against environmental legislation from the 1970s.\nGCC was the largest industry group active in climate policy. About 40 companies and industry associations were GCC members. Considering member corporations, member trade associations, and business represented by member trade associations, GCC represented over 230,000 businesses. Industry sectors represented included: aluminium, paper, transportation, power generation, petroleum, chemical, and small businesses. All major oil companies were members until 1996 (Shell left in 1998). GCC members were from industries that would have been adversely effected by limitations on fossil fuel consumption. GCC was funded by membership dues.\nAdvocacy activities.\nGCC was one of the most powerful lobbyist groups against action to mitigate global warming. It was the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations, and led a campaign opposed to policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The GCC was one of the most powerful non-governmental organizations representing business interests in climate policy, according to Kal Raustiala, professor at the UCLA School of Law.\nGCC's advocacy activities included lobbying government officials, grassroots lobbying through press releases and advertising, participation in international climate conferences, criticism of the processes of international climate organizations, critiques of climate models, and personal attacks on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of anthropogenic climate change, emphasizing the uncertainty in climatology, advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of climate change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national sovereignty, and opposition to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.\nGCC sent delegations to all of the major international climate conventions. Only nations and non-profits may send official delegates to the United Nations Climate Change conferences. GCC registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a non-governmental organization, and executives from GCC members attended official UN conferences as GCC delegates.\nIn 1990, after US president, George H. W. Bush, addressed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) urging caution in responding to global warming, and offering no new proposals, GCC said Bush's speech was \"very strong\" and concurred with the priorities of economic development and additional research. GCC sent 30 attendees to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where it lobbied to keep targets and timetables out of the Framework Convention on Climate Change. In December, 1992 GCC's executive director wrote in a letter to \"The New York Times\": \"...there is considerable debate on whether or not man-made greenhouse gases (produced primarily by burning fossil fuels) are triggering a dangerous 'global warming' trend.\" In 1992 GCC distributed a half-hour video entitled \"The Greening of Planet Earth\", to hundreds of journalists, the White House, and several Middle Eastern oil-producing countries, which suggested that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide could boost crop yields and solve world hunger.\nIn 1993, after then US president Bill Clinton pledged \"to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000,\" GCC's executive director said it \"could jeopardize the economic health of the nation.\" GCC's lobbying was key to the defeat in the United States Senate of Clinton's 1993 BTU tax proposal. In 1994, after United States Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary said the 1992 UNFCCC needed to be strengthened, and that voluntary carbon dioxide reductions may not be enough, GCC said it was: \"disturbed by the implication that the President's voluntary climate action plan, which is just getting under way, will be inadequate and that more stringent measures may be needed domestically.\"\nGCC did not fund original scientific research and its climate claims relied largely on the \"World Climate Review\" and its successor the \"World Climate Report\" edited by Patrick Michaels and funded by the Western Fuels Association. GCC promoted the views of climate deniers such as Michaels, Fred Singer, and Richard Lindzen. In 1996, GCC published a report entitled \"Global warming and extreme weather: fact vs. fiction\" written by Robert E. Davis.\nGCC members questioned the efficacy of climate change denial and shifted their message to highlighting the economic costs of proposed greenhouse gas emission regulations and the limited effectiveness of proposals exempting developing nations. In 1995, after the United Nations Climate Change conference in Berlin agreed to negotiate greenhouse gas emission limits, GCC's executive director said the agreement gave \"developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride\" and would \"change the relations between sovereign countries and the United Nations. This could have very significant implications. It could be a way of capping our economy.\" At a Washington, D.C. press conference on the eve of the second United Nations Climate Change conference in Geneva, GCC's executive director said, \"The time for decision is not yet now.\" At the conference in Geneva, GCC issued a statement that said it was too early to determine the causes of global warming. GCC representatives lobbied scientists at the September, 1996 IPCC conference in Mexico City.\nAfter actor Leonardo DiCaprio, chairman of Earth Day 2000, interviewed Clinton for ABC News, GCC sent out an e-mail that said that DiCaprio's first car was a Jeep Grand Cherokee and that his current car was a Chevrolet Tahoe.\n\"Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer\".\nIn 1995, GCC assembled an advisory committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled \"Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer\", which said: \"The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.\" In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California's efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", the primer demonstrated that \"even as the coalition worked to sway opinion, its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted.\" According to the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2015, the primer was: \"remarkable for indisputably showing that, while some fossil fuel companies' deception about climate science has continued to the present day, at least two decades ago the companies' own scientific experts were internally alerting them about the realities and implications of climate change.\"\nIPCC Second Assessment Report.\nGCC was an industry participant in the review process of the IPCC Second Assessment Report. In 1996, prior to the publication of the Second Assessment Report, GCC distributed a report entitled \"The IPCC: Institutionalized Scientific Cleansing\" to reporters, US Congressmen, and scientists. The coalition report said that Benjamin D. Santer, the lead author of Chapter 8 in the assessment, entitled \"Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes,\" had altered the text, after acceptance by the Working Group, and without approval of the authors, to strike content characterizing the uncertainty of the science. Frederick Seitz repeated GCC's charges in a letter to \"The Wall Street Journal\" published June 12, 1996. The coalition ran newspaper advertisements that said: \"unless the management of the IPCC promptly undertakes to republish the printed versions ... the IPCC's credibility will have been lost.\"\nSanter and his co-authors said the edits were integrations of comments from peer review as per agreed IPCC processes.\nOpposition to Kyoto Protocol.\nGCC was the main industry group in the United States opposed to the Kyoto Protocol, which committed signatories to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The coalition \"was the leading industry group working in opposition to the Kyoto Protocol,\" according to Greenpeace, and led opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, according to the \"Los Angeles Times.\"\nPrior to 1997, GCC spent about $1 million annually lobbying against limits on CO2 emissions; before Kyoto, GCC annual revenue peaked around $1.5 million; GCC spent $13 million on advertising in opposition to the Kyoto treaty. The coalition funded the Global Climate Information Project and hired the advertising firm that produced the 1993\u20131994 Harry and Louise advertising campaign which opposed Clinton's health care initiative. The advertisements said, \"the UN Climate Treaty isn't Global...and it won't work\" and \"Americans will pay the price...50 cents more for every gallon of gasoline.\"\nGCC opposed the signing of the Kyoto Protocol by Clinton. GCC was influential in the withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol by the administration of President George W. Bush. According to briefing notes prepared by the United States Department of State for the under-secretary of state, Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol was \"in part based on input from\" GCC. GCC lobbying was key to the July, 1997 unanimous passage in the United States Senate of the Byrd\u2013Hagel Resolution, which reflected the coalition's position that restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions must include developing countries. GCC's chairman told a US congressional committee that mandatory greenhouse gas emissions limits were: \"an unjustified rush to judgement.\" The coalition sent 50 delegates to the third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Kyoto. On December 11, 1997, the day the Kyoto delegates reached agreement on legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions, GCC's chairman said the agreement would be defeated by the US Senate. In 2001, GCC's executive director compared the Kyoto Protocol to the \"RMS Titanic\".\nMembership decline.\nGCC's challenge to science prompted a backlash from environmental groups. Environmentalists described GCC as a \"club for polluters\" and called for members to withdraw their support. \"Abandonment of the Global Climate Coalition by leading companies is partly in response to the mounting evidence that the world is indeed getting warmer,\" according to environmentalist Lester R. Brown. In 1998, Green Party delegates to the European Parliament introduced an unsuccessful proposal that the World Meteorological Organization name hurricanes after GCC members. Defections weakened the coalition. In 1996, British Petroleum resigned and later announced support for the Kyoto Protocol and commitment to greenhouse gas emission reductions. In 1997, Royal Dutch Shell withdrew after criticism from European environmental groups. In 1999, Ford Motor Company was the first US company to withdraw; the \"New York Times\" described the departure as \"the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming.\" DuPont left the coalition in 1997 and Shell USA (then known as Shell Oil Company) left in 1998. In 2000, GCC corporate members were the targets of a national student-run university divestiture campaign. Between December, 1999 and early March, 2000, Texaco, the Southern Company, General Motors and Daimler-Chrysler withdrew. Some former coalition members joined the Business Environmental Leadership Council within the Pew Center on Global Climate Change which represented diverse stakeholders, including business interests, with a commitment to peer-reviewed scientific research and accepted the need for emissions restrictions to address climate change.\nIn 2000, GCC restructured as an association of trade associations; membership was limited to trade associations, and individual corporations were represented through their trade association. Brown called the restructuring \"a thinly veiled effort to conceal the real issue \u2013 the loss of so many key corporate members.\"\nDissolution.\nAfter US President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the Kyoto process in 2001, GCC disbanded. Absent the participation of the US, the effectiveness of the Kyoto process was limited. GCC said on its website that its mission had been successfully achieved, writing \"At this point, both Congress and the Administration agree that the U.S. should not accept the mandatory cuts in emissions required by the protocol.\" Networks of well-funded industry lobbyists and other climate change denial groups continue its work.\nReception.\nIn 2015, the Union of Concerned Scientists compared GCC's role in the public policy debate on climate change to the roles in the public policy debate on tobacco safety of the Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry's lobbyist group, and the Council for Tobacco Research, which promoted misleading science. Environmentalist Bill McKibben said that, by promoting doubt about the science, \"throughout the 1990s, even as other nations took action, the fossil fuel industry's Global Climate Coalition managed to make American journalists treat the accelerating warming as a he-said-she-said story.\" According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", GCC members integrated projections from climate models into their operational planning while publicly criticising the models.\nFormer Vice President Al Gore described the oil companies' blocking campaign as \"the most serious crime of the post-World War Two era\".\nMembers.\nMembership notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is best known as the home of the superhero Batman and his allies and foes. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, the city was first identified as Batman's place of residence in \"Batman\" #4 (December 1940) and has since been the primary setting for stories featuring the character. In most of its incarnations, Gotham is depicted as one of the most crime-ridden cities in the world.\nGotham City is traditionally depicted as being located in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Gotham's look and atmosphere were primarily influenced by New York City, but over the years have drawn inspiration from Chicago and London as well. Architect Hugh Ferriss' designs also influenced the look and emotional feel of Gotham City, particularly in its later depictions. Bill Finger said that he chose the name \"Gotham\", and not New York, so that all readers in any city could identify with it.\nLocations used as inspiration or filming locations for Gotham City in the live-action \"Batman\" films and television series have included St. Louis, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, London, Glasgow, Hong Kong, Detroit, and Liverpool.\nOrigin of name.\nIn Jim Steranko's \"History of the Comics\", writer Bill Finger, on the naming of the city, said, \"Originally I was going to call Gotham City 'Civic City.' Then I tried 'Capital City,' then 'Coast City.' Then I flipped through the New York City phone book and spotted the name 'Gotham Jewelers' and said, 'That's it,' Gotham City. We didn't call it New York because we wanted anybody in any city to identify with it.\"\n\"Gotham\" has been a nickname for New York City that first became popular in the 19th century; Washington Irving had first attached it to New York in the November 11, 1807, edition of his \"Salmagundi\", a periodical which lampooned New York culture and politics. Irving took the name from the English village of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, which was known for the Wise Men of Gotham story, a legendary incident where the village's residents feigned idiocy to prevent a royal visit from John, King of England.\nGeography.\nGotham City, like other cities in the DC Universe, has varied in its portrayals over the decades, but the city's location is traditionally depicted as being in the state of New Jersey. Gotham and Metropolis are sometimes portrayed as twin cities on opposite sides of the Delaware Bay, with Gotham in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware. \nHistory.\nGotham City was founded in 1635 by Jon Logerquist, a Norwegian mercenary, before subsequently being taken over by the English; this parallels the history of New York City, which was founded by the Dutch as New Amsterdam before being conquered by England and renamed New York. During the American Revolutionary War, Gotham City was the site of a major battle between American and British forces (paralleling the real-life Battle of Long Island). This was detailed in Rick Veitch's \"Swamp Thing\" #85 featuring Tomahawk. Rumors held it to be the site of various occult rites.\nThe 2011 comic book series ' details a history of Gotham City in which Alan Wayne (Bruce Wayne's ancestor), Theodore Cobblepot (Oswald Cobblepot's ancestor), and Edward Elliot (Thomas Elliot's ancestor) are considered the founding fathers of Gotham. In 1881, they constructed three bridges called the Gates of Gotham, each bearing one of their last names. Edward Elliot became increasingly jealous of the Wayne family's popularity and wealth during this period, jealousy that would spread to his great-great-grandson, Thomas Elliot or Hush.\nThe occult origins of Gotham are further delved into by Peter Milligan's 1990 story arc \"Dark Knight, Dark City\", which reveals that some of the Founding Fathers of the United States are involved in summoning a bat-demon which becomes trapped beneath old \"Gotham Town\", its dark influence spreading as Gotham City evolves. A similar trend is followed in 2005's \"Shadowpact\" #5 by Bill Willingham, which expands upon Gotham's occult heritage by revealing a being who has slept for 40,000 years beneath the land upon which Gotham City was built. Strega, the being's servant, says that the \"dark and often cursed character\" of the city was influenced by the being who now uses the name \"Doctor Gotham\". In \"Gotham Underground\" #2 by Frank Tieri, Tobias Whale claims that 19th century Gotham was run by five rival gangs, until the first \"masks\" appeared, eventually forming a gang of their own. It is not clear whether these were vigilantes or costumed criminals.\nMany storylines have added more events to Gotham's history, at the same time greatly affecting the city and its people. Perhaps the greatest in effect was a long set of serial storylines, which started with Ra's al Ghul releasing a debilitating virus called the \"Clench\" during the \" storyline. As that arc concluded, the city was beginning to recover, only to suffer an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale in the 1998 \" storyline. This resulted in the federal government cutting Gotham off from the rest of the United States in the 1999 storyline \"No Man's Land\", the city's remaining residents forced to engage in gang warfare, either as active participants or paying for protection from groups ranging from the GCPD to the Penguin, just to stay alive. Eventually, Gotham was rebuilt and returned to the U.S. as part of a campaign mounted by Lex Luthor, who used the positive publicity of his role to make a successful bid for the position of President of the United States. Suggestions of other Gotham City histories include a founding date of 1820 seen in a city seal in \"\", and a 200th anniversary of the city being celebrated in Tim Burton's Batman, either of which would make Maine the most likely state to contain Gotham City.\nCulture.\n\"Batman\" writer and editor Dennis O'Neil has said that, figuratively, Batman's Gotham City is akin to \"Manhattan below 14th Street at eleven minutes past midnight on the coldest night in November\". Batman artist Neal Adams has long believed that Chicago has been the basis for Gotham, stating \"one of the things about Chicago is Chicago has alleys (which are virtually nonexistent in New York). Back alleys, that's where Batman fights all the bad guys.\" The statement \"Metropolis is New York by day; Gotham City is New York by night\" has been variously attributed to comics creators Frank Miller and John Byrne.\nIn designing \"\", creators Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski emulated the Tim Burton films' \"otherworldly timelessness\", incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police airships (although no such thing existed, Timm has stated that he found it to fit the show's style), and a \"vintage\" color scheme with film noir flourishes. Police airships have since been incorporated into Batman comic books and are a recurring element in Gotham City.\nConcerning the evolution of Gotham throughout the years, former \"Batman\" editor Paul Levitz has stated, \"Each guy adds their own vision. That's the fun of comics, rebuilding a city each time\".\nArchitecture.\nIn \"\", Gotham Cathedral plays a central role in the story since it is built by Mr. Whisper, the story's antagonist.\nIn a 1992 storyline, a man obsessed with Pinkney's architecture destroys several Gotham buildings to reveal the Pinkney structures they had hidden; the editorial purpose behind this was to make Gotham resemble its depiction in the 1989 \"Batman\" film.\n\"Batman Begins\" features a CGI-augmented version of Chicago while \"The Dark Knight\" more directly features Chicago infrastructure and architecture such as Navy Pier. \"The Dark Knight Rises\" forgoes Chicago, instead shooting in Pittsburgh; Los Angeles; New York City; Newark, New Jersey; London; and Glasgow.\nNotable residents.\nOver the years, in various Batman-related titles in the chronological DC Comics continuity, the Caped Crusader enlists the help of numerous characters, the first being his trusty sidekick, Robin. Although a singular title, many have donned the mantle over the years. The first was Nightwing, then came Red Hood, Red Robin, Spoiler and finally Batman's son Damian Wayne. In addition to the Robins or former Robins, there is Catwoman, Batgirl (Barbara Gordon), Batgirl (Cassandra Cain), Signal, Batwing, Batwoman, and Huntress.\nOther DC characters have also been depicted living in Gotham, including the hitman Tommy Monaghan; Jason Blood, the host of the demon Etrigan; the Green Lantern Alan Scott; the original Spectre (Jim Corrigan); Black Canary; Starman; and the Grey Ghost.\nDC's 2011 reboot of \"All Star Western\" takes place in an Old West-styled Gotham. Jonah Hex and Amadeus Arkham are among this version of Gotham's inhabitants.\nApart from Gotham's superhero residents, the residents of the city feature in a back-up series in \"Detective Comics\" called \"Tales of Gotham City\" and in two limited series called \"Gotham Nights\". Additionally, the Gotham City Police Department is the focus of the series \"Gotham Central\", as well as the mini-series \"Gordon's Law\", \"Bullock's Law\", and \"\".\nMayors.\nThe first Gotham mayor depicted in comics was in \"Detective Comics\" #68 (October 1942). Theodore Cobblepot, great-grandfather of the Penguin, was mayor in the late 19th century. An unnamed mayor encountered the Court of Owls in 1914 and was killed by them. Archibald Brewster was mayor during the Great Depression. Mayor Thorndike was killed by the Made of Wood killer in 1948. Mayor Aubrey James was a contemporary of Thomas Wayne who was stabbed to death. Mayor Jessop was in office shortly after the Wayne murders. A man named Falcone was purportedly mayor during the earliest days of Batman's career. Shortly after, Mayor Wilson Klass directed the GCPD to turn a blind eye to Batman's activities after Batman saved his daughter. Hamilton Hill was in office when the Joker debuted, and a man named Gill was mayor early in Batman's career, as was former police commissioner Grogan. An unnamed bald mayor was killed by a villain known as Midnight. Men named Carfax, Bradley Stokes, Sheppard, Taylor, and Hayes all served as mayor. Mayor Charles Chesterfield was killed by a sentient fat-eating blob of grease.\nHamilton Hill became mayor through the backing of crime boss Rupert Thorne but was ultimately ousted from office and replaced by George P. Skowcroft. An unnamed mayor is killed by Deacon Blackfire's followers and replaced by Donald Webster. Mayor Julius Lieberman is killed by a Predator. Mayor Goode served briefly before being replaced by an African American man. Armand Krol became mayor and died of the Clench virus after leaving office. A woman, Marion Grange, became mayor with the backing of Bruce Wayne but was assassinated in Washington, D.C., while trying to secure federal aid for Gotham after an earthquake. In the wake of , Daniel Danforth Dickerson III served as mayor only to be killed by a sniper, after which he was replaced by David Hull. Seamus McGreevy served as mayor in the midst of a criminal conspiracy known as \"The Body\". An unnamed woman was mayor when Batman returned to Gotham a year after \"Infinite Crisis\". Sebastian Hady was a corrupt mayor who was eventually killed by the League of Shadows. Councilwoman Muir served as interim mayor when the city was in the grip of a virus that only affected men. Michael Akins, former commissioner of police, was appointed mayor, and later replaced by a man named Atkins. In the wake of Bane's takeover of the city, a man named Dunch served as mayor, and in the aftermath of the Joker War, anti-vigilante mayoral candidate Christopher Nakano wins election in a landslide.\nIn other media.\nTelevision.\nIn multiple episodes of the 1960s live-action \"Batman\" television series, Batman is seen consulting a transparent map of Gotham, which is an inverted map of St. Louis.\nThe live-action TV series \"Gotham\" was filmed in New York City and was an important requirement of the show's creative team. According to executive producer Danny Cannon, its atmosphere was inspired by the look of New York in the 1970s films of Sidney Lumet and William Friedkin. Clues to this include signs showing phone numbers bearing the area code 212. Donal Logue, who portrayed Harvey Bullock, described different aspects of that series' design of Gotham City as exhibiting different sensibilities, explaining, \"for me, you can step into things that almost feel like the roaring 20s, and then there's this other really kind of heavy \"Blade Runner\" vibe floating around. There are elements of it that are completely contemporary and there are pieces of it that are very old-fashioned\u00a0... There were a couple of examples of modern technology, but maybe an antiquated version of it, that gave me a little bit of sense that it's certainly not the 50s and the 60s\u00a0... But it's not high tech and it's not futuristic, by any means.\"\nThe fifth episode of \"Young Justice\", entitled \"Schooled\", indicates that Gotham is located in Connecticut, near Bridgeport.\nThe 2019 series \"Batwoman\", which is set in Gotham City, was filmed in Chicago.\nThe 2024 series \"The Penguin\" is set in Gotham City.\nDC Animated Universe.\nGotham City is featured heavily in \"\". When describing Gotham City Paul Dini, a writer and director of the show, stated, \"In my mind, it was sort of like what if the 1939 World's Fair had gone on another 60 years or so\". In the episode \"Joker's Favor\", a driver's license lists a Gotham area resident's hometown as \"Gotham Estates, NY\". In the episode \"Avatar\", when Bruce Wayne leaves for England, a map shows Gotham City, at the joining of Long Island and the Hudson River. The episode \"Fire from Olympus\" shows a character's address in a police file indicating that Gotham City is located in New York state. The episode \"The Mechanic\", however, implies that Gotham resides in a state of the same name; a prison workshop is shown stamping license plates that read \"Gotham: The Dark Deco State\" (as a reference to the artistic style of the series). The episode \"Harlequinade\" states that Gotham has a population of approximately 10 million.\n\"Batman Beyond\" (1999\u20132001) envisions a Gotham City in 2039, referred to as Neo-Gotham.\nArrowverse.\nGotham City was first shown in the Arrowverse as part of \"Elseworlds\", a 2018 crossover storyline among the shows, which introduced Batwoman, although it had been referred to several times previously.\nIn \"The Flash\" episode \"Marathon\", a map shows Gotham City in place of Chicago, Illinois.\nTheme parks.\nThemed lands meant to represent Gotham City have been physically constructed in several different theme parks around the world. WB Movie World in Germany featured a Gotham City section that housed Batman Adventure \u2013 The Ride, and Six Flags Magic Mountain opened a section called the \"Gotham City Backlot\" that featured . The section featured at Magic Mountain was designed by park designer Kevin Barbee, and alongside the opening of Batman: The Ride coincided with the largest expansion the park had ever undergone in 23 years, with the theming elements primarily having been inspired by the \"Batman\" films directed by Tim Burton. Both the ride and the Gotham City Backlot opened on March 26, 1994.\nThe Magic Mountain section closed at the end of the park's 2010 season and was later rethemed and rebranded as the \"DC Universe\", featuring characters and attractions other than just Batman. It reopened in 2011.\nWarner Bros. World Abu Dhabi features a section themed after Gotham City, including rides based on Batman, the Riddler and the Scarecrow as well as a walk-through attraction called \"The Joker's Funhouse\". The park and its Gotham City section were designed by Thinkwell Group. DC characters as they appear in both the attractions themselves as well as through live performers feature costumes based on The New 52 comic book relaunch from 2011. The Gotham City section neighbors another section themed after Metropolis, home of Superman.\nFilms.\n1989 Batman series.\n\"Batman\" (1989) director Tim Burton wanted a timeless alternative to New York and described it as \"hell burst through the pavement and grew\". The look of Gotham was overseen by production designer Anton Furst, who won an Oscar for supervising the art department. Furst stated \"Batman\" was \"definitely based in many ways on the worst aspects of New York City\" and was inspired by Andreas Feininger's photographs of 1940s New York. Furst's draftsman Nigel Phelps created numerous charcoal drawings of the buildings and interior sets for the production.\nFollowing the death of Furst, Burton tapped Bo Welch to oversee production design for \"Batman Returns\" (1992). Burton wanted Welch to re-imagine Gotham, stating \"\"Batman\" didn't feel big to me \u2013 it didn't have the power an old American city has\". Welch wanted to expand on the same basic concept for the sequel but moved away from European influences to show more American Art Deco/World's Fair elements. When asked what inspired his interpretation of Gotham, Welch stated \"[H]ow can I create a visual expression of corruption and greed? That got me thinking about the fascistic architecture employed at world's fairs\u00a0... That feels corrupt because it's evocative of oppressive bureaucracies and dictatorships\u00a0... So I looked at a lot of [Third Reich] art and images from world's fairs\". To physically make the city seem darker, he designed tall \"oppressively overbuilt\" cityscape that physically blocked out light.\nWhen Joel Schumacher took over directing the \"Batman\" film series from Tim Burton, Barbara Ling handled the production design for both of Schumacher's films, \"Batman Forever\" (1995) and 1997's \"Batman &amp; Robin\". Ling's vision of Gotham City was a luminous and outlandish evocation of modern Expressionism and Constructivism. Its futuristic design, which \"Washington Post\" critic Desson Howe felt evoked the 1982 film \"Blade Runner\", were described by Ling in her book, \"Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Production Design of Batman &amp; Robin\", as a cross between 1930s Manhattan and the \"Neo-Tokyo\" of \"Akira\". Ling cited \"neon-ridden\" Tokyo and the Machine Age as her influences, describing her Gotham as \"like a World's Fair on ecstasy\". When Batman is pursuing Two-Face in \"Batman Forever\", the chase ends at Lady Gotham, the fictional equivalent of the Statue of Liberty. During Mr. Freeze's attempt to freeze Gotham in the film \"Batman &amp; Robin\", the targeting screen for his giant laser locates it somewhere on the New England shoreline, possibly as far north as Maine. The soundtrack for \"Batman &amp; Robin\" features a song named after the city and sung by R. Kelly, later included on international editions of his 1998 double album \"R.\"\nThe \"Dark Knight\" trilogy.\nDirector Christopher Nolan has stated that Chicago inspired his portrayal of Gotham, and the majority of both \"Batman Begins\" (2005) and \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) were filmed there. However, Nolan's Gotham City was deliberately set in New Jersey to honor Gotham's location in the comic books.\nFor \"Batman Begins\", Nolan desired that Gotham appear as a large, modern city that nonetheless reflects a variety of architectural styles and periods, as well as different socioeconomic strata. The production's approach depicted Gotham as an exaggeration of New York City, with elements taken from Chicago, the elevated freeways and monorails of Tokyo, and the \"walled city of Kalhoon\" [\"sic\"] in Hong Kong, which was the basis for the slum in the film known as The Narrows.\nIn \"The Dark Knight\", more Chicago and New York influences were observed. On filming in Chicago, James McAllister, key location manager stated, \"visually it's that look like you would see in the comic books\". Nolan also stated \"there's all these different boroughs, with rivers to interconnect. I think it's hard to get away from that, because Gotham is based on New York.\"\nFor \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012), the production utilized Pittsburgh; Los Angeles; New York City; Newark, New Jersey; London; Glasgow; and Toronto for shots of Gotham City.\nDC Extended Universe.\nWithin the DC Extended Universe, Gotham City is located in Gotham County, New Jersey. In \"\", paperwork mentions that the city is in Gotham County, and Amanda Waller's files on Deadshot and Harley Quinn in \"Suicide Squad\" reveal Gotham City to be located in the state of New Jersey. Zack Snyder confirmed that Metropolis and Gotham City are in geographical proximity to each other. The \"Boston Globe\" compared the proximity of Gotham City and Metropolis to Jersey City and Manhattan. A television ad for Turkish Airlines that premiered during the 2016 Super Bowl featured Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) promoting Gotham as a tourist destination.\nTo create Gotham in \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", the creative team \"decided to recreate and combine large sections of existing selected city sections and adapt the architecture and layout to fit Gotham's. Thousands of photographs were put through MPC's photogrammetry pipeline to create geometry and textures for each city section.\"\n\"Birds of Prey\", which takes place in Gotham, was shot entirely in Los Angeles. It was originally expected to be filmed in Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia, but the production received a tax credit from California, incentivizing the location change.\n\"The Batman\".\nThe 2022 Matt Reeves film \"The Batman\" delves into the criminal underbelly of Gotham City through noir-style storytelling and highlights themes of corruption rampant within the city's government and police department. The film used London, Glasgow, Liverpool, and Chicago as filming locations for Gotham City, although it was modeled on New York City. A towering skyscraper similar to the Empire State Building looms over Gotham City with an emblazoned sign that reads \"Gotham Empire\". A busy, commercial intersection called \"Gotham Square\" is seen in several shots and resembles Times Square with its bright signs and giant digital screens. The film's concluding sequence, while filmed at London's O2 Arena, is called \"Gotham Square Garden\", taking its naming convention from New York's Madison Square Garden.\n\"Joker\" (2019) and \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\" (2024).\n\"Joker\" director and producer Todd Phillips imagined Gotham as a \"version of Gotham was the pre-'80s boom New York, or urban northeastern center, but not the iconic New York\". When asked how he re-imagined the city, production designer Mark Friedberg stated, \"our version of Gotham was what groomed him. It was both an appreciation for how severe things got in the city, but also for the world of possibility that lived in the version of that city.\" The film shot on location and used landmarks in New York City; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Newark, New Jersey. In \", Gotham is explicitly stated to be in New York State.\nAnimated films.\nDuring the events of the direct-to-video film \" (1998), a computer screen displaying Barbara Gordon's personal information refers to her location as \"Gotham City, NY\", and displays her area code as 212 \u2013 a Manhattan area code.\nThe 2008 direct-to-DVD film \"\" shows Gotham as a large city with many skyscrapers and a bustling population.\nVideo games.\nGotham City appears in several video games, including \"Batman Begins\", \"DC Universe Online\", \"Gotham Knights\" and \"Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\". The city makes another appearance in a video game with \"\", where the player can fight outside or inside Wayne Manor, on top of a building and in an alley. Other games that feature the city include \"Lego Dimensions\" and Rocksteady's \"Arkham\" franchise.\nGotham City appears as a location in the 2017 video game \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" as part of a crossover in commemoration of Batman's 80th anniversary. It was the fourth incarnation of the game's iconic Tilted Towers area. Players are able to use the Batglider after falling from a great height, as long as they remain in the confines of Gotham City. The location was removed on October 13, 2019, during the game's \"The End\" live event, in which it was sucked into a Black Hole along with the rest of the \"Fortnite\" Chapter 1 Island. The assets used for Gotham City, devoid of any Batman branding, are featured in \"Fortnite Creative\" under the name \"Dark Tilted\".\nBatman: Arkham.\n' (2009) opens with Batman driving Joker from Gotham City to Arkham Asylum. Joker also threatens to detonate bombs across Gotham. In ' (2011), the slums of Old Gotham City (the northern island) were converted into Arkham City. Inside the prison walls, this part of Gotham contains various landmarks throughout the story, like Penguin's Iceberg Lounge, the Ace Chemicals Plant, the Sionis Steel Mill, the Old Gotham City Police Department building, and the Monarch Theatre with the Wayne murder scene in Crime Alley. Most of these locations have major events in the story. In ' (2013), an earlier, younger version of the city can be seen than that of other games in the \"Batman: Arkham\" series. In addition to the northern island, this installment in the series lets players explore a new southern island, connected to the former by the Pioneer's Bridge. The setting of ' (2015), Central Gotham City, is five times larger than Old Gotham. The novelization for \"Batman: Arkham Knight\" revealed that Crime Alley was renamed Wayne Way months after the \"death\" of Batman.\nReferences.\nInline citations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
