{"id": "16027", "revid": "1267919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16027", "title": "J. K. Rowling", "text": "British author (born 1965)\nJoanne Rowling ( ; born 31 July 1965), better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is the British novelist who wrote \"Harry Potter\", a seven-volume series about a young wizard. Published from 1997 to 2007, the fantasy novels are the best-selling book series in history, with over 600 million copies sold. They have been translated into 84\u00a0languages and have spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. She writes \"Cormoran Strike\", an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith.\nBorn in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the \"Harry Potter\" series. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" (2007). By 2008, \"Forbes\" had named her the world's highest-paid author.\nThe novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. There were also religious debates over the \"Harry Potter\" series.\nRowling has won many accolades for her work. She was named to the Order of the British Empire and was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. \"Harry Potter\" brought her wealth and recognition, which she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. She established the Volant Charitable Trust in 2000, and co-founded the charity Lumos in 2005. Rowling's philanthropy centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children. In 2025, \"Forbes\" estimated that Rowling's charitable giving exceeded US$200 million. She has also donated to the British Labour Party, and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit.\nFrom 2019, Rowling began making public remarks about transgender people, opposing attempts to replace the legal definition of birth sex with gender self identity. She has been condemned as transphobic by LGBTQ rights groups, some \"Harry Potter\" fans, and various other critics, including academics. This has affected her public image and relationship with readers and colleagues, altering the way they engage with her works.\nName.\nAlthough she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, before her remarriage her name was Joanne Rowling with no middle name, nicknamed Jo. Staff at Bloomsbury Publishing suggested that she use two initials rather than her full name, anticipating that young boys \u2013 their target audience \u2013 would not want to read a book written by a woman. She chose \"K\" as the second initial, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Rowling, and because of the ease of pronunciation of the two consecutive letters. Following her 2001 remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.\nLife and career.\nEarly life and family.\nJoanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, to a middle-class family. Her parents Anne (n\u00e9e Volant) and Peter (\"Pete\") James Rowling had met the previous year on a train, sharing a trip from King's Cross station, London, to their naval postings at Arbroath, Scotland. Rowling's mother was with the Wrens and her father with the Royal Navy. Her mother was of Scottish and French ancestry. Pete Rowling was the son of a machine-tool setter who later opened a grocery shop. Pete and Anne married on 14 March 1965 and settled in Yate, where Pete started work as an assembly-line production worker and eventually worked his way into management as a chartered engineer. Anne Rowling later worked as a science technician. Neither of Rowling's parents attended university. Rowling is two years older than her sister, Dianne.\nWhen she was four, Rowling's family moved to Winterbourne, Gloucestershire. She began at St Michael's Church of England Primary School in Winterbourne when she was five. The Rowlings lived near a family called Potter \u2013 a name Rowling always liked. Rowling's mother liked to read and the family's homes were filled with books. Her father read \"The Wind in the Willows\" to his daughters, while her mother introduced them to the animals in Richard Scarry's books. Rowling's first attempt at writing, a story called \"Rabbit\" composed when she was six, was inspired by Scarry's creatures.\nWhen Rowling was about nine, the family purchased the historic Church Cottage in Tutshill. In 1974, Rowling began attending the nearby Church of England School. Biographer Sean Smith describes her teacher as a \"battleaxe\" who \"struck fear into the hearts of the children\"; Rowling's teacher seated her in \"dunces' row\" after she performed poorly on an arithmetic test. In 1975, Rowling joined a Brownies pack. Its special events and parties, and the pack groups (Fairies, Pixies, Sprites, Elves, Gnomes and Imps) provided a magical world away from her stern teacher. When she was eleven or twelve, she wrote a short story, \"The Seven Cursed Diamonds\". She later described herself during this period as \"the epitome of a bookish child \u2013 short and squat, thick National Health glasses, living in a world of complete daydreams\".\nSecondary school and university.\nRowling's secondary school was Wyedean School and College, a state school she began attending at the age of eleven and where she was bullied. Rowling was inspired by her favourite teacher, Lucy Shepherd, who taught the importance of structure and precision in writing. Smith describes her as \"intelligent yet shy\". Her teacher Dale Neuschwander was impressed by her imagination. When she was a young teenager, Rowling's great-aunt gave her \"Hons and Rebels\", the autobiography of the civil rights activist Jessica Mitford, who became Rowling's heroine.\nAnne had a strong influence on her daughter. Early in Rowling's life, the support of her mother and sister instilled confidence and enthusiasm for storytelling. Anne was a creative and accomplished cook, who helped lead her daughters' Brownie activities, and took a job in the chemistry department at Wyedean while her daughters were there. John Nettleship, the head of science at Wyedean, described Anne as \"absolutely brilliant\u00a0... very imaginative\". Anne was diagnosed with a \"virulent strain\" of multiple sclerosis when she was 34 or 35 and Jo was 15. Rowling's home life was complicated by her mother's illness and a strained relationship with her father. Rowling later said \"home was a difficult place to be\", and that her teenage years were unhappy. In 2020, she wrote that her father would have preferred a son and described herself as having severe obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder in her teens. She began to smoke, took an interest in alternative rock, and adopted Siouxsie Sioux's back-combed hair and black eyeliner. Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia that provided an escape from her difficult home life and the means for Harris and Rowling to broaden their activities.\nLiving in a small town with pressures at home, Rowling became more interested in her schoolwork. Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as \"not exceptional\" but \"quite good at English\". Rowling took A-levels in English, French, and German, achieving two As and a B, and was named head girl at Wyedean. She applied to Oxford University in 1982 but was rejected. Biographers attribute her rejection to lack of privilege, as she had attended a state school rather than a private one.\nRowling always wanted to be a writer, but chose to study French and the classics at the University of Exeter for practical reasons, influenced by her parents who thought job prospects would be better with evidence of bilingualism. She later stated that Exeter was not initially what she expected (\"to be among lots of similar people \u2013 thinking radical thoughts\") but that she enjoyed herself after she met more people like her. She was an average student at Exeter, described by biographers as prioritising her social life over her studies, and lacking ambition and enthusiasm. Rowling recalls doing little work at university, preferring to read Charles Dickens and J. R. R. Tolkien. She earned a BA in French from Exeter, graduating in 1987 after a year of study in Paris.\nInspiration and mother's death.\nAfter university, Rowling moved to a flat in Clapham Junction with friends, and took a course to become a bilingual secretary. While she was working in temporary jobs in London, Amnesty International hired her to document human rights issues in French-speaking Africa. She began writing adult novels while working as a temp, although they were never published. In 1990, she planned to move with her boyfriend to Manchester, and frequently took long train trips to visit. In mid-1990, she was on a train delayed by four hours from Manchester to London, when the characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger came plainly into her mind. Having no pen or paper allowed her to fully explore the characters and their story in her imagination before she reached her flat and began to write.\nRowling moved to Manchester around November 1990. She described her time in Manchester, where she worked for the Chamber of Commerce and at Manchester University in temp jobs, as a \"year of misery\". Her mother died of multiple sclerosis on 30 December 1990. At the time, Rowling was writing \"Harry Potter\", and her mother's death heavily affected her writing.\nThe pain of the loss of her mother was compounded when some personal effects her mother had left her were stolen. With the end of the relationship with her boyfriend, and \"being made redundant from an office job in Manchester\", Rowling moved to Porto, Portugal, in November 1991 to teach night classes in English as a foreign language, writing during the day.\nMarriage, divorce and single parenthood.\nFive months after arriving in Porto, Rowling met the Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found that they shared an interest in Jane Austen. The relationship was troubled, but they married on 16 October 1992. Their daughter Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford) was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal. By this time, Rowling had finished the first three chapters of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" \u2013 almost as they were eventually published \u2013 and had drafted the rest of the novel.\nRowling experienced domestic abuse during her marriage. Arantes said in June 2020 that he had slapped her and did not regret it. Rowling described the marriage as \"short and catastrophic\". She says she was not allowed to have a house key and that her husband used the growing manuscript of her first book as a hostage. Rowling and Arantes separated on 17 November 1993 after Arantes threw her out of the house; she returned with the police to retrieve Jessica and her belongings and went into hiding for two weeks before she left Portugal. In late 1993, with a draft of \"Harry Potter\" in her suitcase, Rowling moved with her daughter to Edinburgh, Scotland, planning to stay with her sister until Christmas. Her biographer Sean Smith raises the question of why Rowling didn't stay with her father. Rowling has spoken of an estrangement from her father; he had married his secretary within two years of her mother's death, and \"The Scotsman\" reported that this caused a rift between his daughters and their father.\nRowling sought government assistance and got \u00a369 per week from Social Security; not wanting to burden her recently married sister, she moved to a flat that she described as mouse-ridden. She later described her economic status as being as \"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless\". Seven years after graduating from university, she saw herself as a failure. Tison Pugh writes that the \"grinding effects of poverty, coupled with her concern for providing for her daughter as a single parent, caused great hardship\". Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she later described this as \"liberating\" her to focus on writing. She has said that \"Jessica kept me going\". Her old school friend, Sean Harris, lent her \u00a3600 ($900), which allowed her to move to a flat in Leith, where she finished \"Philosopher's Stone\".\nArantes arrived in Scotland in March 1994 seeking both Rowling and Jessica. On 15 March 1994, Rowling sought an action of interdict (order of restraint); the interdict was granted and Arantes returned to Portugal. Early in the year, Rowling began to experience a deep depression and sought medical help when she contemplated suicide. With nine months of therapy, her mental health gradually improved. She filed for divorce on 10 August 1994; the divorce was finalised on 26 June 1995.\nRowling wanted to finish the book before enrolling on a teacher training course, fearing she might not be able to finish once she started the course. She often wrote in caf\u00e9s, including Nicolson's, part-owned by her brother-in-law. Secretarial work brought in \u00a315 ($22.50) per week, but she would lose government benefits if she earned more. In mid-1995, a friend gave her money that allowed her to come off benefits and enrol full-time in college. Still needing money and expecting to make a living by teaching, Rowling began a teacher training course in August 1995 at Moray House School of Education after completing her first novel. She earned her teaching certificate in July 1996 and began teaching at Leith Academy.\nPublishing \"Harry Potter\".\nRowling completed \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" in June 1995. The initial draft included an illustration of Harry by a fireplace, showing a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Following an enthusiastic report from an early reader, Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling. Her manuscript was submitted to twelve publishers, all of which rejected it. Barry Cunningham, who ran the children's literature department at Bloomsbury Publishing, bought it after Nigel Newton, who headed Bloomsbury at the time, saw his eight-year-old daughter finish one chapter and want to keep reading. Rowling recalls Cunningham telling her, \"You'll never make any money out of children's books, Jo.\" Rowling was awarded a writer's grant by the Scottish Arts Council to support her childcare costs and finances before \"Philosopher's Stone\"'s publication, and to aid in writing the sequel, \"Chamber of Secrets\". On 26 June 1997, Bloomsbury published \"Philosopher's Stone\" with an initial print run of 5,650\u00a0copies. Before \"Chamber of Secrets\" was published, Rowling had received \u00a32,800 ($4,200) in royalties.\n\"Philosopher's Stone\" introduces Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard who lives with his non-magical relatives until his eleventh birthday, when he is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Rowling wrote six sequels, which follow Harry's adventures at Hogwarts with friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley and his attempts to defeat Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when he was a child.\nRowling received the news that the US rights were being auctioned at the Bologna Children's Book Fair. To her surprise and delight, Scholastic Corporation bought the rights for $105,000. She bought a flat in Edinburgh with the money from the sale. Arthur A. Levine, head of the imprint at Scholastic, pushed for a name change. He wanted \"Harry Potter and the School of Magic\"; as a compromise Rowling suggested \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". \"Sorcerer's Stone\" was released in the United States in September 1998. It was not widely reviewed, but the reviews it received were generally positive. \"Sorcerer's Stone\" became a \"New York Times\" bestseller by December.\nThe next three books in the series were released in quick succession between 1998 and 2000, each selling millions of copies. When \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" had not appeared by 2002, rumours circulated that Rowling was suffering writer's block. Rowling denied these rumours, stating the 896-page book took three years to write because of its length. It was published in June 2003, selling millions of copies on the first day. \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" was released two years later in July 2005, again selling millions of copies on the first day. The series ended with \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", published in July 2007.\nFilms.\nIn 1999, Warner Bros. purchased film rights to the first two \"Harry Potter\" novels for a reported $1\u00a0million. Rowling accepted the offer with the provision that the studio only produce \"Harry Potter\" films based on books she authored, while retaining the right to final script approval, and some control over merchandising. \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", an adaptation of the first \"Harry Potter\" book, was released in November 2001. Steve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, with Rowling's assistance, ensuring that his scripts kept to the plots of the novels.\nThe film series concluded with \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", which was adapted in two parts; part one was released on 19 November 2010, and part two followed on 15 July 2011.\nWarner Bros. announced an expanded relationship with Rowling in 2013, including a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, fictitious author of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\". The first film of five, a prequel to the \"Harry Potter\" series, set roughly 70\u00a0years earlier, was released in November 2016. Rowling wrote the screenplay, which was released as a book. \"Crimes of Grindelwald\" was released in November 2018. \"Secrets of Dumbledore\" was released in April 2022. \nIn November 2022, \"Variety\" reported that Warner Bros. Discovery was not actively planning to continue the film series or to develop any further films related to the Wizarding World franchise.\nReligion, wealth and remarriage.\nBy 1998, Rowling was portrayed in the media as a \"penniless divorcee hitting the jackpot\". According to her biographer Sean Smith, the publicity became effective marketing for \"Harry Potter\", but her journey from living on benefits to wealth brought, along with fame, concerns from different groups about the books' portrayals of the occult and gender roles. Ultimately, Smith says that these concerns served to \"enhance [her] public profile rather than damage it\".\nRowling identifies as a Christian. Although she grew up next door to her church, accounts of the family's church attendance differ. She began attending a Church of Scotland congregation, where Jessica was christened, around the time she was writing \"Harry Potter\". In a 2012 interview, she said she belonged to the Scottish Episcopal Church. Rowling has stated that she believes in God, but has experienced doubt. She does not believe in magic or witchcraft.\nRowling married Neil Murray, a doctor, in 2001. The couple intended to marry that July in the Galapagos, but when this leaked to the press, they delayed their wedding and changed their holiday destination to Mauritius. After the UK Press Complaints Commission ruled that a magazine had breached Jessica's privacy when the eight-year-old was included in a photograph of the family taken during that trip, Murray and Rowling sought a more private and quiet place to live and work. Rowling bought Killiechassie, an estate house in Perthshire, Scotland, and on 26 December 2001, the couple had a small, private wedding there, officiated by an Episcopalian priest who travelled from Edinburgh. Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born in 2003, and their daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray in 2005.\nIn 2004, \"Forbes\" named Rowling \"the first billion-dollar author\". Rowling denied that she was a billionaire in a 2005 interview. By 2012, \"Forbes\" concluded she was no longer a billionaire due to her charitable donations and high UK taxes, but it re-added her to its list of billionaires in 2025. She was named the world's highest paid author by \"Forbes\" in 2008, 2017 and 2019. Her UK sales total in excess of \u00a3238\u00a0million, which made her the best-selling living author in Britain, until 2025 when she was supplanted by Julia Donaldson. The 2021 \"Sunday Times\" Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3820\u00a0million, ranking her as the 196th-richest person in the UK, and \"The National\" reported her net worth in 2025 as \u00a3945\u00a0million. As of 2020, she owns a \u00a34.5\u00a0million Georgian house in Kensington and a \u00a32\u00a0million home in Edinburgh, where she lives with Murray and her two youngest children.\nAdult fiction and Robert Galbraith.\nIn mid-2011, Rowling left Christopher Little Literary Agency and followed her agent Neil Blair to the Blair Partnership. He represented her for the publication of \"The Casual Vacancy\", released in September 2012 by Little, Brown and Company. It was Rowling's first since \"Harry Potter\" ended, and her first book for adults. A contemporary take on 19th-century British fiction about village life, \"Casual Vacancy\" was promoted as a black comedy, while the critic Ian Parker described it as a \"rural comedy of manners\". It was adapted to a miniseries co-created by the BBC and HBO.\nLittle, Brown and Company also published \"The Cuckoo's Calling\", the purported d\u00e9but novel of Robert Galbraith, in April 2013. Telling the story of a detective named Cormoran Strike, a disabled veteran of the War in Afghanistan, it initially sold 1,500\u00a0copies in hardback. After an investigation prompted by discussion on Twitter, the journalist Richard Brooks contacted Rowling's agent, who confirmed Galbraith was Rowling's pseudonym. Rowling later said she enjoyed working as Robert Galbraith, a name she took from Robert F. Kennedy, a personal hero, and Ella Galbraith, a name she invented for herself in childhood. After the revelation of her identity, sales of \"Cuckoo's Calling\" escalated.\nContinuing the \"Cormoran Strike\" series of detective novels, \"The Silkworm\" was released in 2014; \"Career of Evil\" in 2015; \"Lethal White\" in 2018; \"Troubled Blood\" in 2020; \"The Ink Black Heart\" in 2022; \"The Running Grave\" in 2023; and \"The Hallmarked Man\", which was released in September 2025. In 2017, BBC One aired the first episode of the five-season series \"Strike\", a television adaptation of the \"Cormoran Strike\" novels starring Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger, with a sixth season being shot in 2024. The series was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.\nLater \"Harry Potter\" works.\nRowling launched \"Pottermore\" in 2011, an e-book publisher and interactive content portal on which she would publish articles about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling had reserved e-book and audiobook publishing rights, and until 2015, sales could only be fulfilled through Pottermore, bypassing other marketing formats. In 2015 the innovative new media site moved to a more traditional content model, and Rowling allowed digital sales to transition to an industry standard open-commerce model. The site was migrated to Wizarding World Digital in 2019, retaining original content, and now operates under the name HarryPotter.com.\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" premiered in the West End in May 2016 and on Broadway in July. At its London premiere, Rowling confirmed that she would not write any more \"Harry Potter\" books. Rowling collaborated with the writer Jack Thorne and the director John Tiffany. The stage play's script was published as a book in July 2016. The play follows the friendship between Harry's son Albus and Scorpius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy's son, at Hogwarts.\nAnnounced in April 2023, the \"Harry Potter\" television series will begin in 2026, span ten years of production and feature a series dedicated to each of the seven \"Harry Potter\" books, with Rowling as executive producer.\nChildren's stories.\n\"The Ickabog\" was Rowling's first book aimed at children since \"Harry Potter\". Ickabog is a monster that turns out to be real; a group of children find out the truth about the Ickabog and save the day. Rowling released \"The Ickabog\" free online in mid-2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. She began writing it in 2009 but set it aside to focus on other works including \"Casual Vacancy\". Scholastic held a competition to select children's art for the print edition, which was published in the US and Canada on 10 November 2020. Profits went to charities focused on COVID-19 relief.\nIn \"The Christmas Pig\", a young boy loses his favourite stuffed animal, a pig, and the Christmas Pig guides him through the fantastical Land of the Lost to retrieve it. The novel was published on 12 October 2021 and became a bestseller in the UK and the US.\nInfluences.\nRowling has named Jessica Mitford as her greatest influence. She said Mitford had \"been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War\", and that what inspired her about Mitford was that she was \"incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target\". As a child, Rowling read C. S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", Elizabeth Goudge's \"The Little White Horse\", \"Manxmouse\" by Paul Gallico, and books by E. Nesbit and Noel Streatfeild. Rowling describes Jane Austen as her \"favourite author of all time\".\nRowling acknowledges Homer, Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare as literary influences. Scholars agree that \"Harry Potter\" is heavily influenced by the children's fantasy of writers such as Lewis, Goudge, Nesbit, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones. According to the critic Beatrice Groves, \"Harry Potter\" is also \"rooted in the Western literary tradition\", including the classics. Commentators also note similarities to the children's stories of Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl. Rowling expresses admiration for Lewis, in whose writing battles between good and evil are also prominent, but rejects any connection with Dahl.\nEarlier works prominently featuring characters who learn to use magic include Le Guin's \"Earthsea\" series, in which a school of wizardry also appears, and the \"Chrestomanci\" books by Jones. Rowling's setting of a \"school of witchcraft and wizardry\" departs from the still older tradition of protagonists as apprentices to magicians, exemplified by \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\": yet this trope does appear in \"Harry Potter\", when Harry receives individual instruction from Remus Lupin and other teachers. Rowling also draws on the tradition of stories set in boarding schools, a major example of which is Thomas Hughes's 1857 volume \"Tom Brown's School Days\".\nStyle and themes.\nStyle and allusions.\nRowling is known primarily as an author of fantasy and children's literature. Her writing in other genres, including literary fiction and murder mystery, has received less critical attention. Rowling's most famous work, \"Harry Potter\", has been defined as a fairy tale, a bildungsroman and a boarding-school story. Her other writings have been described by Pugh as gritty contemporary fiction with historical influences (\"The Casual Vacancy\") and hardboiled detective fiction (\"Cormoran Strike\").\nIn \"Harry Potter\", Rowling juxtaposes the extraordinary against the ordinary. Her narrative features two worlds \u2013 the mundane and the fantastic \u2013 but it differs from typical portal fantasy in that its magical elements stay grounded in the everyday. Paintings move and talk; books bite readers; letters shout messages; and maps show live journeys, making the wizarding world \"both exotic and cosily familiar\" according to the scholar Catherine Butler. This blend of realistic and romantic elements extends to Rowling's characters. Harry is ordinary and relatable, with down-to-earth features such as wearing broken glasses; these elements serve to highlight Harry when he is heroic, making him both an everyman and a fairytale hero.\nArthurian, Christian and fairytale motifs are frequently found in Rowling's writing. Harry's ability to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat resembles the Arthurian sword in the stone legend. His life with the Dursleys has been compared to Cinderella. Like C. S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", \"Harry Potter\" contains Christian symbolism and allegory. The series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the psychomachia tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person's soul. The critic of children's literature Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ. According to Maria Nikolajeva, Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of the series: she writes that Harry dies in self-sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an speech, after which Harry is resurrected and defeats his enemy.\nThemes.\nDeath is Rowling's overarching theme in \"Harry Potter\". She later said that her literary creation of the Mirror of Erised is about her mother's death. In the first book, when Harry looks into the mirror, he feels both joy and \"a terrible sadness\" at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with him. Confronting their loss is central to Harry's character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his struggles with Dementors. Other characters in Harry's life die; he even faces his own death in \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\". Soon after she started writing \"Philosopher's Stone\", her mother died, and she said that \"I really think from that moment on, death became a central, if not the central theme of the seven books\". Rowling has described Harry as \"the prism through which I view death\", and further stated that \"all of my characters are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of death\".\nWhile \"Harry Potter\" can be viewed as a story about good versus evil, its moral divisions are not absolute. First impressions of characters are often misleading. Harry assumes in the first book that Quirrell is good because he opposes Snape, who appears malicious; in reality, their positions are reversed. In Rowling's world, good and evil are choices rather than inherent attributes: second chances and redemption are key themes of the series.\nReception.\nRowling has enjoyed enormous commercial success as an author. Her \"Harry Potter\" series topped bestseller lists, spawned a global media franchise including films and video games, and had been translated into 84\u00a0languages by 2023. The first three \"Harry Potter\" books occupied the top three spots of \"The New York Times\" bestseller list for more than a year; they were then moved to a newly created children's list. The final four books each set records as the fastest-selling books in the UK or US, and the series as a whole had sold more than 600\u00a0million copies as of 2023[ [update]]. Neither of Rowling's later works, \"The Casual Vacancy\" and the \"Cormoran Strike\" series, has been as successful, although \"Casual Vacancy\" was still a bestseller in the UK within weeks of its release. \"Harry Potter\"'s popularity has been attributed to factors including the nostalgia evoked by the boarding-school story, the endearing nature of Rowling's characters, and the accessibility of her books to a variety of readers. According to Julia Eccleshare, the books are \"neither too literary nor too popular, too difficult nor too easy, neither too young nor too old\", and hence bridge traditional reading divides.\nCritical response to \"Harry Potter\" has been more mixed. Harold Bloom regarded Rowling's prose as poor and her plots as conventional, while Jack Zipes argues that the series would not be successful if it were not formulaic. Zipes states that the early novels have the same plot: in each book, Harry escapes the Dursleys to visit Hogwarts, where he confronts Lord Voldemort and then heads back successful. Rowling's prose has been described as simple and not innovative; the author Ursula K. Le Guin, like several other critics, considered it \"stylistically ordinary\". According to the novelist A. S. Byatt, the books reflect a dumbed-down culture dominated by soap operas and reality television. Thus, some critics argue, \"Harry Potter\" does not innovate on established literary forms; nor does it challenge readers' preconceived ideas. Conversely, the scholar Philip Nel rejects such critiques as \"snobbery\" that reacts to the novels' popularity, whereas Mary Pharr argues that \"Harry Potter\"'s conventionalism is the point: by amalgamating literary forms familiar to her readers, Rowling invites them to \"ponder their own ideas\". Other critics who see artistic merit in Rowling's writing include Marina Warner, who views \"Harry Potter\" as part of an \"alternative genealogy\" of English literature that she traces from Edmund Spenser to Christina Rossetti. Michiko Kakutani praises Rowling's fictional world and the darker tone of the series' later entries.\nReception of Rowling's later works has varied among critics. \"The Casual Vacancy\", her attempt at literary fiction, drew mixed reviews. Some critics praised its characterisation, while others stated that it would have been better if it had contained magic. The \"Cormoran Strike\" series was more warmly received as a work of British detective fiction, even as some reviewers noted that its plots are occasionally contrived. Theatrical reviews of \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" were highly positive. Fans have been more critical of the play's use of time travel, changes to characters' personalities, and perceived queerbaiting in Albus and Scorpius's relationship, leading some to question its connection to the \"Harry Potter\" canon.\nGender and social division.\nRowling's portrayal of women in \"Harry Potter\" has been described as complex and varied, but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and patriarchal depictions of gender. Gender divides are ostensibly absent in the books: Hogwarts is coeducational and women hold positions of power in wizarding society. However, this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles. According to the scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson, the subordination of female characters goes further early in the series. The final three books \"showcase richer roles and more powerful females\": for instance, the series' \"most matriarchal character\", Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of \"Deathly Hallows\", while other women are shown as leaders. Hermione Granger, in particular, becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists' battle against evil. Yet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and Minerva McGonagall are placed in supporting roles, and Hermione's status as a feminist model is debated. Girls and women are frequently shown as emotional, defined by their appearance, and denied agency in family settings.\nThe social hierarchies in Rowling's magical world have been a matter of debate among scholars and critics. The primary antagonists of \"Harry Potter\", Voldemort and his followers, believe blood purity is paramount, and that non-wizards, or \"muggles\", are subhuman. Their ideology of racial difference is depicted as unambiguously evil. However, the series cannot wholly reject racial division, according to several scholars, as it still depicts wizards as fundamentally superior to muggles. Blake and Zipes argue that numerous examples of wizardly superiority are depicted as \"natural and comfortable\". Thus, according to Gupta, \"Harry Potter\" depicts superior races as having a moral obligation of tolerance and altruism towards lesser races, rather than explicitly depicting equality.\nRowling's depictions of the status of magical non-humans is similarly debated. Discussing the slavery of house-elves within \"Harry Potter\", scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books' abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement. Other critics, including Farah Mendlesohn, find the portrayal of house-elves extremely troublesome; they are written as happy in their slavery, and Hermione's efforts on their behalf are implied to be na\u00efve. Pharr terms the house-elves a disharmonious element in the series, writing that Rowling leaves their fate hanging; at the end of \"Deathly Hallows\", the elves remain enslaved and cheerful. More generally, the subordination of magical non-humans remains in place, unchanged by the defeat of Voldemort. Thus, scholars suggest, the series's message is essentially conservative; it sees no reason to transform social hierarchies, only being concerned with who holds positions of power.\nReligious reactions.\nThere have been attempts to ban \"Harry Potter\" around the world, especially in the United States, and in the Bible Belt in particular. The series topped the American Library Association's list of most challenged books in the first three years of its publication. In the following years, parents in several US cities launched protests against teaching it in schools. Some Christian critics, particularly Evangelical Christians, have claimed that the novels promote witchcraft and harm children; similar opposition has been expressed to the film adaptations. Criticism has taken two main forms: allegations that \"Harry Potter\" is a pagan text; and claims that it encourages children to oppose authority, derived mainly from Harry's rejection of the Dursleys, his guardians. The author and scholar Amanda Cockrell suggests that \"Harry Potter\"'s popularity, and recent preoccupation with fantasy and the occult among Christian fundamentalists, explains why the series received particular opposition. Some groups of Shia and Sunni Muslims also argued that the series contained Satanic subtext, and it was banned in private schools in the United Arab Emirates by its Ministry of Education and Youth, which stated it contradicted Islamic values.\nThe \"Harry Potter\" books also have a group of vocal religious supporters who believe that \"Harry Potter\" espouses Christian values, or that the Bible does not prohibit the forms of magic described in the series. Christian analyses of the series have argued that it embraces ideals of friendship, loyalty, courage, love, and the temptation of power. After the final volume was published, Rowling said she intentionally incorporated Christian themes, in particular the idea that love may hold power over death. According to Farmer, it is a profound misreading to think that \"Harry Potter\" promotes witchcraft. The scholar Em McAvan writes that evangelical objections to \"Harry Potter\" are superficial, based on the presence of magic in the books: they do not attempt to understand the moral messages in the series.\nLegacy.\nRowling's \"Harry Potter\" series has been credited with a resurgence in crossover fiction: children's literature with an adult appeal. Crossovers were prevalent in 19th-century American and British fiction, but fell out of favour in the 20th century and did not occur at the same scale. The post-\"Harry Potter\" crossover trend is associated with the fantasy genre. In the 1970s, children's books were generally realistic as opposed to fantastic, while adult fantasy became popular because of the influence of \"The Lord of the Rings\". The next decade saw an increasing interest in grim, realist themes, with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works.\nThe commercial success of \"Harry Potter\" in 1997 reversed this trend. The scale of its growth had no precedent in the children's market: within four years, it occupied 28% of that field by revenue. Children's literature rose in cultural status, and fantasy became a dominant genre. Older works of children's fantasy, including Diana Wynne Jones's \"Chrestomanci\" series and Diane Duane's \"Young Wizards\", were reprinted and rose in popularity; some authors re-established their careers. In the following decades, many \"Harry Potter\" imitators and subversive responses grew popular.\nRowling has been compared with Enid Blyton, who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children's market. She has also been described as an heir to Roald Dahl. Some critics view \"Harry Potter\"'s rise, along with the concurrent success of Philip Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\", as part of a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure. This is reflected in the BBC's 2003 \"Big Read\" survey of the UK's favourite books, where Pullman and Rowling ranked at numbers\u00a03 and 5, respectively, with very few British literary classics in the top\u00a010.\n\"Harry Potter\"'s popularity led its publishers to plan elaborate releases and fostered additional publications by fans and forgers after the books. Beginning with the release of \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" on 8\u00a0July 1999 at 3:45\u00a0pm, its publishers coordinated selling the books at the same time globally, introduced security protocols to prevent premature purchases, and required booksellers to agree not to sell copies before the appointed time. Driven by the growth of the internet, fan fiction about the series proliferated and has spawned a diverse community of readers and writers. While Rowling has supported fan fiction, her statements about characters made after the books were published but not included in the books \u2013 for instance, that Harry and Hermione could have been a couple, and that Dumbledore was gay \u2013 have complicated her relationship with readers; according to scholars, this shows that modern readers feel a sense of ownership over the text that is independent of, and sometimes contradicts, authorial intent.\nLegal disputes.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Rowling was both a plaintiff and defendant in lawsuits alleging copyright infringement. Nancy Stouffer sued Rowling in 1999, alleging that \"Harry Potter\" was based on stories she published in 1984. Rowling won in September 2002. Richard Posner describes Stouffer's suit as deeply flawed and notes that the court, finding she had used \"forged and altered documents\", assessed a $50,000 penalty against her.\nWith her literary agents and Warner Bros., Rowling has brought legal action against publishers and writers of \"Harry Potter\" knockoffs in several countries. In the mid-2000s, Rowling and her publishers obtained a series of injunctions prohibiting sales or published reviews of her books before their official release dates.\nBeginning in 2001, after Rowling sold film rights to Warner Bros., the studio tried to take \"Harry Potter\" fan sites offline unless it determined that they were made by \"authentic\" fans for innocuous purposes. In 2007, with Warner Bros., Rowling started proceedings to cease publication of a book based on content from a fan site called \"The Harry Potter Lexicon\". The court held that \"Lexicon\" was neither a fair use of Rowling's material nor a derivative work, but it did not prevent the book from being published in a different form. \"Lexicon\" was published in 2009.\nPhilanthropy.\nRowling's charitable donations between 2005 and 2025 were estimated at over $200\u00a0million by \"Forbes\", which also estimated she had donated $160\u00a0million before 2012. She was the second most generous UK donor in 2015 (following the singer Elton John), giving about $14\u00a0million.\nIn 2000, she established the Volant Charitable Trust, named after her mother to address social deprivation in at-risk women, children and youth. She was appointed president of One Parent Families (now Gingerbread) in 2004, after becoming its first ambassador in 2000. She collaborated with Sarah Brown on a book of children's stories to benefit One Parent Families. Together with the member of the European Parliament Emma Nicholson, Rowling founded the charity now known as Lumos in 2005. Lumos has worked with orphanages in Ukraine, Romania, Haiti, and Colombia, and it had supported at least 280,000 children by 2025. She has donated several hundred thousand pounds to help women lawyers flee from the Taliban's control, helping hundreds of Afghans escape.\nRowling has made donations to support other medical causes. She named another institution after her mother in 2010, when she donated \u00a310\u00a0million to found a multiple sclerosis research centre at the University of Edinburgh. She gave an additional \u00a315.3\u00a0million to the centre in 2019. To support COVID-19 relief, she donated six-figure sums to both Khalsa Aid and the British Asian Trust from royalties for \"The Ickabog\".\nSeveral publications in the \"Harry Potter\" universe have been sold for charitable purposes. Profits from \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" and \"Quidditch Through the Ages\", both published in 2001, went to Comic Relief. To support Children's Voice, later renamed Lumos, Rowling sold a deluxe copy of \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" at auction in 2007. Amazon's \u00a31.95\u00a0million purchase set a record for a contemporary literary work and for children's literature. Rowling published the book and, in 2013, donated the proceeds of nearly \u00a319\u00a0million (then about $30\u00a0million) to Lumos. Rowling and 12 other writers composed short pieces in 2008 to be sold to benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word \"Harry Potter\" prequel. When the revelation that Rowling wrote \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" led to an increase in sales, she donated the royalties to ABF The Soldiers' Charity (formerly the Army Benevolent Fund).\nViews.\nRowling was actively engaged on the internet before author webpages were common, and used Twitter to reach her \"Harry Potter\" fans and followers. She often uses sarcasm in tweets about her political opinions, sometimes generating controversy.\nPolitics.\nIn 2008, Rowling donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Labour Party, endorsed the Labour prime minister Gordon Brown over his Conservative challenger David Cameron, and commended Labour's policies on child poverty. In June 2024, she wrote that she had a \"poor opinion\" of Keir Starmer and that it would be hard for her to vote for Labour due to their position on transgender rights, which she claims comes at the expense of women.\nIn her \"Single mother's manifesto\" published in \"The Times\" in 2010, Rowling criticised the prime minister David Cameron's plan to offer married couples an annual tax credit. She thought that the proposal discriminated against single parents, whose interests the Conservative Party failed to consider. Rowling opposed the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and donated \u00a31\u00a0million to the Better Together anti-independence campaign. She campaigned for the UK to stay in the European Union in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. She defined herself as an internationalist, \"the mongrel product of this European continent\", and expressed concern that \"racists and bigots\" were directing parts of the Leave campaign.\nShe opposed Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but refused to support a cultural boycott of Israel in 2015, believing that depriving Israel of shared culture would not dislodge him. In 2015, Rowling joined 150 others in signing a letter published in \"The Guardian\" in favour of cultural engagement with Israel. She has come out in favour of Israel during the Gaza War.\nPress.\nRowling has a difficult relationship with the press and has tried to influence the type of coverage she receives. She described herself in 2003 as \"too thin-skinned\". As of 2011, she had taken more than 50\u00a0actions against the press. Rowling dislikes the British tabloid the \"Daily Mail\", which she successfully sued in 2014 for libel about her time as a single mother.\nThe Leveson Inquiry into the British press named Rowling as a \"core participant\" in 2011. She was one of many celebrities alleged to have been victims of phone hacking. The following year she criticised Cameron's decision not to implement all the inquiry's recommendations and supported the Hacked Off campaign, pushing for stricter media reform.\nTransgender people.\nRowling is opposed to legislation that would allow transgender people to legally self-identify their gender without first receiving a medical diagnosis. She rejects the view that gender identity is different from birth sex, and that it should take priority in equalities law. Her view is that it would be unsafe to allow \"any man who believes or feels he's a woman\" into bathrooms, changing rooms, or what she considers \"single-sex spaces\". These views are often described as trans-exclusionary. \nFriction over Rowling's trans-exclusionary writings surged in 2019 when she defended Maya Forstater, whose employment contract was not renewed after she made a series of tweets questioning UK government plans to let people declare their own gender. (The Employment Appeal Tribunal found that Forstater had been discriminated against.) Rowling wrote that transgender people should live in \"peace and security\" but said she opposed \"forc[ing] women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real\". According to the \"Harry Potter\" scholar Lana Whited, in the next six months \"Rowling herself fanned the flames as she became increasingly vocal\".\nRowling has opposed proposed gender self-recognition law reforms in the UK that would make it easier for trans people to change their legal gender. She also supported trans-exclusionary campaign group For Women Scotland in the landmark UK Supreme Court case \"For Women Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers\". According to the media scholar Jennifer Duggan, Rowling has suggested on social media that children and cisgender women are threatened by trans women and trans-positive messages. Responding to an online op-ed that used the words \"people who menstruate\", Rowling mocked the phrase and tweeted that women's rights and \"lived reality\" would be \"erased\" if \"sex isn't real\". Following the strengthening of a hate crime law in Scotland in April 2024, she tweeted a list of trans women, writing that they are \"men, every last one of them\" and challenging the police to arrest her. In 2024, \"Variety\" wrote that Rowling had \"made her campaign against trans identity the central focus of her online persona\".\nRowling denies that her views are transphobic. Rowling's public expression of her views has prompted declarations of support for transgender people from the literary, music, theme park, and video gaming sectors as well as fuelling debates on freedom of speech and cancel culture. She has been the target of widespread condemnation for her comments, with negative reactions including insults and death threats. Criticism came from \"Harry Potter\" fansites, LGBT charities, leading actors of the Wizarding World, and Human Rights Campaign. After Kerry Kennedy expressed \"profound disappointment\" in her views, Rowling returned the Ripple of Hope Award given to her by the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organisation.\nDuring her advocacy in 2022 against the Scottish Parliament's bill to simplify changing one's legal gender, Rowling founded Beira's Place with her own funds, a women-only rape help centre that provides free support services to survivors of sexual violence. The centre does not serve trans women. Rowling has donated to the group For Women Scotland, which brought legal challenges leading to the UK Supreme Court case \"For Women Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers\". In 2025, she opened the J.K. Rowling Women's Fund, which supports groups advocating for \"sex-based rights\" for women; in describing the group, NBC says that while the fund makes no mention of trans people directly, this terminology is frequently used by \"proponents of efforts to restrict trans rights\".\nWhited wrote in 2024 that Rowling's sometimes \"flippant\" and \"simplistic understanding of gender identity\" had left some transgender people feeling betrayed and permanently changed her \"relationship not only with fans, readers, and scholars\u00a0... but also with her works themselves\".\nAwards and honours.\nRowling's \"Harry Potter\" series has won awards for general literature, children's literature, and speculative fiction. It has earned multiple British Book Awards, beginning with the Children's Book of the Year for the first two volumes, \"Philosopher's Stone\" and \"Chamber of Secrets\". The third novel, \"Prisoner of Azkaban\", was nominated for an adult award, the Whitbread Book of the Year, where it competed against the Nobel Prize laureate Seamus Heaney's . The award body gave Rowling the children's prize instead (worth half the cash amount), which some scholars felt exemplified a literary prejudice against children's books. She won the World Science Fiction Convention's Hugo Award for the fourth book, \"Goblet of Fire\", and the British Book Awards' adult prize \u2013 the Book of the Year \u2013 for the sixth novel, \"Half-Blood Prince\".\nRowling was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2000 Birthday Honours for services to children's literature, and three years later received Spain's Prince of Asturias Award for Concord. Following the conclusion of the \"Harry Potter\" series, she won the Outstanding Achievement Prize at the 2008 British Book Awards. The next year, she was awarded by the French president Nicolas Sarkozy, and leading magazine editors named her the \"Most Influential Woman in the UK\" in 2010. In the 2017 Birthday Honours, Rowling was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for services to literature and philanthropy.\nMany academic institutions have bestowed honorary degrees on Rowling, including her alma mater, the University of Exeter, and Harvard University, where she spoke at the 2008 commencement ceremony. In 2002, Rowling was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL) and awarded as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE). In 2011, she was recognised as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE).\nRowling shared the British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema with the cast and crew of the \"Harry Potter\" films in 2011. Her other awards include the 2017 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play for \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", and the 2021 British Book Awards' Crime and Thriller prize for the fifth volume of her \"Cormoran Strike\" series.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nBooks\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournal articles\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNon-English news articles\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16028", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16028", "title": "Jan Hus", "text": "Czech theologian, philosopher, and martyr (c. 1369\u20131415)\nJan Hus (; ; c. 1369 \u2013 6 July 1415), sometimes anglicized as John Goose or John Huss, and referred to in historical texts as Iohannes Hvs or Johannes Huss, was a Czech theologian and philosopher who became a Church reformer and the inspiration of Hussitism, a key predecessor to Protestantism, and a seminal figure in the Bohemian Reformation. Hus is considered to be the first Church reformer, even though some designate the theorist John Wycliffe. His teachings had a strong influence, most immediately in the approval of a reformed Bohemian religious denomination and, over a century later, on Martin Luther.\nAfter being ordained as a Catholic priest, Hus began to preach in Prague. He opposed many aspects of the Catholic Church in Bohemia, such as its views on ecclesiology, simony, the Eucharist, and other theological topics. Hus was a master, dean, and rector at the Charles University in Prague between 1409 and 1410.\nAlexander V issued a Papal bull that excommunicated Hus; however, it was not enforced, and Hus continued to preach. Hus then spoke out against Alexander V's successor, Antipope John XXIII, for his selling of indulgences. Hus' excommunication was then enforced, and he spent the next two years living in exile.\nWhen the Council of Constance assembled, Hus was asked to be there and present his views on the dissension within the Church. When he arrived, with a promise of safe-conduct, he was arrested and put in prison. He was eventually taken in front of the council and asked to recant his views. He refused. On 6 July 1415, he was burned at the stake for \"heresy\" against the teachings of the Catholic Church.\nAfter Hus was executed, the followers of his religious teachings (known as Hussites) refused to elect another Catholic monarch and defeated five consecutive papal crusades between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the Hussite Wars. Both the Bohemian and the Moravian populations remained majority Hussite until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the Battle of the White Mountain resulted in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown coming under Habsburg dominion for the next 300 years and being subject to immediate and forced conversion to Catholicism in an intense campaign.\nEarly life.\nThe exact date of Hus's birth is disputed. Some claim he was born around 1369, while others claim he was born between 1373 and 1375. Though older sources state the latter, more contemporary research states that 1372 is more likely. The belief that he was born on 6 July, also his death day, has no factual basis. Hus was born in Husinec, southern Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), to peasant parents. It is well known that Hus took his name from the village where he lived (Husinec). The reason behind his taking his name from his village rather than from his father is up to speculation; some believe that it was because Hus did not know of his father, while others say it was simply a custom at that time. The name \"Hus\", however, means 'goose' in Bohemian (now called Czech), and he was a century later referenced as a \"Bohemian goose\" in a dream given to Frederick, the Elector of Saxony. Nearly all other information known about Hus's very early life is unsubstantiated. Similarly, we know little of Hus's family. His father's name was Michael; his mother's name is unknown. It is known that Hus had a brother due to his expressing concerns for his nephew while awaiting execution at Constance. Whether or not Hus had any other family is unknown.\nAt the age of roughly 10, Hus was sent away to a monastery. The exact reason is not known; some claim that his father had died, others say he went there due to his devotion to God. He impressed the teachers with his studies, and they recommended him to move to Prague, one of the largest cities in Bohemia at that time. Hus apparently supported himself by securing employment in Prague, which allowed him to fulfill his necessities and access to the Prague Library.\nThree years later, he was admitted to the University of Prague. Though not an exceptional student, he pursued his studies with ferocity. In 1393, Hus earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Prague, and he earned his master's degree in 1396. The strongly anti-papal views that were held by many of the professors there likely influenced Hus's future works. During his studies, he served as a choir boy, to supplement his earnings.\nCareer.\nHus began teaching at the University of Prague in 1398, and in 1399, he first publicly defended propositions of Wycliffe. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1400. In 1401, his students and faculty promoted him to dean of the philosophy department, and a year later, he became a rector of the University of Prague. He was appointed a preacher at the Bethlehem Chapel in 1402. Hus was a strong advocate for the Czechs and the Realists, and he was influenced by the writings of John Wycliffe. Although Church authorities banned many of Wycliffe's works in 1403, Hus translated \"Trialogus\" into Czech and helped to distribute it.\nHus denounced the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit. Archbishop Zbyn\u011bk Zaj\u00edc tolerated this, and even appointed Hus a preacher at the clergy's biennial synod. On 24 June 1405, Pope Innocent VII directed the Archbishop to counter Wycliffe's teachings, especially the idea of impanation in the Eucharist. The archbishop complied by issuing a synod decree against Wycliffe, as well as forbidding any further attacks on the clergy.\nIn 1406, two Bohemian students brought to Prague a document bearing the seal of the University of Oxford and praising Wycliffe. Hus proudly read the document from his pulpit. Then, in 1408, Pope Gregory XII warned Archbishop Zajic that the Church in Rome had been informed of Wycliffe's heresies and of the sympathies of King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia for nonconformists. In response, the king and university ordered all of Wycliffe's writings surrendered to the archdiocesan chancery for correction. Hus obeyed, declaring that he condemned the errors in those writings.\nPapal Schism.\nIn 1408, the Charles University in Prague was divided by the Western Schism, in which Gregory XII in Rome and Benedict XIII in Avignon both claimed the papacy. Wenceslaus felt Gregory XII might interfere with his plans to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. He denounced Gregory, ordered the clergy in Bohemia to observe a strict neutrality in the schism, and said that he expected the same of the university. Archbishop Zaj\u00edc remained faithful to Gregory. At the University, only the scholars of the Bohemian \"nation\" (one of the four governing sections), with Hus as their leader, vowed neutrality.\nKutn\u00e1 Hora Decree.\nIn January 1409, Wenceslaus summoned representatives of the four nations comprising the university to the Czech city of Kutn\u00e1 Hora to demand statements of allegiance. The Czech nation agreed, but the other three nations declined. The king then decreed that the Czech nation would have three votes in university affairs, while the \"German nation\" (composed of the former Bavarian, Saxon, and Polish nations) would have one vote in total. Due to the change in voting structure by May 1409, the German dean and rector were deposed and replaced by Czechs. The Palatine Elector called the Germans to his own University of Heidelberg, while the Margrave of Meissen started a new university in Leipzig. It is estimated that over one thousand students and masters left Prague. The emigrants also spread accusations of Bohemian heresy.\nAntipope Alexander V.\nIn 1409, the Council of Pisa tried to end the schism by electing Alexander V as Pope, but Gregory and Benedict did not submit (Alexander was declared an \"antipope\" by the Council of Constance in 1418). Hus, his followers, and Wenceslaus IV transferred their allegiance to Alexander V. Under pressure from\nKing Wenceslaus IV, Archbishop Zaj\u00edc did the same. Zaj\u00edc then lodged an accusation of \"ecclesiastical disturbances\" against Wycliffites in Prague with Alexander V.\nOn 20 December 1409, Alexander V issued a papal bull that empowered the Archbishop to proceed against Wycliffism in Prague. All copies of Wycliffe's writings were to be surrendered and his views repudiated, and free preaching discontinued. After the publication of the bull in 1410, Hus appealed to Alexander V, but in vain. The Wycliffe books and valuable manuscripts were burned, and Hus and his adherents were excommunicated by Alexander V.\nCrusade against Naples.\nAlexander V died in 1410 and was succeeded by John XXIII (also later declared an antipope). In 1411, John XXIII proclaimed a crusade against King Ladislaus of Naples, the protector of rival Pope Gregory XII. This crusade was preached in Prague as well. John XXIII also authorized indulgences to raise money for the war. Priests urged the people on, and they crowded into churches to give their offerings. This traffic in indulgences was a sign of the corruption of the Church needing remediation.\nCondemnation of indulgences and Crusade.\nArchbishop Zaj\u00edc died in 1411, and with his death, the religious movement in Bohemia entered a new phase during which the disputes concerning indulgences assumed great importance. Hus spoke out against indulgences, but he could not carry with him the men of the university. In 1412, a dispute took place, on which occasion Hus delivered his address \"Quaestio magistri Johannis Hus de indulgentiis\". It was taken literally from the last chapter of Wycliffe's book, \"De ecclesia\", and his treatise, \"De absolutione a pena et culpa\". Hus asserted that no pope or bishop had the right to take up the sword in the name of the Church; he should pray for his enemies and bless those who curse him; man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money. The doctors of the theological faculty replied, but without success. A few days afterward, some of Hus' followers, led by Vok Voksa z Vald\u0161tejna, burned the Papal bulls. Hus, they said, should be obeyed rather than the Church, which they considered a fraudulent mob of adulterers and Simonists.\nIn response, three men from the lower classes who openly called the indulgences a fraud were beheaded. They were later considered the first martyrs of the Hussite Church. In the meantime, the faculty had condemned the forty-five articles of Wycliffe and added several other theses, deemed heretical, which had originated with Hus. The king forbade the teaching of these articles, but neither Hus nor the university complied with the ruling. They requested that the articles should first be proven to be unscriptural. The tumults at Prague had stirred up a sensation. Papal legates and Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls, and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.\nAttempts at reconciliation.\nKing Wenceslaus IV made efforts to harmonize the opposing parties. In 1412, he convoked the heads of his kingdom for a consultation and, at their suggestion, ordered a synod to be held at \u010cesk\u00fd Brod on 2 February 1412. The synod was instead held in the palace of the archbishops at Prague to exclude Hus from participation. Propositions were made to restore peace in the Church. Hus declared that Bohemia should have the same freedom regarding ecclesiastical affairs as other countries and that approbation and condemnation should therefore be announced only with the permission of the state power. This was the view of Wycliffe (\"Sermones\", iii. 519, etc.).\nThere followed treatises from both parties, but no harmony was obtained. \"Even if I should stand before the stake which has been prepared for me,\" Hus wrote at the time, \"I would never accept the recommendation of the theological faculty.\" The synod did not produce any results, but the king ordered a commission to continue the work of reconciliation. The doctors of the university demanded that Hus and his followers approve the university's conception of the Church. According to this conception, the pope is the head of the Church and the Cardinals are the body of the Church. Hus protested vigorously. The Hussite party seems to have made a great effort toward reconciliation. To the article that the Roman Church must be obeyed, they added only \"so far as every pious Christian is bound\". Stanislav ze Znojma and \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n P\u00e1le\u010d protested against this addition and left the convention; they were exiled by the king, with two others.\nHus leaves Prague and appeals to Jesus Christ.\nBy this time, Hus's ideas had become widely accepted in Bohemia, and there was broad resentment against the Church hierarchy. The attack on Hus by the pope and archbishop caused riots in parts of Bohemia. King Wenceslaus IV and his government took the side of Hus, and the power of his adherents increased from day to day. Hus continued to preach in the Bethlehem Chapel. The churches of the city were put under the ban, and an interdict was pronounced against Prague. To protect the city, Hus left and went into the countryside, where he continued to preach and write.\nBefore Hus left Prague, he decided to take a step that gave a new dimension to his endeavors. He wanted to become a preacher and then taught at the university he studied at before. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive king, a hostile pope, or an ineffective council. On 18 October 1412, he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church. For the Bohemian Reformation, this step was as significant as the Ninety-five Theses posted in Wittenberg by Martin Luther in 1517.\nAfter Hus left Prague for the country, he realized what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care. Therefore, he started to write many texts in Czech, such as the basics of the Christian faith or preachings, intended mainly for the priests whose knowledge of Latin was poor.\nWritings of Hus and Wycliffe.\nOf the writings occasioned by these controversies, those of Hus on the Church, entitled \"De Ecclesia\", were written in 1413 and have been most frequently quoted and admired or criticized, yet their first ten chapters are an epitome of Wycliffe's work of the same title and the following chapters are an abstract of another of Wycliffe's works (\"De potentate papae\") on the power of the pope. Wycliffe had written his book to oppose the common position that the Church consisted primarily of the clergy, and Hus now found himself making the same point. He wrote his work at the castle of one of his protectors in Koz\u00ed Hr\u00e1dek and sent it to Prague, where it was publicly read in the Bethlehem Chapel. It was answered by Stanislav ze Znojma and \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n z P\u00e1l\u010de (also \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n P\u00e1le\u010d) with treatises of the same title.\nAfter the most vehement opponents of Hus had left Prague, his adherents occupied the whole ground. Hus wrote his treatises and preached in the neighborhood of Koz\u00ed Hr\u00e1dek. Bohemian Wycliffism was carried into Poland, Hungary, Croatia, and Austria. But in January 1413, a general council in Rome condemned the writings of Wycliffe and ordered them to be burned.\nHus was also a musical composer. Many of his writings were adapted into musical pieces by other composers.\nCouncil of Constance.\nKing Wenceslaus's brother Sigismund of Hungary, who was \"King of the Romans\" (that is, head of the Holy Roman Empire though not then Emperor) and heir to the Bohemian crown, was anxious to put an end to religious dissension within the Church. To put an end to the papal schism and to take up the long-desired reform of the Church, he arranged for a general council to convene on 1 November 1414, at Konstanz (Constance). The Council of Constance (1414\u20131418) became the 16th ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church. Hus, willing to make an end to all dissensions, agreed to go to Constance, under Sigismund's promise of safe-conduct.\nImprisonment and preparations for trial.\nIt is not known whether Hus knew what his fate would be; however, he made his will before setting out. He started on his journey on 11 October 1414, arriving in Constance on 3 November 1414. The following day, the bulletins on the church doors announced that Michal z N\u011bmeck\u00e9ho Brodu (Michal de Causis) would be opposing Hus. In the beginning, Hus was at liberty under his safe-conduct from Sigismund and lived at the house of a widow. But he continued celebrating Mass and preaching to the people, in violation of restrictions decreed by the Church. After a few weeks, on 28 November 1414, his opponents succeeded in imprisoning him on the strength of a rumor that he intended to flee. He was first brought into the residence of a canon and then on 6 December 1414 into the prison of the Dominican monastery. Sigismund, as the guarantor of Hus's safety, was greatly angered and threatened the prelates with dismissal. The prelates convinced him that he could not be bound by promises to a heretic.\nOn 4 December 1414, John XXIII entrusted a committee of three bishops with a preliminary investigation against Hus. As was common practice, witnesses for the prosecution were heard, but Hus was not allowed an advocate for his defense. His situation became worse after the downfall of John XXIII, who had left Constance to avoid abdicating. Hus had been the captive of John XXIII and in constant communication with his friends, but now he was delivered to the bishop of Constance and brought to his castle, \"Gottlieben on the Rhine\". Here he remained for 73 days, separated from his friends, chained day and night, poorly fed, and ill.\nTrial.\nOn 5 June 1415, he was tried for the first time and was transferred to a Franciscan monastery, where he spent the last weeks of his life. Extracts from his works were read, and witnesses were heard. He refused all formulae of submission but declared himself willing to recant if his errors should be proven to him from the Bible. Hus conceded his veneration of Wycliffe and said that he could only wish his soul might some time attain unto that place where Wycliffe's was. On the other hand, he denied having defended Wycliffe's view of The Lord's Supper or the forty-five articles; he had only opposed their summary condemnation. King Sigismund admonished him to deliver himself up to the mercy of the council, as he did not desire to protect a heretic.\nAt the last trial, on 8 June 1415, thirty-nine sentences were read to him. Of these, twenty-six had been excerpted from his book on the Church (\"De ecclesia\"), seven from his treatise against P\u00e1le\u010d (Contra Palecz), and six from that against Stanislav ze Znojma (\"Contra Stanislaum\"). The danger of some of these views to worldly power was explained to Sigismund to incite him against Hus. Hus again declared himself willing to submit if he could be convinced of errors. This declaration was considered an unconditional surrender, and he was asked to confess:\n1. That he had erred in the theses which he had hitherto maintained;\n2. That he renounced them for the future;\n3. That he recanted them; and\n4. That he declared the opposite of these sentences.\nHe asked to be exempted from recanting teachings that he had never taught. Other views, which the assembly considered erroneous, he was not willing to revoke, and to act differently would be against his conscience. These words found no favorable reception. After the trial on 8 June, several other attempts were purportedly made to induce him to recant, which he resisted.\nCondemnation.\nThe condemnation of Jan Hus took place on 6 July 1415 in the presence of the assembly of the council in the cathedral. After the High Mass and Liturgy, Hus was led into the church. The Bishop of Lodi (then Giacomo Balardi Arrigoni) delivered an oration on the duty of eradicating heresy; various theses of Hus and Wycliffe and a report of his trial were then read.\nAn Italian prelate pronounced the sentence of condemnation upon Hus and his writings. Hus protested, saying that even at this hour he did not wish anything but to be convinced from Scripture. He fell upon his knees and asked God with a soft voice to forgive all his enemies. Then followed his degradation from the priesthood. He was dressed in priestly vestments and again asked to recant, and again he refused. With curses, Hus's ornaments were taken from him, his priestly tonsure was destroyed. The judgment of the Church was pronounced:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This holy synod of Constance, seeing that God\u2019s church has nothing more that it can do, relinquishes John Hus to the judgment of the secular authority and decrees that he is to be relinquished to the secular court.\u2014\u200a\nA tall paper hat was allegedly put upon his head with the inscription \"Haeresiarcha\" (\"i.e.\", the leader of a heretical movement). Hus was led away to the stake under a strong guard of armed men.\nBefore his execution, Hus is said to have declared, \"You may kill a weak goose [\"Hus\" is Czech for \"goose\"], but more powerful birds, eagles and falcons, will come after me.\" Luther modified the statement and reported that Hus had said that they might have roasted a goose, but that in a hundred years a swan would sing to whom they be forced to listen. In 1546, in his funeral sermon for Luther, Johannes Bugenhagen gave a further twist to Hus's declaration: \"You may burn a goose, but in a hundred years will come a swan you will not be able to burn.\" Twenty years later, in 1566, Johannes Mathesius, Luther's first biographer, found Hus's prophecy to be evidence of Luther's divine inspiration.\nExecution.\nAt the place of execution, he knelt, spread out his hands, and prayed aloud. The executioner undressed Hus and tied his hands behind his back with ropes. His neck was bound with a chain to a stake around which wood and straw had been piled up so that it covered him to the neck. At the last moment, the imperial marshal, von Pappenheim, in the presence of the Count Palatine, asked Hus to recant and thus save his own life. Hus declined, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;God is my witness that the things charged against me I never preached. In the same truth of the Gospel which I have written, taught, and preached, drawing upon the sayings and positions of the holy doctors, I am ready to die today.\nAnecdotally, it has been said that the executioners had trouble intensifying the fire. An old woman then came to the stake and threw a relatively small amount of brushwood on it. Upon seeing her act, a suffering Hus then exclaimed, \"O \"Sancta Simplicitas!\"\" (\"O holy simplicity!\"). It is said that when he was about to expire, he cried out, \"Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on us!\" (a variant of the Jesus Prayer). Hus's ashes were later thrown into the Rhine river as a means of preventing the veneration of his remains.\nAftermath.\nBohemian Protest.\nAs news of Hus's death spread, outrage was brewing among the local nobles and doctors. On 2 September 1415, a document now called the Bohemian Protest was signed with corresponding attached wax seals by 100 notable people from Bohemia and Moravia in protest of Jan Hus's burning. There is evidence that four documents of this kind were made in total, however only this one is known to survive and is currently held at the University of Edinburgh. The statement inside reads that \"Master John Hus was a good, just and catholic man\" that \"consistently detested all error and heresies\" and that anyone that believed that heresy was arising within Bohemia or Moravia to be \"the worst of traitors\".\nHussite Wars.\nResponding with horror to the execution of Hus, the people of Bohemia moved even more rapidly away from Papal teachings. Rome then pronounced a crusade against them (1 March 1420): Pope Martin V issued a Papal bull authorizing the execution of all supporters of Hus and Wycliffe. King Wenceslaus IV died in August 1419, and his brother, Sigismund of Hungary, was unable to establish a real government in Bohemia due to the Hussite revolt.\nThe Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Under the leadership of Jan \u017di\u017eka (c. 1360\u20131424) and later of Prokop the Great (c. 1380\u20131434)\u2014both excellent commanders\u2014the Hussites defeated the crusade and the other three crusades that followed (1419\u20131434). Fighting ended after a compromise between the Utraquist Hussites and the Catholic Council of Basel in 1436. It resulted in the Basel Compacts, in which the Catholic Church officially allowed Bohemia to practice its own version of Christianity (Hussitism). A century later, as much as ninety percent of the inhabitants of the Czech Crown lands still followed Hussite teachings.\nHus's scholarship and teachings.\nHus left reformatory writings. He translated Wycliffe's \"Trialogus\" and was very familiar with his works on the body of Jesus, the Church, and the power of the pope, as well as and especially with his sermons. There are reasons to suppose that Wycliffe's view of the Lord's Supper (consubstantiation rather than transubstantiation) had spread to Prague as early as 1399, with strong evidence that students returning from England had brought the work back with them. It gained an even wider circulation after it had been prohibited in 1403, and Hus preached and taught it. The view was seized eagerly by the Taborites, who made it the central point of their system. According to their book, the Church is not the clerical hierarchy that was generally accepted as 'the Church'; the Church is the entire body of those who from eternity have been predestined for salvation. Christ, not the pope, is its head. It is no article of faith that one must obey the pope to be saved. Neither internal membership in the Church nor churchly offices and dignities is a surety that the persons in question are members of the true Church.\nHus's efforts were designed to rid the Church of its ethical abuses. The seeds of the Reformation are clear in Hus's and Wycliffe's writings. In explaining the plight of the average Christian in Bohemia, Hus wrote, \"One pays for confession, for Mass, for the sacrament, for indulgences, for churching a woman, for a blessing, for burials, for funeral services and prayers. The very last penny that an old woman has hidden in her bundle for fear of thieves or robbery will not be saved. The villainous priest will grab it.\" After Hus's death, his followers, known as Hussites, split off into several groups including the Utraquists, Taborites and Orphans.\nApology of the Catholic Church.\nNearly six centuries later in 1999, Pope John Paul II expressed \"deep regret for the cruel death inflicted\" on Hus and added \"deep sorrow\" for Hus's death and praised his \"moral courage\". Cardinal Miloslav Vlk of the Czech Republic was instrumental in crafting John Paul II's statement. Members of the Moravian Church believe that it remains for God to judge those who were involved in the death of Hus.\nHus and the Czech language.\nThe works of Jan Hus incorporate reforms to medieval Czech orthography, including the \"hook\" (h\u00e1\u010dek) diacritic which was used to form the graphemes \u27e8\u010d\u27e9, \u27e8\u011b\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9, \u27e8\u0159\u27e9 and \u27e8\u017e\u27e9, which replaced digraphs like \u27e8cz\u27e9, \u27e8ie\u27e9, \u27e8sch\u27e9, \u27e8rz\u27e9 and \u27e8zs\u27e9; the \"dot\" above letters for strong accent, as well as the acute accent to mark long vowels \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, and \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9, in order to represent each phoneme by a single symbol. Some sources mention documented use of the special symbols in Bible translations (1462), the Schaffhausen Bible, and handwritten notes in the Bible. The symbol \u27e8\u016f\u27e9 (instead of \u27e8uo\u27e9) came later. The book \"Orthographia Bohemica\" (1406) was attributed to Hus by Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd, but it is possible that it was compiled by another author from Charles University.\nLegacy.\nA century after the Hussite Wars began, as many as 90% of inhabitants of the Czech lands were Hussites (although in the Utraquist tradition following a joint Utraquist\u2014Catholic victory in the Hussite Wars). Bohemia was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, and there are still Protestant adherents remaining in modern times, though they no longer comprise the majority: suggested historical reasons include the persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, particularly after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620; restrictions during the Communist rule; and also the ongoing secularization. Modern Czechs exhibit very high distrust of religious and other institutions.\nJan Hus was a key contributor to Protestantism, whose teachings had a strong influence on the states of Europe and on Martin Luther. The Hussite Wars resulted in the Basel Compacts, which allowed for a reformed Church in the Kingdom of Bohemia\u2014almost a century before such developments would take place in the Lutheran Reformation. The Unitas Fratrum (or Moravian Church) is the modern-day home of Hus's followers. Hus's extensive writings earned him a prominent place in Czech literary history.\nIn 1883, the Czech composer Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed his Hussite Overture based on melodies used by Hussite soldiers. It was often performed by the German conductor Hans von B\u00fclow.\nProfessor Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk used Hus's name in his speech at Geneva University on 6 July 1915, for defense against Austria and in July 1917 for the title of the first corps of troops of his legions in Russia.\nToday, the Jan Hus Memorial is located at the Prague Old Town Square (), and there are many smaller memorials in other towns throughout the Czech Republic.\nIn New York City, a church in Brooklyn (located at 153 Ocean Avenue) and a church and a theatre in Manhattan (located at 351 East 74th Street) are named for Hus, the John Hus Moravian Church and the Jan Hus Playhouse, respectively. Although Manhattan's church and theatre share a single building and management, the playhouse's productions are usually nonreligious or nondenominational.\nA statue of Jan Hus was erected at the Union Cemetery in Bohemia, New York (on Long Island) by Czech immigrants to the New York area in 1893.\nIn contrast to the popular perception that Hus was a proto-Protestant, some Eastern Orthodox Christians have argued that his theology was far closer to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Jan Hus is considered a martyr saint in some jurisdictions of the Orthodox Church. The Czechoslovak Hussite Church claims to trace its origin to Hus, to be \"neo-Hussite\", and contains mixed Eastern Orthodox and Protestant elements. Nowadays, he is considered a saint by the Orthodox churches of Greece, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, and several others.\nHus was voted the greatest hero of the Czech nation in a 2015 survey by Czech Radio.\nIn popular culture.\nHus appears in the \"Mezi proudy\" trilogy by writer Alois Jir\u00e1sek.\nJan Hus is a major character of the \"Hussite Revolutionary Trilogy\" directed by Otakar V\u00e1vra. He is played by Zden\u011bk \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek in the 1954 film \"Jan Hus.\"\nJan Hus is played by Rod Colbin in the 1977 American film \"John Hus\".\nJan Hus is a major character in the stage play \"\u010cesk\u00e9 nebe\".\nThe Czech television film \"Jan Hus\" was released in 2015. It starred Mat\u011bj H\u00e1dek.\nJan Hus is frequently mentioned in the 2018 video game ' and its sequel, ', both of which take place in the lead up to the Hussite Wars.\nHus appears in the 2022 film \"Medieval\" played by Viktor Kri\u0161tof.\nThe lives of Hus and Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd are the subject of the 2014 \"Hus a Chel\u010dick\u00fd\" book for older children, written and illustrated by Ren\u00e1ta Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1. The book won the Association of Czech Graphic Artists' HOLLAR award for its illustrations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16032", "revid": "50419451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16032", "title": "Julio-Claudian dynasty", "text": "Roman imperial dynasty\nThe Julio-Claudian dynasty comprised the first five Roman emperors: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.\nThis line of emperors ruled the Roman Empire, from its formation (under Augustus, in 27 BC) until the last of the line, Emperor Nero, committed suicide (in AD 68).\nThe name \"Julio-Claudian\" is a historiographical term, deriving from the two families composing the imperial dynasty: the Julii Caesares and Claudii Nerones.\nNomenclature.\n\"Julius\" and \"Claudius\" were two Roman family names; in classical Latin, they came second. Roman family names were inherited from father to son, but a Roman aristocrat could\u2014either during his life or in his will\u2014adopt an heir if he lacked a natural son. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, the adopted son would replace his original family name with the name of his adopted family. A famous example of this custom is Julius Caesar's adoption of his great-nephew, Gaius Octavius.\nPrimogeniture is notably absent in the history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Augustus, Caligula and Nero failed to father biological and legitimate sons. Tiberius' own son, Drusus predeceased him. Only Claudius was outlived by his son, Britannicus, although he opted to promote his adopted son Nero as his successor to the throne. Adoption ultimately became a tool that most Julio-Claudian emperors utilized in order to promote their chosen heir to the front of the succession. Augustus\u2014himself an adopted son of his great-uncle, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar\u2014adopted his stepson Tiberius as his son and heir. Tiberius was, in turn, required to adopt his nephew Germanicus, the father of Caligula and brother of Claudius. Caligula adopted his cousin Tiberius Gemellus (grandson of the emperor Tiberius) shortly before executing him. Claudius adopted his great-nephew and stepson Nero, who, lacking a natural or adopted son of his own, ended the reign of the Julio-Claudian dynasty with his fall from power and subsequent suicide.\nAugustus (\"Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus\"), as Caesar's adopted son and heir, discarded the family name of his natural father and initially renamed himself \"Gaius Julius Caesar\" after his adoptive father. It was also customary for the adopted son to acknowledge his original family by adding an extra name at the end of his new name. As such, Augustus' adopted name would have been \"Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus\". However, there is no evidence that he ever used the name Octavianus.\nFollowing Augustus' ascension as the first emperor of the Roman Empire in 27 BC, his family became a \"de facto\" royal house, known in historiography as the \"Julio-Claudian dynasty\". For various reasons, the Julio-Claudians followed in the example of Julius Caesar and Augustus by utilizing adoption as a tool for dynastic succession. The next four emperors were closely related through a combination of blood relation, marriage and adoption.\nTiberius (\"Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti Filius Augustus\"), a Claudian by birth, became Augustus' stepson after the latter's marriage to Livia, who divorced Tiberius' natural father in the process. Tiberius' connection to the Julian side of the Imperial family grew closer when he married Augustus' only daughter, Julia the Elder. He ultimately succeeded Augustus as emperor in AD 14 after becoming his stepfather's adopted son and heir.\nCaligula (\"Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\") was born into the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family, thereby making him the first actual \"Julio-Claudian\" emperor. His father, Germanicus, was the son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, the son of Livia and the daughter of Octavia Minor respectively. Germanicus was also a great-nephew of Augustus on his mother's side and nephew of Tiberius on his father's side. His wife, Agrippina the Elder, was a granddaughter of Augustus. Through Agrippina, Germanicus' children\u2014including Caligula\u2014were Augustus' great-grandchildren. When Augustus adopted Tiberius, the latter was required to adopt his brother's eldest son as well, thus allowing Germanicus' side of the Imperial family to inherit the Julius nomen.\nClaudius (\"Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\"), the younger brother of Germanicus, was a Claudian on the side of his father, Nero Claudius Drusus, younger brother of Tiberius. However, he was also related to the Julian branch of the Imperial family through his mother, Antonia Minor. As a son of Antonia, Claudius was a great-nephew of Augustus. Moreover, he was also Augustus' step-grandson due to the fact that his father was a stepson of Augustus. Unlike Tiberius and Germanicus, both of whom were born as Claudians and became adopted Julians, Claudius was not adopted into the Julian family. Upon becoming emperor, however, he added the Julian-affiliated cognomen \"Caesar\" to his full name.\nNero (\"Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\") was a great-great-grandson of Augustus and Livia through his mother, Agrippina the Younger. The younger Agrippina was a daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, as well as Caligula's sister. Through his mother, Nero was related by blood to the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family. However, he was born into the Domitii Ahenobarbi on his father's side. Nero became a Claudian in name as a result of Agrippina's marriage to her uncle, Claudius, who ultimately adopted her son as his own. He succeeded Claudius in AD 54, becoming the last direct descendant of Augustus to rule the Roman Empire. Within a year of Nero's suicide in AD 68, the Julio-Claudian dynasty was succeeded by the Flavian emperors following a brief civil war over the vacant Imperial throne.\nRise and fall of the Julio-Claudians.\nAugustus.\nLacking any male child and heir, Augustus married his only child\u2014a daughter\u2014Julia to his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus. Marcellus, however, died of food poisoning in 23 BC. Augustus then married his widowed daughter to his loyal friend, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, previously married to Augustus' niece, the sister of Marcellus. This marriage produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Julia the Younger, Agrippina the Elder, and Agrippa Postumus.\nGaius and Lucius, the first two children of Julia and Agrippa, were adopted by Augustus and became heirs to the throne; however, Augustus also showed great favour toward his wife Livia's two children from her first marriage: Tiberius and Drusus. They were successful military leaders who had fought against the barbarian Germanic tribes.\nAgrippa died in 12 BC, and Tiberius was ordered by Augustus to divorce his wife Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Agrippa by his first marriage, and marry his stepsister, the twice-widowed Julia. Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, died in 9 BC after falling from a horse. Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers, but shortly thereafter, in 6 BC, he went into voluntary exile in Rhodes. After the early deaths of both Lucius (AD 2) and Gaius (AD 4) and the exile of both Julia the Elder and Younger for adultery, a turn of events which saw the elder Julia's half brother Publius Cornelius Scipio exiled for treason, Mark Antony's son Iullus Antonius committing suicide and Julia the Younger's husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus being executed for conspiracy, Augustus was forced to recognize Tiberius as the next Roman emperor. Augustus banished his grandson Postumus Agrippa, who was adopted after the death of his brothers, to the small island of Planasia (around AD 6 or 7) where he was later executed, and Tiberius was recalled to Rome and officially adopted by Augustus. By Augustus' request, Tiberius adopted his nephew Germanicus, son of his late brother Drusus and biological great-nephew of Augustus through his mother. Germanicus subsequently married Augustus' granddaughter Agrippina.\nTiberius.\nOn 19 August AD 14, Augustus died. Tiberius had already been established as Princeps in all but name, and his position as heir was confirmed in Augustus' will.\nDespite his difficult relationship with the Senate, Tiberius' first years were generally good. He stayed true to Augustus's plans for the succession and favoured his adopted son and nephew Germanicus over his natural son, Drusus, as did the Roman populace. On Tiberius' request, Germanicus was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime military zone of Germania, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes from AD 14 to 16. Germanicus died in Syria in AD 19 and, on his deathbed, accused the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, of murdering him at Tiberius's orders. With Germanicus dead, Tiberius began elevating his own son Drusus to replace him as the Imperial successor. By this time Tiberius had left more of the day-to-day running of the Empire to Lucius Aelius Sejanus.\nSejanus created an atmosphere of fear in Rome, controlling a network of informers and spies whose incentive to accuse others of treason was a share in the accused's property after their conviction and death. Treason trials became commonplace; few members of the Roman aristocracy were safe. The trials played up to Tiberius' growing paranoia, which made him more reliant on Sejanus, as well as allowing Sejanus to eliminate potential rivals. Victims of this reign of terror related to the imperial family included Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus, second husband of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania, who had since died, and Decimus Haterius Agrippa, grandson of Agrippa and husband of Augustus' great-niece.\nTiberius, perhaps sensitive to this ambition, rejected Sejanus's initial proposal to marry Livilla, Germanicus' sister and the widow of Tiberius' son Drusus the Younger, who had since died, in AD 25, but later had withdrawn his objections so that, in AD 30, Sejanus was betrothed to Julia Livia, daughter of Livilla and Drusus the Younger. Sejanus' family connection to the Imperial house was now imminent, and in AD 31 Sejanus held the Consulship with the emperor as his colleague, an honour Tiberius reserved only for heirs to the throne. When he was summoned to a meeting of the Senate later that year on 18 October AD 31, he probably expected to receive a share of the tribunician power. Instead, however, Tiberius' letter to the Senate, completely unexpectedly, requested the destruction of Sejanus and his faction. A purge followed, in which Sejanus and his most prominent supporters were killed. With Drusus dead and having had Germanicus' elder two sons Nero and Drusus convicted of treason and killed, along with their mother Agrippina, Tiberius appointed Caligula, Germanicus' youngest son, and Tiberius Gemellus, the son of Drusus the Younger and grandson of Tiberius, co-heirs. Drusus III's wife Aemilia Lepida was later forced to commit suicide after being accused of adultery.\nRome's second Emperor died at the port town of Misenum on 16 March AD 37, at the age of 78 years, having reigned for 23 years. Suetonius writes that the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard Naevius Sutorius Macro smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession. According to Suetonius, he was known for his cruelty and debauchery through his perversion on the island of Capri where he forced young boys and girls into orgies. On one account when one of the boys complained, Tiberius had his legs broken.\nCaligula.\nAlthough Augustus' succession plans were all but ruined due to the deaths of more than several family members, including many of his own descendants, in the end, Tiberius remained faithful to his predecessor's wishes that the next emperor would hail from the Julian side of the Imperial family. Thus, Tiberius was succeeded by Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, the sole-remaining son of his nephew and adopted son Germanicus. The new emperor was a great grandson of Augustus through his mother Agrippina the Elder thus making him a Julian but he was also a Claudian through his father Germanicus being the son of Livia's younger son Drusus the Elder. More commonly remembered in history by his childhood nickname Caligula, he was the third Roman Emperor ruling from AD 37 to 41.\nWhen Tiberius died on 16 March AD 37, Caligula was well-positioned to assume power, despite the obstacle of Tiberius's will, which named him and his cousin Tiberius Gemellus as joint heirs. Caligula ordered Gemellus killed within his first year in power. Backed by Naevius Sutorius Macro, Caligula asserted himself as sole princeps, though he later had Macro disposed of as well. Following Gemellus' death, Caligula marked his brother-in-law, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, husband of his sister Julia Drusilla, as his heir. However, after Drusilla's death, Lepidus was accused of having affairs with Caligula's other sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla and he was executed. He had previously had Drusilla's first husband Lucius Cassius Longinus killed and upon the death of Agrippina's husband Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, he seized his inheritance.\nSeveral unsuccessful assassination attempts were made on Caligula's life. The successful conspiracy that ended Caligula's life was hatched by the disgruntled Praetorian Guard with backing by the Senate. The historian Josephus claims that the conspirators wished to restore the Republic while the historian Suetonius claims their motivations were mostly personal. On 24 January AD 41, the Praetorian tribune Cassius Chaerea and his men stopped Caligula alone in an underground passage leading to a theater. They stabbed him to death. Together with another tribune, Cornelius Sabinus, he killed Caligula's wife Caesonia and their infant daughter Julia Drusilla on the same day.\nClaudius.\nAfter Caligula's death, the Senate attempted and failed to restore the Republic. Claudius, Caligula's paternal uncle, became emperor by the instigation of the Praetorian Guards.\nDespite his lack of political experience, and the disapproval of the people of Rome, Claudius proved to be an able administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the empire, including the invasion of Britain in AD 43. He took a personal interest in the law, presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day; however, he was seen as vulnerable throughout his rule, particularly by the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position\u2014resulting in the deaths of many senators. Claudius also suffered tragic setbacks in his personal life. He married four times (to, in order, Plautia Urgulanilla, Aelia Paetina, Valeria Messalina and, finally, Agrippina the Younger) and is referenced by Suetonius as being easily manipulated. This is particularly evident during his marriage to Agrippina the Younger, his niece. Messalina saw several members of the dynasty eliminated, notably arranging for the executions of Claudius' nieces Julia Livilla, daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, and Julia Livia, daughter of Livilla and Drusus the Younger, as well as Julia Livilla's husband Marcus Vinicius, her mother's husband Appius Junius Silanus, Gaius Asinius Pollio, son of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania by her second husband and whose brother Servius Asinius Celer was also killed around this time, Claudius' son-in-law Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, and his parents Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi and Scribonia. Messalina herself was finally executed after being charged with adultery.\nClaudius' reign also included several attempts on his life. In order to gain political support, he married Agrippina and adopted his great-nephew Nero.\nWith his adoption on 25 February AD 50, Nero became heir to the throne, over Claudius' own son Britannicus. Claudius died on 13 October AD 54, and Nero became emperor. A number of ancient historians accuse Agrippina of poisoning Claudius, but details on these private events vary widely. These events are recounted in book 12 of the Annals of Tacitus, book 61 of Cassius Dio's Roman History, and in the biographies of Nero and Claudius by Suetonius.\nNero.\nNero became emperor in AD 54 at sixteen, the youngest emperor yet. Like his maternal uncle Caligula before him, Nero was also a direct descendant of Augustus, a fact which made his ascension to the throne much easier and smoother than it had been for Tiberius or Claudius. Ancient historians describe Nero's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother Agrippina the Younger, his tutor Seneca, and the Praetorian Prefect Burrus, especially in the first year. In the first year of his reign, Nero had left all of the day-to-day running of the Empire to his mother Agrippina the Younger. He was made Emperor over his step-brother, Claudius' son Britannicus, who he had killed. Agrippina was believed to have poisoned Claudius, having allegedly poisoned her second husband Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus. She had also arranged the deaths of Caligula's third wife, Lollia Paulina and Messalina's mother Domitia Lepida the Younger. She saw that the dynasty's numbers dwindle with the execution of Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a grandson of Julia the Younger, to strengthen Nero's claim, having previously arranged the death of his brother Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus. In AD 55, Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator. He was consul four times between AD 55 and 60. Nero consolidated power over time through the execution and banishment of his rivals and slowly usurped authority from the Senate. He reportedly arranged the death of his own mother and after divorcing his wife Claudia Octavia, daughter of Claudius' and Messalina, he had her killed. Other relatives whom Nero was believed to have had killed were Claudius' daughter by Aelia Paetina, Claudia Antonia, her husband and half-brother of Messalina, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus, brother of Marcus and Lucius Junius Silanus Torquantus, as well as Marcus' son, also named Lucius, his aunt Domitia Lepida the Elder, and Rubellius Plautus, son of Julia Livia along with his wife, children and father-in-law.\nIn AD 64 Rome burned. Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as large reconstruction projects. To fund this, the provinces were heavily taxed following the fire.\nBy AD 65, senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the Pisonian conspiracy, led by Gaius Calpurnius Piso, an adoptive descendant of Triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, a governor of Syria who committed suicide after being accused of killing Germanicus, and first husband of Livia Orestilla, Caligula's second wife. The conspiracy failed and its members were executed. Vacancies after the conspiracy allowed Nymphidius Sabinus, a grandson of former imperial freedman Gaius Julius Callistus, who claimed to be an illegitimate son of Caligula, to rise in the Praetorian Guard.\nIn late AD 67 or early 68, Vindex, the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis in Gaul, rebelled against Nero's tax policies. Lucius Virginius Rufus, the governor of superior Germany, was sent to put down the rebellion. To gain support, Vindex called on Galba, the governor of Hispania Citerior (in the Iberian Peninsula), to become emperor. Virginius Rufus defeated Vindex's forces and Vindex committed suicide. Galba was declared a public enemy and his legion was confined in the city of Clunia.\nNero had regained the control of the empire militarily, but this opportunity was used by his enemies in Rome. Nymphidius Sabinus, who desired to become emperor himself, bribed the Praetorian Guard to betray Nero. Sabinus was later murdered in favour of Galba.\nNero reportedly committed suicide with the help of his scribe Epaphroditus. The Senate had been trying to preserve the dynastic bloodline by saving Nero's life, and were additionally reluctant to let someone who was not of the family become emperor; however, once he had committed suicide, and with Galba marching on the city, it had no choice but to declare him a public enemy posthumously. With his death, the reign of the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos then ensued in the Year of the Four Emperors.\nSurvival after the fall of Nero.\nThe lineage of Augustus endured into the era of the Nerva-Antonine dynasty, the house that succeeded the Flavians. Augustus' bloodline outlived his dynasty through the descendants of his first granddaughter, Julia the Younger, who married Lucius Aemilius Paullus and gave birth to Aemilia Lepida. After marrying Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, Aemilia gave birth to several children, including Junia Calvina and Junia Lepida. Although Calvina died childless, she was married to Lucius Vitellius, whose elder brother was the short-lived emperor Vitellius. Her younger sister, Junia Lepida, married Gaius Cassius Longinus and produced a daughter called Cassia Longina. The Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo married Cassia, who provided him with two daughters, including Domitia Longina, later wife of the emperor Domitian. By her first husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia Plautius Aelianus, Domitia Longina may have been the mother or maternal grandmother of Lucius Fundanius Lamia Aelianus. Fundanius married Rupilia, sister of Rupilia Faustina, and had a son, Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus, consul in AD 145, as well as a daughter, Fundania, married to Marcus Annius Libo, consul in AD 128. Fundania's offspring included Marcus Annius Libo, suffect consul in AD 161, and Annia Fundania Faustina (d. AD 192), wife of Titus Pomponius Proculus Vitrasius Pollio. Faustina and both of her children, Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio (d. AD 182) and Vitrasia Faustina, were executed by Commodus on the charge of conspiracy.\nIn addition to Cassia Longina, Junia Lepida gave birth to a son called Cassius Lepidus. Around AD 80 Lepidus had a daughter named Cassia Lepida, who married Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus, a descendant of Herod the Great, Ptolemy VI Philometor and Antiochus VIII Gryphus. Julia Cassia Alexandria, Lepida's daughter by Berenicianus, married Gaius Avidius Heliodorus and ultimately gave birth to Gaius Avidius Cassius. Avidius Cassius had three children with his wife (named either Volusia Vettia or Volusia Maeciana); they were Avidius Heliodorus, Avidius Maecianus and Avidia Alexandra. In AD 175 Cassius was proclaimed emperor after he received erroneous news of the death of Marcus Aurelius, whose survival made Cassius a usurper of the empire. Cassius' rebellion ended three months into his bid for the throne when one of his centurions assassinated him in favour of Marcus Aurelius. Cassius' daughter, Avidia, is known to have had four children with her husband, Titius Claudius Dryantianus Antonius: the senator Claudius Cassius Aggripinus, Claudia Maeciana Alexandra, Claudia Vettia Agrippina, and Claudia Dryantilla Platonis, one of the women who took part in the \"ludi saeculares\" of the year AD 204.\nTiberius' lineage may have survived into the 2nd century through the offspring of his granddaughter Julia Livia, wife of Gaius Rubellius Blandus. Apart from a son, Rubellius Plautus, executed by Nero in AD 62, Julia had a daughter or step-daughter, Rubellia Bassa, who married a maternal uncle of the future Roman Emperor Nerva by the name of Gaius Octavius Laenas. Together Laenas and Bassa had at least one child, a surmised son, who was the grandfather of Sergius Octavius Laenas Pontianus, consul in AD 131. \nRelationships among the rulers.\nThe great-uncle/great-nephew blood relationship and/or adopted son relationship was commonly found among the rulers of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\nThe other recurring relationship between emperor and successor is that of stepfather/stepson, a relationship not by blood but by marriage:\nThe uncle/nephew relationship is also prominent:\nThere were several instances of Emperors being father-in-law and son-in-law to each other:\nThe following bullet points illustrate the lineage of Julio-Claudian emperors (adoptions included; emperors in bold):\nNo Julio-Claudian emperor was a blood descendant of his immediate predecessor. Although Tiberius and Claudius had potential heirs (Tiberius Gemellus, grandson of Tiberius through his son Drusus, and Britannicus, son of Claudius, respectively) available for the succession, both were, in turn, ultimately succeeded by their great-nephews Caligula and Nero, respectively.\nThe fact that ordinary father-son (or grandfather-grandson) succession did not occur has contributed to the image of the Julio-Claudian court presented in Robert Graves's \"I, Claudius\" as a dangerous world where scheming family members were all too ready to murder the direct heirs so as to bring themselves, their own immediate families, or their lovers closer to the succession.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are sometimes defined to exclude the uniform polyhedrons. There are ninety-two solids with such a property: the first solids are the pyramids, cupolas, and a rotunda; some of the solids may be constructed by attaching with those previous solids, whereas others may not. \nDefinition and background.\nA Johnson solid is a convex polyhedron whose faces are all regular polygons. The convex polyhedron means as bounded intersections of finitely many half-spaces, or as the convex hull of finitely many points. Although there is no restriction that any given regular polygon cannot be a face of a Johnson solid, some authors require that Johnson solids are not uniform. This means that a Johnson solid is neither a Platonic solid, Archimedean solid, prism, nor antiprism. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are nearly regular, but some are not precisely regular, is known as a near-miss Johnson solid.\nThe solids were named after the mathematicians Norman Johnson and Victor Zalgaller. published a list including ninety-two solids\u2014excluding the five Platonic solids, the thirteen Archimedean solids, the infinitely many uniform prisms, and the infinitely many uniform antiprisms\u2014and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only ninety-two, but he did conjecture that there were no others. proved that Johnson's list was complete.\nNaming and enumeration.\nThe naming of Johnson solids follows a flexible and precise descriptive formula that allows many solids to be named in multiple different ways without compromising the accuracy of each name as a description. Most Johnson solids can be constructed from the first few solids (pyramids, cupolae, and a rotunda), together with the Platonic and Archimedean solids, prisms, and antiprisms; the center of a particular solid's name will reflect these ingredients. From there, a series of prefixes are attached to the word to indicate additions, rotations, and transformations:\nThe last three operations\u2014\"augmentation\", \"diminution\", and \"gyration\"\u2014can be performed multiple times for certain large solids. \"Bi-\" &amp; \"Tri-\" indicate a double and triple operation respectively. For example, a \"bigyrate\" solid has two rotated cupolae, and a \"tridiminished\" solid has three removed pyramids or cupolae. In certain large solids, a distinction is made between solids where altered faces are parallel and solids where altered faces are oblique. \"Para-\" indicates the former, that the solid in question has altered parallel faces, and \"meta-\" the latter, altered oblique faces. For example, a \"parabiaugmented\" solid has had two parallel faces augmented, and a \"metabigyrate\" solid has had two oblique faces gyrated.\nThe last few Johnson solids have names based on certain polygon complexes from which they are assembled. These names are defined by Johnson with the following nomenclature:\nThe enumeration of Johnson solids may be denoted as formula_1, where formula_2 denoted the list's enumeration (an example is formula_3 denoted the first Johnson solid, the equilateral square pyramid). The following is the list of ninety-two Johnson solids, with the enumeration followed according to the list of :\nSome of the Johnson solids may be categorized as elementary polyhedra. This means the polyhedron cannot be separated by a plane to create two small convex polyhedra with regular faces; examples of Johnson solids are the first six Johnson solids\u2014square pyramid, pentagonal pyramid, triangular cupola, square cupola, pentagonal cupola, and pentagonal rotunda\u2014tridiminished icosahedron, parabidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron, tridiminished rhombicosidodecahedron, snub disphenoid, snub square antiprism, sphenocorona, sphenomegacorona, hebesphenomegacorona, disphenocingulum, bilunabirotunda, and triangular hebesphenorotunda. The other Johnson solids are composite polyhedron because they are constructed by attaching some elementary polyhedra.\nProperties.\nAs the definition above, a Johnson solid is a convex polyhedron with regular polygons as their faces. However, there are several properties possessed by each of them.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the longest-serving of the original disc jockeys on BBC Radio 1, broadcasting regularly from 1967 until his death in 2004.\nPeel was one of the first broadcasters to play psychedelic rock and progressive rock records on British radio. He is widely acknowledged for promoting artists of many genres, including pop, dub reggae, punk rock and post-punk, electronic music and dance music, indie rock, extreme metal and UK rap. Fellow DJ Paul Gambaccini described Peel as \"the most important single person in popular music from approximately 1967 through 1978. He broke more important artists than any individual.\"\nPeel's Radio 1 shows included the regular \"Peel Sessions\", which usually consisted of four songs recorded by an artist in the BBC's studios, often providing the first major national coverage to bands that later achieved fame. The annual Festive Fifty countdown of his listeners' favourite records of the year was a notable part of his promotion of new music.\nPeel appeared on television occasionally as one of the presenters of \"Top of the Pops\" in the 1980s, and provided voice-over commentary for a number of BBC programmes. He became popular with the audience of BBC Radio 4 for his \"Home Truths\" programme, which ran from the 1990s, featuring unusual stories from listeners' domestic lives.\nEarly life.\nPeel was born John Robert Parker Ravenscroft at a nursing home in Heswall in Merseyside on 30 August 1939, the son of Joan Mary (n\u00e9e Swainson) and cotton merchant Robert Leslie Ravenscroft. He had two younger brothers and grew up in the nearby village of Burton. He was educated as a boarder at Shrewsbury School, where future Monty Python member Michael Palin was his contemporary. In his posthumously published autobiography, Peel said that he was raped by an older pupil while at the school.\nPeel was an avid radio listener and record collector from an early age, firstly of music offered by the American Forces Network and Radio Luxembourg. He recalled an early desire to host a radio programme of his own \"so that I could play music that I heard and wanted others to hear\". His housemaster, R. H. J. Brooke, whom Peel described as \"extraordinarily eccentric\" and \"amazingly perceptive\", wrote on one of his school reports, \"Perhaps it's possible that John can form some kind of nightmarish career out of his enthusiasm for unlistenable records and his delight in writing long and facetious essays.\"\nPeel completed his national service in 1959 in the Royal Artillery as a B2 radar operator. Afterwards, he worked as a mill operative at Townhead Mill in Rochdale and returned each weekend to Heswall on a scooter borrowed from his sister. While in Rochdale during the week, he stayed in a bed-and-breakfast in the area of Milkstone Road and Drake Street, and developed long-term associations with the town as the years progressed.\nCareer.\nUnited States.\nIn 1960, aged 21, Peel went to the United States to work for a cotton producer who had business dealings with his father. He took a number of other jobs afterwards, including working as a travelling insurance salesman. While in Dallas, Texas, where the insurance company he worked for was based, he conversed with the presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, and his running mate Lyndon B. Johnson, who were touring the city during the 1960 election campaign, and took photographs of them. Following Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Peel passed himself off as a reporter for the \"Liverpool Echo\" in order to attend the arraignment of Lee Harvey Oswald. He and a friend can be seen in the footage of the 22/23 November midnight press conference at the Dallas Police Department when Oswald was paraded before the media. He later phoned in the story to the \"Echo\".\nWhile working for the insurance company, Peel wrote programs for punched card entry for an IBM 1410 computer (which led to his entry in \"Who's Who\" calling him a former computer programmer), and he got his first radio job working unpaid for WRR (AM) in Dallas. There, he presented the second hour of the Monday night programme \"Kat's Karavan\", which was primarily hosted by the American singer and radio personality Jim Lowe. Following this, and as Beatlemania hit the United States, Peel was hired by the Dallas radio station KLIF as the official Beatles correspondent on the strength of his connection to Liverpool. He later worked for KOMA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, until 1965, when he moved to KMEN in San Bernardino, California, and used his birth name, John Ravenscroft, to present the breakfast show.\nReturn to England.\nPeel returned to England in early 1967 and found work with the offshore pirate radio station Radio London. He was offered the midnight-to-two shift, which gradually developed into a programme, \"The Perfumed Garden\".\nPeel's show was an outlet for the music of the UK underground scene. He played classic blues, folk music and psychedelic rock, with an emphasis on the new music emerging from Los Angeles and San Francisco. As important as the musical content of the programme was the personal \u2013 sometimes confessional \u2013 tone of Peel's presentation, and the listener participation it engendered. Underground events he had attended during his periods of shore leave, such as the UFO Club and the 14 Hour Technicolor Dream, together with causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres like the drug busts of the Rolling Stones and John \"Hoppy\" Hopkins, were discussed between records. All this was far removed from Radio London's daytime format. Listeners sent Peel letters, poems and records from their own collections so that the programme became a vehicle for two-way communication; by the final week of Radio London he was receiving far more mail than any other DJ on the station.\nAfter the closure of Radio London in 1967, Peel wrote a column, \"The Perfumed Garden\", for the underground newspaper the \"International Times\" (from autumn 1967 to mid-1969).\nBBC.\nWhen Radio London closed on 14 August 1967, Peel joined the BBC's new music station, BBC Radio 1, which was first broadcast on 30 September 1967. Unlike Big L, Radio 1 was not a full-time station but a broadcaster of a mixture of recorded music and live studio orchestras. Peel said he felt he was hired because the BBC \"had no real idea what they were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn't anybody else\". Peel presented a programme called \"Top Gear.\" At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs (Pete Drummond and Tommy Vance were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of \"Top Gear.\" He presented the show until it ended in 1975.\nIn 1969, after hosting a trailer for a BBC programme on VD on his \"Night Ride\" programme, Peel received significant media attention because he divulged on air that he had suffered from a sexually transmitted disease earlier that year. This admission was later used in an attempt to discredit him when he appeared as a defence witness in the 1971 \"Oz\" obscenity trial.\nThe \"Night Ride\" programme, advertised by the BBC as an exploration of words and music, seemed to take up from where \"The Perfumed Garden\" had left off. It featured rock, folk, blues, classical and electronic music. A unique feature of the programme was the inclusion of tracks, mostly of exotic non-Western music, drawn from the BBC Sound Archive; the most popular of these were gathered on a BBC Records LP, \"John Peel's Archive Things\" (1970). \"Night Ride\" also featured poetry readings and numerous interviews with a wide range of guests, including his friends Marc Bolan, journalist and musician Mick Farren, poet Pete Roche, singer-songwriter Bridget St John and stars such as the Byrds, the Rolling Stones and John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The programme captured much of the creative activity of the underground scene. Its anti-establishment stance and unpredictability, however, did not find approval with the BBC hierarchy and it ended in September 1969 after 18 months.\nIn his sleeve notes to the \"Archive Things\" LP Peel calls the free-form nature of \"Night Ride\" his preferred radio format. His subsequent shows featured a mixture of records and live sessions, a format that would characterise his Radio 1 programmes for the rest of his career.\nPunk era.\nPeel's enthusiasm for music outside the mainstream occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the station controller Derek Chinnery contacted John Walters and asked him to confirm that the show was not playing any punk, which he (Chinnery) had read about in the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.\nIn a 1990 interview, Peel recalled his 1976 discovery of the first album by New York punk band the Ramones as a seminal event,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1979, Peel stated: \"They leave you to get on with it. I'm paid money by the BBC not to go off and work for a commercial radio station ... I wouldn't want to go to one anyway, because they wouldn't let me do what the BBC let me do.\"\nPeel's reputation as an important DJ who broke unsigned acts into the mainstream was such that young hopefuls sent him an enormous number of records, CDs, and tapes. When he returned home from a three-week holiday at the end of 1986 there were 173 LPs, 91 12\"s and 179 7\"s waiting for him. In 1983 Alan Melina and Jeff Chegwin, the music publishers for unsigned artist Billy Bragg, drove to the Radio 1 studios with a mushroom biryani and a copy of his record after hearing Peel mention that he was hungry; the subsequent airplay launched Billy Bragg's career.\nIn addition to his Radio 1 show, Peel broadcast as a disc jockey on the BBC World Service, on the British Forces Broadcasting Service (\"John Peel's Music on BFBS\") for 30 years, VPRO Radio3 in the Netherlands, YLE Radio Mafia in Finland, \u00d63 in Austria (Nachtexpress), and on Radio 4U, Radio Eins (Peel ...), Radio Bremen (Ritz) and some independent radio stations around FSK Hamburg in Germany. As a result of his BFBS programme he was voted, in Germany, \"Top DJ in Europe\".\nPeel was an occasional presenter of \"Top of the Pops\" on BBC1 from the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, and in particular from 1982 to 1987 when he appeared regularly. In 1971 he appeared not as presenter but performer, alongside Rod Stewart and the Faces, pretending to play mandolin on \"Maggie May\". He often presented the BBC's television coverage of music events, notably the Glastonbury Festival.\nFrom 26 September to 31 October 1987, Peel produced a six-part radio series on BBC Radio 1 called \"Peeling Back the Years\". In it, he discussed his life and career at length with his long-time producer John Walters and also played some of his favorite records. The show's theme music was \"Blue Tango\" by Ray Martin which, Peel revealed, was the first record he ever bought.\nLater years.\nBetween 1995 and 1997, Peel presented \"Offspring\", a show about children, on BBC Radio 4. In 1998, \"Offspring\" grew into the magazine-style documentary show \"Home Truths\". When he took on the job presenting the programme, which was about everyday life in British families, Peel requested that it be free from celebrities, as he found real-life stories more entertaining. \"Home Truths\" was described by occasional stand-in presenter John Walters as being \"about people who had fridges called Renfrewshire\". Peel also made regular contributions to BBC Two's humorous look at the irritations of modern life \"Grumpy Old Men\". His only appearances in an acting role in film or television were in Harry Enfield's \"Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era\" as John Past Bedtime, and in 1999 as a \"grumpy old man who catalogues records\" in the film \"Five Seconds to Spare\". However, he had provided narration for others.\nHe appeared as a celebrity guest on a number of TV shows, including \"This Is Your Life\" (1996, BBC), \"Travels With My Camera\" (1996, Channel 4 TV) and \"Going Home\" (2002, ITV TV), and presented the 1997 Channel 4 series \"Classic Trains\". He was also in demand as a voice-over artist for television documentaries, such as BBC One's \"A Life of Grime\".\nIn April 2003, the publishers Transworld successfully wooed Peel with a package worth \u00a31.5 million for his autobiography, having placed an advert in a national newspaper aimed only at Peel. Unfinished at the time of his death, it was completed by Sheila and journalist Ryan Gilbey. It was published in October 2005 under the title \"Margrave of the Marshes\". A collection of Peel's miscellaneous writings, \"The Olivetti Chronicles\", was published in 2008.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages.\nAt the age of 25, while residing in Dallas in 1965, Peel married 15-year-old American girl Shirley Anne Milburn. The marriage was never happy, with reports that she was often violent towards him. Although she accompanied Peel back to England in 1967, they were soon separated and the divorce became final in 1973. In 1987, Milburn took her own life.\nPeel married Sheila Gilhooly on 31 August 1974. The reception was held at Regent's Park, with Rod Stewart as best man. In the 1970s, Peel and Gilhooly moved to \"Peel Acres\", a thatched cottage in Great Finborough. In later years, Peel broadcast many of his shows from a studio in the house, with Gilhooly and their children often being involved or at least mentioned. Peel's passion for Liverpool FC was reflected in his children's names: William Robert Anfield Ravenscroft, Alexandra Mary Anfield Ravenscroft, Thomas James Dalglish Ravenscroft, and Florence Victoria Shankly Ravenscroft. Thomas, now better known as Tom Ravenscroft, also became a radio DJ.\nHealth problems.\nAt the age of 62, in 2001, Peel was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes following many years of fatigue.\nAllegations of sexual misconduct.\nSeveral journalists, including Sarah Woolley and Fiona Sturges, writing in \"The Independent\", have questioned Peel's legacy due to sexual relations with underage fans. Frequently cited is his first marriage to Milburn in 1965, Milburn was aged 15 and Peel 25 when they married; although this was legal in Texas at the time. Peel always maintained that she lied about her age at their time of marriage, claiming she was 16.\nPeel told \"The Guardian\" in 1975, regarding his relations with female fans, \"Well, of course, I didn't ask for ID. All they wanted me to do was abuse them, sexually, which, of course, I was only too happy to do.\"\nHe sardonically told \"The Sunday Correspondent\" in 1989, \"Girls used to queue up outside. By and large not usually for shagging. Oral sex they were particularly keen on, I remember. There was one extraordinary older woman - when I say older, I mean about 21 - came in and just climbed into bed with me. And we had a quick shag and she got dressed and went away again. So to go from years of self-abuse - I was unimaginably innocent by modern standards until I was 21 - to find yourself in that sort of position was like having all your masturbation fantasies becoming fact. But with it came dangers. One of my, er, regular customers, as it were, turned out to be 13, though she looked older. It became expedient to move to Oklahoma\".\nIn 2012 a woman, Jane Nevin, came forward stating that she had a three-month affair with Peel in 1969, when she was 15 and he was 30. She said they had unprotected sex; this was shortly after Peel discussed contracting a sexually transmitted disease. The relationship resulted in a \"traumatic\" abortion. She stated that, \"Looking back, it was terribly wrong and I was perhaps manipulated. But it was a different era\". Two months after making her story public, Nevin reached out to the BBC saying she regretted sharing it and wanting to put the record straight. She said that she had felt the need to share her story in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, but in retrospect she felt her relationship with Peel was not abuse. In a video interview she stated that she had never told Peel her age, while providing a photo to show she looked much older than 15. She explained that she felt that she had been partially responsible for unfairly tarnishing Peel's name, stating, \"it shouldn't be that way, he was marvellous... he was lovely to me.\"\nAn interview originally published in \"The Herald\" in April 2004 stated that he admitted to sexual contact with \"an awful lot\" of underage girls. He said that, in the United States in the 1960s, the only available \"pool of single, unconnected women was high school\", as most women were married by 20.\nIn July 2022 a petition was launched to rename the \"John Peel Stage\" at the Glastonbury Festival, because of the accusations. In 2023 the stage was renamed \"Woodsies\". Emily Eavis, co-organiser of the festival, said the name change \"was not related to a recent petition\".\nDeath.\nOn 25 October 2004, during a working holiday in the Peruvian city of Cusco, Peel suffered a heart attack and died suddenly at the age of 65. Shortly after the announcement of his death, fans and supporters paid tribute to him. The following day, BBC Radio 1 cleared its schedule to broadcast a day of tributes. London's \"Evening Standard\" boards that afternoon read \"the day the music died\", quoting Don McLean's hit \"American Pie\".\nPeel had often spoken wryly of his eventual death. He once said on the Channel 4 miniseries \"Sounds of the Suburbs\", \"I've always imagined I'd die by driving into the back of a truck while trying to read the name on a cassette and people would say, 'He would have wanted to go that way.' Well, I want them to know that I wouldn't.\"\nPeel once said that if he died before his producer John Walters, he wanted Walters to play Roy Harper's song \"When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease\". Walters had died in 2001, leaving Andy Kershaw to end his tribute programme to Peel on BBC Radio 3 with the song. Peel's stand-in on his Radio 1 slot, Rob da Bank, also played the song at the start of the final show before his funeral. Another time, Peel said he would like to be remembered with a gospel song. He stated that the final record he would play would be the C. L. Franklin sermon \"Dry Bones in the Valley\".\nOn his \"Home Truths\" BBC radio show, Peel once commented about his own death: \"I definitely want to be buried, although not yet. I'm 61 on Wednesday\u2014just a working day for me, I'm afraid\u2014so actually I should have a mile or two left in me, but I do want the children to be able to stand solemnly at my graveside and think lovely thoughts along the lines of 'get out of that one, you swine', which they won't be able to do if I've been cremated.\"\nPeel's funeral took place in Bury St Edmunds on 12 November 2004 and was attended by over 1,000 people, including many of the artists he had championed. Eulogies were read by his brother Alan and fellow DJ Paul Gambaccini. The service ended with clips of him talking about his life. His coffin was carried out to the accompaniment of his favourite song, the Undertones' \"Teenage Kicks\". Peel had written that, apart from his name, all he wanted on his gravestone were the \"Teenage Kicks\" lyrics \"teenage dreams, so hard to beat\". A headstone featuring the lyrics and the liver bird from his favourite football team, Liverpool FC, was placed at his grave in 2008. He was buried in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church in Great Finborough.\nLife in music.\nPeel Sessions.\nJohn Peel Sessions were a feature of his BBC Radio 1 shows, which usually consisted of four pieces of music pre-recorded at the BBC's studios. The sessions originally came about due to restrictions imposed on the BBC by the Musicians' Union and Phonographic Performance Limited which represented the record companies dominated by the EMI cartel.\nDue to these restrictions, the BBC had been forced to hire bands and orchestras to render cover versions of recorded music. The theory behind this device was that it would create employment and force people to buy records and not listen to them free of charge on the air. One of the reasons why the offshore broadcasting stations of the 1960s were called \"pirates\" was because they operated outside of British laws and were not bound by the needle time restriction on the number of records they could play on the air.\nThe BBC employed its own house bands and orchestras and it also engaged outside bands to record exclusive tracks for its programmes in BBC studios. This was the reason why Peel was able to use \"session men\" in his own programmes. Sessions were usually four tracks recorded and mixed in a single day; as such they often had a rough-and-ready, demo-like feel, somewhere between a live performance and a finished recording. During the 37 years Peel remained on BBC Radio 1, over 4,000 sessions were recorded by over 2,000 artists. Many classic Peel Sessions have been released on record, particularly by the Strange Fruit label. In May 2020, an alphabetised catalogue of hundreds of classic Peel Sessions others had previously uploaded to YouTube was published.\nFestive Fifty.\nThe Festive Fifty \u2013 a countdown of the best tracks of the year as voted for by the listeners \u2013 was an annual tradition of Peel's Radio 1 show. Despite his eclectic play list, it tended to be composed largely of \"white boys with guitars\", as Peel complained in 1988. In 1991, the broadcast of the chart was cancelled due to a lack of votes.\nTopped by Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", this Phantom Fifty was eventually broadcast at the rate of one track per programme in 1993. The 1997 chart was initially cancelled due to the lack of air-time Peel had been allocated for the period, but enough \"spontaneous\" votes were received over the phone that a Festive Thirty-One was compiled and broadcast.\nPeel wrote that \"The Festive 50 dates back to what was doubtless a crisp September morning in the early-to-mid Seventies, when John Walters and I were musing on life in his uniquely squalid office. In our waggish way, we decided to mock the enthusiasm of the Radio 1 management of the time for programmes with alliterative titles. Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy \"Radio Times\" billing. In the course of our historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, when I could have been out and about having fun, fun, fun.\"\nAfter his death, the Festive Fifty was continued on Radio 1 by Rob da Bank, Huw Stephens and Ras Kwame for two years, but then given to Peel-inspired Internet radio station Dandelion Radio, and continues to be compiled.\nDandelion Records and Strange Fruit.\nIn 1969, Peel founded Dandelion Records (named after his pet hamster) so that he could release the debut album by Bridget St John, which he also produced. The label released 27 albums by 18 different artists before folding in 1972. Of its albums, \"There is Some Fun Going Forward\" was a sampler intended to present its acts to a wide audience, but Dandelion was never a great success, with only two releases charting nationally: Medicine Head in the UK with \"(And the) Pictures in the Sky\" and Beau in Lebanon with \"1917 Revolution\". Having had an affinity with the Manchester area from working in a cotton mill in Rochdale in 1959, Peel signed Manchester bands Stack Waddy and Tractor to Dandelion and was always supportive of both bands throughout his life. It is alleged that Peel spotted a Rochdale postmark on the envelope containing the tape sent to him by Tractor, then called \"The Way We Live\".\nPeel later said:\nIt was never a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I remember correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent as it would have been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.\nPeel appeared on one Dandelion release: the David Bedford album \"Nurses Song with Elephants\", recorded at the Marquee Studios, as part of a group playing twenty-seven plastic pipe twirlers on the track \"Some Bright Stars for Queen's College\".\nIn the 1980s Peel set up Strange Fruit Records with Clive Selwood to release material recorded by the BBC for Peel Sessions.\nProduction (albums).\nJohn Peel is sometimes confused with the more prolific record producer Jonathan Peel, who was an in-house music producer for EMI before going freelance in 1970.\nFavourite music.\nJohn Peel wrote in his autobiography, \"Margrave of the Marshes\", that the band of which he owned the most records was the Fall. Regulars in the Festive 50, and easily recognised by vocalist Mark E. Smith's distinctive delivery, the Fall became synonymous with Peel's Radio 1 show through the 1980s and 1990s. Peel kept in contact with many of the artists he championed but only met Smith on two, apparently awkward, occasions.\nThe Misunderstood is the only band that Peel ever personally managed \u2013 he first met the band in Riverside, California in 1966 and convinced them to move to London. He championed their music throughout his career; in 1968, he described their 1966 single \"I Can Take You to the Sun\" as \"the best popular record that's ever been recorded.\" and shortly before his death, he stated, \"If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've seen in my life, one would be the Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966 ... My god, they were a great band!\"\nHis favourite single is widely known to have been \"Teenage Kicks\" by the Undertones; in an interview in 2001, he stated \"There's nothing you could add to it or subtract from it that would improve it.\" In the same 2001 interview, he also listed \"No More Ghettos in America\" by Stanley Winston, \"There Must Be Thousands\" by the Quads and \"Lonely Saturday Night\" by Don French as being among his all-time favourites. He also described Lianne Hall as one of the great English voices.\nIn 1997 \"The Guardian\" asked Peel to list his top 20 albums. He listed Captain Beefheart's \"Trout Mask Replica\" as his number 1, having previously described it as \"a work of art\". The top 20 also included LPs by the Velvet Underground, the Ramones, Pulp, Misty in Roots, Nirvana, Neil Young, Pink Floyd, the Four Brothers, Dave Clarke, Richard and Linda Thompson, and the Rolling Stones.\nA longer list of his favourite singles was revealed in 2005 when the contents of a wooden box in which he stored the records that meant the most to him were made public. The box was the subject of a television documentary, \"John Peel's Record Box\". Out of 130 vinyl singles in the box, 11 of them were by the White Stripes, more than any other band in the box.\nAwards and honorary degrees.\nPeel was 11 times \"Melody Maker\"\u2032s DJ of the year, Sony Broadcaster of the Year in 1993, winner of the publicly voted Godlike Genius Award from the \"NME\" in 1994, Sony Gold Award winner in 2002 and is a member of the Radio Academy Hall of Fame. At the NME awards in 2005, he was Hero of the Year and was posthumously given a special award for \"Lifelong Service To Music\". At the same event the \"John Peel Award For Musical Innovation\" was awarded to the Others.\nPeel was awarded many honorary degrees including an MA from the University of East Anglia, doctorates (Anglia Polytechnic University and Sheffield Hallam University), various degrees (University of Liverpool, Open University, University of Portsmouth, University of Bradford) and a fellowship of Liverpool John Moores University.\nPeel was appointed an OBE in 1998, for his services to British music. In 2002, the BBC conducted a vote to discover the \"100 Greatest Britons\" of all time, in which Peel was voted 43rd.\nLegacy.\nSince his death various parties have recognised Peel's influence. A stage for new bands at the Glastonbury Festival, previously known as \"The New Bands Tent\" was renamed \"The John Peel Stage\" in 2005, although this was renamed again as \"Woodsies\" in 2023.\nIn 2008 Merseytravel announced it would be naming a train after him.\nThe John Peel Centre for Creative Arts opened in Stowmarket in early 2013. The main purposes of the centre is to serve as a live venue for music and performance and as a community meeting point.\nThe 2005 Mogwai live compilation album \"\" was dedicated to Peel as some of the tracks had been performed during the Peel Sessions. Peel's voice announces \"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mogwai!\" at the intro to \"Hunted by a Freak\", the album's opener.\nOn 8 October 2005 Cotswold Rail locomotive 47813 was named \"John Peel\" by Peel's widow Sheila at Bury St Edmunds station.\nOn 13 October 2005, the first \"John Peel Day\" was held to mark the anniversary of his last show. The BBC encouraged as many bands as possible to stage gigs on the 13th, and over 500 gigs took place in the UK and as far away as Canada and New Zealand, from bands ranging from Peel favourites New Order and The Fall, to many new and unsigned bands. A second John Peel day was held on 12 October 2006, and a third on 11 October 2007. The BBC had originally planned to hold a John Peel Day annually, but Radio 1 has not held any official commemoration of the event since 2007, though gigs still took place around the country to mark the anniversary for a number of years afterwards.\nIn 2007, ambient duo Stars of the Lid released a tour EP ('Carte De Visite') with a track titled 'J.P.R.I.P' with a soundbyte of Peel during the intro.\nAt the annual Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Awards, the \"John Peel Play More Jazz Award\" was named in his honour.\nIn Peel's hometown of Heswall, a pub was opened in his honour in 2007. Named The Ravenscroft, the pub was converted from the old Heswall Telephone Exchange but has since been renamed.\nIn 2012 Peel was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork \u2013 the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover.\nSeveral Peel-related compilation albums have been released since his death, including \"\", a project Peel started with his wife that was left unfinished when he died, and \"Kats Karavan: The History of John Peel on the Radio\" (2009), a 4 CD box set. Rock music critic Peter Paphides said in a review of the box set that \"[s]ome artists remain forever associated with him\", including ...And the Native Hipsters with \"There Goes Concorde Again\", and Ivor Cutler with \"Jam\". A sizable online community has also emerged dedicated to sharing recordings of his radio shows.\nIn May 2012 a campaign was started to turn demolition-threatened Bradford Odeon into the John Peel Creative Arts Centre in the North, though this was ultimately unsuccessful.\nBlue plaques.\nIn 2009 blue plaques bearing Peel's name were unveiled at two former recording studios in Rochdale \u2013 one at the site of Tractor Sound Studios in Heywood, the other at the site of the Kenion Street Music Building \u2013 to recognise Peel's contribution to the local music industry.\nIn June 2017 Peel's widow Sheila unveiled a blue plaque in his honour in Great Finborough.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16037", "revid": "15154581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16037", "title": "Josephus on Jesus", "text": "Flavius Josephus was a first-century Jewish historian who provided external information on some people and events found in the New Testament. Josephus was a general in Galilee, which is where Jesus ministered and people who knew him still lived; he dwelled near Jesus's hometown of Nazareth for a time, and kept contact with groups such as the Sanhedrin and Ananus II who were involved in the trials of Jesus and his brother James. The extant manuscripts of Josephus' book \"Antiquities of the Jews\", written c.\u2009AD\u00a093\u201394, contain two references to Jesus of Nazareth and one reference to John the Baptist.\nThe first and most extensive reference to Jesus in the \"Antiquities\", found in , states that Jesus was the Messiah and a wise teacher who was crucified by Pontius Pilate. It is commonly called the \"\". The passage exists in all extant manuscripts of \"Antiquities\". Since the late 20th century, the general consensus has held that the Testimonium is partially authentic in that an authentic nucleus referencing the life of Jesus was original to the Greek text. However, the exact nature and extent of the original statement remains unclear. Many modern scholars believe that an Arabic version that was discovered by Shlomo Pines reflects the state of Josephus' original text. \nModern scholarship has largely acknowledged the authenticity of the second reference to Jesus in the \"Antiquities\", found in , which mentions \"the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James\".\nAlmost all modern scholars consider the reference in of the \"Antiquities\" to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist also to be authentic and not a Christian interpolation. A number of differences exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the death of John the Baptist and the New Testament accounts. Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, since a Christian interpolator would likely have made them correspond to the New Testament accounts, not differ from them. Scholars have provided explanations for their inclusion in Josephus' later works.\nExtant manuscripts.\nJosephus wrote all of his surviving works after his establishment in Rome (c.\u2009AD\u00a071) under the patronage of the Flavian Emperor Vespasian. As is common with ancient texts, however, there are no known manuscripts of Josephus' works that can be dated before the eleventh century, and the oldest which do survive were copied by Christian monks. Jews are not known to have preserved the writings of Josephus perhaps because he was considered a traitor, or because his works circulated in Greek, the use of which declined among Jews shortly after Josephus' era.\nThere are about 120 extant Greek manuscripts of Josephus, of which 33 predate the fourteenth century, with two thirds from the Komnenos period. The earliest surviving Greek manuscript that contains the \"\" is the eleventh-century Ambrosianus 370 (F 128), preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, which includes almost all of the second half of the \"Antiquities\". There are about 170 extant Latin translations of Josephus, some of which go back to the sixth century. According to Louis Feldman these have proven very useful in reconstructing the Josephus texts through comparisons with the Greek manuscripts, confirming proper names and filling in gaps. One of the reasons the works of Josephus were copied and maintained by Christians was that his writings provided a good deal of information about a number of figures mentioned in the New Testament, and the background to events such as the death of James during a gap in Roman governing authority.\nSlavonic Josephus.\nThe three references found in and of the \"Antiquities\" do not appear in any other versions of \"The Jewish War\" except for a Slavonic version of the \"Testimonium Flavianum\" (at times called \"\") which surfaced in the west at the beginning of the twentieth century, after its discovery in Russia at the end of the nineteenth century.\nAlthough originally hailed as authentic (notably by Robert Eisler), it is now almost universally acknowledged by scholars to have been the product of an eleventh-century creation as part of a larger ideological struggle against the Khazars. As a result, it has little place in the ongoing debate over the authenticity and nature of the references to Jesus in the \"Antiquities\". Craig A. Evans states that although some scholars had in the past supported the \"Slavonic Josephus\", \"to my knowledge no one today believes that they contain anything of value for Jesus research\".\nArabic and Syriac Josephus.\nIn 1971, a tenth-century Arabic version of the ' from the chronicle of Agapius of Hierapolis was brought to light by Shlomo Pines, who also discovered a twelfth-century Syriac version of the ' in the chronicle of Michael the Syrian. These additional manuscript sources of the \"\" have furnished additional ways to evaluate Josephus' mention of Jesus in the \"Antiquities\", principally through a close textual comparison between the Arabic, Syriac and Greek versions to the \"Testimonium\".\nThere are subtle yet key differences between the Greek manuscripts and these texts. For instance, the Arabic version does not blame the Jews for the death of Jesus. The key phrase \"at the suggestion of the principal men among us\" reads instead \"Pilate condemned him to be crucified\". Instead of \"he was Christ\", the Syriac version has the phrase \"he was believed to be Christ\". Drawing on these textual variations, scholars have suggested that these versions of the \"\" more closely reflect what a non-Christian Jew might have written.\nPotential dependence on Eusebius.\nIn 2008, however, Alice Whealey published an article arguing that Agapius' and Michael's versions of the ' are not independent witnesses to the original text of Josephus' \"Antiquities\". Rather, they both ultimately derive from the Syriac translation of the \"Ecclesiastical History\" written by Eusebius, which in turn quotes the '. Whealey notes that Michael's Syriac ' shares several peculiar choices of vocabulary with the version found in the Syriac translation of the \"Ecclesiastical History\". These words and phrases are not shared by an independent Syriac translation of the ' from Eusebius' book \"Theophania\", strongly indicating that Agapius's text is simply a paraphrased quotation from the Syriac \"Ecclesiastical History\", and not a direct quotation of Josephus himself. Michael's text, in contrast, she concludes is much closer to what Josephus actually wrote.\nOne of the key prongs in her argument is that Agapius' and Michael's ' share the unique peculiarity that they both explicitly state that Jesus died after being condemned to the cross, while the Greek original does not include this detail. According to Whealey, the differences between the two ' are simply due to the fact that Agapius' chronicle more freely paraphrases and abbreviates its sources, whereas Michael's version is probably a verbatim copy. The implication of this argument, if valid, is that Agapius' abbreviated \"\" cannot be an earlier version of the passage than what we find in extant manuscripts of Josephus' \"Antiquities\".\nWhealey furthermore notices that Michael's version of the ' shares common features with Jerome's Latin translation. Most importantly for her, instead of \"he was the Messiah\", as in the Greek ', Jerome's and Michael's versions both read, \"he was thought to be the Messiah\". She considers it likely, therefore, that the Latin and Arabic translations go back to an original Greek version with the same reading. Since they otherwise have no substantial disagreement from the Greek version we possess, and since that sole variant is sufficient to explain the most powerful objections to the \"\"'s integrity, she concludes that it is \"the only major alteration\" that has been made to what Josephus originally wrote.\nThe \"Testimonium Flavianum\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAbout this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Christ. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared.\n\u2014\"Antiquities of the Jews\", \nThe ', meaning 'the testimony of Flavius Josephus', is a passage found in of the \"Antiquities\" which describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities. The ' is probably the most discussed passage in Josephus.\nSince the late 20th century, the general consensus has held that the Testimonium is partially authentic in that an authentic nucleus referencing the life of Jesus was original to the Greek text. James Dunn states that there is \"broad consensus\" among scholars regarding the nature of an authentic reference to Jesus in the \"\" and what the passage would look like without the interpolations. Among other things, the authenticity of this passage would help make sense of the later reference in \"Antiquities\" where Josephus refers to the stoning of \"James the brother of Jesus\".\nThe earliest secure reference to this passage is found in the writings of the fourth-century Christian apologist and historian Eusebius, who used Josephus' works extensively as a source for his own \"Ecclesiastical History\". Writing no later than 324, Eusebius quotes the passage in essentially the same form as that preserved in extant manuscripts. It has therefore been suggested by a minority of scholars that part or all of the passage may have been Eusebius' own invention, in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Christ. Some argue that the wording in the differs from Josephus' usual writing style, and that a traditional Jew would not have proclaimed ('he was the Christ', at Josephus' time simply meaning 'Messiah'.) \nThree perspectives on authenticity.\nPaul L. Maier and Zvi Baras state that there are three possible perspectives on the authenticity of the \":\nPaul Maier states that the first case is generally seen as hopeless given that as a Jew, Josephus would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and that the second option is hardly tenable given the presence of the passage in all extant Greek manuscripts; thus a large majority of modern scholars accept partial authenticity. Baras adds that partial authenticity is more plausible because it accepts parts of the passage as genuine, but discounts other parts as interpolations. Craig A. Evans and Robert E. Van Voorst state that most modern scholars accept the position that the \" is partially authentic, had a kernel with an authentic reference to Jesus, and that the analysis of its content and style support this conclusion.\nWhile before the advent of literary criticism most scholars considered the ' entirely authentic, thereafter the number of supporters of full authenticity declined. Most scholars now accept partial authenticity and many attempt to reconstruct their own version of the authentic kernel, and scholars such as G\u00e9za Vermes have argued that the overall characterizations of Jesus in the ' are in accord with the style and approach of Josephus.\nArguments for complete authenticity.\nPre-modern criticism.\nUntil the rise of modern criticism, many scholars believed the ' was nearly or completely authentic with little or no Christian interpolations. Some of these arguments relied on the language used in the '. For instance, Jesus is called \"a wise man\" (and Josephus described others like Solomon, Daniel, and John the Baptist in the same fashion), which would not have been a common Christian label for Christ at the time. He referred to Jesus merely as \"a worker of amazing deeds\" and nothing more, again disagreeing with how Christians viewed Christ. Referring to Jesus as \"a teacher of people who accept the truth with pleasure\", where \"pleasure\" () connotes hedonistic value, is not in line with how Christians saw the point of Jesus' teachings. Claiming that Jesus won over \"both Jews and Greeks\" is a misunderstanding that a Christian scribe would not likely have made, knowing that Jesus mainly ministered to Jews. Also, the phrase \"Those who had first loved him did not cease doing so\" is Josephan in style, and calling Christians a \"tribe\" would not have made sense to a Christian writer.\nModern defense.\nIn 2025, T. C. Schmidt defended the essential authenticity of the \"\", arguing that the passage only lost two or three words during its textual transmission. These are the Greek word \"certain\" () in the opening sentence (which appears in Eusebius' quotation of Josephus in \"Ecclesiastical History\") and the phrase \"thought to be the Christ\" instead of \"was the Christ\", which is supported by several Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Armenian textual witnesses. From his statistical analysis of the vocabulary and frequency of terms from all the works of Josephus and the passage, the passage is Josephan.\nSchmidt argues that when adding those missing words the text of the ' becomes ambiguous and can plausibly be interpreted as either a negative or neutral portrayal of Jesus, which is how most ancient Christian sources interpreted the passage. He also argues that the style and vocabulary of the passage find numerous parallels elsewhere in Josephus' works, and that other ancient Jewish and pagan writers frequently made comments about Jesus that were similar to those found in the ', supporting the authenticity of the text.\nSchmidt further argues that Josephus' sources for his account of Jesus can be identified, since the Jewish historian wrote that the \"first men\" () were \"among us\" (), a phrase which Josephus always uses to refer to someone with whom he was personally acquainted. Josephus writes several times elsewhere that he was closely familiar with the \"first men\" () of Jerusalem beginning in the early 50s AD. Since he also knew some chief priests in Jerusalem and at least one leading member of the Sanhedrin at that time, Schmidt suggests that Josephus probably knew some of the \"first men among us\" who accused Jesus a few decades before.\nParaphrase model.\nThe \"paraphrase model\", advanced by G. J. Goldberg in 2022, is based on the observation that Josephus wrote most of the \"Jewish Antiquities\" by paraphrasing Greek and Hebrew sources. Goldberg proposes that the Jesus passage in the \"Antiquities\" is also a paraphrase in the same manner. Josephus's methods of revising his sources have been well established and can be used to objectively test whether a proposed candidate source could have been adapted in the same way for the Jesus passage. In a phrase-by-phrase study, Goldberg finds that the Jesus account can be derived from Luke's Emmaus narrative using transformations Josephus is demonstrated to have employed in paraphrasing known sources for the \"Antiquities\". He finds these paraphrase precedents in word adoption, word and phrase substitution, content order preservation and content modification. As these stylistic pairings are unlike the relationships found among any other ancient Jesus texts, Goldberg proposes the most plausible explanation of these findings is that the Jesus passage in the \"Antiquities\" is indeed Josephus's paraphrase of a Christian text very much like, if not identical to, Luke's Emmaus narrative (Luke 24:18\u201324).\nThis paraphrase model, Goldberg argues, is not only a natural application of Josephus's writing processes but also resolves the questions that researchers have raised about the passage, shedding light on the origin of specific difficult phrases and accounting for its brevity and its mixture of Josephan language with a Christian credal structure. While many had previously suspected that an original Josephus passage had been edited by a later Christian to give the credal appearance, the paraphrase model argues such edits cannot explain the end-to-end consistency of a paraphrase relationship with the Emmaus text. The more plausible explanation is rather the reverse: an original Christian document was edited by Josephus by applying his usual revision method for the \"Antiquities\".\nThe historical implications of the model, Goldberg argues, include the following. First, it shows Jesus was a historical figure and not a myth, based on the reasoning that Josephus's treatment of his source indicates he thought it reliable; it must have conformed with what he knew of events under Pilate. The model also provides unique evidence about the dating of at least one passage of Luke's Gospel. And as the paraphrase shows Josephus had obtained a Christian source and treated it with a degree of respect, it provides an unexpected window into a cordial relationship between Christians and Jews in Rome at the end of the first century.\nArguments for presence of Christian interpolations.\nThe ' has been the subject of a great deal of research and debate among scholars, being one of the most discussed passages among all antiquities. Louis Feldman has stated that in the period from 1937 to 1980 at least 87 articles had appeared on the topic, the overwhelming majority of which questioned the total or partial authenticity of the '. While early scholars considered the \" to be a total forgery, the majority of modern scholars consider it partially authentic, despite some clear Christian interpolations in the text.\nThe arguments surrounding the authenticity of the \" fall into two categories: internal arguments that rely on textual analysis and compare the passage with the rest of Josephus' work; and external arguments, that consider the wider cultural and historical context. Some of the external arguments are \"arguments from silence\" that question the authenticity of the entire passage not for what it says, but due to lack of references to it among other ancient sources.\nThe external analyses of the ' have even used computer-based methods, e.g. the matching of the text of the ' with the Gospel of Luke performed by Gary Goldberg in 1995. Goldberg found some partial matches between the ' and Luke 24:19\u201321, 26\u201327 stating \"the Emmaus narrative more closely resembles the ' in its phrase-by-phrase outline of content and order than any other known text of comparable age.\" Goldberg's analyses suggested three possibilities: that the matches were random, that the ' was a Christian interpolation based on Luke, or that both the ' and Luke were based on the same sources. In a later work, published in 2022, Goldberg investigated Josephus's paraphrase style and concluded only the last of these possibilities could explain why the Emmaus-\"\" language relationships were end-to-end consistent with Josephus's methods of revision.\nInternal arguments.\nChristian phraseology.\nOne of the key internal arguments against the complete authenticity of the ' is that the clear inclusion of Christian phraseology strongly indicates the presence of some interpolations. For instance, the phrases \"if it be lawful to call him a man\" suggests that Jesus was more than human and is likely a Christian interpolation. Some scholars have attempted to reconstruct the original ', but others contend that attempts to discriminate the passage into Josephan and non-Josephan elements are inherently circular.\nEusebian phraseology.\nAnother example of the textual arguments against the \"\" is that it uses the Greek term to mean \"doer\" (as part of the phrase \"doer of wonderful works\"), but elsewhere in his works Josephus only uses the term to mean \"poet\", whereas this use of seems consistent with the Greek of Eusebius.\nExternal arguments.\nOrigen's references to Josephus.\nAccording to Wataru Mizugaki, the ' passage that Origen had seen in the third century was likely to have been neutral or skeptical on Jesus without Christian interpolation and this may have looked unsatisfactory to a Christian editor. Origen's statement in his \"Commentary on Matthew\" () that Josephus \"did not accept Jesus as Christ\", is usually seen as a confirmation of the generally accepted fact that Josephus did not believe Jesus to be the Messiah. This forms a key external argument against the total authenticity of the ' in that Josephus, as a Jew, would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and the reference to \"he was the Christ\" in the ' must be a Christian interpolation. Based on this observation alone, Paul L. Maier calls the case for the total authenticity of the ' \"hopeless\". Almost all modern scholars reject the total authenticity of the \"Testimonium\", while the majority of scholars still hold that it includes an authentic kernel.\nArguments from silence.\nA different set of external arguments against the authenticity of the ' (either partial or total) are arguments from silence, e.g. that although twelve Christian authors refer to Josephus before Eusebius in AD\u00a0324, none mentions the '.\nEven after Eusebius' AD\u00a0324 reference, it is not until Jerome's ' (c.\u2009AD\u00a0392) that the passage from Josephus is referenced again, even though the ''s reference to Jesus would seem appropriate in the works of many intervening patristic authors. However, Bart D. Ehrman and John P. Meier have argued that this silence is mainly due to the fact that the original \"\" probably had a neutral tone toward Jesus and did not contain elements that would have been useful to Christian apologetics, since it did not recognize him as the Messiah, nor did it speak about his resurrection; it was, therefore, not a useful instrument in their polemics with pagan writers.\nSome scholars also point to the silence of Photios as late as the ninth century, and the fact that he does not mention the ' at all in his broad review of Josephus. However, Photios argues in his ' that Josephus's works mention the Massacre of the Innocents and the virgin birth of Jesus (which no works of Josephus make any reference to), leading many scholars to think that he actually had a scant knowledge of the writings he was reviewing or that the documents he was working on were grossly interpolated. Also, Photios had clearly read Eusebius's \"Ecclesiastical History\" and Jerome's ', since he lists them both in his '.\nTable of Josephus excludes the \"Testimonium\".\nA separate argument from silence against the total or partial authenticity of the \"\" is that a fifth- or sixth-century table of contents of Josephus (albeit selective) makes no mention of it.\nArabic \"Testimonium\" lacks Christian terminology.\nAndreas J. K\u00f6stenberger argues that the fact that the tenth-century Arabic version of the ' (discovered in the 1970s) lacks distinct Christian terminology while sharing the essential elements of the passage indicates that the Greek ' has been subject to interpolation.\nNo parallel in other works.\nA final argument from silence relates to Josephus' own writings and questions the authenticity of \"\" based on the fact that it has no parallel in the \"Jewish War\", which includes a discussion of Pontius Pilate at about the same level of detail.\nTiming of the interpolations.\nZvi Baras believes that the ' was subject to interpolation before Eusebius wrote. Baras believes that Origen had seen the original ' but that the ' seen by Origen had no negative reference to Jesus, else Origen would have reacted against it. Baras states that the interpolation in the ' took place between Origen and Eusebius.\nPaul L. Maier states that a comparison of Eusebius' reference with the tenth-century Arabic version of the ' due to Agapius of Hierapolis indicates that the Christian interpolation present in the ' must have come early, before Eusebius. Robert E. Van Voorst also states that the interpolation likely took place some time between Origen and Eusebius.\nArguments for partial authenticity.\nLack of Jewish deicide.\nCraig A. Evans states that an argument in favor of the partial authenticity of the ' is that the passage does not stress the role played by the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus. According to Evans, if the passage had been an interpolation after the emergence of conflicts between Jews and Christians, it would have had a more accusatory tone, but in its current form reads as one would expect it to read for a passage composed by Josephus towards the end of the first century. G\u00e9za Vermes concurs, arguing that if the ' had been the work of a Christian forger, it would have placed blame on the Jewish leaders, but as is it is \"perfectly in line\" with the attitude of Josephus towards Pilate. Vermes also states that the detached depiction of the followers of Jesus is not the work of a Christian interpolator. Vermes calls the Jesus notice in the \"\" a \"veritable tour de force\" in which Josephus plays the role of a neutral witness.\nJosephan vocabulary and style.\nAndreas J. K\u00f6stenberger argues that the \"\" includes vocabulary that is typically Josephan, and the style is consistent with that of Josephus. K\u00f6stenberger (and separately Van Voorst) state that the Josephus' reference to the large number of followers of Jesus during his public ministry is unlikely to have been due to a Christian scribe familiar with the New Testament accounts, and is hence unlikely to be an interpolation.\nJosephan beliefs about Jesus.\nClaudia Setzer holds that while \"tribe is an odd way to describe Christians\", it does not necessarily have negative connotations. Setzer argues for the existence of an authentic kernel because \"the style and vocabulary are Josephan\" and specific parts (e.g. the use of \"wise man\") are not what one would expect from a Christian forger. Setzer argues that the Testimonium indicates that Josephus had heard of Jesus and the basic elements surrounding his death, and that he saw Jesus as primarily a miracle worker. Van Voorst also states that calling Christians a \"tribe\" would have been very out of character for a Christian scribe, while Josephus has used it to refer both to Jewish and Christian groups.\nArguments from external attestation.\nOrigen's complaint about Josephus referencing Jesus.\nLester L. Grabbe notes that in two works (\"Commentary on Matthew\" 10.17 and \"Contra Celsum\" 1.47; see ) Origen had actually complained that Josephus had mentioned Jesus, while not recognizing Jesus as the messiah, and this provided an early independent support of the partial ' in a more neutral form. Zvi Baras argues from this that Origen had seen a version of the ' that included no interpolations. Baras asserts that a ' seen by Origen must have had a neutral tone, and included no derogatory references towards Christians, and hence required no reaction from Origen. He claims that the neutral tone of the ' was then modified between the time of Origen and Eusebius. John P. Meier similarly argues that the fact that Origen complains that Josephus had not recognized Jesus as the Messiah points to the fact that Origen had read the original version of the \"\", since such a clear statement could not have simply arisen from the \"James, brother of Jesus\" passage.\nArabic \"Testimonium\" as the more authentic version.\nAndreas J. K\u00f6stenberger argues that a comparison of the Greek manuscripts with the Arabic quotation discovered by Shlomo Pines in the 1970s provides an indication of the original Josephan text. K\u00f6stenberger states that many modern scholars believe that the Arabic version reflects the state of Josephus' original text before it was subject to Christian interpolation. This version reads as follows:\nAt this time there was a wise man who was called Jesus. And his conduct was good,\nand [he] was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. And those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.\nOther arguments.\nComparison to Philo's works.\nSteve Mason has argued for partial authenticity for the \"\", because no other parts of any of the works of Josephus have been contested to have had scribal tempering, Christian copyists were usually conservative when transmitting texts in general, and seeing that the works of Philo were unaltered by Christian scribes through the centuries strongly support that it is very unlikely that the passage was invented out of thin air by a Christian scribe. Philo often wrote in a way that was favorable to Christian ideas and yet no Christian scribes took advantage of that to insert Jesus or Christian beliefs into Philo's text.\nAuthenticity of the James passage.\nBruce Chilton and Craig A. Evans state that the general acceptance of the authenticity of the James passage lends support to the partial authenticity of the ' in that the brief reference to \"Jesus, who was called Christ\" in \"Antiquities\" \"clearly implies a prior reference\" and that \"in all probability the ' is that prior reference\". Paul L. Maier concurs with the analysis of Chilton and Evans and states that Josephus' first reference was the \"Testimonium\". G\u00e9za Vermes also considers the \"who was called Christ\" reference in the James passage as the second reference to Jesus in the \"Antiquities\" and states that the first reference is likely to be the \"\".\nReconstruction of an authentic kernel.\nRobert E. Van Voorst states that most modern scholars believe that the ' is partially authentic, and has a reference to Jesus. However, he states that scholars are divided on the tone of the original reference and while some scholars believe that it had a negative tone which was softened by Christian interpolators, others believe that it had a neutral tone, in keeping with the style and approach of Josephus regarding the issue. According to Van Voorst, scholars who support the negative reconstruction contend that the reference read something like \"source of further trouble in Jesus a wise man\" and that it stated \"he was the so-called Christ\". Van Voorst states that most scholars support a neutral reconstruction which states \"Around this time lived Jesus, a wise man\" and includes no reference to \"he was the Christ\". Van Voorst states that if the original references to Jesus had had a negative tone, the Christian scribes would have likely deleted it entirely. Van Voorst also states that the neutral reconstruction fits better with the Arabic ' discovered by Pines in the 1970s. Van Voorst states that the neutral reconstruction is supported by the majority of scholars because it involves far less conjectural wording and fits better with the style of Josephus.\nExclusion of three divisive elements.\nCraig Blomberg states that if the three elements \"lawful to call him a man\", \"he was the Christ\" and the reference to the resurrection are removed from the ' the rest of the passage flows smoothly within the context, fits the style of Josephus and is likely to be authentic. Blomberg adds that after the removal of these three elements (which are likely interpolations) from the Greek versions the remaining passage fits well with the Arabic version and supports the authenticity of the reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate. Joel B. Green also states that the removal of some elements from the ' produces a passage that is likely to be an authentic reference to the death of Jesus.\nIn the estimation of James Dunn, there is \"broad consensus\" among scholars regarding what the \"\" would look like without the interpolations. According to Dunn's reconstruction, the original passage likely read:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNow there was about this time Jesus, a wise man. For he was a doer of startling deeds, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. And he gained a following both among many Jews and many of Greek origin. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.\nIn this passage, which is based on John P. Meier's reconstruction, Jesus is called a \"wise man\", but \"lawful to call him a man\" and \"he was the Christ\" are removed, as is the reference to the resurrection. According to Bart D. Ehrman, Meier's reconstruction is currently the most accepted among scholars.\nG\u00e9za Vermes has performed a detailed analysis of the ' and modified it to remove what he considers the interpolations. In Vermes' reconstruction \"there was Jesus, a wise man\" is retained, but the reference to \"he was the Christ\" is changed to \"he was called the Christ\" and the resurrection reference is omitted. Vermes states that the ' provides Josephus' authentic portrayal of Jesus, depicting him as a wise teacher and miracle worker with an enthusiastic group of followers who remained faithful to him after his crucifixion by Pilate, up to the time of Josephus. Vermes's version reads:Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man. For he was a doer of startling deeds, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. And he gained a following both among many Jews and many of Greek origin. He was called the Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.\nArguments for complete forgery.\nTextual similarities to Eusebian works.\nIn addition to the arguments listed above, a minority of scholars have put forward arguments to the effect that the entire ' is a Christian interpolation. For example, Kenneth Olson has argued that the entire ' must have been forged by Eusebius himself, basing his argument on textual similarities between the \"\" and Eusebius' writings in the \"Demonstrations of the Gospels\".\nSabrina Inowlocki argues that it is unlikely that Eusebius forged the \"\", as that would have been contrary to his methodology and purposes.\nThree Eusebian phrases.\nIn 2012, Josephus scholar Louis Feldman reversed his prior support for the partial authenticity of the \"Testimonium\", proposing that the passage was interpolated in its entirety by Eusebius. In support of this view, Feldman points out, following Olson, that the \"\" features three phrases (\"one who wrought surprising feats\", \"the tribe of the Christians\", and \"still to this day\") which are used nowhere else in the whole of Greek literature except Eusebius. Feldman's new theory was criticized by James Carleton Paget, who accused Feldman of misreading the data and of using anachronistic criteria.\nBoth Carleton Paget and Alice Whealey had already responded to Olson's argument, rejecting its arguments and conclusion. In his 2000 book Van Voorst had also argued that the word \"tribe\" is actually used by Josephus to describe other Jewish groups, while G\u00e9za Vermes argued in 2009 that the expression \"surprising feats\" () is repeatedly used by Josephus in his works to describe many miracles associated with the Old Testament (such as the burning bush and the miracles of Moses and Elisha).\nFourth-century Christian credal statements.\nIn 2014, Paul J. Hopper wrote a book chapter in which he argued that the style and narrative structure of the ' is sharply in contrast with the rest of Josephus' work. According to Hopper, the language of the ' has more in common with fourth-century Christian credal statements than the historiographical work of first-century authors, including Josephus. He concluded that the most likely explanation is that the passage was simply interpolated in its entirety by a Christian scribe.\nThe concordance of the language used in the ', its flow within the text, and its length have formed components of the internal arguments against its authenticity, e.g. that the brief and compact character of the ' stands in marked contrast to Josephus' more extensive accounts presented elsewhere in his works. For example, Josephus' description of the death of John the Baptist includes consideration of his virtues, the theology associated with his baptismal practices, his oratorical skills, his influence, the circumstances of his death, and the belief that the destruction of Herod's army was a divine punishment for Herod's slaughter of John. G. A. Wells has argued against the authenticity of the \"\", stating that the passage is noticeably shorter and more cursory than such notices generally used by Josephus in the \"Antiquities\", and that had it been authentic, it would have included more details and a longer introduction.\nIntrusion that breaks the narrative.\nA further internal argument against the \"\"'s authenticity is the context of the passage in the \"Antiquities of the Jews\". Some scholars argue that the passage is an intrusion into the progression of Josephus' text at the point in which it appears in the \"Antiquities\" and breaks the thread of the narrative.\n\"James, the brother of Jesus\" passage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJosephus' reference to James the brother of Jesus\nAnd now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king, desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrin without his consent. Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.\nFlavius Josephus: \"Antiquities of the Jews\" For Greek text see https://\nIn \"Antiquities\" () Josephus refers to the stoning of \"James the brother of Jesus\" (James the Just) by order of Ananus ben Ananus, a Herodian-era High Priest. The James referred to in this passage is most likely the James to whom the Epistle of James has been attributed. The translations of Josephus' writing into other languages have at times included passages that are not found in the Greek texts, raising the possibility of interpolation, but this passage on James is found in all manuscripts, including the Greek texts.\nThe context of the passage is the period following the death of Porcius Festus, and the journey to Alexandria by Lucceius Albinus, the new Roman Procurator of Judea, who held that position from AD\u00a062 to 64. Because Albinus' journey to Alexandria had to have concluded no later than the summer of AD\u00a062, the date of James' death can be assigned with some certainty to around that year. The second-century chronicler Hegesippus also left an account of the death of James, and while the details he provides diverge from those of Josephus, the two accounts share similar elements.\nModern scholarship has almost universally acknowledged the authenticity of the reference to \"the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James\" () and has rejected its being the result of later Christian interpolation. Moreover, in comparison with Hegesippus' account of James' death, most scholars consider Josephus' to be the more historically reliable. However, a few scholars question the authenticity of the reference, based on various arguments, but primarily based on the observation that various details in \"The Jewish War\" differ from it.\nEarly references.\nOrigen of Alexandria.\nIn the third century, Origen of Alexandria claimed in two works that Josephus had mentioned James, the brother of Jesus. In Origen's commentary on Matthew, he writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And to so great a reputation among the people for righteousness did this James rise, that Flavius Josephus, who wrote the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" in twenty books, when wishing to exhibit the cause why the people suffered so great misfortunes that even the temple was razed to the ground, said, that these things happened to them in accordance with the wrath of God in consequence of the things which they had dared to do against James the brother of Jesus who is called Christ. And the wonderful thing is, that, though he did not accept Jesus as Christ, he yet gave testimony that the righteousness of James was so great; and he says that the people thought that they had suffered these things because of James.\u2014\u200a\nIn Origen's apologetic work \"Contra Celsum\", he made a similar remark:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now this writer [Josephus], although not believing in Jesus as the Christ, in seeking after the cause of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple, whereas he ought to have said that the conspiracy against Jesus was the cause of these calamities befalling the people, since they put to death Christ, who was a prophet, says nevertheless\u2014being, although against his will, not far from the truth\u2014that these disasters happened to the Jews as a punishment for the death of James the Just, who was a brother of Jesus (called Christ),\u2014the Jews having put him to death, although he was a man most distinguished for his justice.\u2014\u200a\nMany commentators have concluded that Origen is making reference to the \"James, the brother of Jesus\" passage found in \"Antiquities\", Book 20 here, but there are some problems with this view. Origen is attributing statements to Josephus that he never wrote in any of his extant works (such as the claim that the killing of James caused the destruction of the Jerusalem temple), suggesting that he is at least partially confused.\nEusebius of Caesarea.\nIn of his \"Ecclesiastical History\", Eusebius mentions Josephus' reference to the death of James. Eusebius attributes the following quote to Josephus: \"These things happened to the Jews to avenge James the Just, who was a brother of Jesus, that is called the Christ. For the Jews slew him, although he was a most just man.\" However, this statement does not appear in the extant manuscripts of Josephus. Moreover, in Book III, chapter 11, Eusebius states that the conquest of Jerusalem immediately followed the martyrdom of James setting the martyrdom at c.\u2009AD\u00a070 rather than the c.\u2009AD\u00a062 given by Josephus.\nArguments for authenticity.\nLouis Feldman states that the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James has been \"almost universally acknowledged\". Feldman states that this passage, above others, indicates that Josephus did say something about Jesus. Feldman states that it would make no sense for Origen to show amazement that Josephus did not acknowledge Jesus as Christ (), if Josephus had not referred to Jesus at all. Paul L. Maier states that most scholars agree with Feldman's assessment that \"few have doubted the genuineness of this passage\" Zvi Baras also states that most modern scholars consider the James passage to be authentic.\nAccording to Robert E. Van Voorst the overwhelming majority of scholars consider both the reference to \"the brother of Jesus called Christ\" and the entire passage that includes it as authentic. Van Voorst states that the James passage fits well in the context in the \"Antiquities\" and an indication for its authenticity is the lack of the laudatory language that a Christian interpolator would have used to refer to Jesus as \"the Lord\", or a similar term. Van Voorst also states that the use of a neutral term \"called Christ\" which neither denies nor affirms Jesus as the Messiah points to authenticity, and indicates that Josephus used it to distinguish Jesus from the many other people called Jesus at the time, in the same way that James is distinguished, given that it was also a common name.\nRichard Bauckham states that although a few scholars have questioned the James passage, \"the vast majority have considered it to be authentic\", and that among the several accounts of the death of James the account in Josephus is generally considered to be historically the most reliable. Bauckham states that the method of killing James by stoning, and the description provided by Josephus via the assembly of the Sanhedrin of judges are consistent with the policies of the Temple authorities towards the early Christian Church at the time.\nAndreas K\u00f6stenberger considers the James passage to be authentic and states that the James passage attests to the existence of Jesus as a historical person, and that his followers considered him the Messiah. K\u00f6stenberger states that the statement by Josephus that some people recognized Jesus as the Messiah is consistent with the grammar of Josephus elsewhere but does not imply that Josephus himself considered Jesus the Messiah. K\u00f6stenberger concurs with John Meier that it is highly unlikely for the passage to be a Christian interpolation given that in New Testament texts James is referred to as the \"brother of the Lord\" rather than the \"brother of Jesus\", and that a Christian interpolator would have provided a more detailed account at that point.\nClaudia Setzer states that few have questioned the authenticity of the James passage, partly based on the observation that a Christian interpolator would have provided more praise for James. Setzer states that the passage indicates that Josephus, a Jewish historian writing towards the end of the first century, could use a neutral tone towards Christians, with some tones of sympathy, implying that they may be worthy of Roman protection.\nJohn Painter states that nothing in the James passage looks suspiciously like a Christian interpolation and that the account can be accepted as historical. Painter discusses the role of Ananus and the background to the passage, and states that after being deposed as High Priest for killing James and being replaced by Jesus the son of Damnaeus, Ananus had maintained his influence within Jerusalem through bribery. Painter points out that as described in the Antiquities of the Jews () Ananus was bribing both Albinus and Jesus the son of Damnaeus so that his men could take the tithes of other priests outside Jerusalem, to the point that some priests then starved to death. Philip Carrington states that there is no reason to question the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James, and elaborates the background by stating that Ananus continued to remain a power within the Jewish circles at the time even after being deposed, and that it is likely that the charges brought against James by Ananus were not only because of his Christian association but because he objected to the oppressive policies against the poor; hence explaining the later indignation of the more moderate Jewish leaders.\nArguments against authenticity.\nA comparative argument made against the authenticity of the James passage by scholars such as Tessa Rajak is that the passage has a negative tone regarding the High Priest Ananus, presenting him as impulsive while in the \"Jewish Wars\" Josephus presents a positive view of Ananus and portrays him as prudent.\nA textual argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that the use of the term \"Christos\" there seems unusual for Josephus. An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that given that the mention of Jesus appears in the \"Antiquities\" before that of John the Baptist, a Christian interpolator may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John. A further argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that it would have read well even without a reference to Jesus.\nDifferences with Christian sources.\nJosephus's account places the date of the death of James as AD\u00a062. This date is supported by Jerome's 'seventh year of the Emperor Nero', although Jerome may simply be drawing this from Josephus. However, James's successor as leader of the Jerusalem church, Simeon, is not, in tradition, appointed till after the siege of Jerusalem in AD\u00a070, and Eusebius's notice of Simeon implies a date for the death of James immediately before the siege, i.e. about AD\u00a069. The method of death of James is not mentioned in the New Testament. However, the account of Josephus differs from that of later works by Hegesippus, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen, and Eusebius of Caesarea in that it simply has James stoned while the others have other variations such as having James thrown from the top of the Temple, stoned, and finally beaten to death by a fuller as well as his death occurring during the siege of Jerusalem in AD\u00a069.\nJohn Painter states that the relationship of the death of James to the siege is an important theologoumenon in the early church. On the basis of the Gospel accounts it was concluded that the fate of the city was determined by the death there of Jesus. To account for the 35-year difference, Painter states that the city was preserved temporarily by the presence within it of a 'just man' (see also Sodom); who was identified with James, as confirmed by Origen. Hence Painter states that the killing of James restarted the clock that led to the destruction of the city and that the traditional dating of AD\u00a069 simply arose from an over-literal application of the theologoumenon, and is not to be regarded as founded on a historical source. The difference between Josephus and the Christian accounts of the death of James is seen as an indication that the Josephus passage is not a Christian interpolation by scholars such as Eddy, Boyd, and Kostenberger. G\u00e9za Vermes states that compared to the Christian accounts: \"the sober picture of Josephus appears all the more believable\". G. A. Wells, on the other hand, has stated that in view of Origen's statements these variations from the Christian accounts may be signs of interpolation in the James passage.\nJohn the Baptist passage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJosephus' reference to John the Baptist\nNow some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man... Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion... Accordingly, he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death.\nIn the \"Antiquities\" () Josephus refers to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist by order of Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee and Perea. The context of this reference is the AD\u00a036 defeat of Herod Antipas in his conflict with Aretas IV of Nabatea, which the Jews of the time attributed to misfortune brought about by Herod's unjust execution of John.\nAlmost all modern scholars consider this passage to be authentic in its entirety, although a small number of authors have questioned it. Because the death of John also appears prominently in the Christian gospels, this passage is considered an important connection between the events Josephus recorded, the chronology of the gospels and the dates for the ministry of Jesus. A few scholars have questioned the passage, contending that the absence of Christian tampering or interpolation does not itself prove authenticity. While this passage is the only reference to John the Baptist outside the New Testament, it is widely seen by most scholars as confirming the historicity of the baptisms that John performed. According to Marsh, any contrast between Josephus and the Gospel's accounts of John would be because the former lacked interest in the messianic element of John's mission.\nArguments for authenticity.\nCraig A. Evans states that almost all modern scholars consider the Josephus passage on John to be authentic in its entirety, and that what Josephus states about John fits well both with the general depiction of John in the New Testament and within the historical context of the activities of other men, their preachings and their promises during that period.\nLouis Feldman, who believes the Josephus passage on John is authentic, states that Christian interpolators would have been very unlikely to have devoted almost twice as much space to John (163 words) as to Jesus (89 words). Feldman also states that a Christian interpolator would have likely altered Josephus's passage about John the Baptist to make the circumstances of the death of John become similar to the New Testament, and to indicate that John was a forerunner of Jesus.\nJames Dunn states that the accounts of Josephus and the New Testament regarding John the Baptist are closer than they may appear at a first reading. Dunn states that Josephus positions John as a righteous preacher () who encourages his followers to practice \"righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God\" and that similarly calls John \"a righteous () and holy man\". Dunn states that Antipas likely saw John as a figure whose ascetic lifestyle and calls for moral reform could provoke a popular uprising on moral grounds, as both Josephus and the New Testament suggest.\nJustin Meggitt states that there are fundamental similarities between the Josephus portrayal of John the Baptist and the New Testament narrative in that in both accounts John is positioned as a preacher of morality, not as someone who had challenged the political authority of Herod Antipas. W. E. Nunnally states that the John passage is considered authentic and that Josephus' emphasis on the egalitarian nature of John's teachings fit well into the biblical and historical traditions.\nIn Origen's apologetic work \"Contra Celsum\", made an explicit reference to the Josephus passage discussing John the Baptist:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For in the 18th book of his Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus bears witness to John as having been a Baptist, and as promising purification to those who underwent the rite.\u2014\u200a\nHere, Origen provides a clear, unambiguous indication that the passage concerning John the Baptist existed in his early manuscript of \"Antiquities of the Jews\". This implies that the John the Baptist passage would have had to have been interpolated into the \"Antiquities\" at quite an early date, before the time of Origen, if it is inauthentic.\nIn \"Ecclesiastical History\" (), Eusebius also discusses the Josephus reference to Herod Antipas's killing of John the Baptist, and mentions the marriage to Herodias in paragraphs 1\u20136.\nArguments against authenticity.\nRivka Nir argues that the kind of baptism performed by John the Baptist was not considered legitimate in the mainstream Jewish circles to which Josephus belonged, and therefore Josephus could not have described John as positively as he is in \"Antiquities\", Book 18. Nir therefore concludes that the passage is likely a Christian interpolation. Joel Marcus states that Nir's argument is based on an outdated notion of \"mainstream Judaism\" which fails to consider the essential diversity of Second Temple Judaism during this period.\nClaire Rothschild has stated that the absence of Christian interpolations in the Josephus passage on John the Baptist can not by itself be used as an argument for its authenticity, but is merely an indication of the lack of tampering.\nDifferences with Christian sources.\nThe marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias is mentioned both in Josephus and in the gospels, and scholars consider Josephus as a key connection in establishing the approximate chronology of specific episodes related to John the Baptist. However, although both the gospels and Josephus refer to Herod Antipas killing John the Baptist, they differ on the details and motives, e.g. whether this act was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in , ), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in . Jean Dani\u00e9lou contends that Josephus missed the religious meaning while recording only the political aspect of the conflict between Herod and John, which led to the latter's death.\nWhile Josephus identifies the location of the imprisonment of John as Machaerus, southeast of the mouth of the Jordan river, the gospels mention no location for the place where John was imprisoned. According to other historical accounts Machaerus was rebuilt by Herod the Great around 30\u00a0BC and then passed to Herod Antipas. The AD\u00a036 date of the conflict with Aretas IV (mentioned by Josephus) is consistent with the approximate date of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias estimated by other historical methods.\nLouis Feldman has stated that there is \"no necessary contradiction between Josephus and the gospels as to the reason why John was put to death\" in that the Christians chose to emphasize the moral charges while Josephus emphasized the political fears that John stirred in Herod.\nJosephus stated () that the AD\u00a036 defeat of Herod Antipas in the conflicts with Aretas IV of Nabatea was widely considered by the Jews of the time as misfortune brought about by Herod's unjust execution of John the Baptist. The approximate dates presented by Josephus are in concordance with other historical records, and most scholars view the variation between the motive presented by Josephus and the New Testament accounts is seen as an indication that the Josephus passage is not a Christian interpolation.\nThe three passages in relation to \"The Jewish Wars\".\nLouis Feldman states that it is significant that the passages on James and John are found in the \"Antiquities\" and not in the \"Jewish Wars\", but provides three explanations for their absence from the \"Jewish Wars\". One explanation is that the \"Antiquities\" covers the time period involved at a greater length than the \"Jewish Wars\". The second explanation is that during the gap between the writing of the \"Jewish Wars\" (c.\u2009AD\u00a070) and \"Antiquities\" (after AD\u00a090) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the \"Antiquities\". Another explanation is that the passages were added to the \"Antiquities\" to highlight the power of the Pharisees, but he considers the last explanation less likely than the others.\nOne of the arguments against the authenticity of the James passage has been that in the \"Jewish Wars\" Josephus portrays the High Priest Ananus in a positive manner, while in the \"Antiquities\" he writes of Ananus in a negative tone. Louis Feldman rejects these arguments against the authenticity of the James passage and states that in several other unrelated cases the \"Jewish Wars\" also differs from the \"Antiquities\", and that an interpolator would have made the two accounts correspond more closely to each other, not make them differ.\nThe twenty-year gap between the writing of the \"Jewish Wars\" and the \"Antiquities\" has also been used to explain some of the differences in tone between them. Clemens Thoma provides an explanation for this based on the observation that Josephus may have learned of the details of the actions of Ananus in the twenty-year gap between the writing of the Jewish Wars and the Antiquities, and thus avoided a positive tone when writing of Ananus in the \"Antiquities\".\nJohn Painter also states that the difference in the context for the \"Jewish Wars\" and the \"Antiquities\" may account for some of the differences in tone between them. When writing of Ananus in a positive tone in the \"Jewish Wars\", the context was Ananus' prudence in avoiding a war and hence Josephus considered that a positive aspect. However, when writing in the \"Antiquities\" about the actions of Ananus which resulted in his demotion from the High Priesthood, the context required the manifestation of a negative aspect of Ananus' character.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16043", "revid": "44840730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16043", "title": "Jerusalem", "text": "City in the Southern Levant\nJerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions\u2014Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city; Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, while Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognised internationally.\nThroughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE) Jerusalem was named as \"Urusalim\" on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning \"City of Shalem\" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE the city had developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538 the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters\u2014the Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860 Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2023 Jerusalem had a population of 1,028,366. In 2022 60% were Jews and almost 40% were Palestinians. In 2020 the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%) and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son King Solomon commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous\u2014and later monotheistic\u2014religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational events assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city () was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only , the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nAt present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be \"established as a \"corpus separatum\" under a special international regime\" administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel's Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\nEtymology and names.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Jerusalem\" is variously etymologised to mean \"foundation (Semitic \"yry\"' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god Shalem\"; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.\nShalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for \"peace\" is derived (\"Shalom\" in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic \"Salam\"). The name thus offered itself to etymologisations such as \"The City of Peace\", \"Abode of Peace\", \"Dwelling of Peace\" (\"founded in safety\"), or \"Vision of Peace\" in some Christian authors.\nThe ending \"-ayim\" indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name \"Yerushalayim\" refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.\nAncient Egyptian sources.\nThe Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called \"rw\u0161\ua723lmm\" or \"\ua723w\u0161\ua723mm\", variously transcribed as \"Ru\u0161alimum\", or \"Uru\u0161alimum\", may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an \"\u00daru\u0161alim\", may be the earliest mention of the city.\nHebrew Bible and Jewish sources.\nThe form \"Yerushalem\" or \"Yerushalayim\" first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, \"Yireh\" (\"the abiding place\", the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and \"Shalem\" (\"Place of Peace\", the name given by high priest Shem).\nOldest written mention of \"Jerusalem\".\nOne of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word \"Jerusalem\" is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: \"I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem\", or as other scholars suggest: \"Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem\". An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE.\nIn extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the \"-ayim\" ending was discovered on a column about 3\u00a0km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.\nJebus, Zion, City of David.\nAn ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the \"Fortress of Zion\" (\"metsudat Zion\"), it was renamed as the \"City of David\", and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, \"Zion\", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.\nGreek, Roman and Byzantine names.\nIn Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated \"Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma\" (Greek: \u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1; in Greek \"hier\u00f2s\", \"\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2\", means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.\nUp until the 2010s the consensus among historians was that following Alexander the Great's conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the Seleucid kingdom, and to be Hellenised as \"Hierapolis.\" However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the polis would be similar to \"Hierolophos\".\nAfter the Bar Kokhba revolt (132\u2013136 CE), the city was renamed Aelia Capitolina during the Roman period of its history. Named for the Roman emperor Hadrian and the deities of Rome, the name lasted until the Byzantine era.\nSalem.\nThe Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier \"Salem\" (\u05e9\u05dc\u05dd), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and \"targumim\", however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.\nArabic names.\nOriginally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as , transliterated as \"al-Quds\" and meaning \"the holy\" or \"the holy sanctuary\", cognate with . The name is possibly a shortened form of \"Mad\u012bnat al-Quds\" \"city of the holy sanctuary\" after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, \"Ir ha-Qodesh\" (). The (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (\u0294) as in Levantine Arabic. Official Israeli government policy mandates that , transliterated as \"\u016aru\u0161al\u012bm\", which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with , giving , \u016aru\u0161al\u012bm-al-Quds. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called \"\"Qudsi\" () or \"Maqdasi\"\" (), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.\nHistory.\nJerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as \"Rusalimum.\" By the 17th century BCE Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.\nThe city's importance grew during the \"Israelite period\", which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David's son King Solomon built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious centre. Following the kingdom's split Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the Second Temple period. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish sovereignty, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.\nIn 63 BCE Jerusalem was captured by Pompey and brought under the rule of the Roman Republic. The city was embellished by Herod the Great, who expanded the Second Temple, making it one of the largest sanctuaries in the ancient world. Tensions between the Jews and the Roman Empire eventually escalated into the First Jewish Revolt, resulting in the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE. A few decades later, the city was rebuilt as the Roman colony \"Aelia Capitolina\", dedicated to Jupiter, provoking the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132\u2013136 CE). After the revolt's suppression, Jews were banned from the city. During the Byzantine period, Jerusalem gained prominence as a centre of Christian pilgrimage, especially after Constantine the Great supported the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.\nDuring the Crusades Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the modern period Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city's history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasise the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city's broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem's status and future.\nPolitical status.\nFrom 1923 until 1948 Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.\nFrom 1949 until 1967 West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognised as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.\nIn 1988 the Israeli government ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.\nInternational status.\nWhile the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognised as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948 the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the city.\nStatus under Israeli rule.\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.\nIn 2010 Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritised construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent \"a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided\", and that \"all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading\".\nThe status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city's borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there.\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that \"Jerusalem will never be divided\". A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship, while 31% opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.\nJerusalem as capital of Israel.\nOn 5 December 1949 Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel's \"eternal\" and \"sacred\" capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had \"compelled\" the Israeli leadership \"to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv\", while \"for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only\u2014Jerusalem the Eternal\", and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for \"the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.\" This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government\u2014legislative, judicial and executive\u2014have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion's proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.\nIn July 1980 Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the \"complete and united\" capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is \"a violation of international law\", is \"null and void and must be rescinded forthwith\". Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem.\nFollowing the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are five embassies\u2014United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Papua New Guinea and Kosovo\u2014and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem. Paraguay maintains an embassy in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion, in addition to Bolivia whose embassy is now . There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.\nIn 1995 the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 the US president, Donald Trump, officially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticised by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017. A subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018 the United States officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.\nIn December 2017, US President Donald Trump made the decision to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to that city. This decision faced significant opposition, particularly from leaders within the Arab and Muslim communities. The Palestinians assert that East Jerusalem should serve as the capital of their future state, and its status ought to be resolved through peace negotiations as outlined in the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas remarked that Trump's action effectively negated the United States' position as a mediator in the peace process. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Islamist Hamas movement, urged for a new \"intifada,\" or uprising. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the decision, stating it would \"place the region in a ring of fire.\" Saudi Arabia's King Salman described it as \"a clear provocation to Muslims globally.\" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi indicated that this decision would exacerbate the situation in the region. Iran warned that the decision would incite a \"new intifada,\" labeling it a blatant infringement of international resolutions.\nIn April 2017 the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel's capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018 the Australian government officially recognised West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.\nGovernment precinct and national institutions.\nThe Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the president and the prime minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv's HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).\nIsraeli settlements.\nSince its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law.\nJerusalem as capital of Palestine.\nThe Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.\nThe PLO's position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint \"development council\" would be responsible for coordinated development. Orient House in East Jerusalem served as the headquarters of the PLO in the 1980s and 1990s. It was closed by Israel in 2001, two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing.\nSome states, such as Russia and China, recognise the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\nPalestinian offices and institutions.\nGovernment offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior. There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighbourhood.\nMunicipal administration.\nThe Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018 Moshe Lion was elected mayor.\nApart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor is Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years\u2014six consecutive terms\u2014in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.\nThe headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor's office are at Safra Square (\"Kikar Safra\") on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district's capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built upon.\nIn the Oslo I Accord, certain parts of few neighbourhoods were allotted to the Palestinian Authority. Parts of Sur Baher, Wadi al-Hummus, Umm Leisun and Umm Tuba, altogether came under Area A, which is completely controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Ram and Dahiyat al-Barid are mostly in Area B, where both Palestine and Israel has control. Other parts of Beit Hanina, Kafr Aqab and Arab al-Jahalin also falls under Area B.\nGeography.\nJerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately . The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (\"wadis\"). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.\nThe Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. These were destroyed by centuries of warfare and neglect. Farmers in the Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.\nWater supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.\nJerusalem is east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the north.\nMount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.\nClimate.\nThe city is characterised by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Csa\"), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.\nJanuary is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of ; July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of , and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around , with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralysed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was on 25 January 1907.\nMost of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.\nDemographics.\nDemographic history.\nJerusalem's population size and composition have shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least the Rev. George Williams' subsequent labelling of it.\nMost population data before 1905 are based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.\nBetween 1838 and 1876 a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.\nCurrent demographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn December 2007 Jerusalem had a population of 747,600\u201463.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.\nAccording to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.\nIn 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.\nIn 2005 the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)\u2014similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.\nIn 1967 Jews accounted for 74% of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down by 9%. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.\nIn 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in Jerusalem studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.\nWhile some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a \"Jerusalem resident status\" are entitled to the subsidised healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.\nDemographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.\nWithin the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012 it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze'ev and constituted 3% of the population in Neve Ya'akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008 the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.\nJerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city's adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.\nJerusalem had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.\nJerusalem had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).\nJerusalem had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).\nAccording to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem expanded by 60% under Donald Trump's first US presidency. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of the building permits.\nUrban planning issues.\nCritics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and \"the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators\" than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).\nReligious significance.\nJerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.\nJudaism.\nJerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first five books of the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in the rest of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews throughout the world turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, attracts over 10 million visitors each year. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the \"Shulchan Aruch\", daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have \"Mizrach\" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer. Many parts of Jewish liturgy mention Jerusalem, including at the conclusion of the Passover Seder when participants declare \"Next Year in Jerusalem!\" The fourteenth blessing of the Amidah prayer, said three times per day is a request that the Jerusalem be rebuilt, as well as the \"Shechinah\" be returned to Zion. The \"Grace After Meals\" which is said after eating a meal including bread, has multiple references to Jerusalem. The entire fast day of Tisha B'Av is dedicated to remembering and mourning the destruction of the first and second temples in Jerusalem.\nChristianity.\nJerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus' Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom. It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.\nIslam.\nJerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the \"qibla\" (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city's lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad's Night Journey (c.\u2009620 CE). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur'an's \"Surat al-Isra\" notes the destination of Muhammad's journey as \"al-masjid al-aq\u1e63\u0101\" (\"the farthest place of prayer\"). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad's death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.\nEconomy.\nHistorically, Jerusalem's economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem's religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by \"Travel + Leisure magazine\". In 2013, 75% of the 3.5\u00a0million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem's economy. The government, centred in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel's financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem's Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015 \"Time\" magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that \"The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.\"\nHigher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem's land is zoned for \"industry and infrastructure\". By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).\nAlthough many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older\u2014lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, the activist group Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.\nThe increasing number of educated Palestinians in Jerusalem has brought about positive economic changes. Through reforms and initiatives in sectors like technology, tourism, trade, and infrastructure, they have helped drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living conditions in the city. Various joint summits between Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have been held in the city. Palestine Investment Fund have proposed various projects in Jerusalem. Palestinian industrialist Bashar Masri sought to make heavy investments in the city. PA controlled industrial areas are located outskirts of Jerusalem, primarily in Bir Nabala, Abu Dis and Eizariya, engaging in manufacture of tires, food products and concretes.\nHigh-tech industry is emerged among Palestinian society of Jerusalem. In 2023 Israel opened a technology park in East Jerusalem, known as EasTech. Local Palestinian engineers are employed in the complex by multinational companies, some of which includes AT&amp;T, Natural Intelligence, Nvidia, Unity and Synamedia. Station J, an innovation hub is located in Sheikh Jarrah, which is yet another tech hub for Palestinians in the city. Hani Alami, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian entrepreneur has set up a start-+up accelerator. As a part of Israeli\u2013Palestinian economic peace efforts, interaction between Israeli and Palestinian business community, also contributes in growth of Palestinian IT sector in the city.\nUrban structure.\nHigh-rise construction.\nJerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.\nA new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it was set to break ground by 2019.\nNew projects in Jerusalem.\nIn 2021 Bashar Masri announced and launched \"Lana\", a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial centre that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, caf\u00e9s and offices. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents. In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasises the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings. This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors. It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem.\nTransportation.\nPublic transport.\nJerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.\nThe Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi'in Illit and Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City's Damascus Gate.\nRailway.\nThe Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze'ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.\nA high-speed rail line connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem became partially operational in 2018 and was completed in 2019. Its terminus is at the new underground station ( deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operated train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh, but this service was discontinued in 2020.\nBegin Expressway is one of Jerusalem's major north\u2013south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualised decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.\nAirport.\nIn the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport. It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine. Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a \"symbol of Palestinian sovereignty\". The airport falls beyond Green Line. After the 1948 war it came under control of Jordan. Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel. With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000. Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem\u2013Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.\nThe Australian businessman Kevin Bermeister proposed a masterplan of Jerusalem, which also includes the development of an airport for Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. The airport is sought to be a joint Israeli-Palestinian airport. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh have also appealed to Israeli authorities to redevelop the airport. In 2021, the Israeli government planned to redevelop Atarot Airport as a joint Israeli\u2013Palestinian airport. The new Atarot Airport will include two separate Israeli and Palestinian terminals.\nEducation.\nUniversities.\nJerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.\nFounded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university's major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world's largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv'at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.\nThe Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and \"Yeshivot\", including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003\u20132004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (\"Bagrut\") and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardised tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.\nAl-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the \"only Arab university in Jerusalem\". Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat's office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a Abu Dis campus. Other campuses of AQU are located within city limits of Jerusalem. A campus of university in Sheikh Jarrah, which is one of the oldest faculties, is known as Hind Al Husseini College for Arts. It was named after Hind al-Husseini, a Palestinian activists known for rescuing orphaned survivors of Deir Yassin massacre and giving them shelter in a palace of her grandfather, which was converted into an orphanage and later a college, which is a part today's Al Quds University. A joint campus of AQU and Bard College is located in Beit Hanina. Bayt Mal Al Qods Acharif Agency, a Moroccan organisation, is constructing a new campus in the same neighbourhood.\nOther institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.\nArab schools.\nIsrael's public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticised for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city's Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007 the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6\u00a0billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3\u00a0million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the \"Bagrut\" matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.\nCulture.\nAlthough Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum's Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem's first eye clinic in this building in 1912.\nNext to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the \"Bible Hill\". A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel's top tourist attraction for Israelis. The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city's western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel's national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world's largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5\u00a0million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.\nThe Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (\"Binyanei HaUma\") near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha'Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organiser of this event. The Jerusalem Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city's only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of \"Shav'ua Hasefer\" (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.\nJerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra which toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artefacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009 a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit 'Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people\nPalestinian cinema is based in the city. Jerusalem has been location for \"Jerusalem Arab Film Festival\", for exhibiting Palestinian films. The city is home to numerous artists, singers, actors, actresses and filmmakers. Established in 1991, Riwaq have been working on various projects to restore cultural and historical sites across Palestine. Difficulties to operate in the annexed areas of Palestinian Jerusalem, it have successfully worked across those neighbourhoods, rural and suburban area and Jerusalem Mountains (\"Jibal al-Quds\"), where the Palestinian government has control. So far, the organisation have restored a number of sites across the neighbourhoods of Kafr 'Aqab, Al Jib, Jaba and Qalandia. Those restored structures serves as local community centres, cultural sites and headquarters of several NGOs and cultural groups. Yabous Cultural Center is the largest cultural centre in the city, opened by Palestinian groups in 1997. Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have a branch in Jerusalem.\nHadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University have unveiled a \"Tree of Peace\" statue at the Al Quds University School of Dental Medicine. The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Centre for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008 the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czes\u0142aw D\u017awigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem's quest for peace.\nMedia.\nThe headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. \"The Jerusalem Post\" and \"The Times of Israel\" are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include the Israeli \"Kol Ha'ir\" and the Palestinian \"Jerusalem Times\". God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city. PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East's first digital village and is also home to the first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East.\nSports.\nThe two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem's other major football team, and one of Beitar's top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit. Since its opening in 1992, Teddy Stadium has been Jerusalem's primary football stadium, with a capacity of 31,733.\nThe most popular Palestinian football club is Jabal Al Mukaber (since 1976) which plays in West Bank Premier League. The club hails from Mount Scopus at Jerusalem, part of the Asian Football Confederation, and plays at the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium at Al-Ram, across the West Bank Barrier.\nIn basketball Hapoel Jerusalem is one of the top teams in the top division. The club has won Israel's championship in 2015, the State Cup four times, and the ULEB Cup in 2004.\nThe Jerusalem Marathon, established in 2011, is an international marathon race held annually in Jerusalem in the month of March. The full 42-kilometre race begins at the Knesset, passes through Mount Scopus and the Old City's Armenian Quarter, and concludes at Sacher Park. In 2012, the Jerusalem Marathon drew 15,000 runners, including 1,500 from fifty countries outside Israel.\nA popular non-competitive sports event is the Jerusalem March, held annually during the Sukkot festival.\nTwin towns\u2014sister cities.\nJerusalem is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEast Jerusalem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWest Jerusalem:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16044", "revid": "50913839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16044", "title": "J. Edgar Hoover", "text": "American attorney and law enforcement administrator (1895\u20131972)\nJohn Edgar Hoover (January 1, 1895\u00a0\u2013 May 2, 1972) was an American law enforcement administrator who served as the fifth and final director of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) and the first director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). President Calvin Coolidge first appointed Hoover as director of the BOI, the predecessor to the FBI, in 1924. After 11 years in the post, Hoover became instrumental in founding the FBI in June 1935, where he remained as director for an additional 37 years until his death in May 1972 \u2013 serving a total of 48 years leading both the BOI and the FBI under eight Presidents.\nHoover expanded the FBI into a larger crime-fighting agency and instituted a number of modernizations to policing technology, such as a centralized fingerprint file and forensic laboratories. Hoover also established and expanded a national blacklist, referred to as the FBI Index or Index List.\nLater in life and after his death, Hoover became a controversial figure as evidence of his secretive abuses of power began to surface. He was found to have routinely violated both the FBI's own policies and the very laws which the FBI was charged with enforcing, to have used the FBI to harass and sabotage political dissidents, and to have extensively collected information on officials and private citizens using illegal surveillance, wiretapping, and burglaries. Hoover consequently amassed a great deal of power and was able to intimidate and threaten high-ranking political figures.\nEarly life and education.\nHoover was born on New Year's Day 1895 in Washington, D.C., to German American Anna Marie (\"n\u00e9e\" Scheitlin; 1860\u20131938) and Dickerson Naylor Hoover (1856\u20131921), chief of the printing division of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, formerly a plate maker for the same organization. Dickerson Hoover was of English and German ancestry. Hoover's maternal great-uncle, John Hitz, was a Swiss honorary consul general to the United States. Among his family, he was the closest to his mother, who despite being \"inclined to instruction\", showed great affection towards her son.\nHoover was born in a house on the present site of Capitol Hill United Methodist Church, located on Seward Square near Eastern Market in Washington's Capitol Hill neighborhood. A stained glass window in the church is dedicated to him. Hoover did not have a birth certificate filed upon his birth, although it was required in 1895 in Washington. Two of his siblings did have certificates, but Hoover's was not filed until 1938 when he was 43.\nHoover lived his entire life in Washington, D.C. He attended Central High School, where he sang in the school choir, participated in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, and competed on the debate team. During debates, he argued against women getting the right to vote and against the abolition of the death penalty. The school newspaper applauded his \"cool, relentless logic\". Hoover stuttered as a boy, which he later learned to manage by teaching himself to talk quickly\u2014a style that he carried through his adult career. He eventually spoke with such ferocious speed that stenographers had a hard time following him.\nHoover was 18\u00a0years old when he accepted his first job, an entry-level position as messenger in the orders department at the Library of Congress. The library was a half mile from his house. The experience shaped both Hoover and the creation of the FBI profiles; as Hoover observed in a 1951 letter, \"This job ... trained me in the value of collating material. It gave me an excellent foundation for my work in the FBI where it has been necessary to collate information and evidence.\"\nIn 1916, Hoover obtained a Bachelor of Laws from the George Washington University Law School, where he was a member of the Alpha Nu Chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order, a Southern fraternity. While Kappa Alpha Order later deemed Confederate General Robert E. Lee as their spiritual founder, this happened after Hoover\u2019s time as an active member. Some prominent Kappa Alpha alumni, who had an influence on Hoover's future beliefs, included author Thomas Dixon and John Temple Graves. Hoover graduated with an LL.M. in 1917 from the same university. While a law student, Hoover became interested in the career of Anthony Comstock, the New York City U.S. Postal Inspector, who waged prolonged campaigns against fraud, vice, pornography, and birth control.\nDepartment of Justice.\nWar Emergency Division.\nImmediately after getting his LL.M. degree, Hoover was hired by the Justice Department to work in the War Emergency Division. He accepted the clerkship on July 27, 1917, aged 22. The job paid $990 a year ($ in 2024 dollars) and was exempt from the draft. Hoover soon became the head of the Division's Alien Enemy Bureau, authorized by President Woodrow Wilson at the beginning of World War I to arrest and jail allegedly disloyal foreigners without trial. He received additional authority from the 1917 Espionage Act. Out of a list of 1,400 suspicious Germans living in the U.S., the Bureau arrested 98 and designated 1,172 as arrestable.\nBureau of Investigation.\nHead of the Radical Division.\nIn August 1919, the 24-year-old Hoover became head of the Bureau of Investigation's new General Intelligence Division, also known as the Radical Division because its goal was to monitor and disrupt the work of domestic radicals. America's First Red Scare was beginning, and one of Hoover's first assignments was to carry out the Palmer Raids. Hoover and his chosen assistant, George Ruch, monitored a variety of U.S. radicals. Targets during this period included Marcus Garvey; Rose Pastor Stokes and Cyril Briggs; Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman; and future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, who, Hoover maintained, was \"the most dangerous man in the United States\". In 1920, at D.C.'s Federal Lodge No. 1 in Washington, D.C., the 25-year-old Hoover was initiated as a Freemason. He went on to join the Scottish Rite in which he was made a 33rd Degree Inspector General Honorary in 1955.\nHead of the Bureau of Investigation.\nIn 1921, Hoover rose in the Bureau of Investigation to deputy head, and in 1924 the Attorney General made him the acting director. On May 10, 1924, President Calvin Coolidge appointed Hoover as the fifth Director of the Bureau of Investigation, partly in response to allegations that the prior director, William J. Burns, was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. When Hoover took over the Bureau of Investigation, it had approximately 650\u00a0employees, including 441\u00a0Special Agents. Hoover fired all female agents and banned the future hiring of them.\nHoover was sometimes unpredictable in his leadership. He frequently fired Bureau agents, singling out those he thought \"looked stupid like truck drivers,\" or whom he considered \"pinheads\". He also relocated agents who had displeased him to career-ending assignments and locations. Melvin Purvis was a prime example: Purvis was one of the most effective agents in capturing and breaking up 1930s gangs, and it is alleged that Hoover maneuvered him out of the Bureau because he was envious of the substantial public recognition Purvis received.\nIn December 1929, Hoover oversaw the protection detail for the Japanese Naval Delegation who were visiting Washington, D.C., on their way to attend negotiations for the 1930 London Naval Treaty (officially called Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament). The Japanese delegation was greeted at Washington Union (train) Station by U.S. Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson and the Japanese Ambassador Katsuji Debuchi. The Japanese delegation then visited the White House to meet with President Herbert Hoover.\nDepression-era gangsters.\nIn the early 1930s, criminal gangs carried out large numbers of bank robberies in the Midwest. They used their superior firepower and fast getaway cars to elude local law enforcement agencies and avoid arrest. Many of these criminals frequently made newspaper headlines across the United States, particularly John Dillinger, who became famous for leaping over bank cages, and repeatedly escaping from jails and police traps.\nThe robbers operated across state lines, and Hoover pressed to have their crimes recognized as federal offenses so that he and his men would have the authority to pursue them and get the credit for capturing them. Initially, the Bureau suffered some embarrassing foul-ups, in particular with Dillinger and his conspirators. A raid on a summer lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, called \"Little Bohemia\", left a Bureau agent and a civilian bystander dead and others wounded; all the gangsters escaped.\nHoover realized that his job was then on the line, and he pulled out all stops to capture the culprits. In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the Chicago office, received a tip on Dillinger's whereabouts that paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed, and killed by Bureau agents outside the Biograph Theater. Hoover was credited for overseeing several highly publicized captures or shootings of outlaws and bank robbers. These included those of Machine Gun Kelly in 1933, of Dillinger in 1934, and of Alvin Karpis in 1936, which led to the Bureau's powers being broadened.\nIn 1935, the Bureau of Investigation was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It was not simply a name change. A great deal of restructuring was done. In fact, Hoover visited the lab of Canadian forensic scientist Wilfrid Derome twice \u2013 in 1929 and 1932 \u2013 to plan the foundation of his own FBI laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1939, the FBI became pre-eminent in domestic intelligence, thanks in large part to changes made by Hoover, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division, to compiling the largest collection of fingerprints to date, and Hoover's help to expand the FBI's recruitment and create the FBI Laboratory, a division established in 1932 to examine and analyze evidence found by the FBI.\nAmerican Mafia.\nDuring the 1930s, Hoover persistently denied the existence of organized crime, despite numerous organized crime shootings as Mafia groups struggled for control of the lucrative profits deriving from illegal alcohol sales during Prohibition, and later for control of prostitution, illegal drugs and other criminal enterprises. Hoover was reluctant to pursue the Mafia as he knew that organized crime investigations typically required excessive man hours while resulting in a relatively small number of arrests. He also feared that placing underpaid FBI agents\u2014who had a starting annual salary $5,500 in the mid 1950s\u2014in close contact with wealthy mobsters could undermine the FBI's reputation of incorruptibility.\nMany writers believe Hoover's denial of the Mafia's existence and his failure to use the full force of the FBI to investigate it were due to Mafia gangsters Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello's possession of embarrassing photographs of Hoover in the company of his \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9\", FBI Deputy Director Clyde Tolson. Other writers believe Costello corrupted Hoover by providing him with horseracing tips, passed through a mutual friend, gossip columnist Walter Winchell. Hoover had a reputation as \"an inveterate horseplayer\" and was known to send Special Agents to place $100 bets for him. Hoover once said the Bureau had \"much more important functions\" than arresting bookmakers and gamblers.\nAlthough Hoover built the reputation of the FBI arresting bank robbers in the 1930s, his main interest had always been Communist subversion, and during the Cold War he was able to focus the FBI's attention on these investigations. From the mid-1940s through the mid-1950s, he paid little attention to criminal vice rackets such as illegal drugs, prostitution, extortion, and flatly denied the existence of the Mafia in the United States. In the 1950s, evidence of the FBI's unwillingness to investigate the Mafia became a topic of public criticism. After the Apalachin meeting of crime bosses in 1957, Hoover could no longer deny the existence of a nationwide crime syndicate. In fact, Cosa Nostra's control of the Syndicate's many branches operating criminal activities throughout North America prevailed and was heavily reported in popular newspapers and magazines. Hoover created the \"Top Hoodlum Program\" and went after the syndicate's top bosses throughout the country.\nInvestigation of subversion and radicals.\nHoover was concerned about what he claimed was subversion, and under his leadership the FBI investigated tens of thousands of suspected subversives and radicals. According to critics, Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of these alleged subversives and many times overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating that perceived threat. William G. Hundley, a Justice Department prosecutor, joked that Hoover's investigations had actually helped the American communist movement survive, as Hoover's \"informants were nearly the only ones that paid the party dues.\" Due to the FBI's aggressive targeting, by 1957 the membership of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were informants for the FBI.\nFlorida and Long Island U-boat landings.\nThe FBI investigated rings of German saboteurs and spies starting in the late 1930s and had primary responsibility for counterespionage. The first arrests of German agents were made in 1938 and continued throughout World War II. In the Quirin affair during World War II, German U-boats set two small groups of Nazi agents ashore in Florida and on Long Island to cause acts of sabotage within the country. The two teams were apprehended after one of the agents contacted the FBI and told them everything \u2013 he was also charged and convicted.\nWiretapping.\nDuring this time period, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, out of concern over Nazi agents in the United States, gave \"qualified permission\" to wiretap persons \"suspected ... [of] subversive activities\". He went on to add in 1941 that the U.S. Attorney General had to be informed of its use in each case. Attorney General Robert H. Jackson left it to Hoover to decide how and when to use wiretaps, as he found the \"whole business\" distasteful. Jackson's successor at the post of Attorney General, Francis Biddle, did turn down Hoover's requests on occasion. An example of J. Edgar Hoover approving wiretaps is the Nixon wiretaps.\nConcealed espionage discoveries.\nIn the late 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave Hoover the task to investigate both foreign espionage in the United States and the activities of domestic communists and fascists. When the Cold War began in the late 1940s, the FBI under Hoover undertook the intensive surveillance of communists and other left-wing activists in the United States. The FBI also participated in the Venona project, a pre-World War II joint project with the British to eavesdrop on Soviet spies in the UK and the United States. They did not initially realize that espionage was being committed, but the Soviets' multiple use of one-time pad ciphers (which with single use are unbreakable) created redundancies that allowed some intercepts to be decoded. These established that espionage was being carried out. Hoover kept the intercepts\u00a0\u2013 America's greatest counterintelligence secret\u00a0\u2013 in a locked safe in his office. He chose not to inform President Harry S. Truman, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath, or Secretaries of State Dean Acheson and General George Marshall while they held office. He informed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the Venona Project in 1952.\nPlans for expanding the FBI to do global intelligence.\nAfter World War II, Hoover advanced plans to create a \"World-Wide Intelligence Service\". These plans were shot down by the Truman administration. Truman objected to the plan, emerging bureaucratic competitors opposed the centralization of power inherent in the plans, and there was a considerable aversion to creating an American version of the \"Gestapo\".\nPlans for suspending \"habeas corpus\".\nIn 1946, Attorney General Tom C. Clark authorized Hoover to compile a list of potentially disloyal Americans who might be detained during a wartime national emergency. In 1950, at the outbreak of the Korean War, Hoover submitted a plan to President Truman to suspend the writ of \"habeas corpus\" and detain 12,000 Americans suspected of disloyalty. Truman did not act on the plan.\nCOINTELPRO and the 1950s.\nIn 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited the Justice Department's ability to prosecute people for their political opinions, most notably communists. Some of his aides reported that he purposely exaggerated the threat of communism to \"ensure financial and public support for the FBI.\" At this time he formalized a covert \"dirty tricks\" program under the name COINTELPRO. COINTELPRO was first used to disrupt the CPUSA, where Hoover ordered observation and pursuit of targets that ranged from suspected citizen spies to larger celebrity figures, such as Charlie Chaplin, whom he saw as spreading Communist propaganda.\nCOINTELPRO's methods included infiltration, burglaries, setting up illegal wiretaps, planting forged documents, and spreading false rumors about key members of target organizations. Some authors have charged that COINTELPRO methods also included inciting violence and arranging murders. This program remained in place until it was exposed to the public in 1971, after the burglary by a group of eight activists of many internal documents from an office in Media, Pennsylvania, whereupon COINTELPRO became the cause of some of the harshest criticism of Hoover and the FBI. COINTELPRO's activities were investigated in 1975 by the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, called the \"Church Committee\" after its chairman, Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho); the committee declared COINTELPRO's activities were illegal and contrary to the Constitution.\nHoover amassed significant power by collecting files containing large amounts of compromising and potentially embarrassing information on many powerful people, especially politicians. According to Laurence Silberman, appointed Deputy Attorney General in early 1974, FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley thought such files either did not exist or had been destroyed. After \"The Washington Post\" broke a story in January 1975, Kelley searched and found them in his outer office. The House Judiciary Committee then demanded that Silberman testify about them.\nReaction to civil rights groups.\nIn 1956, several years before he targeted Martin Luther King Jr., Hoover had a public showdown with T. R. M. Howard, a civil rights leader from Mound Bayou, Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard had criticized the FBI's failure to investigate thoroughly the racially motivated murders of George W. Lee, Lamar Smith, and Emmett Till. Hoover wrote an open letter to the press singling out these statements as \"irresponsible\". In the 1960s, Hoover's FBI monitored John Lennon, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali. The COINTELPRO tactics were later extended to organizations such as the Nation of Islam, the Black Panther Party, King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and others. Hoover's moves against people who maintained contacts with subversive elements, some of whom were members of the civil rights movement, also led to accusations of trying to undermine their reputations.\nThe treatment of Martin Luther King Jr. and actress Jean Seberg are two examples: Jacqueline Kennedy recalled that Hoover told President John F. Kennedy that King had tried to arrange a sex party while in the capital for the March on Washington and that Hoover told Robert F. Kennedy that King had made derogatory comments during the President's funeral. Under Hoover's leadership, the FBI sent an anonymous blackmail letter to King shortly before he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, indicating \"There is only one thing left for you to do\", which King interpreted as an exhortation for him to commit suicide; however, King's interpretation of the letter has not been proven, with more portions of the letter being made public in 2014 which revealed that it also praised \"older leaders\" in the civil right movement such as Roy Wilkins and urged King to step aside and let other men lead the movement.\nThe Church Committee, a U.S. Senate subcommittee led by U.S. Senator Frank Church which investigated numerous controversial FBI activities, found in 1976 that the FBI's intent was to push King out of SCLC leadership. King's aide Andrew Young claimed in a 2013 interview with the Academy of Achievement that the main source of tension between the SCLC and FBI was the government agency's lack of black agents, and that both parties were willing to co-operate with each other by the time the Selma to Montgomery marches had taken place.\nIn one 1965 incident, white civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo was murdered by Ku Klux Klansmen, who had given chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was Gary Thomas Rowe, an acknowledged FBI informant. The FBI spread rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the CPUSA and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African Americans involved in the civil rights movement. FBI records show that Hoover personally communicated these insinuations to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Nevertheless, three Klansmen would be convicted in a federal trial for Liuzzo's murder in December 1965.\nHoover also personally ordered to cease the Federal inquiry into the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing by members of the Ku Klux Klan that killed four girls. By May 1965, local investigators and the FBI had identified suspects in the bombing and witnesses, and this information was relayed to Hoover. No prosecutions of the four suspects ensued even though the evidence was reportedly \"so strong that even a white Alabama jury would convict\". There had been a history of mistrust between local and federal investigators. \nHoover wrote in a memo that the chances of a conviction were remote and told his agents not to share their results with federal or state prosecutors. In 1968, the FBI formally closed their investigation into the bombing without filing charges against any of their named suspects. The files were sealed by order of Hoover. Hoover in 1970 personally authorized \"black-bag\" jobs against the Weather Underground per testimony from William C. Sullivan.\nLate career and death.\nOne of his biographers, Kenneth Ackerman, wrote that the allegation that Hoover's secret files kept presidents from firing him \"is a myth\". President Richard Nixon was recorded in 1971 as stating that one of the reasons he would not fire Hoover was that he was afraid of Hoover's reprisals against him. Similarly, Presidents Harry S. Truman and John F. Kennedy considered dismissing Hoover as FBI Director, but ultimately concluded that the political cost of doing so would be too great. In 1964, Hoover's FBI investigated Jack Valenti, a special assistant and confidant of President Lyndon Johnson, married to Johnson's personal secretary, but who allegedly maintained a gay relationship with a commercial photographer friend.\nHoover personally directed the FBI investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, just days before Hoover testified in the earliest stages of the Warren Commission hearings, President Lyndon B. Johnson waived the then mandatory U.S. Government Service Retirement Age of 70, allowing Hoover to remain the FBI Director \"for an indefinite period of time\". Hoover had been among those to suggest the setting up of the commission, faced with a suspicious public, Hoover wrote to White House aide Walter Jenkins that \"the thing I am concerned about is having something issued so that we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin\". The House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a report in 1979 critical of the performance by the FBI, the Warren Commission, and other agencies. The report criticized the FBI's (Hoover's) reluctance to investigate thoroughly the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.\nWhen Nixon took office in January 1969, Hoover had just turned 74. There was a growing sentiment in Washington, D.C., that the aging FBI chief should retire, but Hoover's power and friends in Congress remained too strong for him to be forced to do so. Hoover remained director of the FBI until he died of a heart attack in his Washington home, on May 2, 1972, whereupon operational command of the Bureau was passed onto Associate Director Clyde Tolson. On May 3, 1972, Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray\u00a0\u2013 a Justice Department official with no FBI experience\u00a0\u2013 as acting director of the FBI, with W. Mark Felt becoming associate director.\nHoover's body lay in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, where Chief Justice Warren Burger eulogized him. Up to that time, Hoover was the only civil servant to have lain in state according to \"The New York Daily News\". At the time, \"The New York Times\" observed that this was \"an honor accorded to only 21 persons before, of whom eight were Presidents or former Presidents.\" President Nixon delivered another eulogy at the funeral service in The National Presbyterian Church, and called Hoover \"one of the Giants, [whose] long life brimmed over with magnificent achievement and dedicated service to this country which he loved so well\". Hoover is buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., next to the graves of his parents and a sister who had died in infancy.\nLegacy.\nFBI.\nBiographer Kenneth D. Ackerman summarizes Hoover's legacy thus:\nFor better or worse, he built the FBI into a modern, national organization stressing professionalism and scientific crime-fighting. For most of his life, Americans considered him a hero. He made the G-Man brand so popular that, at its height, it was harder to become an FBI agent than to be accepted into an Ivy League college. \nHoover worked to groom the image of the FBI in American media; he was a consultant to Warner Brothers for a theatrical film about the FBI, \"The FBI Story\" (1959), and in 1965 on Warner's long-running spin-off television series, \"The F.B.I.\" President Harry S. Truman said that Hoover transformed the FBI into his private secret police force:\n... we want no Gestapo or secret police. The FBI is tending in that direction. They are dabbling in sex-life scandals and plain blackmail. J. Edgar Hoover would give his right eye to take over, and all congressmen and senators are afraid of him.\nBecause Hoover's actions came to be seen as abuses of power, FBI directors are now limited to one 10-year term, subject to extension by the U.S. Senate. Jacob Heilbrunn, journalist and senior editor at \"The\" \"National Interest\", gives a mixed assessment of Hoover's legacy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There's no question that Hoover's record is a mixed one, but I don't think he was a demon. He's constantly being decried as being virulently anti-communist as if this was just a symptom of his paranoia. But if anything, he wasn't vigilant enough in ferreting out communist infiltration in the Roosevelt administration \u2013 we now know from KGB archives that there were dozens if not hundreds of KGB informants working inside the government. He's also regularly accused of broaching people's civil liberties - but in fact, Hoover resisted the wire-tapping activities that President Nixon wanted to perpetuate.\nThe FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. is named the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover. Because of the controversial nature of Hoover's legacy, both Republicans and Democrats have periodically introduced legislation in the House and Senate to rename it. The first such proposal came just two months after the building's inauguration. On December 12, 1979, Gilbert Gude \u2013 a Republican congressman from Maryland \u2013 introduced H.R. 11137, which would have changed the name of the edifice from the \"J. Edgar Hoover F.B.I. Building\" to simply the \"F.B.I. Building\"; however, that bill never made it out of committee, nor did two subsequent attempts by Gude. Another notable attempt came in 1993 when Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum pushed for a name change following a new report about Hoover's ordered \"loyalty investigation\" of future Senator Quentin Burdick. \nIn 1998, Democratic Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building, stating that \"J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the building.\" The Senate did not adopt the amendment. The building is \"aging\" and \"deteriorating\", and its naming might eventually be made moot by the FBI moving its headquarters to a new suburban site. Hoover's practice of violating civil liberties for the stated sake of national security has been questioned in reference to recent national surveillance programs. An example is a lecture titled \"Civil Liberties and National Security: Did Hoover Get it Right?\", given at The Institute of World Politics on April 21, 2015.\nSome qualified praise for Hoover came from the Soviet double agent Kim Philby, who spent time in Washington. Philby respected the way Hoover had built the FBI as a serious intelligence agency from virtually nothing, but Joseph McCarthy was a fake; and Hoover knew that McCarthy was a fake, but found it useful to manipulate McCarthy.\nWhite Christian nationalism.\nThrough his 2023 book \"The Gospel of J. Edgar Hoover\", Lerone Martin argues that an understated but long-lasting influence of Hoover has been to normalize \"white Christian nationalism\" in the country, Hoover framing his work with the FBI as a crusade modelled after Catholic orders such as the Jesuits, despite himself being Protestant, favoring religiosity among FBI members (including \"spiritual retreats\") as well weaponizing traditional Christian rhetoric against what he perceived to be the atheist and Communist menace to the United States, for him founded on Christian principles. Martin also says that such social conservatism was not only religious but also racial in nature, as Hoover aimed to maintain the ethnic dynamics of his days, including the legal superiority of the White Americans over the minorities.\nPrivate life.\nPets.\nHoover received his first dog from his parents when he was a child, after which he was never without one. He owned many throughout his lifetime and became an aficionado especially knowledgeable in breeding of pedigrees, particularly Cairn Terriers and Beagles. He gave many dogs to notable people, such as Presidents Herbert Hoover (not closely related) and Lyndon B. Johnson, and buried seven canine pets, including a Cairn Terrier named Spee De Bozo, at Aspen Hill Memorial Park, in Silver Spring, Maryland.\nSexuality.\nIn the 1940s, rumors began circulating that Hoover was homosexual. Hoover reportedly hunted down and threatened anyone who insinuated that he was homosexual. On May 2, 1969, \"Screw\" published the first reference in print to Hoover's sexuality, titled \"Is J. Edgar Hoover a Fag?\"\nHoover described Clyde Tolson as his alter ego. Both single, the two men worked closely; also, they often went to night clubs together, dined together, and vacationed together. This closeness between the two men is often cited as evidence that they were lovers. Some FBI employees who knew them, such as Mark Felt, say the relationship was \"brotherly\"; however, former FBI executive assistant director Mike Mason suggested that some of Hoover's colleagues denied that he had a sexual relationship with Tolson in an effort to protect Hoover's image. Hoover bequeathed his estate to Tolson, who moved into Hoover's house after Hoover died. Tolson accepted the American flag that draped Hoover's casket. Tolson is buried a few yards away from Hoover in the Congressional Cemetery. \nSome associates and scholars dismiss rumors about Hoover's alleged homosexuality, and rumors about an alleged sexual relationship with Tolson in particular, as unlikely, while others have described them as probable or even \"confirmed\". Still, other scholars have reported the rumors without expressing an opinion. Historians John Stuart Cox and Athan G. Theoharis concluded that \"the strange likelihood is that Hoover never knew sexual desire at all\". Anthony Summers, who wrote \"Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover\" (1993), stated that there was no ambiguity about the FBI director's sexual proclivities and described him as \"bisexual with failed heterosexuality\".\nIn his 2004 study, historian David K. Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover's homosexuality as relying on \"the kind of tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected: guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip\".\nHoover kept a large collection of pornographic films, photographs, and written materials, with particular emphasis on nude photos of celebrities. He reportedly used these for his own titillation and held them for blackmail purposes.\nSummers quoted Susan Rosenstiel as claiming to have seen Hoover engaging in cross-dressing in the 1950s at all-male parties at the Plaza Hotel with attorney Roy Cohn and young male prostitutes. Another Hoover biographer, Burton Hersh, later corroborated this story. Others have expressed skepticism about accounts of Hoover's tranvestism.\nAncestry.\nSince the release of the 2011 film \"J. Edgar\", Hoover's genealogy has become a topic of interest. A theory that Hoover had African-American heritage has not been substantiated. There are also family stories and genealogies recorded by writer Millie McGhee in her 2000 book \"Secrets Uncovered: J. Edgar Hoover \u2014 Passing for White?\", where she and Hoover are said to have a common ancestor.\u00a0The claim has not been proven.\nWritten works.\nHoover was the nominal author of a number of books and articles, for which he received the credit and royalties, although it is widely believed that all of these were ghostwritten by FBI employees.\nTheater and media portrayals.\nHoover has been portrayed by numerous actors in films and stage productions featuring him as FBI Director. The first known portrayal was by Kent Rogers in the 1941 Looney Tunes short \"Hollywood Steps Out\". Some notable portrayals (listed chronologically) include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The Secret File on J.

{"id": "16045", "revid": "12136076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16045", "title": "James Thurber", "text": "American cartoonist, author, journalist, and playwright (1894\u20131961)\nJames Grover Thurber (December 8, 1894 \u2013 November 2, 1961) was an American cartoonist, writer, humorist, journalist, and playwright. He was best known for his cartoons and short stories, published mainly in \"The New Yorker\" and collected in his numerous books.\nThurber was one of the most popular humorists of his time and celebrated the comic frustrations and eccentricities of ordinary people. His works have frequently been adapted into films, including \"The Male Animal\" (1942), \"The Battle of the Sexes\" (1959, based on Thurber's \"The Catbird Seat\"), and \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" (adapted twice, in 1947 and in 2013).\nLife.\nThurber was born in Columbus, Ohio, to Charles L. Thurber and Mary Agnes \"Mame\" (n\u00e9e Fisher) Thurber on December 8, 1894. Both of his parents greatly influenced his work. His father was a sporadically employed clerk and minor politician who dreamed of being a lawyer or an actor. Thurber described his mother as a \"born comedian\" and \"one of the finest comic talents I think I have ever known\". She was a practical joker and on one occasion pretended to be disabled, and attended a faith healer revival only to jump up and proclaim herself healed.\nDue to overcrowding in his grandfather's house, where his family had moved while his father recovered from an illness, Thurber often stayed at the home of his aunt, Margery Albright. Albright lived in Downtown Columbus near Holy Cross Church, the clock and bell of which Thurber would reference in later writing.\nWhen Thurber was seven years old, he and one of his brothers were playing a game of William Tell, when his brother shot James in the eye with an arrow. He lost that eye, and the injury later caused him to become almost entirely blind. He was unable to participate in sports and other activities in his childhood because of this injury, but he developed a creative mind, which he used to express himself in writings. Neurologist V. S. Ramachandran suggests that Thurber's imagination may be partly explained by Charles Bonnet syndrome, a neurological condition that causes complex visual hallucinations in people who have had some level of visual loss. (This was the basis for the piece \"The Admiral on the Wheel\".)\nFrom 1913 to 1918, Thurber attended Ohio State University where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and editor of the student magazine, the \"Sundial\". It was during this time that he rented the house on 77 Jefferson Avenue,&lt;ref name=\"csmonitor/life-James-Thurber\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which became Thurber House in 1984. He never graduated from the university because his poor eyesight prevented him from taking a mandatory Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) course. In 1995 he was posthumously awarded a degree.\nFrom 1918 to 1920, Thurber worked as a code clerk for the United States Department of State, first in Washington, D.C., and then at the embassy in Paris. On returning to Columbus, he began his career as a reporter for \"The Columbus Dispatch\" from 1921 to 1924. During part of this time, he reviewed books, films, and plays in a weekly column called \"Credos and Curios\", a title that was given to a posthumous collection of his work. Thurber returned to Paris during this period, where he wrote for the \"Chicago Tribune\" and other newspapers.\nMove to New York.\nIn 1925, Thurber moved to Greenwich Village in New York City, obtaining a job as a reporter with the \"New York Evening Post\". He joined the staff of \"The New Yorker\" in 1927 as an editor, with the help of E. B. White, his friend and fellow \"New Yorker\" contributor. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930 after White found some of Thurber's drawings in a trash can and submitted them for publication; White inked-in some of these earlier drawings to make them reproduce better for the magazine, and years later expressed deep regret he had done such a thing. Thurber contributed both his writings and his drawings to \"The New Yorker\" until the 1950s.\nMarriage and family.\nThurber married Althea Adams in 1922, although the marriage, as he later wrote to a friend, devolved into \"a relationship charming, fine, and hurting\". They lived in the Sanford\u2013Curtis\u2013Thurber House, in Fairfield County, Connecticut, with their daughter Rosemary&lt;ref name=\"lithub/grandfathers-book\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (b. 1931).&lt;ref name=\"connecticutcreativeplaces/sanford-curtis-thurber\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"newstimes/11055925\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ended in divorce in May 1935, and Althea kept&lt;ref name=\"ctpost/11055925\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford\u2013Curtis\u2013Thurber House. He married his editor, Helen Muriel Wismer (1902\u20131986) in June 1935. After meeting Mark Van Doren on a ferry to Martha's Vineyard, Thurber began summering in Cornwall, Connecticut, along with many other prominent artists and authors of the time. After three years of renting, Thurber found a home, which he referred to as \"The Great Good Place\", in Cornwall, Connecticut.&lt;ref name=\"connecticutcreativeplaces/Great Good Place\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nDeath.\nThurber's behavior became erratic in his last year. Thurber was stricken with a blood clot on the brain on October 4, 1961, and underwent emergency surgery, drifting in and out of consciousness. Although the operation was initially successful, Thurber died a few weeks later, on November 2, aged 66, due to complications from pneumonia. The doctors said his brain was senescent from several small strokes and hardening of the arteries. His last words, aside from the repeated word \"God\", were \"God bless... God damn\", according to his wife, Helen.\nCareer.\nThurber also became well known for his simple, outlandish drawings and cartoons. Both his literary and his drawing skills were helped along by the support of, and collaboration with, fellow \"New Yorker\" staff member E. B. White, who insisted that Thurber's sketches could stand on their own as artistic expressions. Thurber drew six covers and numerous classic illustrations for \"The New Yorker\".\nWriter.\nMany of Thurber's short stories are humorous fictional memoirs from his life, but he also wrote darker material, such as \"The Whip-Poor-Will\", a story of madness and murder. His best-known short stories are \"The Dog That Bit People\" and \"The Night the Bed Fell\"; they can be found in \"My Life and Hard Times\", which was his \"break-out\" book. Among his other classics are \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\", \"The Catbird Seat\", \"The Night the Ghost Got In\", \"A Couple of Hamburgers\", \"The Greatest Man in the World\", and \"If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox\". \"The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze\" has several short stories with a tense undercurrent of marital discord. The book was published the year of his divorce and remarriage.\nAlthough his 1941 story \"You Could Look It Up\", about a three-foot adult being brought in to take a walk in a baseball game, has been said to have inspired Bill Veeck's stunt with Eddie Gaedel with the St. Louis Browns in 1951, Veeck claimed an older provenance for the stunt.\nIn addition to his other fiction, Thurber wrote more than seventy-five fables, some of which were first published in \"The New Yorker\" (1939), then collected in \"Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated\" (1940) and \"Further Fables for Our Time\" (1956). These were short stories that featured anthropomorphic animals (e.g. \"The Little Girl and the Wolf\", his version of Little Red Riding Hood) as main characters, and ended with a moral as a tagline. An exception to this format was his most famous fable, \"The Unicorn in the Garden\", which featured an all-human cast except for the unicorn, which does not speak. Thurber's fables were satirical, and the morals served as punch lines as well as advice to the reader, demonstrating \"the complexity of life by depicting the world as an uncertain, precarious place, where few reliable guidelines exist.\" His stories also included several book-length fairy tales, such as \"The White Deer\" (1945), \"The 13 Clocks\" (1950) and \"The Wonderful O\" (1957). The latter two were among several of Thurber's works illustrated by Marc Simont.\nThurber's prose for \"The New Yorker\" and other venues included numerous humorous essays. A favorite subject, especially toward the end of his life, was the English language. Pieces on this subject included \"The Spreading 'You Know',\" which decried the overuse of that pair of words in conversation, \"The New Vocabularianism\", and \"What Do You Mean It \"Was\" Brillig?\". His short pieces \u2013 whether stories, essays or something in between \u2013 were referred to as \"casuals\" by Thurber and the staff of \"The New Yorker\".\nThurber wrote a five-part \"New Yorker\" series, between 1947 and 1948, examining in depth the radio soap opera phenomenon, based on near-constant listening and researching over the same period. Leaving nearly no element of these programs unexamined, including their writers, producers, sponsors, performers, and listeners alike, Thurber republished the series in his anthology, \"The Beast in Me and Other Animals\" (1948), under the section title \"Soapland.\" The series was one of the first to examine such a pop-culture phenomenon in depth.\nThe last twenty years of Thurber's life were filled with material and professional success in spite of his blindness. He published at least fourteen books in that era, including \"The Thurber Carnival\" (1945), \"Thurber Country\" (1953), and the extremely popular book about \"New Yorker\" founder/editor Harold Ross, \"The Years with Ross\" (1959). A number of Thurber's short stories were made into movies, including \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" in 1947.\nCartoonist.\nWhile Thurber drew his cartoons in the usual fashion in the 1920s and 1930s, his failing eyesight later required changes. He drew them on very large sheets of paper using a thick black crayon (or on black paper using white chalk, from which they were photographed and the colors reversed for publication). Regardless of method, his cartoons became as noted as his writings; they possessed an eerie, wobbly feel that seems to mirror his idiosyncratic view on life. He once wrote that people said it looked like he drew them under water. Dorothy Parker, a contemporary and friend of Thurber, referred to his cartoons as having the \"semblance of unbaked cookies\". The last drawing Thurber completed was a self-portrait in yellow crayon on black paper, which was featured as the cover of \"Time\" magazine on July 9, 1951. The same drawing was used for the dust jacket of \"The Thurber Album\" (1952).\n75th anniv. edition (2004) with foreword by John Updike, \n (Modern Library Edition)\nBibliography.\nShort stories.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranscript of Alistair Cooke's Interview With James Thurber on \"Omnibus (U.S. TV series)\" \nProvided to YouTube by Masterworks Broadway; \u2117 Originally released 1960 Sony Music Entertainment"}
{"id": "16046", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16046", "title": "James Cagney", "text": "American actor and dancer (1899\u20131986)\nJames Francis Cagney Jr. (; July 17, 1899\u00a0\u2013 March 30, 1986) was an American actor and dancer. On stage and in film, he was known for his consistently energetic performances, distinctive vocal style, and deadpan comic timing. He won acclaim and major awards for a wide variety of performances.\nCagney is remembered for playing multifaceted tough guys in films such as \"The Public Enemy\" (1931), \"Taxi!\" (1932), \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938), \"The Roaring Twenties\" (1939), \"City for Conquest\" (1940) and \"White Heat\" (1949), finding himself typecast in the early years of his career. He was able to negotiate dancing opportunities in his films and ended up winning the Academy Award for his role of George M. Cohan in the musical \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942). In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him eighth on its list of greatest male stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Orson Welles described him as \"maybe the greatest actor who ever appeared in front of a camera\".\nAfter making his debut in 1919, he spent several years in vaudeville as a dancer and comedian and played his first major acting role in 1925. Al Jolson was sufficiently impressed by his performance in 1929's \"Penny Arcade\" that he bought the rights to it, securing Cagney's part in the Warner Bros. adaptation of the play. This marked the beginning of a lengthy, albeit turbulent association with the studio. \nCagney's fifth film, \"The Public Enemy\", became one of the most influential gangster movies of the period. He became one of Hollywood's leading stars and one of Warner Bros.' biggest contracts at the time. In 1938, he received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his subtle portrayal of the tough guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan in \"Angels with Dirty Faces\". He was nominated a third time in 1955 for \"Love Me or Leave Me\" with Doris Day. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961. He came out of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie \"Ragtime\" (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.\nCagney walked out on Warner Bros. twice over the course of his career, each time returning on much improved personal and artistic terms. In 1935, he sued Warner for breach of contract and signed with Edward L. Alperson's independent company Grand National Pictures. In 1942, he established his own production company, Cagney Productions, before returning to Warner seven years later. In reference to Cagney's refusal to be pushed around, Jack L. Warner called him \"the Professional Againster\". Cagney also made numerous USO troop tours before and during World War II and served as president of the Screen Actors Guild for two years.\nEarly life.\nJames Francis \"Jimmy\" Cagney Jr. was born in 1899 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. His biographers disagree as to the actual location: either on the corner of Avenue D and 8th Street, or in a top-floor apartment at 391 East 8th Street, the address that is on his birth certificate. His father, James Francis Cagney Sr. (1875\u20131918), was of Irish descent. At the time of his son's birth, he was a bartender and amateur boxer, although on Cagney's birth certificate, he is listed as a telegraphist. His mother was Carolyn Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Nelson; 1877\u20131945); her father was a Norwegian ship's captain, and her mother was Irish.\nCagney was the second of seven children, two of whom died within months of their births. He was sickly as an infant\u2014so much so that his mother feared he would die before he could be baptized. He later attributed his sickly health to the poverty his family endured. The family moved twice while he was still young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street. He was confirmed at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan; his funeral service would eventually be held in the same church.\nThe red-haired, blue-eyed Cagney graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City in 1918, and attended Columbia College, where he intended to major in Art. He also took German and joined the Student Army Training Corps, but he dropped out after one semester, returning home upon the death of his father during the 1918 flu pandemic.\nCagney held a variety of jobs early in his life: junior architect, copy boy for the \"New York Sun\", book custodian at the New York Public Library, bellhop, draughtsman, and night doorkeeper. He gave all his earnings to his family. While Cagney was working for the New York Public Library, he met Florence James, who helped him into an acting career. Cagney believed in hard work, later stating, \"It was good for me. I feel sorry for the kid who has too cushy a time of it. Suddenly he has to come face-to-face with the realities of life without any mama or papa to do his thinking for him.\"\nHe started tap dance as a boy (a skill that eventually contributed to his Academy Award) and was nicknamed \"Cellar-Door Cagney\" after his habit of dancing on slanted cellar doors. He was a good street fighter, defending his older brother Harry, a medical student, when necessary. He engaged in amateur boxing, and was a runner-up for the New York state lightweight title. His coaches encouraged him to turn professional, but his mother would not allow it. He also played semi-professional baseball for a local team, and entertained dreams of playing in the Major Leagues.\nHis introduction to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt who lived in Brooklyn, opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House (one of the first settlement houses in the nation) where his brother Harry performed and Florence James directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake.\nCareer.\n1919\u20131930: Early career.\nIn 1919, while Cagney was working at Wanamaker's Department Store, a colleague saw him dance and informed him about a role in the upcoming production \"Every Sailor\". It was a wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women that was originally titled \"Ever Sailor\". Cagney auditioned for the chorus, although considering it a waste of time, as he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves and added them to his repertoire while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own naturally shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: \"For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles.\"\nHad Cagney's mother had her way, his stage career would have ended when he quit \"Every Sailor\" after two months; proud as she was of his performance, she preferred that he get an education. Cagney appreciated the $35 a week he was paid, which he later remembered as \"a mountain of money for me in those worrisome days.\" In deference to his mother's concerns, he got a job as a brokerage house runner. This did not stop him from looking for more stage work, however, and he went on to audition successfully for a chorus part in the William B. Friedlander musical \"Pitter Patter\", for which he earned $55 a week. (He sent $40 to his mother each week.) So strong was his habit of holding down more than one job at a time, that he also worked as a dresser for one of the leads, portered the casts' luggage, and understudied for the lead. Among the chorus line performers was 20-year-old Frances Willard \"Billie\" Vernon; they married in 1922.\nThe show began Cagney's 10-year association with vaudeville and Broadway. The Cagneys were among the early residents of Free Acres, a social experiment established by Bolton Hall in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.\n\"Pitter Patter\" was not hugely successful, but it did well enough to run for 32 weeks, making it possible for Cagney to join the vaudeville circuit. He and Vernon toured separately with a number of different troupes, reuniting as \"Vernon and Nye\" to do simple comedy routines and musical numbers. \"Nye\" was a rearrangement of the last syllable of Cagney's surname. One of the troupes Cagney joined was Parker, Rand, and Leach, taking over the spot vacated when Archie Leach\u2014who later changed his name to Cary Grant\u2014left.\nIn 1924, after years of touring and struggling to make money, Cagney and Vernon moved to Hawthorne, California, partly for Cagney to meet his new mother-in-law, who had just moved there from Chicago, and partly to investigate breaking into the movies. Their train fares were paid for by a friend, the press officer of \"Pitter Patter\", who was also desperate to act. They were not successful at first; the dance studio Cagney set up had few clients and folded; Vernon and he toured the studios, but there was no interest. Eventually, they borrowed some money and headed back to New York via Chicago and Milwaukee, enduring failure along the way when they attempted to make money on the stage.\nCagney secured his first significant nondancing role in 1925. He played a young tough guy in the three-act play \"Outside Looking In\" by Maxwell Anderson, earning $200 a week. As with \"Pitter Patter\", Cagney went to the audition with little confidence he would get the part. At this point, he had had no experience with drama. Cagney felt that he only got the role because his hair was redder than that of Alan Bunce, the only other red-headed performer in New York. Both the play and Cagney received good reviews; \"Life\" magazine wrote, \"Mr. Cagney, in a less spectacular role [than his co-star] makes a few minutes silence during his mock-trial scene something that many a more established actor might watch with profit.\" Burns Mantle wrote that it \"...contained the most honest acting now to be seen in New York.\"\nFollowing the four-month run of \"Outside Looking In\", the Cagneys were financially secure enough for Cagney to return to vaudeville over the next few years, achieving various success. During this period, he met George M. Cohan, whom he later portrayed in \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\", though they never spoke.\nCagney secured the lead role in the 1926\u201327 season West End production of \"Broadway\" by George Abbott. The show's management insisted that he copy Broadway lead Lee Tracy's performance, despite Cagney's discomfort in doing so, but the day before the show sailed for England, they decided to replace him. This was a devastating turn of events for Cagney apart from the logistical difficulties this presented \u2013 the couple's luggage was in the hold of the ship and they had given up their apartment. He almost quit show business. As Vernon recalled, \"Jimmy said that it was all over. He made up his mind that he would get a job doing something else.\"\nThe Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, which lasted as long as the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, providing them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, and then landed a part in the play \"Women Go On Forever\", directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school.\nCagney had built a reputation as an innovative teacher; when he was cast as the lead in \"Grand Street Follies of 1928\", he was also appointed choreographer. The show received rave reviews and was followed by \"Grand Street Follies of 1929\". These roles led to a part in George Kelly's \"Maggie the Magnificent\", a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney's performance. Cagney saw this role (and \"Women Go on Forever\") as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned \"...what a director was for and what a director could do. They were directors who could play all the parts in the play better than the actors cast for them.\"\n1930\u20131935: Warner Bros..\n\"Sinners' Holiday\" (1930) and \"The Doorway to Hell\" (1930).\nPlaying opposite Cagney in \"Maggie the Magnificent\" was Joan Blondell, who starred again with him a few months later in Marie Baumer's new play, \"Penny Arcade\". While the critics panned \"Penny Arcade\", they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled \"Sinners' Holiday\", the film was released in 1930, starring Grant Withers and Evalyn Knapp. Joan Blondell recalled that when they were casting the film, studio head Jack Warner believed that she and Cagney had no future, and that Withers and Knapp were destined for stardom. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract with Warner Bros.\nIn the film, he portrayed Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic \"bad\" guy was to become a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of \"Sinners' Holiday\", he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his attitude toward the work. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: \"There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... [The line] was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm not going to say that line.'\" They took the line out.\nDespite this outburst, the studio liked him, and before his three-week contract was up\u2014while the film was still shooting\u2014they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which was followed by a full seven-year contract at $400 a week. However, the contract allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively guaranteeing him only 40 weeks\u2019 income at a time. As he did when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately played another colorful gangster supporting role in \"The Doorway to Hell\" (1930) starring Lew Ayres. The film was a financial hit, and helped to cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.\n\"The Public Enemy\" (1931).\nWarner Brothers' succession of gangster movie hits, in particular \"Little Caesar\" with Edward G. Robinson, culminated in the 1931 film \"The Public Enemy\". Due to the strong reviews he had received in his short film career, Cagney was cast as nice-guy Matt Doyle, opposite Edward Woods as Tom Powers. However, after the initial rushes, the actors switched roles. Years later, Joan Blondell recalled that a few days into the filming, director William Wellman turned to Cagney and said \"Now you\u2019re the lead, kid!\" \"Jimmy's charisma was so outstanding\", she added. The film cost only $151,000 to make, but it became one of the first low-budget films to gross $1\u00a0million.\nCagney received widespread praise for his performance. The \"New York Herald Tribune\" described his interpretation as \"...the most ruthless, unsentimental appraisal of the meanness of a petty killer the cinema has yet devised.\" He received top billing after the film, but while he acknowledged the importance of the role to his career, he always disputed the suggestion that it changed the way heroes and leading men were portrayed. He cited Clark Gable's slapping of Barbara Stanwyck six months earlier (in \"Night Nurse\") as more important. \"Night Nurse\" was actually released three months after \"The Public Enemy.\" Gable's character punched Stanwyck's, knocking the nurse unconscious.\nMany critics view the scene in which Cagney pushes half a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face as one of the most famous moments in movie history. The scene itself was a late addition, and the origin of the idea is a matter of debate: producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference, Wellman said the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss, who threw an omelette into his girlfriend's face. Joan Blondell recalled that the change was made when Cagney decided the omelette wouldn't work. Cagney himself usually cited the writers' version, but the fruit's victim, Clarke, agreed that it was Wellman's idea, saying, \"I'm sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit. I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie. Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea suddenly. It wasn't even written into the script.\" However, according to Turner Classic Movies (TCM), the grapefruit scene was a practical joke that Cagney and costar Mae Clarke decided to play on the crew while the cameras were rolling. Wellman liked it so much that he left it in. TCM also notes that the scene made Clarke's ex-husband, Lew Brice, very happy. \"He saw the film repeatedly just to see that scene, and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud.\"\nCagney's stubbornness became well known behind the scenes, especially after he refused to join in a 100% participation-free charity drive pushed by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Cagney did not object to donating money to charity, but he did object to being forced to give. Already he had acquired the nickname \"The Professional Againster\".\n\"Smart Money\" (1931), \"Blonde Crazy\" (1931), and \"Taxi!\" (1932).\nWarner Bros. was quick to team its two rising gangster stars, Edward G. Robinson and Cagney, for the 1931 film \"Smart Money\". Eager to follow the success of Robinson's \"Little Caesar\", the studio filmed \"Smart Money\" concurrently with \"The Public Enemy\".\nWith the introduction of the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 that placed limits upon on-screen violence, Warner Bros. allowed Cagney a change of pace, casting him in the comedy \"Blonde Crazy\", again opposite Blondell.\n\"The Public Enemy\" was an enormous box-office success, and Cagney began to compare his pay with that of his peers, believing that his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films. However, Warner Bros. refused to allow him a pay raise. The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even those in which he did not appear, despite his opposition. Cagney returned to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment.\nWhile Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had effectively become his agent, sought a substantial pay raise and more personal freedom for him. Following the success of \"The Public Enemy\" and \"Blonde Crazy\", Warner Bros. offered Cagney a contract for $1,000 per week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was \"Taxi!\" (1932), a critical success in which Cagney danced for the first time on screen. It also marked the last time that he permitted live ammunition to be shot at him, a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were rare and expensive. During filming for \"Taxi!\", he was almost hit by gunfire. In the film's opening scene, Cagney speaks fluent Yiddish, a language that he had learned during childhood in New York City.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I never said, 'Mmm, you dirty rat!' What I actually did say was 'Judy, Judy, Judy.'\"\n \"Cagney, in his acceptance speech for the AFI Life Achievement Award, 1974\"\n\"Blonde Crazy\" and \"Taxi!\" contain lines that became the basis of many misquoted celebrity impersonations of Cagney. He never said \"Mmm, you dirty rat!\" on film; in \"Blonde Crazy\", he says: \"That dirty, double-crossin' rat!\" and in \"Taxi!\", he says: \"Come out and take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give it to you through the door!\" The quote from \"Blonde Crazy\" was nominated for the American Film Institute's 2005 AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list.\nThe film was swiftly followed by \"The Crowd Roars\" and \"Winner Take All\".\nFighting with Warner Bros..\nDespite his success, Cagney remained dissatisfied with his contract. He wanted more money for his successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. He held out for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended him. Cagney announced that he would do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine. After six months of suspension, Frank Capra brokered a deal that increased Cagney's salary to around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year.\nHaving learned about the block-booking studio system that virtually guaranteed the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, though he did not generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors\u2014even teenagers\u2014regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.\nCagney returned to the studio and made \"Hard to Handle\" (1933). This was followed by a steady stream of crowd-pleasing films, including the highly regarded \"Footlight Parade\", which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots. The film includes show-stopping scenes with Busby Berkeley-choreographed routines. In 1934, \"Here Comes the Navy\" paired him with Pat O'Brien for the first of nine films together. The two would have an enduring friendship. Also in 1934, Cagney made his first of two raucous comedies with Bette Davis, \"Jimmy the Gent\", for which he had himself heavily made up with thick eyebrows and procured an odd haircut for the period without the studio's permission, shaved on the back and sides. Cagney initially had the make-up department put prominent scars on the back of his head for a close-up but the studio demanded that he remove them. Cagney's and Davis's fast-paced scenes together were particularly energetic.\nIn 1935 Cagney was listed as one of the Top Ten Moneymakers in Hollywood for the first time, and was cast more frequently in non-gangster roles; he played a lawyer who joins the FBI in \"G-Men\", and he also took on his first, and only, Shakespearean role, as top-billed Nick Bottom in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" alongside Joe E. Brown as Francis Flute and Mickey Rooney as Puck.\nCagney's last movie in 1935 was \"Ceiling Zero\", his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien received top billing, which was a clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined with the fact that Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.\n1936\u20131937: Independent years.\nCagney spent most of the next year on his farm, and went back to work only when Edward L. Alperson of Grand National Pictures, a newly established, independent studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two features for Grand National: the crime drama \"Great Guy\" (1936) with Cagney as a federal inspector, and the musical \"Something to Sing About\" (1937) with Cagney as a bandleader and dancer. He received good reviews for both. \nCagney might have continued with Grand National but the studio, having spent lavishly on the Cagney films, couldn't recoup the production costs. Grand National usually made low-budget features for small, neighborhood theaters, and the Cagney films proved too expensive for the intended market. Grand National had acquired a promising story property from author Rowland Brown, \"Angels with Dirty Faces\", for $30,000. Cagney was slated to star in the film version but, with the studio in financial trouble, the project went no further. Cagney took the script to Warner Bros., which bought it from Grand National and filmed it in 1938.\nCagney also became involved in political causes, and in 1936, agreed to sponsor the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League. Unknown to Cagney, the League was in fact a front organization for the Communist International (Comintern), which sought to enlist support for the Soviet Union and its foreign policies.\nThe courts eventually decided the Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He had done what many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also knew that he was still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.\nCagney had demonstrated the power of the walkout in holding the studios to their word. He later explained his reasons, saying, \"I walked out because I depended on the studio heads to keep their word on this, that, or other promise, and when the promise was not kept, my only recourse was to deprive them of my services.\" Cagney himself acknowledged the importance of the walkout for other actors in breaking the dominance of the studio system. Normally, when a star walked out, the time he or she was absent was added onto the end of an already long contract, as happened with Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis. Cagney, however, walked out and came back to a better contract. Many in Hollywood watched the case closely for hints of how future contracts might be handled.\n1938\u20131942: Return to Warner Bros..\n\"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938).\nCagney's two films of 1938, \"Boy Meets Girl\" and \"Angels with Dirty Faces\", both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former was a fast-paced farce with a Hollywood theme, with Cagney and O'Brien playing for laughs, and received mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was anxious to get him back to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative.\nCagney starred as Rocky Sullivan, a gangster fresh out of jail and looking for his former associate, played by Humphrey Bogart, who owes him money. While revisiting his old haunts, he runs into his old friend Jerry Connolly, played by O'Brien, who is now a priest concerned about the Dead End Kids' futures, particularly as they idolize Rocky. After a messy shootout, Sullivan is eventually captured by the police and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Connolly pleads with Rocky to \"turn yellow\" on his way to the chair so the Kids will lose their admiration for him, and hopefully avoid turning to crime. Sullivan refuses, but on his way to his execution, he breaks down and begs for his life. It is unclear whether this cowardice is real or just feigned for the Kids' benefit. Cagney himself refused to say, insisting he liked the ambiguity. The film is regarded by many as one of Cagney's finest, and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for 1938. He lost to Spencer Tracy in \"Boys Town\". Cagney had been considered for the role, but lost out on it due to his typecasting. (He also lost the role of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in \"Knute Rockne, All American\" to his friend Pat O'Brien for the same reason.) Cagney did, however, win that year's New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.\nHis earlier insistence on not filming with live ammunition proved to be a good decision. Having been told while filming \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. As it turned out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.\n\"The Roaring Twenties\" (1939).\nDuring his first year back at Warner Bros., Cagney became the studio's highest earner, making $324,000. He starred with George Raft in the smash hit \"Each Dawn I Die\", an extremely entertaining prison movie that was so successful at the box office that it prompted the studio to offer Raft an important contract in the wake of his departure from Paramount. In addition, Cagney made \"The Oklahoma Kid\", a memorable Western with Humphrey Bogart as the black-clad villain. Cagney completed his first decade of movie-making in 1939 with \"The Roaring Twenties\", his first film with Raoul Walsh and his last with Bogart. After \"The Roaring Twenties\", it would be a decade before Cagney made another gangster film. Cagney again received good reviews; Graham Greene stated, \"Mr. Cagney, of the bull-calf brow, is as always a superb and witty actor\". \"The Roaring Twenties\" was the last film in which Cagney's character's violence was explained by poor upbringing, or his environment, as was the case in \"The Public Enemy\". From that point on, violence was attached to mania, as in \"White Heat\". In 1939 Cagney was second to only Gary Cooper in the national acting wage stakes, earning $368,333.\n1940\u20131941: \"City for Conquest\", \"The Fighting 69th\", and \"The Strawberry Blonde\".\nIn 1940, Cagney portrayed a boxer in the epic thriller \"City for Conquest\" with Ann Sheridan as Cagney's leading lady, Arthur Kennedy in his first screen role as Cagney's younger brother attempting to compose musical symphonies, Anthony Quinn as a brutish dancer, and Elia Kazan as a flamboyantly dressed young gangster originally from the local neighborhood. The well-received film with its shocking plot twists features one of Cagney's most moving performances. \nLater the same year, Cagney and Sheridan reunited with Pat O'Brien in \"Torrid Zone\", a turbulent comedy set in a Central American country in which a labor organizer is turning the workers against O'Brien's character's banana company, with Cagney's \"Nick Butler\" intervening. The supporting cast features Andy Devine and George Reeves.\nCagney's third film in 1940 was \"The Fighting 69th\", a World War I film about a real-life unit with Cagney playing a fictional private, alongside Pat O'Brien as Father Francis P. Duffy, George Brent as future OSS leader Maj. \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, and Jeffrey Lynn as famous young poet Sgt. Joyce Kilmer. Alan Hale Sr., Frank McHugh and Dick Foran also appear. In 1941, Cagney and Bette Davis reunited for a comedy set in the contemporary West titled \"The Bride Came C.O.D.\", followed by a change of pace with the gentle turn-of-the-century romantic comedy \"The Strawberry Blonde\" (1941) featuring songs of the period and also starring Olivia de Havilland and rising young phenomenon Rita Hayworth, along with Alan Hale Sr. and Jack Carson.\n\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Smart, alert, hard-headed, Cagney is as typically American as Cohan himself... It was a remarkable performance, probably Cagney's best, and it makes \"Yankee Doodle\" a dandy\"\n\"Time magazine\"\nIn 1942, Cagney portrayed George M. Cohan in \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\", a film Cagney \"took great pride in\" and considered his best. Producer Hal Wallis said that having seen Cohan in \"I'd Rather Be Right\", he never considered anyone other than Cagney for the part. Cagney, though, insisted that Fred Astaire had been the first choice, but turned it down. Many critics of the time and since have declared it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, \"I've always maintained that in this business, you're only as good as the other fellow thinks you are. It's nice to know that you people thought I did a good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too.\"\nFilming began the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the cast and crew worked in a \"patriotic frenzy\" as the United States' involvement in World War II gave the workers a feeling that \"they might be sending the last message from the free world\", according to actress Rosemary DeCamp. Cohan was given a private showing of the film shortly before his death, and thanked Cagney \"for a wonderful job,\" exclaiming, \"My God, what an act to follow!\" A paid premi\u00e8re, with seats ranging from $25 to $25,000, raised $5,750,000 for war bonds for the US treasury.\n1942\u20131948: Independent again.\nCagney announced in March 1942 that his brother William and he were setting up Cagney Productions to release films through United Artists. Free of Warner Bros. again, Cagney spent some time relaxing on his farm in Martha's Vineyard before volunteering to join the USO. He spent several weeks touring the US, entertaining troops with vaudeville routines and scenes from \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\". In September 1942, he was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild.\nAlmost a year after its creation, Cagney Productions produced its first film, \"Johnny Come Lately\", in 1943. While the major studios were producing patriotic war movies, Cagney was determined to continue dispelling his tough-guy image, so he produced a movie that was a \"complete and exhilarating exposition of the Cagney 'alter-ego' on film\". According to Cagney, the film \"made money but it was no great winner\", and reviews varied from excellent (\"Time\") to poor (New York's \"PM\").\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I'm here to dance a few jigs, sing a few songs, say hello to the boys, and that's all.\"\n\"Cagney to British reporters\"\nFollowing the film's completion, Cagney went back to the USO and toured US military bases in the UK. He refused to give interviews to the British press, preferring to concentrate on rehearsals and performances. He gave several performances a day for the Army Signal Corps of \"The American Cavalcade of Dance\", which consisted of a history of American dance, from the earliest days to Fred Astaire, and culminated with dances from \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\".\nThe second movie Cagney's company produced was \"Blood on the Sun\". Insisting on doing his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and from Jack Halloran, a former policeman. He continued to study judo for some time after the film was finished. His use of actual judo throws and holds in the movie has been noted as the first appearance of eastern martial arts in Western film. The Cagneys had hoped that an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse at the box office than \"Johnny Come Lately\". At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of \"Life\" magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.\nWhile negotiating the rights for his third independent film, Cagney starred in 20th Century Fox's \"13 Rue Madeleine\" for $300,000 for two months of work. The wartime spy film was a success, and Cagney was keen to begin production of his new project, an adaptation of William Saroyan's Broadway play \"The Time of Your Life\". Saroyan himself loved the film, but it was a commercial disaster, costing the company half a million dollars to make; audiences again struggled to accept Cagney in a nontough-guy role.\nCagney Productions was in serious trouble; poor returns from the produced films, and a legal dispute with Sam Goldwyn Studio over a rental agreement forced Cagney back to Warner Bros. He signed a distribution-production deal with the studio for the film \"White Heat\", effectively making Cagney Productions a unit of Warner Bros.\n1949\u20131955: Back to Warner Bros..\n\"White Heat\" (1949).\nCagney's portrayal of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film \"White Heat\" is one of his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in \"The Strawberry Blonde\"), and the actor's portrayal of gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in \"The Public Enemy\", Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney's hair had begun to gray, and he developed a paunch for the first time. He was no longer a dashing romantic commodity in precisely the same way he obviously was before, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, \"it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of thing, so I suggested we make him nuts. It was agreed so we put in all those fits and headaches.\"\nCagney's final lines in the film \u2013 \"Made it, Ma! Top of the world!\" \u2013 was voted the 18th-greatest movie line by the American Film Institute. Likewise, Jarrett's explosion of rage in prison on being told of his mother's death is widely hailed as one of Cagney's most memorable performances. Some of the extras on set actually became terrified of the actor because of his violent portrayal. Cagney attributed the performance to his father's alcoholic rages, which he had witnessed as a child, as well as someone that he had seen on a visit to a mental hospital.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"[A] homicidal paranoiac with a mother fixation\"\n\"Warner Bros. publicity description of Cody Jarrett in White Heat\" \nThe film was a critical success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic. Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting. He said to a journalist, \"It's what the people want me to do. Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids could go and see.\" However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\", assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950's \"The West Point Story\" with Doris Day, an actress he admired.\nHis next film, \"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye\", was another gangster movie, which was the first by Cagney Productions since its acquisition. While compared unfavorably to \"White Heat\" by critics, it was fairly successful at the box office, with $500,000 going straight to Cagney Productions' bankers to pay off their losses. Cagney Productions was not a great success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, \"A Lion Is in the Streets\", a drama loosely based on flamboyant politician Huey Long, the company came to an end.\n\"Love Me or Leave Me\" (1955).\nCagney's next notable role was the 1955 film \"Love Me or Leave Me\", his third with Doris Day, who was top-billed above Cagney for this picture, the first movie for which he'd accepted second billing since \"Smart Money\" in 1931. Cagney played Martin \"Moe the Gimp\" Snyder, a lame Jewish-American gangster from Chicago, a part Spencer Tracy had turned down. Cagney described the script as \"that extremely rare thing, the perfect script\". When the film was released, Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney himself insisted he had not, having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped: \"What I did was very simple. I just slapped my foot down as I turned it out while walking. That's all\".\nHis performance earned him another Best Actor Academy Award nomination, 17 years after his first. Reviews were strong, and the film is considered one of the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was \"the most professional actor I've ever known. He was always 'real'. I simply forgot we were making a picture. His eyes would actually fill up when we were working on a tender scene. And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set.\"\n\"Mister Roberts\" (1955).\nCagney's next film was \"Mister Roberts\", directed by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. Tracy's involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role in his close friend's movie, although in the end, Tracy did not take part and Henry Fonda played the titular role instead. Cagney enjoyed working with the film's superb cast despite the absence of Tracy. Major film star William Powell played a rare supporting role as \"Doc\" in the film, his final picture before retirement from a stellar career that had spanned 33 years, since his first appearance in \"Sherlock Holmes\" with John Barrymore in 1922. Cagney had worked with Ford on \"What Price Glory?\" three years earlier, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford had met Cagney at the airport for that film, the director warned him that they would eventually \"tangle asses\", which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, \"I would have kicked his brains out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man.\" The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying \"When I started this picture, you said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready now \u2013 are you?\" Ford walked away, and they had no more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.\nCagney's skill at noticing tiny details in other actors' performances became apparent during the shooting of \"Mister Roberts\". While watching the \"Kraft Music Hall\" anthology television show some months before, Cagney had noticed Jack Lemmon performing left-handed, doing practically everything with his left hand. The first thing that Cagney asked Lemmon when they met was if he was still using his left hand. Lemmon was shocked; he had done it on a whim, and thought no one else had noticed. He said of his co-star, \"his powers of observation must be absolutely incredible, in addition to the fact that he remembered it. I was very flattered.\"\nThe film was a success, securing three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Sound Recording and Best Supporting Actor for Lemmon, who won. While Cagney was not nominated, he had thoroughly enjoyed the production. Filming on Midway Island and in a more minor role meant that he had time to relax and engage in his hobby of painting. He also drew caricatures of the cast and crew.\n1955\u20131961: Later career.\nIn 1955 Cagney replaced Spencer Tracy on the Western film \"Tribute to a Bad Man\" for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received praise for his performance, and the studio liked his work enough to offer him \"These Wilder Years\" with Barbara Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; they had both previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained the cast and crew off-screen by singing and dancing.\nIn 1956 Cagney undertook one of his very rare television roles, starring in Robert Montgomery's \"Soldiers From the War Returning\". This was a favor to Montgomery, who needed a strong fall season opener to stop the network from dropping his series. Cagney's appearance ensured that it was a success. The actor made it clear to reporters afterwards that television was not his medium: \"I do enough work in movies. This is a high-tension business. I have tremendous admiration for the people who go through this sort of thing every week, but it's not for me.\"\nThe following year, Cagney appeared in \"Man of a Thousand Faces\", in which he played a fictionalized version of Lon Chaney. He received excellent reviews, with the \"New York Journal American\" rating it one of his best performances, and the film, made for Universal, was a box office hit. Cagney's skill at mimicry, combined with a physical similarity to Chaney, helped him generate empathy for his character.\nLater in 1957, Cagney ventured behind the camera for the first and only time to direct \"Short Cut to Hell\", a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film \"This Gun for Hire\", which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel \"A Gun for Sale\". Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an excellent director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, \"We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business\".\nIn 1959 Cagney played a labor leader in what proved to be his final musical, \"Never Steal Anything Small\", which featured a comical song and dance duet with Cara Williams, who played his girlfriend.\nFor Cagney's next film, he traveled to Ireland for \"Shake Hands with the Devil\", directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped to spend some time tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.\n\"The Gallant Hours\" (1960).\nCagney's career began winding down, and he made only one film in 1960, the critically acclaimed \"The Gallant Hours\", in which he played Admiral William F. \"Bull\" Halsey. The film, although set during the Guadalcanal campaign in the Pacific Theater during World War II, was not a war film, but instead focused on the impact of command. Cagney Productions, which shared the production credit with Robert Montgomery's company, made a brief return, though in name only. The film was a success, and \"The New York Times\"'s Bosley Crowther singled out its star for praise: \"It is Mr. Cagney's performance, controlled to the last detail, that gives life and strong, heroic stature to the principal figure in the film. There is no braggadocio in it, no straining for bold or sharp effects. It is one of the quietest, most reflective, subtlest jobs that Mr. Cagney has ever done.\"\n\"One, Two, Three\" (1961).\nCagney's penultimate film was a comedy. He was hand-picked by Billy Wilder to play a hard-driving Coca-Cola executive in the film \"One, Two, Three\". Cagney had concerns with the script, remembering back 23 years to \"Boy Meets Girl\", in which scenes were reshot to try to make them funnier by speeding up the pacing, with the opposite effect. Cagney received assurances from Wilder that the script was balanced. Filming did not go well, though, with one scene requiring 50 takes, something to which Cagney was unaccustomed. In fact, it was one of the worst experiences of his long career. Cagney noted, \"I never had the slightest difficulty with a fellow actor. Not until \"One, Two, Three\". In that picture, Horst Buchholz tried all sorts of scene-stealing didoes. I came close to knocking him on his ass.\" For the first time, Cagney considered walking out of a film. He felt he had worked too many years inside studios, and combined with a visit to Dachau concentration camp during filming, he decided that he had had enough, and retired afterward. One of the few positive aspects was his friendship with Pamela Tiffin, to whom he gave acting guidance, including the secret that he had learned over his career: \"You walk in, plant yourself squarely on both feet, look the other fella in the eye, and tell the truth.\"\n1961\u20131986: Later years and retirement.\nCagney remained in retirement for 20 years, conjuring up images of Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in \"My Fair Lady\", he found it easier to rebuff others, including a part in \"The Godfather Part II\". He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.\nAmerican Film Institute Life Achievement Award (1974).\nCagney was diagnosed with glaucoma and began taking eye drops, but continued to have vision problems. On Zimmermann's recommendation, he visited a different doctor, who determined that glaucoma had been a misdiagnosis, and that Cagney was actually diabetic. Zimmermann then took it upon herself to look after Cagney, preparing his meals to reduce his blood triglycerides, which had reached alarming levels. Such was her success that, by the time Cagney made a rare public appearance at his American Film Institute Life Achievement Award ceremony in 1974, he had lost and his vision had improved. Charlton Heston opened the ceremony, and Frank Sinatra introduced Cagney. So many Hollywood stars attended\u2014said to be more than for any event in history\u2014that one columnist wrote at the time that a bomb in the dining room would have ended the movie industry. In his acceptance speech, Cagney lightly chastised the impressionist Frank Gorshin, saying, \"Oh, Frankie, just in passing, I never said 'MMMMmmmm, you dirty rat!' What I actually did say was 'Judy, Judy, Judy!'\"\u2014a joking reference to a similar misquotation attributed to Cary Grant.\n\"Ragtime\" (1981).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I think he's some kind of genius. His instinct, it's just unbelievable. I could just stay at home. One of the qualities of a brilliant actor is that things look better on the screen than the set. Jimmy has that quality.\"\n\"Director Milo\u0161 Forman \"\nWhile at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After he spent two weeks in the hospital, Zimmermann became his full-time caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they went. After the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Milo\u0161 Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film \"Ragtime\" (1981).\nThis film was shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, and on his arrival at Southampton aboard the \"Queen Elizabeth 2\", Cagney was mobbed by hundreds of fans. Cunard officials, who were responsible for security at the dock, said they had never seen anything like it, although they had experienced past visits by Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.\nDespite the fact that \"Ragtime\" was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was immediately at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe. Howard Rollins, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, \"I was frightened to meet Mr. Cagney. I asked him how to die in front of the camera. He said 'Just die!' It worked. Who would know more about dying than him?\" Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon. As filming progressed, Cagney's sciatica worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue.\nCagney's frequent co-star, Pat O'Brien, appeared with him on the British chat show \"Parkinson\" in the early 1980s and they both made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother's command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance onstage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time she did so during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.\n\"Terrible Joe Moran\" (1984).\nCagney made a rare TV appearance in the lead role of the movie \"Terrible Joe Moran\" in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie \"Winner Take All\" (1932).\nPersonal life.\nIn 1920, Cagney was a member of the chorus for the show \"Pitter Patter\", where he met Frances Willard \"Billie\" Vernon. They married on September 28, 1922, and the marriage lasted until his death in 1986. Frances Cagney died in 1994. In 1940 they adopted a son whom they named James Francis Cagney III, and later a daughter, Cathleen \"Casey\" Cagney. Cagney was a very private man, and while he was willing to give the press opportunities for photographs, he generally spent his personal time out of the public eye.\nCagney's son died from a heart attack on January 27, 1984, in Washington, D.C., two years before his father's death. James III had become estranged from him, and they had not seen or talked to one another since 1982. Cagney's daughter Cathleen was also estranged from her father during the final years of his life. She died on August 11, 2004.\nAs a young man, Cagney became interested in farming \u2013 sparked by a soil conservation lecture he had attended \u2013 to the extent that during his first walkout from Warner Bros., he helped to found a farm in Martha's Vineyard. Cagney loved that no paved roads surrounded the property, only dirt tracks. The house was rather run-down and ramshackle, and Billie was initially reluctant to move in, but soon came to love the place as well. After being inundated by movie fans, Cagney sent out a rumor that he had hired a gunman for security. The ruse proved so successful that when Spencer Tracy came to visit, his taxi driver refused to drive up to the house, saying, \"I hear they shoot!\" Tracy had to go the rest of the way on foot.\nIn 1955, having shot three films, Cagney bought a farm in Stanfordville, Dutchess County, New York, for $100,000, from show-business and Army veteran Lanny Ross. Cagney named it Verney Farm, taking the first syllable from Billie's maiden name and the second from his own surname. He turned it into a working farm, selling some of the dairy cattle and replacing them with beef cattle. He expanded it over the years to . Such was Cagney's enthusiasm for agriculture and farming that his diligence and efforts were rewarded by an honorary degree from Florida's Rollins College. Rather than just \"turning up with Ava Gardner on my arm\" to accept his honorary degree, Cagney turned the tables upon the college's faculty by writing and submitting a paper on soil conservation.\nCagney was born in 1899 (prior to the widespread use of automobiles) and loved horses from childhood. As a child, he often sat on the horses of local deliverymen and rode in horse-drawn streetcars with his mother. As an adult, well after horses were replaced by automobiles as the primary mode of transportation, Cagney raised horses on his farms, specializing in Morgans, a breed of which he was particularly fond.\nCagney was a keen sailor and owned boats that were harbored on both coasts of the U.S., including the \"Swift of Ipswich\". His joy in sailing, however, did not protect him from occasional seasickness\u2014becoming ill, sometimes, on a calm day while weathering rougher, heavier seas at other times. Cagney greatly enjoyed painting, and claimed in his autobiography that he might have been happier, if somewhat poorer, as a painter than a movie star. The renowned painter Sergei Bongart taught Cagney in his later life and owned two of Cagney's works. Cagney often gave away his work but refused to sell his paintings, considering himself an amateur. He signed and sold only one painting, purchased by Johnny Carson to benefit a charity.\nPolitical views.\nIn his autobiography, Cagney wrote that as a young man, he had no political views, as he was typically more concerned with the source of his next meal. However, the emerging labor movement of the 1920s and 1930s soon forced him to take sides. The first version of the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935, and growing tensions between labor and management fueled the movement. Fanzines in the 1930s, however, described his politics as \"radical\".\nThis somewhat exaggerated view was enhanced by Cagney's public contractual wranglings with Warner Bros., his decision to join the Screen Actors Guild in 1933 and his involvement in the revolt against the so-called \"Merriam tax\", a method of funneling studio funds to politicians. During the 1934 Californian gubernatorial campaign, studio executives would \"tax\" their actors, automatically taking a day's pay from their biggest earners, ultimately sending nearly half a million dollars to the gubernatorial campaign of Frank Merriam. Cagney (as well as Jean Harlow) publicly refused to pay and Cagney even threatened that, if the studios took a day's pay for Merriam's campaign, he would donate a week's pay to Upton Sinclair, Merriam's opponent in the race.\nCagney supported political activist and labor leader Thomas Mooney's defense fund but was repelled by the behavior of some of Mooney's supporters at a rally. Around the same time, he gave money for a Spanish Republican Army ambulance during the Spanish Civil War, which he attributed to being \"a soft touch\". This donation enhanced his liberal reputation. He also became involved in a \"liberal group...with a leftist slant\" along with Ronald Reagan. However, when he and Reagan saw the direction in which the group was heading, they resigned on the same night.\nCagney was accused of being a communist sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter that police found from a local communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, supported this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed that the donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr. on the House Un-American Activities Committee.\nCagney became president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term. He took a role in the guild's fight against the Mafia and the Chicago Outfit, which had been using the threat of strike action by a mob-controlled labor union to extort protection money from Hollywood studios. His wife Billie Vernon once received a phone call telling her that Cagney had died in an automobile accident. According to Cagney, having failed to intimidate him or the guild, the Chicago Outfit allegedly sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light onto his head. Upon hearing of the rumor of a hit, George Raft supposedly made a call that canceled the contract.\nDuring World War II, Cagney raised money for war bonds at racing exhibitions at the Roosevelt Raceway and by selling seats for the premiere of \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\". He also permitted the United States Army to conduct practice maneuvers at his Martha's Vineyard estate.\nAfter the war, Cagney's politics began to change. He had worked on Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidential campaigns, including the 1940 presidential election against Wendell Willkie. However, by the time of the 1948 election, Cagney had become disillusioned with Harry S. Truman, and he voted for Thomas E. Dewey, his first non-Democratic vote. He would also support Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election.\nBy 1980, Cagney was contributing financially to the Republican Party, supporting his friend Reagan's bid for the presidency in the 1980 election. Cagney labeled himself as \"arch-conservative\" in his autobiography. He regarded his move away from Marxism as \"a totally natural reaction once I began to see undisciplined elements in our country stimulating a breakdown of our system ... Those functionless creatures, the hippies ... just didn't appear out of a vacuum\".\nDeath.\nCagney died of a heart attack at his Dutchess County farm in Stanford, New York on Easter Sunday 1986 at the age of 86. A funeral mass was held at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan. The eulogy was delivered by his close friend President Ronald Reagan. His pallbearers included boxer Floyd Patterson, dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov (who had hoped to play Cagney on Broadway), actor Ralph Bellamy and director Milo\u0161 Forman. Governor Mario M. Cuomo and mayor Edward I. Koch also attended the service.\nCagney was interred in a crypt in the Garden Mausoleum at Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven in Hawthorne, New York.\nHonors and legacy.\nCagney won the Academy Award in 1943 for his performance as George M. Cohan in \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\".\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Cagney was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 6504 Hollywood Boulevard.\nIn 1974, Cagney received the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award. Charlton Heston, in announcing that Cagney was to be honored, called him \"one of the most significant figures of a generation when American film was dominant, Cagney, that most American of actors, somehow communicated eloquently to audiences all over the world ... and to actors as well.\"\nHe received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1980, and a Career Achievement Award from the U.S. National Board of Review in 1981. In 1984, Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nOn October 21, 1981, Cagney threw out the ceremonial first pitch of the second game of the 1981 World Series.\nIn 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a 33-cent stamp honoring Cagney.\nCagney was among the most favored actors for director Stanley Kubrick and actor Marlon Brando, and was considered by Orson Welles to be \"maybe the greatest actor to ever appear in front of a camera.\" Warner Bros. arranged private screenings of Cagney films for Winston Churchill.\nOn May 19, 2015, a new musical celebrating Cagney, and dramatizing his relationship with Warner Bros., opened off-Broadway in New York City at the York Theatre. \"Cagney, The Musical\" then moved to the Westside Theatre until May 28, 2017.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1970, he founded the Modern Lovers, an influential proto-punk band. Since the mid-1970s, Richman has worked either solo or with low-key acoustic and electric backing. He is known for his wide-eyed, unaffected, and childlike outlook, and music that, while rooted in rock and roll, is influenced by music from around the world.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn into a Jewish family in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Natick, Massachusetts, Richman began playing music and writing his own songs in the mid-1960s. He became infatuated with the Velvet Underground and, in 1969, he moved to New York City, lived on the couch of their manager, Steve Sesnick, worked odd jobs, and tried to break in as a professional musician. Failing at this, he returned to Boston.\nThe Modern Lovers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen I was a teenager, I thought I would be a painter, and then sound overtook me. I made up songs because I had to. I had the need to express how I felt. And that's still how it is. It's just what I do. I do it when there's no audience, I do it when there is an audience. And, when I paint, that's how that is too.\nRichman in a 2020 online thread\nRichman formed the Modern Lovers, a proto-punk garage rock band, in Boston, Massachusetts. Other notable members of the group were keyboard player Jerry Harrison and drummer David Robinson, who later joined Talking Heads and the Cars, respectively.\nIn 1972, they recorded a series of demos with producer John Cale (formerly of the Velvet Underground). Among these songs were the seminal \"Roadrunner\" and \"Pablo Picasso\", which eventually formed the core of the LP \"The Modern Lovers\", released two years after the group had disbanded. The album was strange for its time, featuring Velvets-influenced basic three-chord rock (\"Roadrunner\" \u2013 based on just two chords \u2013 is an homage to \"Sister Ray\") at a time when glam and progressive rock were the norm.\nLater in 1972, the group re-recorded some songs, along with other material, with producer Kim Fowley. These demos were eventually released in 1981 as \"The Original Modern Lovers\" LP. Despite playing live regularly, the Modern Lovers had a difficult time securing a recording contract. By late 1973, Richman wanted to scrap the recorded tracks and start again with a mellower, more lyrical sound, influenced by the laid-back local music he had heard when the band had a residency at the Inverurie Hotel in Bermuda earlier in the year. These stymied efforts to complete a debut album led to the breakup of the original Modern Lovers in February 1974.\nJonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.\nIn 1975, Richman moved to California to record as a solo singer-songwriter with the independent Beserkley Records label. His first released recordings appeared on 1975's \"Beserkley Chartbusters\" compilation, where he was backed by members of Earth Quake and the Rubinoos. The four songs on the compilation also appeared on singles released by Beserkley.\nIn January 1976, Richman put together a new version of the Modern Lovers, which included original Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson, former Rubinoos bassist Greg 'Curly' Keranen and Leroy Radcliffe on guitar. The new group, now billed as Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers, found Richman turning away from the harder, Velvet Underground-influenced electric rock of the original Modern Lovers, toward a gentler sound mixing pop with 1950s rock and roll, and including a bigger emphasis on harmony vocals. During this period Richman recorded a mix of original songs and material by other writers, including Chuck Berry's \"Back in the USA\", the traditional spiritual songs \"Amazing Grace\" and \"Angels Watching Over Me\", and older pop songs like \"Emaline\", \"Buzz, Buzz, Buzz\", and \"Lydia\".\nRichman's own songs continued to mix straightforward love themes with more whimsical themes like Martians (\"Here Come the Martian Martians\"), Leprechauns (\"Rockin' Rockin' Leprechauns\"), the Abominable Snowman (\"Abominable Snowman in the Market\"), and mosquitoes (\"I'm Nature's Mosquito\"). Richman's 1977 recording of the children's music standard \"The Wheels on the Bus\" made explicit his interest in making music for listeners of all ages.\nThe album \"Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers\" was released in May 1976, three months before the older \"The Modern Lovers\" sessions were finally released. Drummer David Robinson left the group soon thereafter, due to frustration with Richman's quest for lower volume levels, and joined with Ric Ocasek in forming the band the Cars.\nAfter several months as a trio, Richman found a new drummer, D. Sharpe, an avant-garde jazz player on the Boston scene, who later went on to become a member of pianist Carla Bley's band.\n\"Rock 'n' Roll with the Modern Lovers\" was released in 1977 and, just as this record began to climb the charts in Europe, Keranen left the group to attend college. A subsequent live album, \"Modern Lovers Live\", was released in 1978, with Asa Brebner on bass.\nIn the United Kingdom, Richman was recognised as a progenitor of the punk rock scene, and several of his singles became hits. \"Roadrunner\" reached number 11 in the UK Singles Chart, and its follow-up, the instrumental \"Egyptian Reggae\", made number 5 in late 1977. \"Egyptian Reggae\" was a version of Jamaican musician Earl Zero's reggae song None Shall Escape the Judgement; Zero was credited as co-writer on Richman's later versions of the track.\n\"Back in Your Life\" was released in 1979 under the \"Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers\" moniker, but only about half the disc featured a backup band. The balance of the album was Richman playing solo. Following this version of The Modern Lovers' final breakup, Richman went on sabbatical for a few years, staying in Appleton, Maine, and playing at local bars in Belfast, Maine.\nBy 1981, Richman was recording and touring once again with various combinations of musicians under the band name Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. The touring band was as large as five backup musicians during parts of 1981, when the group had bassist Curly Keranen once again, along with drummer Michael Guardabascio, keyboard player Ken Forfia, vocalist and guitarist Ellie Marshall, and vocalist Beth Harrington for a gig at New York's Bottom Line. This expanded Modern Lovers group would go on to record much of the music on the \"Jonathan Sings\" (1983), \"Rockin' &amp; Romance\" (1985), and \"It's Time For\" (1986) albums.\nFrom 1981 to 1984, Richman most often played live in a trio with Keranen and Marshall. In 1985, the group was reconfigured, and consisted of bassist Asa Brebner and drummer Andy Paley. From 1986 to 1988, most of Richman's concerts were played with guitarist Brennan Totten and drummer Johnny Avila. Signing with Rounder Records in 1987, Richman recorded his final album using the \"Modern Lovers\" group name (\"Modern Lovers 88\"). After this, the \"Modern Lovers\" moniker was retired.\nSolo.\nFrom 1988 to 1992, Richman performed mostly as a solo act to support his Rounder albums \"Jonathan Richman\" (1989), \"Jonathan Goes Country\" (1990), and \"Having a Party with Jonathan Richman\" (1991). Around the time of his \"I, Jonathan\" album (1992), he formed his performance duo with drummer Tommy Larkins (Giant Sand, Yard Trauma, Naked Prey, et al.), who would continue to play and record with Richman for more than 30 years.\nIn 1993, he contributed the track \"Hot Nights\" to the AIDS-benefit album \"No Alternative\" produced by the Red Hot Organization.\nAlways possessing an ardent cult following, Richman became better known in the 1990s thanks to a series of appearances on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". Another career boost came with the Farrelly Brothers' 1998 film \"There's Something About Mary\", where Richman and Larkins served as a two-man Greek chorus, commenting on the plot while performing their music within the framed action itself. He also appeared briefly in a bar scene in a previous Farrelly Brothers film, \"Kingpin\", and performed the song \"As We Walk to Fenway Park\" for their 2005 comedy, \"Fever Pitch\".\nRichman continued to release albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with the Spanish-language \"\u00a1Jonathan, Te Vas a Emocionar!\" (1994), followed by \"You Must Ask the Heart\" (1995), \"Surrender to Jonathan!\" (1996), \"I'm So Confused\" (1998), \"Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow\" (2001), and \"Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love\" (2004). In 1998, a live album of Modern Lovers recordings from the early 1970s was released, \"Live at the Long Branch &amp; More\". A live filmed performance, \"Take Me to the Plaza\", was released on DVD in 2002. \"Revolution Summer\", a soundtrack album to a film of the same name, was released in 2007. Finally there were two more albums: \"Because Her Beauty Is Raw and Wild\" (2008) and \"O Moon, Queen Of Night On Earth\" (2010).\nRichman's most recent albums are on the Cleveland, Ohio based Blue Arrow Records: 2016's \"Ishkode! Ishkode!\", 2018's \"SA\", 2021's \"Want to Visit My Inner House?\", and 2025's \"Only Frozen Sky Anyway\".\nPersonal life.\nHis first marriage was to Gail Clook of Vermont, in 1982, with whom he has a daughter, Jenny Rae, and stepson, Jason (Gail's son from a previous relationship). This marriage ended in divorce sometime shortly before the release of \"Surrender to Jonathan!\" (1996).\nIn 2003, Richman married Nicole Montalbano of Chico, California. She contributed backing vocals to the album \"Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love\" (2004).\nRichman also runs a business, Arcane Masonry, in Chico, making bread ovens as well as other projects.\nArtistry and instruments.\nRichman's minimalist songwriting style has been described as whimsical and childlike. He himself has stated, \"I don't write, really. I just make up songs.\"\nRichman has played a variety of electric and acoustic guitars throughout his career. In promotional and concert photos from the early 1970s (such as those reproduced in the album \"Precise Modern Lovers Order\"), Richman is frequently seen using a white Fender Stratocaster. He later wrote a song (\"Fender Stratocaster\") expressing his affection for the Stratocaster design.\nIn the late 1970s, working with his group The Modern Lovers, Richman often played a Fender Jazzmaster. He can be seen playing this guitar in the Dutch TV program \"TopPop\" filmed on September 16, 1978. A contemporaneous stage photo used on the cover of the \"Egyptian Reggae\" single shows Richman playing a sunburst Stratocaster.\nLate-1970s studio recordings, such as the \"Rock and Roll with the Modern Lovers\" album, also featured Richman playing nylon-stringed acoustic guitar. On a 1979 performance on French television, and in the cover photo of \"The Best of Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers\", Richman plays a late-1970s Ibanez model 2453CW hollow-body electric guitar, a guitar similar in style to the Epiphone he would use extensively a decade later.\nIn the early- and mid-1980s, working with The Modern Lovers, Richman was frequently photographed playing a Harmony Hollywood hollow-body electric guitar. This guitar is seen on the back cover of Richman's \"It's Time For\" album. By the late 1980s, Richman was frequently performing solo concerts using a blonde 1980s Epiphone Regent hollow-body electric guitar. He can be seen holding this guitar on the back cover of the \"Having a Party with Jonathan Richman\" CD.\nRichman was still using his Epiphone Regent on stage when he began performing as a duo with drummer Tommy Larkins in 1992. After a short stint playing other electric guitars on stage including a Gibson SG, Richman switched to exclusively playing nylon-stringed acoustic guitars (of the classical and flamenco styles) in concert. Richman has played a number of different nylon-stringed guitars since the mid-1990s.\nAfter switching to nylon-stringed acoustic guitars, Richman initially used a pick and played in a style close to that of his electric guitar playing. Eventually, he stopped using both a guitar pick and a guitar strap in concert, preferring to play only with his fingers and to move frequently between playing guitar, dancing, and playing percussion instruments.\nRichman has also been photographed playing a Fender Telecaster and other electric and acoustic guitars, and he does not consider any specific instrument to be essential to his sound. In a 2006 interview with musician Chuck Prophet, Richman said \"It's not the guitar, it's the player. In fact, my most recent Flamenco guitar isn't even a real Flamenco guitar. It's not made out of the right woods. Made out of walnut. It's twangy. I bought it and I like it.\"\nDuring the early- and mid-1980s, Richman frequently played tenor saxophone during his concerts with The Modern Lovers. He can be heard playing the instrument on \"California Desert Party\", a song on his \"Modern Lovers 88\" album. The album also shows him holding the instrument in the cover photograph.\nInfluence.\nRichman's work with the first incarnation of Modern Lovers is a major influence on punk rock. One critic called him the \"Godfather of Punk\". On his second solo album, Brian Eno made mention of Richman's band in his lyrics, and the Sex Pistols and Joan Jett were among the first artists of note to cover the song \"Roadrunner\" in the 1970s. A version of \"Pablo Picasso\" performed by Burning Sensations was included in the 1984 cult film, \"Repo Man\". David Bowie covered \"Pablo Picasso\" on his album \"Reality\". Velvet Underground founding member John Cale has a version of the song on his 1975 album, \"Helen of Troy\", and continues to include the song in his live shows. Iggy Pop has performed \"Pablo Picasso\" live and wrote an extra verse for it. Echo and the Bunnymen covered \"She Cracked\" in concert in 1984 and 1985 and Siouxsie and the Banshees have a version of the song on \"Downside Up\".\nRichman's music has set the tone for many alternative rock bands, such as Violent Femmes, Galaxie 500, They Might Be Giants (\"Roadrunner\" reportedly inspired John Flansburgh to become a musician), Weezer, Tullycraft, Jens Lekman, Pixies leader Black Francis aka Frank Black (who composed the tribute song \"The Man Who Was Too Loud\"), Brandon Flowers, Art Brut, Craig Finn of the Hold Steady &amp; Lifter Puller, Mac DeMarco and Nerf Herder who composed a song about him, titled \"Jonathan\", which appeared on the band's second album \"How To Meet Girls\". British country rock band the Rockingbirds released the single \"Jonathan, Jonathan\" in tribute to Richman in 1992. The Silos also covered the Modern Lovers' \"I'm Straight\". Boston ska-punk band Big D and the Kids Table also covered Richman's song \"New England\" for their \"Gypsy Hill\" EP. A tribute album, \"If I Were a Richman: a Tribute to the Music of Jonathan Richman\", was released by Wampus Multimedia in 2001.\nThe Modern Lovers' song \"Roadrunner\" appears on the soundtrack to the film \"School of Rock\". In the commentary, director Richard Linklater mentions it is often called \"the first punk song\" and wanted to include it for that reason, along with all the other seminal rock songs in that film. Rapper M.I.A. featured the opening lyrics from \"Roadrunner\" in the song \"Bamboo Banga\" on her 2007 album, \"Kala\".\nAs a producer himself, Richman and drummer Tommy Larkins produced Vic Chesnutt's final album \"Skitter on Take-Off\" in 2009 which appeared on Vapor Records. Chesnutt opened for Richman at concerts many times during his later years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born in Rain in 1572. In 1592, aged 20, he began his study of philosophy and law at the University of Ingolstadt, after which he moved to Augsburg to begin work as a lawyer, becoming legal adviser to the city council in 1612.\nBayer had several interests outside his work, including archaeology and mathematics. However, he is primarily known for his work in astronomy; particularly for his work on determining the positions of objects on the celestial sphere. He remained unmarried and died in 1625.\nBayer's star atlas \"Uranometria Omnium Asterismorum\" (\"Uranometry of all the asterisms\") was first published in 1603 in Augsburg and dedicated to two prominent local citizens. This was the first atlas to cover the entire celestial sphere. It was based upon the work of Tycho Brahe and may have borrowed from Alessandro Piccolomini's 1540 star atlas, \"De le stelle fisse\" (\"Of the fixed stars\"), although Bayer included an additional 1,000 stars. The \"Uranometria\" introduced a new system of star designation which has become known as the Bayer designation. Bayer's atlas included twelve new constellations invented a few years earlier to fill in the far south of the night sky, which was unknown to ancient Greece and Rome.\nThe crater Bayer on the Moon is named after him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16069", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16069", "title": "Jonathan Demme", "text": "American filmmaker (1944\u20132017)\nRobert Jonathan Demme ( ; February 22, 1944 \u2013 April 26, 2017) was an American filmmaker, whose career directing, producing, and screenwriting spanned more than 30 years and 70 feature films, documentaries, and television productions. He was an Academy Award and a Directors Guild of America Award winner, and received nominations for a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and three Independent Spirit Awards.\nBeginning his career under B-movie producer Roger Corman, Demme made his directorial debut with the 1974 women-in-prison film \"Caged Heat\", before becoming known for his casually humanist films such as \"Melvin and Howard\" (1980), \"Swing Shift\" (1984), \"Something Wild\" (1986), and \"Married to the Mob\" (1988). His 1991 psychological horror film \"The Silence of the Lambs\", based on the novel of the same title, won five Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture.\nHis subsequent films earned similar acclaim, notably the HIV/AIDS-themed drama \"Philadelphia\" (1993), the supernatural Gothic horror \"Beloved\" (1998), the conspiracy thriller \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (2004), and the independent drama \"Rachel Getting Married\" (2008). Demme also directed numerous concert films such as \"Stop Making Sense\" (1984), \"\" (2006), and \"Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids\" (2016), and worked on several television series as both a producer and director.\nEarly life.\nDemme was born on February 22, 1944, in Baldwin, New York, the son of Dorothy Louise (n\u00e9e Rogers) and Robert Eugene Demme, a public relations executive. He was raised in Rockville Centre, New York and Miami, where he graduated from Southwest Miami High School before attending the University of Florida.\nCareer.\nEarly films.\nDemme broke into feature film working for exploitation film producer Roger Corman early in his career, co-writing and producing \"Angels Hard as They Come\" (1971), a motorcycle movie very loosely based on \"Rashomon\", and \"The Hot Box\" (1972). He then moved on to directing three films for Corman's studio New World Pictures: \"Caged Heat\" (1974), \"Crazy Mama\" (1975), and \"Fighting Mad\" (1976). After \"Fighting Mad\", Demme directed the comedy film \"Handle with Care\" (originally titled \"Citizens Band\", 1977) for Paramount Pictures. The film was well received by critics, but received little promotion, and performed poorly at the box office. He also directed a 1978 episode of \"Columbo\".\nDemme's next film, \"Melvin and Howard\" (1980), did not get a wide release, but received a groundswell of critical acclaim and film award recognition, including Academy Award nominations, winning two of its three nominations (Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Mary Steenburgen, and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay \u2013 Bo Goldman). This acclaim led to the signing of Demme to direct the Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell star vehicle \"Swing Shift\" (1984). Intended as a prestige picture for Warner Bros. as well as a major commercial vehicle for Demme, it instead became a troubled production due to the conflicting visions of Demme and star Hawn. Demme ended up renouncing the finished product, and when the film was released in May 1984, it was generally panned by critics and neglected by moviegoers. After \"Swing Shift\", Demme stepped back from Hollywood to make the Talking Heads concert film \"Stop Making Sense\" (also 1984) which won the National Society of Film Critics Award for best documentary; the eclectic screwball action-romantic comedy \"Something Wild\" (1986); a film-version of the stage production \"Swimming to Cambodia\" (1987), by monologist Spalding Gray; and the New York Mafia-by-way-of Downtown comedy \"Married to the Mob\" (1988).[a]\nDemme formed his production company, Clinica Estetico, with producers Edward Saxon and Peter Saraf in 1987. They were based out of New York City for fifteen years.\nLater films.\nDemme won the Academy Award for \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991)\u2014one of only three films to win all the major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress). Inspired by his friend Juan Su\u00e1rez Botas's illness with AIDS and fueled by his own moral convictions, Demme then used his influence to make \"Philadelphia\" (1993), one of the first major films to address the AIDS crisis and which garnered star Tom Hanks his first Best Actor Oscar. He also co-directed (with his nephew Ted) the music video for Bruce Springsteen's Best Song Oscar-winning \"Streets of Philadelphia\" from the film's soundtrack. Jonathan used several of the same actors for both movies.\nSubsequently, his films included an adaptation of Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\" (1998), and remakes of two films from the 1960s: \"The Truth About Charlie\" (2002), based on \"Charade\", that starred Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role; and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (2004), with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep. Demme's documentary film \"Man from Plains\" (2007), a documentary about former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's promotional tour publicizing his book \"\", had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival.\nHis art-house hit \"Rachel Getting Married\" (2008) was compared by many critics to Demme's films of the late 1970s and 1980s. It was included in many 2008 \"best of\" lists, and received numerous awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress by lead Anne Hathaway. In 2010, Demme made his first foray into theater, directing \"Family Week\", a play by Beth Henley. The play was produced by MCC Theater and co-starred Rosemarie DeWitt and Kathleen Chalfant.\nAt one time, Demme was signed on to direct, produce, and write an adaptation of Stephen King's sci-fi novel \"11/22/63\", but later left the project due to disagreements with King on what should be included in the script.\nHe returned to the concert documentary format with \"Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids\" (2016), which he described as a \"performance film, but also a portrait of an artist at a certain moment in the arc of his career\", and his last project was a history of rock &amp; roll for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame compiled from footage from Hall of Fame induction ceremonies set to debut in summer 2017.\nDemme directed music videos for artists such as Suburban Lawns, New Order, KRS-One's H.E.A.L. project and Bruce Springsteen. He also produced a compilation of Haitian music called \"Konbit: Burning Rhythms of Haiti\" that was released in 1989. (Lou Reed selected \"Konbit...\" as one of his 'picks of 1989').\nDemme was on the board of directors at Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, New York. In addition to his role on the board, he curated and hosted a monthly series called \"Rarely Seen Cinema\".\nStyle.\nThroughout 1986\u20132004, Demme was known for his dramatic close-ups in films. This style of close-ups involves the character looking directly into the camera during crucial moments. According to Demme, this was done to put the viewer into the character's shoes. Beginning with \"Rachel Getting Married\" (2008), Demme adopted a documentary style of filmmaking.\nHe was known for his use of recurring supporting players, including Charles Napier, Harry Northup, Tracey Walter, Ann Dowd, LisaGay Hamilton, Kimberly Elise, Paul Lazar, Ron Vawter, Dean Stockwell, Obba Babatund\u00e9, Ted Levine, Paul Le Mat, Mary Steenburgen, Jason Robards, Scott Glenn, and his former producer Roger Corman, as well as casting musicians and bands in roles. These included Sister Carol, Chris Isaak, Tunde Adebimpe, the Feelies, Charles Aznavour, Steve Scales, the Flirtations, Manno Charlemagne, Bernie Worrell, David Johansen, Beau Sia, Q Lazzarus, and Rick Springfield. In addition to Corman, Demme cast a number of other fellow directors in cameos, including John Sayles, Agn\u00e8s Varda, George A. Romero, Sidney Lumet, and John Waters. Many of these performers received opening credits billing in films they appeared in, despite sometimes having only one or two lines.\nWriter/director Paul Thomas Anderson has paid homage to Demme in his films and has cited him as a major influence in his work. In an interview, Anderson jokingly stated that the three filmmakers who inspired him the most are \"Jonathan Demme, Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Demme.\" Other directors such as Alexander Payne and Wes Anderson have been known to be inspired by his close-ups in their own work.\nPolitical activism.\nDemme was involved in various political projects. In 1981, he directed a series of commercials for the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way. The spots, titled \"Eggs\", \"Music\", and \"Sports\", were produced by Norman Lear and featured Muhammad Ali, Carol Burnett, and Goldie Hawn celebrating Freedom of Expression. In 1985, he directed a video for Artists United Against Apartheid. The short, featured various international musicians including Afrika Bambaataa, Rub\u00e9n Blades, Jimmy Cliff, Herbie Hancock, Little Steven, Run\u2013D.M.C., and Bruce Springsteen, calling for a boycott of the South African luxury resort Sun City during Apartheid. His documentary \"Haiti Dreams of Democracy\" (1988) captured Haiti's era of democratic rebuilding after dictatorship, while his documentary \"The Agronomist\" (2008) profiled Haitian journalist and human rights activist Jean Dominique. Demme spent six years on the documentary \"I'm Carolyn Parker\" (2011), which highlighted rebuilding efforts in New Orleans Lower Ninth Ward after Hurricane Katrina.\nPersonal life.\nDemme was married twice. His first marriage to Evelyn Purcell ended in divorce. In 1987, he married artist Joanne Howard, with whom he had three children. He was the uncle of film director Ted Demme, who died in 2002. Demme's cousin was the Rev. Robert Wilkinson Castle Jr., an Episcopal priest who appeared in some of Demme's films.\nDemme was a member of the steering committee of the Friends of the Apollo Theater, Oberlin, Ohio, along with Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman. In 2013, he returned to Oberlin as part of an alumni reunion during the class of 2013 graduation ceremony and received the award for Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts.\nIn 2009, Demme signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown \"freely and safely\", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door \"for actions of which no-one can know the effects.\"\nDemme was an avid collector and devotee of Haitian art, in particular of Hector Hyppolite - so much so that he called it \"an addiction\". In 2014, he held an auction in Philadelphia selling thousands from his collection, much of which was donated to a cultural center in Port-au-Prince.\nDeath.\nDemme died at his home in Manhattan on April 26, 2017, from complications from esophageal cancer and heart disease; he was 73.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you'd have to design a hurricane to contain him. Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy. Love him so much.\"\u2014\u200a\nDirector Brady Corbet dedicated his 2018 film \"Vox Lux\" to Demme's memory, as did Luca Guadagnino with his 2018 film \"Suspiria\" and Paul Thomas Anderson with his 2017 film \"Phantom Thread\" starring Daniel Day-Lewis. Demme is thanked in the credits of Spike Lee's 2020 concert film \"American Utopia\" starring David Byrne. The album \"A Beginner's Mind\" by musicians Sufjan Stevens and Angelo De Augustine is dedicated to Demme, with one of its songs, \"Cimmerian Shade\", mentioning him and referencing \"The Silence of the Lambs\" within its lyrics.\nAwards and nominations.\nDirected Academy Award Performances\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Closely connected to the innovative artistic genre Cubism, his works are among the movement's most distinctive.\nLife.\nGris was born in Madrid and later studied engineering at the Madrid School of Arts and Sciences. There, from 1902 to 1904, he contributed drawings to local periodicals. From 1904 to 1905, he studied painting with the academic artist Jos\u00e9 Moreno Carbonero. It was in 1905 that Jos\u00e9 Victoriano Gonz\u00e1lez adopted the more distinctive name Juan Gris.\nIn 1909, Lucie Belin (1891\u20131942)\u2014Gris' wife\u2014gave birth to Georges Gonzalez-Gris (1909\u20132003), the artist's only child. The three lived at the Bateau-Lavoir, 13 Rue Ravignan, Paris, from 1909 to 1911. In 1912 Gris met Charlotte Augusta Fernande Herpin (1894\u20131983), also known as Josette. Late 1913 or early 1914 they lived together at the Bateau-Lavoir until 1922. Josette Gris was Juan Gris' second companion and unofficial wife.\nCareer.\nIn 1906, after he sold all his possessions, he moved to Paris and became friends with the poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, and artists Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Fernand L\u00e9ger and Jean Metzinger. He submitted darkly humorous illustrations to journals such as the anarchist satirical magazine \"L'Assiette au Beurre\", and also \"Le Rire\", \"Le Charivari\", and \"Le Cri de Paris\". In Paris, Gris followed the lead of Metzinger and another friend and fellow countryman, Pablo Picasso.\nGris began to paint seriously in 1911 (when he gave up working as a satirical cartoonist), developing at this time a personal Cubist style. In \"A Life of Picasso\", John Richardson writes that Jean Metzinger's 1911 work, \"Le go\u00fbter (Tea Time)\", persuaded Juan Gris of the importance of mathematics in painting. Gris exhibited for the first time at the 1912 Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants (a painting entitled \"Hommage \u00e0 Pablo Picasso\").\n\"He appears with two styles\", writes art historian Peter Brooke, \"In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the \"Go\u00fbter\" and of Metzinger's later work in 1912.\" In the other, Brooke continues, \"the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken. Their presence is suggested by the heavy, often triangular, shading of the angles between them... Both styles are distinguished from the work of Picasso and Braque by their clear, rational and measurable quality.\" Although Gris regarded Picasso as a teacher, Gertrude Stein wrote in \"The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas\" that \"Juan Gris was the only person whom Picasso wished away\".\nIn 1912, Gris exhibited at the \"Exposici\u00f3 d'art cubista\", Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, the first declared group exhibition of Cubism worldwide; the gallery Der Sturm in Berlin; the \"Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de Peinture Moderne\" in Rouen; and the Salon de la Section d'Or in Paris. Gris, in that same year, signed a contract that gave Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler exclusive rights to his work.\nAt first Gris painted in the style of \"Analytical Cubism\", a term he himself later coined, but after 1913 he began his conversion to \"Synthetic Cubism\", of which he became a steadfast interpreter, with extensive use of papier coll\u00e9 or, collage. Unlike Picasso and Braque, whose Cubist works were practically monochromatic, Gris painted with bright harmonious colors in daring, novel combinations in the manner of his friend Matisse. Gris exhibited with the painters of the Puteaux Group in the Salon de \"la Section d'Or\" in 1912. His preference for clarity and order influenced the Purist style of Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), and made Gris an important exemplar of the post-war \"return to order\" movement. In 1915 he was painted by his friend, Amedeo Modigliani. In November 1917 he made one of his few sculptures, the polychrome plaster \"Harlequin\".\nCrystal Cubism.\nGris's works from late 1916 through 1917 exhibit a greater simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in \"Woman with Mandolin, after Corot\" (September 1916) and in its epilogue, \"Portrait of Josette Gris\" (October 1916; Museo Reina Sofia).\nThe clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly controls the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point.\nThe geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in \"Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan\" (June 1915; Philadelphia Museum of Art). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come.\nIn 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and to assert its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.\nDesigner and theorist.\nIn 1924, he designed ballet sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev and the famous Ballets Russes.\nGris articulated most of his aesthetic theories during 1924 and 1925. He delivered his definitive lecture, \"Des possibilit\u00e9s de la peinture\", at the Sorbonne in 1924. Major Gris exhibitions took place at the Galerie Simon in Paris and the Galerie Flechtheim in Berlin in 1923 and at the Galerie Flechtheim in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1925.\nDeath.\nAfter October 1925, Gris was frequently ill with bouts of uremia and cardiac problems. He died of kidney failure in Boulogne-sur-Seine (Paris) on 11 May 1927, at the age of 40, leaving a wife, Josette, and a son, Georges.\nArt market.\nThe top auction price for a Gris work is $57.1\u00a0million (\u00a334.8\u00a0million), achieved for his 1915 painting \"Nature morte \u00e0 la nappe \u00e0 carreaux (Still Life with Checked Tablecloth)\". This surpassed previous records of $20.8\u00a0million for his 1915 still life \"Livre, pipe et verres\", $28.6\u00a0million for the 1913 artwork \"Violon et guitare\" and $31.8 million for \"The musician's table\", now in the Met.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16074", "revid": "50565921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16074", "title": "James Whale", "text": "English film director (1889-1957)\nJames Whale (22 July 1889\u00a0\u2013 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theatre director and actor, who spent the greater part of his career in Hollywood. He is best remembered for several horror films: \"Frankenstein\" (1931), \"The Old Dark House\" (1932), \"The Invisible Man\" (1933) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical \"Show Boat\".\nWhale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire (now the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley). He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I, he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realised he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play \"Journey's End\" led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime romantic partner, producer David Lewis. Apart from \"Journey's End\" (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterised by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.\nAt the height of his career as a director, Whale directed \"The Road Back\" (1937), a sequel to \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision, and it was a critical failure. A run of box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He took his own life on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.\nWhale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very rare in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more widespread, some of his films, \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career. Other commentators have contended that his retirement was provoked by a succession of poorly received projects with which Whale was growing personally dissatisfied (particularly deleterious to his career was \"The Road Back\", which went through development hell at multiple stages, whereafter the buck was perceived to stop with Whale as principal director).\nEarly years.\nWhale was born in Dudley, Worcestershire, at the heart of the Black Country, the sixth of seven children of William, a blast furnaceman, and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years, because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family. Thought not physically strong enough to follow his brothers into the local heavy industries, Whale started work as a cobbler, reclaiming the nails he recovered from replaced soles and selling them for scrap for extra money. He discovered he had some artistic ability and earned additional money lettering signs and price tags for his neighbors. He used his additional income to pay for evening classes at the Dudley School of Arts and Crafts.\nWorld War I broke out in early August 1914. Although Whale had little interest in the politics behind the war, he realized that conscription was inevitable, so he voluntarily enlisted just before it was introduced, into the British Army's Inns of Court Officer Training Corps in October 1915, and was stationed initially at Bristol. He was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Worcestershire Regiment in July 1916. He was taken prisoner of war in battle on the Western Front in Flanders in August 1917, and was held at Holzminden Officers' Camp, where he remained until the war's end, being repatriated to England in December 1918. While imprisoned he became actively involved, as an actor, writer, producer and set-designer, in the amateur theatrical productions that took place in the camp, finding them \"a source of great pleasure and amusement\". He also developed a talent for poker, and after the war he cashed in the chits and IOUs from his fellow prisoners that he had amassed in gambling to provide himself with finances for re-entry into civilian life.\nCareer.\nTheatre.\nAfter the armistice, he returned to Birmingham and tried to find work as a cartoonist. He sold two cartoons to the \"Bystander\" in 1919 but was unable to secure a permanent position. Later that year he embarked on a professional stage career. Under the tutelage of actor-manager Nigel Playfair, he worked as an actor, set designer and builder, \"stage director\" (akin to a stage manager) and director. In 1922, while with Playfair, he met Doris Zinkeisen. They were considered a couple for some two years, despite Whale's living as an openly gay man. They were reportedly engaged in 1924, but by 1925 the engagement was off.\nIn 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R. C. Sherriff's then-unknown play \"Journey's End\" for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, \"Journey's End\" gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fianc\u00e9e. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of \"Beau Geste\". The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play \"managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like\". After three weeks at the Savoy, \"Journey's End\" transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years.\nWith the success of \"Journey's End\" at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller's Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I.\nEarly work in Hollywood.\nThe success of the various productions of \"Journey's End\" brought Whale to the attention of movie producers. Coming at a time when motion pictures were making the transition from silent to talking, producers were interested in hiring actors and directors with experience with dialogue. Whale traveled to Hollywood in 1929 and signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He was assigned as \"dialogue director\" for a film called \"The Love Doctor\" (1929). He completed work on the film in 15 days and his contract was allowed to expire. It was at around this time that he met David Lewis.\nWhale was hired by independent film producer and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, who planned to turn the previously silent Hughes production \"Hell's Angels\" (1930) into a talkie. Whale directed the dialogue sequences. When his work for Hughes was completed, he headed to Chicago to direct another production of \"Journey's End\".\nHaving purchased the film rights to \"Journey's End\", British producers Michael Balcon and Thomas Welsh agreed that Whale's experience directing the London and Broadway productions of the play made him the best choice to direct the film. The two partnered with a small American studio, Tiffany-Stahl, to shoot it in New York. Colin Clive reprised his role as Stanhope, and David Manners was cast as Raleigh. Filming got underway on 6 December 1929 and wrapped on 22 January 1930. \"Journey's End\" was released in Great Britain on 14 April and in the United States on 15 April. On both sides of the Atlantic the film was a tremendous critical and commercial success.\nWith the Laemmles at Universal.\nUniversal Studios signed Whale to a five-year contract in 1931 and his first project was \"Waterloo Bridge\". Based on the Broadway play by Robert E. Sherwood, the film stars Mae Clarke as Myra, a chorus girl in World War I London who becomes a prostitute. It too was a critical and popular success. At around this time, Whale and Lewis began living together.\nIn 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale his choice of any property the studio owned. He chose \"Frankenstein\", mostly because none of Universal's other properties particularly interested him, and he wanted to make something other than a war picture. While Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\" itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to the little known Boris Karloff, who had wide-ranging experience in supporting roles. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. \"Frankenstein\" was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12\u00a0million on first release.\nNext from Whale were \"The Impatient Maiden\" and \"The Old Dark House\" (both 1932). \"The Impatient Maiden\" made little impression but \"The Old Dark House\", starring Karloff and Charles Laughton, is credited with reinventing the \"dark house\" subgenre of horror films. Thought lost for some years, a print was found by filmmaker Curtis Harrington in the Universal vaults in 1968. It was restored by George Eastman House, and released on Blu-ray disk in 2017.\nWhale's next film was \"The Kiss Before the Mirror\" (1933), a critical success but a box-office failure. He returned to horror with \"The Invisible Man\" (1933). Shot from a script approved by H. G. Wells, the film blended horror with humor and confounding visual effects. Much admired, \"The New York Times\" placed it in their list of the ten best films of the year, and the film broke box-office records in cities across America. So highly regarded was the film that France, which restricted the number of theatres in which undubbed American films could play, granted it a special waiver because of its \"extraordinary artistic merit\".\nAlso in 1933 Whale directed the romantic comedy \"By Candlelight\" which gained good reviews and was a modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed \"One More River\", an adaptation of the novel of the same name by John Galsworthy. The film tells the story of a woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.\n\"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935) was Whale's next project. He had resisted making a sequel to \"Frankenstein\" as he feared being pigeonholed as a horror director. \"Bride\" hearkened back to an episode from Mary Shelley's original novel in which the Monster promises to leave Frankenstein and humanity alone if Frankenstein makes him a mate. In the film he does, but the mate is repelled by the monster who then, setting Frankenstein and his wife free to live, chooses to destroy himself and his \"bride\". The film was a critical and box office success, having earned some $2\u00a0million for Universal by 1943. Lauded as \"the greatest of Universal's gothic horror\", \"Bride\" is frequently hailed as Whale's masterpiece.\nWith the success of \"Bride\", Laemmle was eager to put Whale to work on \"Dracula's Daughter\" (1936), the sequel to Universal's first big horror hit of the sound era. Whale, wary of doing two horror films in a row and concerned that directing \"Dracula's Daughter\" could interfere with his plans for the first all-sound version of \"Show Boat\" (previously filmed as a part-talkie by Harry A. Pollard), instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a novel called \"The Hangover Murders\". The novel is a comedy-mystery in the style of \"The Thin Man\", about a group of friends who were so drunk the night one of them was murdered that none can remember anything. Retitled \"Remember Last Night?\", the film was one of Whale's personal favorites, but met with sharply divided reviews and commercial uninterest.\nWith the completion of \"Remember Last Night?\" Whale immediately went to work on \"Show Boat\" (1936). Whale gathered as many of those as he could who had been involved in one production or another of the musical, including Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, Charles Winninger, Sammy White, conductor Victor Baravalle, orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett, and, as Magnolia, Irene Dunne, who believed that Whale was the wrong director for the piece. The 1936 version of \"Show Boat\", faithfully adapted from the original stage production, is believed to be the definitive film version of the musical by many critics, but became unavailable following the 1951 remake. In 2014, a restoration of the film became available on DVD in the U.S. as part of Warner Home Video's Archive Collection line; and in 2020, a 4K restoration Blu-Ray was released by The Criterion Collection.\n\"Show Boat\" was the last of Whale's films to be produced under the Laemmle family. The studio was now bankrupt, and the Laemmles lost control to J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and Charles R. Rogers, who was installed in Junior Laemmle's old job.\nCareer decline.\nWhale's career went into sharp decline following the release of his next film, \"The Road Back\" (1937). The sequel to Erich Maria Remarque's \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", which Universal had filmed in 1930, the novel and film follow the lives of several young German men who have returned from the trenches of World War I and their struggles to re-integrate into society. The Los Angeles consul for Nazi Germany, Georg Gyssling, learned that the film was in production. He protested to PCA enforcer Joseph Breen, arguing that the film gave an \"untrue and distorted picture of the German people\". Gyssling eventually met Whale, but nothing came of it. Gyssling then sent letters to members of the cast, threatening that their participation in the film might lead to difficulties in obtaining German filming permits for them and for anyone associated in a film with them. While the low volume of business conducted by Universal in Germany made such threats largely hollow, the State Department, under pressure from the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and the Screen Actors Guild, stepped in and the German government backed down. Whale's original cut of the film was given generally positive reviews, but some time between preview screenings and the film's general release, Rogers capitulated to the Germans, ordering that cuts be made and additional scenes be shot and inserted. Whale was furious, and the altered film was banned in Germany anyway. The Germans were successful in persuading China, Greece, Italy and Switzerland to ban the film as well.\nFollowing the debacle of \"The Road Back\", Charles Rogers tried to get out of his contract with Whale; Whale refused. Rogers then assigned him to a string of B movies to run out his contractual obligation. Whale only made one additional successful feature film, \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" (1939), before retiring from the film industry in 1942.\nPost-film life.\nWith his film career behind him, Whale found himself at a loose end. He was offered the occasional job, including the opportunity to direct \"Since You Went Away\" for David O. Selznick, but turned them down. Lewis, meanwhile, was busier than ever with his production duties and often worked late hours, leaving Whale lonely and bored. Lewis bought him a supply of paint and canvasses and Whale re-discovered his love of painting. Eventually he built a large studio for himself.\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Whale volunteered his services to make a training film for the United States Army. He shot the film, called \"Personnel Placement in the Army\", in February 1942. Later that year, in association with actress Claire DuBrey, he created the Brentwood Service Players.&lt;ref name=\"cdnc/DNLA19430329.1.14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Players took over a 100\u2013seat theatre. Sixty seats were provided free of charge to service personnel; the remaining were sold to the public, with the box office proceeds donated to wartime charities. The group expanded to the Playtime Theatre during the summer, where a series of shows ran through October.\nWhale returned to Broadway in 1944 to direct the psychological thriller \"Hand in Glove\". It was his first return to Broadway since his failed \"One, Two, Three!\" in 1930. \"Hand in Glove\" would fare no better than his earlier play, running the same number of performances, 40.\nWhale directed his final film in 1950, a short subject based on the William Saroyan one-act play \"Hello Out There\". The film, financed by supermarket heir Huntington Hartford, was the story of a man in a Texas jail falsely accused of rape and the woman who cleans the jail. Hartford intended for the short to be part of an anthology film along the lines of \"Quartet\". However, attempts to find appropriate short fiction companion pieces to adapt were unsuccessful and \"Hello Out There\" was never commercially released.\nWhale's last professional engagement was directing \"Pagan in the Parlour\", a farce about two New England spinster sisters who are visited by a Polynesian whom their father, when shipwrecked years earlier, had married. The production was mounted in Pasadena for two weeks in 1951. Plans were made to take it to New York, but Whale suggested taking the play to London first. Before opening the play in England, Whale decided to tour the art museums of Europe. In France he renewed his acquaintanceship with Curtis Harrington, whom he had met in 1947. While visiting Harrington in Paris, he went to some gay bars. At one he met a 25-year-old bartender named Pierre Foegel, whom Harrington believed was nothing but \"a hustler out for what he could get\". The 62-year-old Whale was smitten with the younger man and hired him as his chauffeur.\nA provincial tour of \"Pagan in the Parlour\" began in September 1952 and it appeared that the play would be a hit. However, Hermione Baddeley, starring in the play as the cannibal \"Noo-ga\", was drinking heavily and began engaging in bizarre antics and disrupting performances. Because she had a run of the play contract she could not be replaced and so producers were forced to close the show.\nWhale returned to California in November 1952 and advised David Lewis that he planned to bring Foegel over early the following year. Appalled, Lewis moved out of their home. While this ended their 23-year romantic relationship, the two men remained friends. Lewis bought a small house and dug a swimming pool, prompting Whale to have his own pool dug, although he did not himself swim in it. He began throwing all-male swim parties and would watch the young men cavort in and around the pool. Foegel moved in with Whale in early 1953 and remained there for several months before returning to France. He returned to California in 1954 permanently, and Whale installed him as manager of a gas station that he owned.\nWhale and Foegel settled into a quiet routine until the spring of 1956, when Whale suffered a small stroke. A few months later he suffered a larger stroke and was hospitalized. While in the hospital he was treated for depression with shock treatments.\nUpon his release, Whale hired one of the male nurses from the hospital to be his personal live-in nurse. A jealous Foegel maneuvered the nurse out of the house and hired a female nurse as a non-live-in replacement. Whale suffered from mood swings and grew increasingly and frustratingly more dependent on others as his mental faculties were diminishing.\nDeath.\nWhale died by suicide by drowning himself in his Pacific Palisades swimming pool on 29 May 1957 at the age of 67. He left a suicide note, which Lewis withheld until shortly before his own death decades later. Because the note was suppressed, the death was initially ruled accidental. The note read in part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To ALL I LOVE,\nDo not grieve for me. My nerves are all shot and for the last year I have been in agony day and night\u2014except when I sleep with sleeping pills\u2014and any peace I have by day is when I am drugged by pills.\nI have had a wonderful life but it is over and my nerves get worse and I am afraid they will have to take me away. So please forgive me, all those I love and may God forgive me too, but I cannot bear the agony and it [is] best for everyone this way. The future is just old age and illness and pain. Goodbye and thank you for all your love. I must have peace and this is the only way.\u2014\u200a\nWhale's body was cremated per his request, and his ashes were interred in the Columbarium of Memory at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale. Because of his habit of periodically revising his date of birth, his niche lists the incorrect date of 1893. When his longtime partner David Lewis died in 1987, his executor and Whale biographer James Curtis had his ashes interred in a niche across from Whale's.\nSexual orientation.\nJames Whale lived as an openly gay man throughout his career in the British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in that era. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go out of his way to publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, \"Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay.\" While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed \"The Queen of Hollywood\", Harrington states that \"nobody made a thing out of it as far as I could perceive\".\nWith knowledge of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in which a number of the creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).\nGay film historian Vito Russo, in considering Pretorius, stops short of identifying the character as gay, instead referring to him as \"sissified\" (\"sissy\" itself being a Hollywood gay stock character). Pretorius serves as a \"gay Mephistopheles\", a figure of seduction and temptation, going so far as to pull Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of non-procreative life. A novelisation of the film published in England made the implication clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein \"'Be fruitful and multiply.' Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way.\" Russo goes so far as to suggest that Whale's homosexuality is expressed in both \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride\" as \"a vision both films had of the monster as an antisocial figure in the same way that gay people were 'things' that should not have happened\".\nWhale's partner David Lewis stated flatly that Whale's sexual orientation was \"not germane\" to his filmmaking. \"Jimmy was first and foremost an artist, and his films represent the work of an artist\u2014not a gay artist, but an artist.\" Whale's biographer Curtis rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, stating that if the highly class-conscious Whale felt himself to be an antisocial figure, it would have been based not in his sexuality but in his origin in the lower classes.\nFilm style.\nWhale was heavily influenced by German Expressionism. He was a particular admirer of the films of Paul Leni, combining as they did elements of gothic horror and comedy. This influence was most evident in \"Bride of Frankenstein\". Expressionist influence is also in evidence in \"Frankenstein\", drawn in part from the work of Paul Wegener and his films \"The Golem\" (1915) and \"\" (1920) along with \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920) from Robert Wiene, which Whale reportedly screened repeatedly while preparing to shoot \"Frankenstein\". \"Frankenstein\" roughly alternates between distorted expressionistic shots and more conventional styles, with the character of Dr. Waldman serving as \"a bridge between everyday and expressionist spaces\". Expressionist influence is also evident in the acting, costuming and the design of the Monster. Whale and makeup artist Jack Pierce may also have been influenced by the Bauhaus school of design. The expressionist influence lasted throughout Whale's career, with Whale's final film, \"Hello Out There\", praised by \"Sight &amp; Sound\" as \"a virtuoso pattern of light and shade, a piece of fully blown expressionist filmmaking plonked down unceremoniously in the midst of neo-realism's heyday\".\nWhale was known for his use of camera movement. He is credited with being the first director to use a 360-degree panning shot in a feature film, included in \"Frankenstein\". Whale used a similar technique during the \"Ol' Man River\" sequence in \"Show Boat\", in which the camera tracked around Paul Robeson as he sang the song. (The sequence also uses expressionist montages illustrating some of the lyrics.) Often singled out for praise in \"Frankenstein\" is the series of shots used to introduce the Monster: \"Nothing can ever quite efface the thrill of watching the successive views Whale's mobile camera allows us of the lumbering figure\". These shots, starting with a medium shot and culminating in two close-ups of the Monster's face, were repeated by Whale to introduce Griffin in \"The Invisible Man\" and the abusive husband in \"One More River\". Modified to a single cut rather than two, Whale uses the same technique in \"The Road Back\" to signal the instability of a returning World War I veteran.\nLegacy.\nInfluential film critic Andrew Sarris, in his 1968 ranking of directors, lists Whale as \"lightly likable\". Noting that Whale's reputation has been subsumed by the \"Karloff cult\", Sarris cites \"Bride of Frankenstein\" as the \"true gem\" of the \"Frankenstein\" series and concludes that Whale's career \"reflects the stylistic ambitions and dramatic disappointments of an expressionist in the studio-controlled Hollywood of the thirties\".\nAmerican post-punk band Tuxedomoon recorded a song \"James Whale\" on their debut studio album \"Half-Mute\", released on March 15, 1980.\nWhale's final months are the subject of the novel \"Father of Frankenstein\" (1995) by Christopher Bram. The novel focuses on the relationship between Whale and a fictional gardener named Clayton Boone. \"Father of Frankenstein\" served as the basis of the 1998 film \"Gods and Monsters\" with Ian McKellen as Whale and Brendan Fraser as Boone. McKellen was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Whale. Bram's novel has also been adapted as a play which premiered in London at the Southwark Playhouse in February 2015.\nOnly two of Whale's films received Oscar nominations: \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" (for its musical score), and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (for its sound recording).\nA memorial sculpture was erected for Whale in September 2001 on the grounds of a new multiplex cinema in his home town of Dudley. The sculpture, by Charles Hadcock, depicts a roll of film with the face of Frankenstein's monster engraved into the frames, and the names of his most famous films etched into a cast concrete base in the shape of film canisters. Other sculptures related to Whale's cinema career were planned, referencing his early work in a local sheet metal factory, but none had been installed as of 2019.\n\"Horror in Hollywood: The James Whale Story\", a retrospective of Whale's artwork, opened at the Dudley Museum and Art Gallery in October 2012 and ran through to January 2013.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16077", "revid": "3008356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16077", "title": "John Hagelin", "text": "American transcendental meditator (born 1954)\nJohn Samuel Hagelin (; born June 9, 1954) is a physicist and the leader of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement in the United States. He was president of Maharishi International University (MIU), formerly Maharishi University of Management (MUM), in Fairfield, Iowa, and honorary chair of its board of trustees..\nIn 1981, Hagelin graduated with a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University and then did several months of post-doctoral research at CERN. He went on to do post-doctoral work at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC). In 1984, he became a professor of physics at MIU, and later became the university's president. Hagelin postulates that his extended version of unified field theory is identified with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's \"unified field of consciousness\", but this view was rejected by \"virtually every theoretical physicist in the world\" in 2006. Hagelin has published over 70 papers about particle physics, electroweak unification, grand unification, supersymmetry, and cosmology, most of them in academic scientific journals , and co-authored a 1983 paper in \"Physics Letters B\", that became one of the 103 most-cited articles in the physical sciences in 1983 and 1984.. A 1984 paper by Hagelin and John Ellis in \"Nuclear Physics B\", \"Supersymmetric relics from the big bang\", had been cited over 500 times by 2007.\nHagelin stood as a candidate for President of the United States for the Natural Law Party, a party founded by the TM movement, in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 elections. He is the author of \"Manual for a Perfect Government\" (1998), which sets out how to apply \"natural law\" to matters of governance. Hagelin is also the president of the David Lynch Foundation, that promotes TM as a remedy for \"trauma and toxic stress among at-risk populations.\".\nEarly life and education.\nHagelin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the second of four sons, to Mary Lee Hagelin (n\u00e9e\u00a0Stephenson), a schoolteacher, and Carl William Hagelin, a businessman. He was raised in Connecticut and won a scholarship to the Taft School for boys in Watertown. In July 1970, while at Taft, he was involved in a motorcycle crash that led to a long stay\u2014in a body cast\u2014in the school infirmary. During his time there, he began reading about quantum mechanics but was also introduced to TM by a practitioner, Rick Archer, who had been invited to the school to talk about the meditation form.\nAfter Taft, Hagelin attended Dartmouth College. At the end of his freshman year, he studied TM in Vittel, France, and returned as a qualified TM teacher. In 1975, he obtained his A.B. in physics with highest honors (\"summa cum laude\") from Dartmouth. He went on to study physics at Harvard University under Howard Georgi, earning a master's degree in 1976 and a Ph.D. in 1981. By the time he had received his Ph.D., he had published several papers on particle theory.\nCareer.\nAcademic positions.\nIn 1981, Hagelin became a postdoctoral researcher at the European Center for Particle Physics (CERN) in Switzerland, and in 1982, he moved to SLAC in California. He left SLAC in 1983. A year later, he joined Maharishi International University (MIU) as chair of the physics department. Two of Hagelin's previous collaborators, Dimitri Nanopoulos and John Ellis, were uncomfortable with his move to MIU, but they continued to work with him. While at MIU, Hagelin received funding from the National Science Foundation.\nHagelin became a trustee of MUM and, in 2016, its president. It was intended that he become president of Maharishi Central University, which was under construction in Smith Center, Kansas, until early 2008, when, according to Hagelin, the project was put on hold while the TM organization dealt with the death of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\nKilby International Award.\nIn 1992, Hagelin received a Kilby International Award from the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce \"for his promising work in particle physics in the development of supersymmetric grand unified field theory\". According to a member of the selection committee, Hagelin's nomination was proposed by another selection-committee member who was a fellow TM practitioner. Chris Anderson, in a 1992 \"Nature\" article about Hagelin's first presidential campaign, questioned the value of the award.\nTheoretical physics.\nDuring his time at CERN, SLAC and MUM, Hagelin worked on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model and grand unification theories. His work on the flipped SU(5) heterotic superstring theory is considered one of the more successful unified field theories, or \"theories of everything\", and was highlighted in 1991 in a cover story in \"Discover\" magazine.\nFrom 1979 to 1996, Hagelin published over 70 papers about particle physics, electroweak unification, grand unification, supersymmetry and cosmology, most of them in academic scientific journals. He co-authored a 1983 paper in \"Physics Letters B\", \"Weak symmetry breaking by radiative corrections in broken supergravity\", that became one of the 103 most-cited articles in the physical sciences in 1983 and 1984. In a 2012 interview in \"Science Watch\", co-author Keith Olive said that his work for the 1984 study was one of the areas that had given him the greatest sense of accomplishment. A 1984 paper by Hagelin and John Ellis in \"Nuclear Physics B\", \"Supersymmetric relics from the big bang\", had been cited over 500 times by 2007.\nMaharishi effect.\nIn the summer of 1993, Hagelin directed a project aimed at demonstrating what TM practitioners call the Maharishi effect, the purported ability of a large group to affect the behavior of others by practising TM. The TM movement believes that one tenth of the square root of the population of a country meditating can bring about peace. However, critics point to a lack of credible supporting evidence.\nApproximately 4,000 people from 82 countries gathered in Washington, DC, and practiced TM for six hours a day from June 7 to July 30. The meditation included \"yogic flying\", a technique taught through the TM-Sidhi program in which practitioners engage in a series of hops while seated in the lotus position. Hagelin claimed that there was a local reduction in crime due to this activity. \nAccording to Hagelin, the analysis was examined by an \"independent review board\", although all members of the board were TM practitioners. Robert L. Park, research professor and former chair of the physics department at the University of Maryland, called the study a \"clinic in data distortion\". In 1994, a science satire magazine, \"Annals of Improbable Research\", \"awarded\" Hagelin the Ig Nobel Prize for Peace, \"for his experimental conclusion that 4,000 trained meditators caused an 18 percent decrease in violent crime in Washington, D.C.\"\nIn 1999, Hagelin held a press conference in Washington, D.C. to announce that the TM movement could end the Kosovo War with yogic flying. He suggested that NATO set up an elite corps of 7,000 yogic flyers at a cost of $33 million.\nEnlightened Audio Designs Corporation.\nIn 1990, Hagelin founded Enlightened Audio Designs Corporation (EAD) with Alastair Roxburgh. The company designed and manufactured high-end digital-to-analog converters. EAD was sold in 2001 to Alpha Digital Technologies in Oregon.\nPolitics.\nNatural Law Party.\nHagelin and 12 others founded the Natural Law Party in April 1992 in Fairfeld, based on the view that problems of governance could be solved more effectively by following \"natural law\", the organizing principle of the universe. The party platform included preventive health care, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies. Hagelin favored abortion rights without public financing, campaign-finance law reform, more restrictive gun control, and a flat tax, with no tax for families earning less than $34,000 per year. He campaigned to eradicate PACs and soft money campaign contributions and advocated safety locks on guns, school vouchers, and efforts to prevent war in the Middle East by reducing \"people's tension\".\nThe party chose Hagelin and Mike Tompkins as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates in 1992 and 1996. Hagelin received 39,212 votes from 32 states in 1992 (and 23 percent of the vote in Jefferson County, where MIU is located), and 113,659 votes from 43 states in 1996 (21 percent in Jefferson County).\nHagelin ran for president again in 2000, nominated both by the NLP and by the Perot wing of the Reform Party, which disputed the nomination of Pat Buchanan. Hagelin's running mate was Nat Goldhaber. A dispute over the Reform Party's nomination generated legal action between the Hagelin and Buchanan campaigns. In September 2000, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Buchanan was the official candidate of the Reform Party and hence eligible to receive federal election funds. The Reform Party convention that nominated Hagelin was declared invalid. In spite of the ruling, Hagelin remained on several state ballots as the Reform Party nominee because of the independent nature of some state affiliates; he was also the national nominee of the Natural Law Party, and in New York was the Independence Party nominee. He received 83,714 votes from 39 states. During the 2004 primary elections, Hagelin endorsed Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich, and in April that year the Executive Committee of the NLP dissolved the NLP as a national organization.\nInstitute of Science, Technology and Public Policy.\nHagelin is the director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy (ISTPP), an MIU think tank. According to the ISTPP's website, he has met with members of Congress and officials at the Department of State and Department of Defense to discuss terrorism. In 1993, he helped draft a paragraph in Hillary Rodham Clinton's 10,000-page health care plan; according to Hagelin, his was the only paragraph that addressed preventive health care. In 1998, the ISTPP testified about germ-line technologies to the DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health; Hagelin's report to the committee said that \"recombinant DNA technology is inherently risky because of the high probability of unexpected side-effects\".\nOther organizations.\nHagelin established the US Peace Government (USPG) in July 2003 as an affiliate of the Global Country of World Peace and served as the latter's minister of science and technology. According to USPG's website, the TM movement created US Peace Government and the Global Country of World Peace to promote evidence-based, sustainable problem-solving and governance policies that align with \"natural law\".\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi appointed Hagelin the \"Raja of Invincible America\" in November 2007. Hagelin organized the Invincible America Assembly in Fairfield in July 2006. The assembly comprised individuals practicing TM and TM-Sidhi techniques twice daily. Hagelin predicted that as the number of Yogic flyers increased towards 3500, \"[p]eace and prosperity will reign [in America], and violence and conflict will subside completely\". In July 2007, he said that the assembly was responsible for the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a record high of 14,022 and predicted that it would top 17,000 within a year.\nHagelin is also president of the Global Union of Scientists for Peace, an organization of scientists opposed to nuclear proliferation and war, and president of the David Lynch Foundation, which promotes TM.\nCriticism.\nHagelin and the credibility of his work have received criticism throughout the years. Hagelin's former academic peers \"ostracized him\" for combining science with a \"form of Hinduism that doesn't acknowledge its roots\". Neuroscientist and meditation researcher David Vago states that all of Hagelin's Maharishi Effect studies are \"correlation without causation\" and Dennis Roark, former chairman of the physics department at MIU, derided Hagelin's research as \"crackpot science\". In 1994, Hagelin was award the satirical Ig Nobel Prize for his experiment of yogic flyers and crime rate as the \"silliest scientific studies of the year\".\nEfforts to link consciousness to the unified field.\nIn a 1992 news article for \"Nature\" about Hagelin's first presidential campaign, Chris Anderson wrote that Hagelin was \"by all accounts a gifted scientist, well-known and respected by his colleagues\", but that his effort to link the flipped SU(5) unified field theory to TM \"infuriates his former collaborators\", who feared it might taint their own work and requests for funding. John Ellis, then director of CERN's department of theoretical physics\u2014who worked with Hagelin on SU(5)\u2014reportedly asked Hagelin to stop comparing it to TM. Anderson wrote that two-page advertisements containing rows of partial differential equations had been appearing in the U.S. media, purporting to show how TM affected distant events. In his book, \"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and The Search for Unity In Physical Law\" (2007), the physicist Peter Woit wrote that identification of a unified field of consciousness with a unified field of superstring theory was wishful thinking, and that \"[v]irtually every theoretical physicist in the world rejects all of this as nonsense and the work of a crackpot\".\nPhilosopher Evan Fales and sociologist Barry Markovsky remarked that, because no such phenomena have been validated, Hagelin's \"far-fetched explanation lacks purpose\". They went on to say that the parallels Hagelin highlighted rest on ambiguity, obscurity and vague analogy, supported by the construction of arbitrary similarities.\nHagelin was featured in the movies \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" (2004) and \"The Secret\" (2006). Jo\u00e3o Magueijo, professor of theoretical physics at Imperial College London, described \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" as \"horrendously tedious\", consisting of deliberate misrepresention of science and \"ludicrous extrapolations\".\nPersonal life.\nHagelin's first marriage, to Margaret Hagelin, ended in divorce. He married Kara Anastasio, the former vice-chair of the Natural Law Party of Ohio, in 2010.\nSelected works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The javelin thrower gains momentum by running within a predetermined area. Javelin throwing is an event of both the men's decathlon and the women's heptathlon.\nHistory.\nThe javelin throw was added to the Ancient Olympic Games as part of the pentathlon in 708\u00a0BC. It included two events, one for distance and the other for accuracy in hitting a target. The javelin was thrown with the aid of a thong (\"ankyle\" in Greek) that was wound around the middle of the shaft. Athletes held the javelin by the \"ankyle\", a leather strap around the shaft, so when they released the javelin, the unwinding of the thong gave the javelin a spiral trajectory.\nThrowing javelin-like poles into targets was revived in Germany and Sweden in the early 1870s. In Sweden, these poles developed into the modern javelin, and throwing them for distance became a common event there and in Finland in the 1880s. The rules continued to evolve over the next decades; originally, javelins were thrown with no run-up, and holding them by the grip at the center of gravity was not always mandatory. Limited run-ups were introduced in the late 1890s, and soon developed into the modern unlimited run-up.\nSweden's Eric Lemming, who threw his first world best (49.32 metres) in 1899 and ruled the event from 1902 to 1912, was the first dominant javelin thrower. When the men's javelin was introduced as an Olympic discipline at the 1906 Intercalated Games, Lemming won by almost nine metres and broke his own world record; Sweden swept the first four places, as Finland's best throwers were absent and the event had yet to become popular in any other country. Though challenged by younger talents, Lemming repeated as Olympic champion in 1908 and 1912; his eventual best mark (62.32\u00a0m, thrown after the 1912 Olympics) was the first javelin world record to be officially ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, most javelin competitions were two-handed; the implement was thrown with the right hand and separately with the left hand, and the best marks for each hand were added together. Competitions for the better hand only were less common, though not unknown. At the Olympics, a both-hands contest was held only once, in 1912; Finland swept the medals, ahead of Lemming. After that, this version of the javelin rapidly faded into obscurity, together with similar variations of the shot and the discus; Sweden's Yngve H\u00e4ckner, with his total of 114.28\u00a0m from 1917, was the last official both-hands world record holder.\nAnother early variant was the freestyle javelin, in which holding the javelin by the grip at the center of gravity was not mandatory; such a freestyle competition was held at the 1908 Olympics, but it was dropped from the program after that. Hungary's M\u00f3r K\u00f3cz\u00e1n used a freestyle end grip to break the 60-metre barrier in 1911, a year before Lemming and Julius Saaristo first did so with a regular grip.\nThe first known women's javelin marks were recorded in Finland in 1909. Originally, women threw the same implement as men; a lighter, shorter javelin for women was introduced in the 1920s. Women's javelin throw was added to the Olympic program in 1932; Mildred \"Babe\" Didrikson of the United States became the first champion.\nFor a long time, javelins were made of solid wood, typically birch, with a steel tip. The hollow, highly aerodynamic Held javelin, invented by American thrower Bud Held and developed and manufactured by his brother Dick, was introduced in the 1950s; the first Held javelins were also wooden with steel tips, but later models were made entirely of metal. These new javelins flew further, but were also less likely to land neatly point first; as a response to the increasingly frequent flat or ambiguously flat landings, experiments with modified javelins started in the early 1980s. The resulting designs, which made flat landings much less common and reduced the distances thrown, became official for men starting in April 1986 and for women in April 1999, and the world records (then 104.80\u00a0m by Uwe Hohn, and 80.00\u00a0m by Petra Felke) were reset. The current (as of 2017[ [update]]) men's world record is held by Jan \u017delezn\u00fd at 98.48\u00a0m (1996); Barbora \u0160pot\u00e1kov\u00e1 holds the women's world record at 72.28\u00a0m (2008).\nOf the 69 Olympic medals that have been awarded in the men's javelin, 32 have gone to competitors from Norway, Sweden or Finland. Finland is the only nation to have swept the medals at a currently recognized official Olympics, and has done so twice, in 1920 and 1932, in addition to its 1912 sweep in the two-handed javelin; in 1920 Finland swept the first four places, which is no longer possible as only three entrants per country are allowed. Finland has, however, never been nearly as successful in the women's javelin.\nThe javelin throw has been part of the decathlon since the decathlon was introduced in the early 1910s; the all-around, an earlier ten-event contest of American origin, did not include the javelin throw. The javelin was also part of some (though not all) of the many early forms of women's pentathlon and has always been included in the heptathlon after it replaced the pentathlon in 1981.\nRules and competitions.\nThe size, shape, minimum weight, and center of gravity of the javelin are all defined by World Athletics rules. In international competition, men throw a javelin between in length and in weight, and women throw a javelin between in length and in weight. The javelin has a grip, about wide, made of cord and located at the javelin's center of gravity () from the javelin tip for the men's javelin and from the javelin tip for the women's javelin.\nUnlike the other throwing events (shot put, discus, and hammer), the technique used to throw the javelin is dictated by World Athletics rules and \"non-orthodox\" techniques are not permitted. The javelin must be held at its grip and thrown overhand, over the athlete's shoulder or upper arm. Further, the athlete is prohibited from turning completely around or starting with their back facing the direction of the throw. This prevents athletes from attempting to spin and hurl the javelin sidearm in the style of a discus throw. This rule was put in place when a group of athletes began experimenting with a spin technique referred to as \"free style\". On 24 October 1956, Pentti Saarikoski threw 99.52\u00a0m () using the technique holding the end of the javelin. Officials were so afraid of the out of control nature of the technique that the practice was banned through these rule specifications.\nInstead of being confined to a circle, javelin throwers have a runway wide and at least in length, ending in an radius \"throwing arc\" from which their throw is measured; athletes typically use this distance to gain momentum in a \"run-up\" to their throw. Like the other throwing events, the competitor may not leave the throwing area (the runway) until after the implement lands. The need to come to a stop behind the throwing arc limits both how close the athlete can come to the line before the release as well as the maximum speed achieved at the time of release.\nThe javelin is thrown towards a 28.96\u00ba circular sector that is centered on the center point of the throwing arc. The angle of the throwing sector (28.96\u00ba) provides sector boundaries that are easy to construct and lay out on a field. A throw is only legal if the tip of the javelin lands within this sector and first strikes the ground before any other part of the javelin. The distance of the throw is measured from the throwing arc to the point where the tip of the javelin landed, rounded down to the nearest centimetre.\nCompetition rules are similar to other throwing events: a \"round\" consists of one attempt by each competitor in turn, and competitions typically consist of three to six rounds. The competitor with the longest single legal throw (over all rounds) is the winner; in case of a tie, the competitors' second-longest throws are also considered. Competitions involving large numbers of athletes sometimes use a \"cut\" whereby all competitors compete in the first three rounds but only those who are currently among the top eight or have achieved some minimum distances are permitted to attempt to improve on their distance in additional rounds (typically three).\nThe javelin is almost always thrown outdoors, though it is rarely thrown indoors. The world record for men's indoor javelin throw is by Matti N\u00e4rhi in 1996.\nJavelin redesigns.\nOn 1 April 1986, the men's javelin () was redesigned by the governing body (the IAAF Technical Committee). They decided to change the rules for javelin design because of the increasingly frequent flat landings and the resulting discussions and protests when these attempts were declared valid or invalid by competition judges. The world record had also crept up to a potentially dangerous level, by Uwe Hohn. With throws exceeding 100 metres, it was becoming difficult to safely stage the competition within the confines of a stadium infield. The javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved forward. In addition, the surface area in front of centre of gravity was reduced, while the surface area behind the centre of gravity was increased. This had an effect similar to that produced by the feathers on an arrow. The javelin turns into the relative wind. This relative wind appears to originate from the ground as the javelin descends, thus the javelin turns to face the ground. As the javelin turns into the wind less lift is generated, reducing the flight distance by around 10% but also causing the javelin to stick in the ground more consistently. In 1999, the women's javelin () was similarly redesigned.\nModifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were forbidden at the end of 1991 and performances made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books. Seppo R\u00e4ty had achieved a world record of in 1991 with such a design, but this record was nullified.\nWeight rules by age group.\nThe weight of the javelin in the Under-20 category is the same as the senior level.\nTechnique and training.\nUnlike other throwing events, javelin allows the competitor to build speed over a considerable distance. In addition, the core and upper body strength is necessary to deliver the implement, javelin throwers benefit from the agility and athleticism typically associated with running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more physical characteristics with sprinters than with others, although they still need the skill of heavier throwing athletes.\nTraditional free-weight training is often used by javelin throwers. Metal-rod exercises and resistance band exercises can be used to train a similar action to the javelin throw to increase power and intensity. Without proper strength and flexibility, throwers can become extremely injury prone, especially in the shoulder and elbow. Core stability can help in the transference of physical power and force from the ground through the body to the javelin. Stretching and sprint training are used to enhance the speed of the athlete at the point of release, and subsequently, the speed of the javelin. At release, a javelin must reach speeds approaching 113\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).\nThe javelin throw consists of three separate phases: the run-up, the transition, and the delivery. During each phase, the position of the javelin changes while the thrower changes his or her muscle recruitment. In the run-up phase as Luann Voza said, \"your arm is bent and kept close to your head, keeping the javelin in alignment with little to no arm movement\". This allows the thrower's bicep to contract, flexing the elbow. In order for the javelin to stay up high, the thrower's deltoid flexes. In the transition phase, the thrower's \"back muscles contract\" as \"the javelin is brought back in alignment with the shoulder with the thrower's palm up\". This, according to Voza, \"stretches your pectoral, or chest, muscles. From there, a stretch reflex, an involuntary contraction of your chest, helps bring your throwing arm forward with increased force\". During the final phase, the rotation of the shoulders initiates the release, which then \"transfers movement through the triceps muscles, wrists and fingers to extend the throwing arm forward to release the javelin\".\nCulture.\nIn 1994, Michael Torke composed \"Javelin\", commissioned by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games in celebration of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra's 50th anniversary season, in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.\nJavelin throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the \u20ac5 Finnish 10th IAAF World Championships in Athletics commemorative coin, minted in 2005 to commemorate the 2005 World Championships in Athletics. On the obverse of the coin, a javelin thrower is depicted. On the reverse, legs of hurdle runners with the Helsinki Olympic Stadium tower in the background can be seen.\nAll-time top 5 (dimpled models 1990\u20131991).\nMarks set using dimpled rough-tailed javelins manufactured by several companies were nullified effective 20 September 1991.\nSeason's bests.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1908, the institution was renamed in 1938 in honor of the fourth president of the United States, James Madison. It has since expanded from its origins as a normal school and teacher's college into a comprehensive university. It is situated in the Shenandoah Valley, just west of Massanutten Mountain.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1908 as a women's college, James Madison University was established by the Virginia General Assembly. It was originally called The State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg. In 1914, the name of the university was changed to the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg. Authorization to award bachelor's degrees was granted in 1916. During this initial period of development, six buildings were constructed.\nThe university became the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg in 1924 and continued under that name until 1938 when it was named Madison College in honor of James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, whose Montpelier estate is located in nearby Orange, Virginia. In 1977, the university's name was changed to James Madison University.\nThe first president of the university was Julian Ashby Burruss. The university opened its doors to its first student body in 1909 with an enrollment of 209 students and a faculty of fifteen. Its first twenty graduates received diplomas in 1911.\nIn 1919, Burruss resigned the presidency to become president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Samuel Page Duke was then chosen as the school's second president. During Duke's administration, nine major buildings were constructed. Duke served as president from 1919 to 1949.\nIn 1946, men were first enrolled as regular day students. G. Tyler Miller became the third president in 1949, following Duke's retirement. During Miller's administration, from 1949 to 1970, the campus was enlarged by and 19 buildings were constructed. Major curriculum changes were made and the university was authorized to grant master's degrees in 1954.\nIn 1966, by the action of the Virginia General Assembly, the university became a coeducational institution. Ronald E. Carrier, JMU's fourth president, headed the institution from 1971 to 1998. Carrier Library is named after him.\n21st century.\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century under Linwood H. Rose (JMU's fifth president), the university continued to expand, not only through new construction east of Interstate 81 but also on the west side of campus. In early 2005, JMU purchased the Rockingham Memorial Hospital campus just north of the main JMU campus for over $40 million. The hospital has since moved and JMU now occupies the site. In June 2005, the university expanded across South High Street by leasing, and then purchasing the former Harrisonburg High School building.\nThe rapid expansion of JMU's campus has at times created tension in the city-university relationship. In 2006, the local ABC affiliate reported that the university had nearly doubled in size in the preceding 20 years, including purchases of several local properties.\nThe university has also experienced tension with local residents and local police when 2,500 students at an off-campus block party grew unruly in 2000. Ten years later, police equipped with riot gear used force to disperse a group of 8,000 college-aged people at the party. Several participants were airlifted to a medical center in Charlottesville for treatment. The university condemned the block party attendees' behavior.\nIn August 2021, the university received national criticism from conservative political commentators and university alumni after an orientation leader training video and other publications surfaced that supposedly labeled white Americans and Christians as oppressors. In a statement to Fox News, the university stood by the training.\nIn March 2025, it was announced that James C. Schmidt would become the seventh president and he is scheduled to take office in July 2025.\nCampus.\nJMU's campus originally consisted of two buildings, Jackson Hall and Maury Hall, which are now known as Darcus Johnson Hall and Gabbin Hall, respectively. Today, the campus has 148 major buildings on . It has become Virginia's second most photographed location on social media sites like Instagram and Twitter.\nThe original, historic Bluestone side of campus is located on South Main Street (also known as U.S. Route 11, and historically as \"The Valley Pike\") and is the heart of the university. Many of the buildings in the Bluestone area have been constructed out of the same stone, known as \"bluestone,\" which is a type of limestone that is locally sourced from the surrounding Shenandoah Valley.\nBeginning in 2002 JMU began receiving state and private funding to construct a performing arts complex. The facility is opposite Wilson Hall across South Main Street.\nRenaming historic halls.\nIn 2020, JMU's Board of Visitors approved the renaming of three historic buildings on the quad that were named in honor of three prominent Virginian Confederate soldiers: Ashby Hall (named after Turner Ashby), Maury Hall (named after Matthew Fontaine Maury), and Jackson Hall (named after Stonewall Jackson). They were given the temporary names of Valley Hall, Mountain Hall, and Justice Studies Hall, respectively. In 2021, the halls were approved and given new names. Mountain Hall (Maury Hall) was renamed Gabbin Hall after Drs. Joanne V. and Alexander Gabbin, professors at JMU for more than 35 years; Valley Hall (Ashby Hall) was renamed Harper Allen-Lee Hall after Doris Harper Allen and Robert Walker Lee, both notable former staff members at JMU; Justice Studies Hall (Jackson Hall) was renamed Darcus Johnson Hall after Sheary Darcus Johnson, the first black student to graduate from JMU.\nIn late 2021, the ISAT/CS building was renamed King Hall in honor of Charles W. King; longtime Senior Vice President of the Administration and Finance Division at JMU.\nOrganization and administration.\nColleges.\nThe College of Visual and Performing Arts includes three schools: the School of Art, Design, and Art History; the School of Music; and the School of Theatre and Dance.\nIn September 2010, the college opened the Forbes Center for the Performing Arts, a complex composed of two connected buildings: the Estes Center for Theatre and Dance and the Roberts Center for Music Performance. The $82 million facility was funded by a Virginia higher-education bond package.\nBoard of Visitors.\nLike all public universities in Virginia, James Madison is governed by a Board of Visitors appointed by the Governor of Virginia. In addition to the 15 members appointed by the governor, the speaker of the Faculty Senate and an elected student representative serve as representatives for the faculty and the student body respectively. The appointed members serve for a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms, while the student representative is limited to two one-year terms. The faculty representative serves while remaining the speaker of the JMU Faculty Senate. Some appointed members of note include former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and former first lady of Virginia, Susan Allen.\nAcademics.\nJames Madison University is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities \u2013 High Research Activity\". It offers 139-degree programs on the bachelor's, master's, educational specialist, and doctoral levels. It comprises seven colleges and 78 academic programs, including the College of Arts and Letters; the College of Business; the College of Education; the College of Health and Behavioral Studies; the College of Integrated Science and Engineering; the College of Science and Mathematics; the College of Visual and Performing Arts; and The Graduate School. Total enrollment in the 2012\u201313 academic year was 19,927\u201418,392 undergraduates and 1,820 graduate students. JMU granted 4,908 degrees in 2012\u20134,096 undergraduate degrees, and 812 graduate degrees.\nOn October 2, 2009, JMU was granted a chapter by the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society.\nReputation and rankings.\nThe 2024 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked JMU No. 124 among national universities. In the 2018 \"Washington Monthly\" college rankings, JMU ranked eighth among master's universities nationwide. \"Washington Monthly\" assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research, and service.\nStudent life.\nThe \"Princeton Review\" recognized James Madison as one of 81 schools in America \"with a conscience\", and in 2006 ranked JMU second in the nation behind only the University of Virginia in the number of Peace Corps volunteers it sent from its student body among \"medium-sized\" universities. And in 2010, the food at JMU was ranked third in the United States. In 2011 the student body was ranked 20th \"happiest in the entire nation\" by \"Newsweek\" and \"The Daily Beast\". These rankings take into consideration the surrounding area's activities, academics, as well as the social scene on campus.\n\"The Breeze\".\n\"The Breeze\" is a student-run weekly newspaper serving JMU since 1922. The six person staff published the first issue on December 2, containing four pages. T\"he Breeze\" has won numerous awards, including a 2012 Online Pacemaker Award, 2012 VPA award for Best in Show for a Non-Daily News Presentation, and a 2012 VPA sweepstakes award.\n\"The Bluestone\".\n\"The Bluestone\" is the universities oldest publication, beginning in 1910 as the \"Schoolma'am\". In 1962, the name changed to \"The Bluestone\". The staff consists of an editorial board and staff members, both receive payment for their work. There are five editorial board positions, Editor-in-Chief, Design Editor, Photography Editor, Copy Editor, and Staff Manager. Staff Members have the option to contribute through photography, writing, or design. The publication is distributed free of charge to students at distribution sites. In 2021, \"The Bluestone\" was recognized by the Associated Collegiate Press on their top 100 Pacemaker awards list at MediaFest22.\nClubs and organizations.\nJames Madison University has over 400 clubs and organizations for students.\nThere are 10 front-end budgeted groups on campus, including the Black Student Alliance (BSA), Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), Latinx Student Alliance (LSA), Madison Equality, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Panhellenic, SafeRides, Student Ambassadors (SA), Student Government Association (SGA), and University Program Board (UPB). The funds allocated to these organization are voted on by the SGA, with the exception to the SGA budget which is approved separately by the administration. Some FEB organizations are more active than others, causing debate about their status from year-to-year. SGA has initiated many of the university's traditional events and programs, such as Homecoming's Purple Out, Mr. and Ms. Madison, Ring Premiere, the Annual Tree Lighting, the Big Event, and SafeRides. They also vote on Front End Budgeted (FEB) organizational budgets each year and allocate contingency funds. Founded in 2003, SafeRides originated as a program run by the SGA. Inspired by a program at Texas A&amp;M, the organization is a student-led non-profit: unpaid students drive students home at night at no charge. By 2022, they had given more than 100,000 rides.\nThe JMU Student Ambassadors work alongside the Admissions Office to offer student-led tours for prospective students. Formerly, the Ambassadors were also associated with the Alumni Office until the GOLD Network was established. Ambassadors are volunteers and are not paid.\nGreek life.\nJames Madison University is home to 20 fraternities and 12 sororities with an active membership of over 4,800 students. Greek life at JMU is organized under three governing councils: the Interfraternity Council (IFC), the Panhellenic Council, and the Inter-Cultural Greek Council (ICGC), which represent multicultural and historically Black Greek-letter organizations respectively. Greek life was formally brought to campus in spring of 1939 with the chartering of Sigma Sigma Sigma and Alpha Sigma Alpha. As of 2025, over 20% of the undergraduate population participates in Greek life.\nOver the years, there have been JMU Greek chapters that have lost university recognition or faced sanctions due to hazing, alcohol abuse, and other misconduct.\nA monument dedicated to the organizations within the Inter-Cultural Greek Council (ICGC) was built in 2022 outside of the university's Student Success Center.\nMusic.\nJames Madison University has the largest collegiate marching band in the nation, with 540 members as of Fall 2022. Nicknamed \"Virginia's Finest\", the Marching Royal Dukes have performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, the NFC title game between Washington and Dallas in 1983, and the Bands of America Grand National Championships in 1988 and 1991. The band has made four appearances in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, first in 2001, again in 2008, 2013, and most recently in 2018. In the past decade, the band has performed in Europe during winter break; they appeared in Athens, Dublin, Monaco, London, and Rome.\nThe JMU Brass Band is one of only a few collegiate brass bands in the United States. Formed in the fall of 2000, the band has twice been named the North American Brass Band Association (NABBA) Honors Section Champion (2004, 2005), and is the 2024 Championship Section Champion.\nJMU is home to ten a cappella ensembles: four all-female, three all-male, and three co-educational groups. They are nationally recognized, with many of them featured on the Best of College A Cappella (BOCA) yearly compilation albums. Several of the groups, such as Note-oriety and The Overtones, have gone \"viral\" for their music videos, \"Pretty Hurts\" and \"Say Love\", respectively. Note-oriety also performed at the White House in 2019.\nClub sports.\nThe JMU men's and women's club soccer teams are two of the most decorated club organizations in JMU school history.\nThe JMU men's ultimate team, the Flying Hellfish, was founded in 1997. The team is named after the Simpsons episode 22, season 7, \"Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'\" Since 2005, the team has hosted an annual tournament known as \"The Hellfish Bonanza,\" which attracts between 12 and 16 teams from across the east coast.\nThe JMU Men's Rugby Club was founded in 1974, making it the first club sport founded at JMU. The Women's Rugby Club was founded two years later. The JMU Men's Rugby Sevens team claimed victory of the Men's Division II title at the 2015 USA Rugby College Sevens National Championship, making it the first time the university's club has done so. The Men's Rugby Club celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2024.\nAthletics.\nJames Madison University's athletic teams are known as the Dukes. An English bulldog, with a crown and cape, and Duke Dog, a gray canine costume in a purple cape and crown, serve as the school's mascot. The \"Dukes\" nickname is in honor of Samuel Page Duke, the university's second president. The school colors are royal purple and gold. Madison competes in the NCAA's Division I in the Sun Belt Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference.\nBeginning in July 2022, the football program began competing in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as part of the Sun Belt Conference. Before that, the team participated in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and within the Colonial Athletic Association.\nOver 546 varsity athletes compete in football, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's tennis, women's swimming and diving, women's volleyball, baseball, women's lacrosse, field hockey, men's and women's golf, women's cross country and track and field, and softball. James Madison has won five national championships in football (2), field hockey, women's lacrosse, and archery, giving the Dukes the second-most national titles by a college or university in Virginia.\nJames Madison University invested heavily in new athletic facilities throughout the tenure of President Linwood Rose. JMU built a new multimillion-dollar baseball and softball field complex that opened in 2010. Additionally, after the last football game of 2009, the university began an expansion of Bridgeforth Stadium that increased seating capacity to approximately 25,000. Construction was completed in time for the 2011 football season.\nBasketball.\nIn 2013, James Madison University's men's basketball team won the CAA championship title for the first time since 1994. The Dukes then won their first NCAA tournament game in 30 years, defeating Long Island University-Brooklyn. The Dukes fell to Indiana in the second round, 83\u201362, finishing the season with a 21\u201315 record.\nAfter the move to the Sunbelt Conference in 2022, the Dukes won their first Sunbelt title in the 2023-2024 conference tournament championship win over Arkansas State, 91-71. This win was followed with a run in the NCAA Tournament defeating No. 5 seeded Wisconsin in a 72-61 win. Coming into the tournament as a No. 12 seed, the https:// made a push into the second round of the tournament and fell short to the No. 1 seeded Duke Blue Devils in a 93-55 loss.\nThe James Madison University's women's basketball team have won 5 national championships along with 15 conference championships while competing in the CAA. Since moving to the Sunbelt conference, the Dukes have won two regular season championship titles and one conference tournament championship in the 2022-2023 season, defeating Texas State, 81-51. Their most recent NCAA appearance came after the 2023 conference championship, making it as a No. 14 seed in the NCAA tournament, falling short in the first round to the Ohio State Buckeyes, 80-66.\nFootball.\nJMU football won the NCAA Division I-AA national title in 2004, with a 13\u20132 record, and in 2016 with a 14\u20131 record going undefeated in the FCS. The 2004 squad was the only team in history to win the title after playing four straight road playoff games. Since 2004, the JMU football team has appeared in the playoffs in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. In 2022 JMU football moved from the FCS to the sunbelt division in the FBS. Within their first three years playing in the FBS they went on to win their first bowl game at the Boca Raton Bowl in Boca Raton, Florida\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "16082", "revid": "47177166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16082", "title": "Jericho", "text": "Palestinian city in the West Bank\nJericho ( ; , ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine, and the capital of the Jericho Governorate. The city is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west.\nJericho is among the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000\u00a0BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth's history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the \"city of palm trees\".\nFollowing the era of Mandatory Palestine, the West Bank was annexed and ruled by Jordan starting in 1950, then was occupied by Israel in 1967. Administrative control of Jericho was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017. In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO's list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the \"oldest fortified city in the world\".\nEtymology.\nJericho's name in Biblical Hebrew, \"Y\u0259ri\u1e25o\" () is generally thought to derive from the Canaanite word \"r\u0113\u1e25\" 'fragrant', but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word \"Yara\u1e25\" 'moon' or the name of the lunar deity Yarikh, for whom the city was an early centre of worship.\nJericho's Arabic name, , means 'fragrant' and also has its roots in Canaanite \"r\u0113\u1e25\".\nHistory and archaeology.\nThe first excavations of the site were carried out by Charles Warren in 1868. Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and John Garstang excavated between 1930 and 1936. Kathleen Kenyon worked there between 1952 and 1958.\nSubsequently, Lorenzo Nigro and Nicol\u00f2 Marchetti excavated in 1997\u20132000. Since 2009, the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome (\"La Sapienza\" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH) under the direction of Nigro, Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015. The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997\u20132017), with some major discoveries, like Tower\u00a0A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace\u00a0G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.\nStone Age: Tell es-Sultan and spring.\nThe earliest excavated settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both Arabic and Hebrew, \"tell\" means \"mound\"; consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and Anatolia. Jericho is the type site for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) periods.\nNatufian hunter-gatherers, c.\u200910,000 BCE.\nEpipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian culture structures beginning earlier than 9000\u00a0BCE, the beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.\nJericho has evidence of settlement dating back to c.\u200910,000 BCE. During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the Ein es-Sultan spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600\u00a0BCE, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.\nPre-Pottery Neolithic, c. 9500\u20136500 BCE.\nThe Pre-Pottery Neolithic eras at Jericho are divided into PPNA and PPNB.\nPre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA).\nThe first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000\u00a0BCE. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed PPNA. Its cultures lacked pottery, but featured the following:\nAt Jericho, circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about across and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.\nThe Pre-Sultan (c.\u20098350 \u2013 7370\u00a0BCE) is sometimes called Sultanian. The site is a settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over high and wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, over high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps and placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria are the oldest towers ever to be discovered.\nThe wall and tower were built during the PPNA period around 8000\u00a0BCE. Carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that the tower was built around 8300\u00a0BCE and stayed in use until c.\u20097800\u00a0BCE. The wall may have served as a defence against flood water (possibly to prevent the erosion of agricultural soil), with the tower used for ceremonial purposes. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, but no street planning. The identity and number of Jericho's inhabitants during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates as high as 2,000\u20133,000 and as low as 200\u2013300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses, and hunted wild animals.\nPre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB).\nThe PPNB was a period of about 1.4 millennia, from 7220 to 5850\u00a0BCE (though carbon-14-dates are few and early). The following are PPNB cultural features:\nAfter a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of around five centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800\u00a0BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.\nThe architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ( and ) with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.\nKathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.\nThe dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.\nOther finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.\nIn the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.\nChalcolithic.\nA succession of settlements followed from 4500\u00a0BCE onward.\nEarly Bronze Age.\nIn Early Bronze I, the stratigraphic layers are Sultan IIIA1 village (EB IA, c. 3500 \u2013 3200\u00a0BCE) and Sultan IIIA2 rural town (proto-urban, EB IB, c. 3200 \u2013 3000\u00a0BCE).\nIn Early Bronze II, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIB1 foritifed town (EB IIA, c. 3000-2850 BCE) and Sultan IIIB2 with added towers and bastions to the fortification (EB IIB, c.2850 \u2013 2700\u00a0BCE).\nIn the Early Bronze IIIA (c.\u20092700 \u2013 2500/2450\u00a0BCE; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600\u00a0BCE.\nDuring Early Bronze IIIB (c.\u20092500/2450\u20132350\u00a0BCE; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.\nIn Early Bronze IV, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIID1 (EB IVA; 2300 \u2013 2200\u00a0BCE) and Sultan IIID2 (EB IVB; 2200 \u2013 2000\u00a0BCE).\nMiddle Bronze Age.\nJericho was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550\u00a0BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported \"the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period\" and there was \"a massive stone revetment ... part of a complex system\" of defenses. Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617\u20131530\u00a0BCE. Carbon dating c. 1573\u00a0BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating c. 1550.\nChronology (Nigro 2016)\nLate Bronze Age.\nDecades after the destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city, it recovered again on a smaller scale during the Late Bronze Age (1450\u20131200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its emerging crest. Excavations have found a structure known as the \"Middle Building\" which apparently served as the residence of the city's local rulers, then vassals of the Egyptian empire. Ultimately, the Middle Building was destroyed, although it was later reused in the early Iron Age. According to Nigro (2023), the Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century BCE materials.\nThe Hebrew Bible tells the story of the Battle of Jericho led by Joshua, leading to the fall of the Canaanite city, the first one captured by the Israelites in the Promised Land. The historicity of biblical account is not generally accepted by scholars. Lorenzo Nigro suggests that the story might have developed from local memories of the destructions suffered by the Canaanite city in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, which were later used by the biblical writers to create their narrative.\nIron Age.\nOccupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century\u00a0BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century, Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.\nPersian and Early Hellenistic periods.\nAfter the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period. During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.\nJericho went from being an administrative centre of Yehud Medinata (\"the Province of Judah\") under Persian rule to serving as the private estate of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323\u00a0BCE after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE Jericho was under Hellenistic rule of the Seleucid Empire, when the Syrian General Bacchides built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the Macabees. One of these forts, built at the entrance to Wadi Qelt, was later refortified by Herod the Great, who named it \"Kypros\" after his mother.\nHasmonean and Herodian periods.\nAfter the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or Hasmonean and Early Roman or Herodian periods was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area. The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of Wadi Qelt. The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group (kohanim) from the tribe of Levi, who ruled over Judea following the success of the Maccabean Revolt until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.\nThe rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and Mount of Temptation. They date between 100\u00a0BCE and 68\u00a0CE.\nHerodian period.\nHerod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30\u00a0BCE, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new Herodian domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (\"Tell es-Samrat\") to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of \"Tulul Abu el-Alaiq\" (also written \"\u02beAlayiq\"). In 2008, the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.\nThe murder of Aristobulus III in a swimming pool at the Hasmonean royal winter palaces, as described by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for Jerusalem's aristocracy.\nHerod was succeeded in Judea by his son, Herod Archelaus, who built a village in his name not far to the north, Archela\u00efs (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.\nFirst-century Jericho is described in Strabo's \"Geography\" as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the New Testament.\nThe Christian Gospels state that Jesus of Nazareth passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars (), and inspired a local chief tax collector named Zacchaeus to repent of his dishonest practices (). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the Parable of the Good Samaritan.\nJohn Wesley, in his New Testament Notes on this section of Luke's Gospel, claimed that \"about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple\".\nSmith's \"Bible Names Dictionary\" suggests that \"Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (; ; ). Here the descendant of Rahab did not disdain the hospitality of Zacchaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan.\"\nRoman province.\nAfter the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70\u00a0CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100\u00a0CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the Bar Kochba revolt in 133.\nByzantine period.\nAccounts of Jericho by a Christian pilgrim are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a Byzantine Jericho, \"Ericha\", was built 1600 metres (1\u00a0mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered. Christianity took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including the Monastery of Saint George of Choziba in 340\u00a0CE and a domed church dedicated to Saint Eliseus. At least two synagogues were also built in the 6th century CE. The monasteries were abandoned after the Sasanian invasion of 614.\nThe Jericho synagogue in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70 to 50\u00a0BCE. A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century CE was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, or \"peace unto Israel\", after the central Hebrew motto in its mosaic floor.\nThe Na'aran synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in a similar condition.\nEarly Muslim period.\nJericho, by then named \"Ariha\" in Arabic variation, became part of Jund Filastin (\"Military District of Palestine\"), part of the larger province of Bilad al-Sham. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab exiled the Jews and Christians of Khaybar to Jericho (and Tayma).\nBy 659, that district had come under the control of Mu'awiya, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho. A decade later, the pilgrim Arculf visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its \"miserable Canaanite\" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.\nA palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724\u2013743) and thus known as Hisham's Palace, is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1\u00a0mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This \"desert castle\" or \"qasr\" was more likely built by Caliph Walid ibn Yazid (r. 743\u2013744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction. The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen \"in situ\" today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.\nUmayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the Arab caliphates of the Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile \"City of the Palms\". Al-Maqdisi, the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that \"the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all Islam. Bananas are plentiful, also dates and flowers of fragrant odor\". Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.\nCrusader period.\nIn 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist, and were credited by 19th-century authors with introducing sugarcane production to the city, although now scholars date it to the pre-Crusader, Early Arab period. The Crusaders, however, have raised sugar production to the level of a large-scale industry. The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. \"sugar mills\") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin after their victory in the Battle of Hattin and the town slowly went into decline.\nAyyubid and Mamluk periods.\nIn 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi said of Jericho, \"it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the \"Ghaur\" land is made here.\" In the 14th century, Abu al-Fida writes that there are sulfur mines in Jericho, \"the only ones in Palestine\".\nOttoman period.\n16th century.\nJericho was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 Ak\u00e7e was recorded, destined for the new Waqf for the Haseki Sultan Imaret of Jerusalem. The villagers processed indigo as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem. Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.\nIn 1596 Jericho appeared in the tax registers under the name of \"Riha\", being in the \"nahiya\" of Al-Quds in the \"liwa\" of Al-Quds. It had a population of 51 households, all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 Ak\u00e7e. All of the revenue still went to a Waqf.\n17th century.\nThe French traveller Laurent d'Arvieux described the city in 1659 as \"now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated.\"\n19th century.\nIn the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often. At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts. Edward Robinson (1838) reported 50 families, which were about 200 people, Titus Tobler (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 kuru\u015f in tax. Abraham Samuel Herschberg (1858\u20131943) also reported after his 1899\u20131900 travels in the region of some 30 poor huts and 300 residents. At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called \"Ein al-Sultan\", lit. \"Sultan's Spring\", in Arabic and \"Ein Elisha\", lit. \"Elisha Spring\", in Hebrew, and springs in Wadi Qelt.\nJ. S. Buckingham (1786\u20131855) describes in his 1822 book how the male villagers of er-Riha, although nominally sedentary, engaged in Bedouin-style raiding, or \"ghazzu\": the little land cultivation he observed was done by women and children, while men spent most of their time riding through the plains and engaging in \"robbery and plunder\", their main and most profitable activity.\nAn Ottoman village list from around 1870 showed that \"Riha\", Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men only.\nThe first excavation at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867.\n20th century.\nIn Jericho and the Jordan Valley, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem acquired estates that supported agricultural development and served as symbols of its renewed presence in the countryside. The Greek Orthodox monasteries of St. George of Choziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.\nBritish Mandate period.\nAfter the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Jericho came under British rule, as part of Mandatory Palestine.\nAccording to the 1922 census of Palestine, Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants (931 Muslims, 92 Christians, and six Jews). The Christian population consisted of 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics (Melkite Catholics), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, four Copts and one Church of England.\nIn 1927, an earthquake struck and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died, but by the 1931 census the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants (1,512 Muslims, 170 Christians, seven Druze, and four Jews), in 347 houses.\nIn the 1938 statistics, Jericho lists a population of 1,996 people (including five Jews).\nIn the 1945 statistics, Jericho's population was 3,010 (2,570 Muslims, 260 Christians, 170 Jews, and 10 \"other\") and it had jurisdiction over 37,481 dunams of land. Of this, 948 dunams were used for citrus and bananas, 5,873 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 9,141 for cereals, while a total of 38 dunams were urban, built-up areas.\nDuring World War II The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company Solel Boneh, and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.\nJordanian period.\nJericho came under Jordanian control after the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. The Jericho Conference, organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed \"His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine\" and called for \"the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity\". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.\nIn 1961, the population of Jericho was 10,166, of whom 935 were Christian, and the rest were Muslim.\n1967 and aftermath.\nJericho has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to Palestinian Authority control in accordance with the Oslo Accords. The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the Gaza\u2013Jericho Agreement of 4 May 1994. Part of the agreement was a \"Protocol on Economic Relations\", signed on 29 April 1994. The city is in an enclave of the Jordan Valley that is in Area A of the West Bank, while the surrounding area is designated as being in Area\u00a0C under full Israeli military control. Four roadblocks encircle the enclave, restricting Jericho's Palestinian population's movement through the West Bank.\nThe Jericho synagogue was controlled by Israel after the Six-Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.\nIn response to the 2001 Second Intifada and suicide bombings, Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops. A deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.\nOn 14 March 2006, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods, raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, Ahmad Sa'adat, and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister Rehavam Zeevi in 2001.\nAfter Hamas assaulted a neighborhood in Gaza mostly populated by the Fatah-aligned Hilles clan, in response to their attack that killed six Hamas members, the Hilles clan was relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008.\nIn 2009, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs David Johnson inaugurated the Presidential Guard Training Center in Jericho, a $9.1\u00a0million training facility for Palestinian Authority security forces built with U.S. funding. In 2024, a Jericho street was named after Aaron Bushnell, a U.S. soldier who self-immolated in support of Palestine.\nThe city had a population of 20,907 in 2017.\nGeography and environment.\nJericho is located below sea level in an oasis in Wadi Qelt in the Jordan Valley, which makes it the lowest city in the world. The nearby spring of \"Ein es-Sultan\" produces 3.8\u00a0m3 (1,000 gallons) of water per minute, irrigating some through multiple channels and feeding into the Jordan River, away.\nImportant Bird Area.\nA site encompassing the city of Jericho and its immediate surrounds has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins, lanner falcons, lesser kestrels, and Dead Sea sparrows.\nClimate.\nAnnual rainfall is , mostly concentrated in the winter months and into early spring. The average temperature is in January and in July. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Jericho has a hot desert climate (\"BWh\"). Rich alluvial soil and abundant spring water have made Jericho an attractive place for settlement.\nDemographics.\nIn the first census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. Palestinian refugees constituted 43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people. The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.\nIn a 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi, 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews. Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The Christian community makes up around 1% of the population. A large community of black Palestinians lives in Jericho.\nEconomy.\nIn 1994, Israel and Palestine signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule. Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.\nThe Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.\nTourism.\nIn 1998, a $150\u00a0million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat. The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.\nIn 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.\nBiblical and Christian landmarks.\nChristian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.\nSchools and religious institutions.\nIn 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.\nHealth care.\nIn April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5\u00a0million in funding for this project.\nSports.\nThe sports team Hilal Areeha plays association football in the West Bank First Division. They play home games in the 15,000-spectator Jericho International Stadium.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nJericho is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16083", "revid": "39457116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16083", "title": "Jesuits", "text": "Male religious congregation of the Catholic Church\nThe Society of Jesus (; abbreviation: S.J. or SJ), also known as the Jesuit Order or the Jesuits ( ; ), is a religious order of clerics regular of pontifical right for men in the Catholic Church headquartered in Rome. It was founded in 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola and six companions, with the approval of Pope Paul III. The Society of Jesus is the largest religious order in the Catholic Church and has played a significant role in education, charity, humanitarian acts and global policies. The Society of Jesus is engaged in evangelization and apostolic ministry in 112 countries. Jesuits work in education, research, and cultural pursuits. They also conduct retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes, sponsor direct social and humanitarian works, and promote ecumenical dialogue.\nThe Society of Jesus is consecrated under the patronage of Madonna della Strada, a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and it is led by a superior general. The headquarters of the society, its general curia, is in Rome. The historic curia of Ignatius is now part of the attached to the Church of the Ges\u00f9, the Jesuit mother church. \nMembers of the Society of Jesus make profession of \"perpetual poverty, chastity, and obedience\" and \"promise a special obedience to the sovereign pontiff in regard to the missions.\" A Jesuit is expected to be totally available and obedient to his superiors, accepting orders to go anywhere in the world, even if required to live in extreme conditions. Ignatius, its leading founder, was a nobleman who had a military background. The opening lines of the founding document of the Society of Jesus accordingly declare that it was founded for \"whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God, to strive especially for the defense and propagation of the faith, and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine\". Jesuits are thus sometimes referred to colloquially as \"God's soldiers\", \"God's marines\", or \"the Company\". The Society of Jesus participated in the Counter-Reformation and, later, in the implementation of the Second Vatican Council.\nJesuit missionaries established missions around the world from the 16th to the 18th century and had both successes and failures in Christianizing the native peoples. The Jesuits have always been controversial within the Catholic Church and have frequently clashed with secular governments and institutions. Beginning in 1759, the Catholic Church expelled Jesuits from most countries in Europe and from European colonies. Pope Clement XIV officially suppressed the order in 1773. In 1814, the Church lifted the suppression.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nIgnatius of Loyola, a Basque nobleman from the Pyrenees area of northern Spain, founded the society after discerning his spiritual vocation while recovering from a wound sustained in the Battle of Pamplona.\nOn 15 August 1534, Ignatius of Loyola (born \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Loyola), a Spaniard from the Basque city of Loyola, and six others mostly of Castilian origin, all students at the University of Paris, met in Montmartre outside Paris, in a crypt beneath the church of Saint Denis, now Saint Pierre de Montmartre, to pronounce promises of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Ignatius' six companions were: Francisco Xavier from Navarre (modern Spain), Alfonso Salmeron, Diego La\u00ednez, Nicol\u00e1s Bobadilla from Castile (modern Spain), Peter Faber from Savoy, and Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues from Portugal.\nThe meeting is commemorated in the Martyrium of Saint Denis, Montmartre. They called themselves the , and also or \"Friends in the Lord\", because they felt \"they were placed together by Christ.\" The name \"company\" had echoes of the military (reflecting perhaps Ignatius' background as captain in the Spanish army) as well as of discipleship (the \"companions\" of Jesus). The Spanish \"company\" would be translated into Latin as like in , a partner or comrade. From this came \"Societas Iesu\" (S.J.), in English \"Society of Jesus\", by which they would be known more widely.\nReligious orders established in the medieval era were named after particular men: Francis of Assisi (Franciscans); Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, later canonized as Saint Dominic (Dominicans); and Augustine of Hippo (Augustinians). Ignatius of Loyola and his followers appropriated the name of Jesus for their new order, provoking resentment by other orders who considered it presumptuous. The resentment was recorded by Jesuit Jos\u00e9 de Acosta of a conversation with the Archbishop of Santo Domingo.\nIn the words of one historian: \"The use of the name Jesus gave great offense. Both on the Continent and in England, it was denounced as blasphemous; petitions were sent to kings and to civil and ecclesiastical tribunals to have it changed; and even Pope Sixtus V had signed a Brief to do away with it.\" But nothing came of all the opposition; there were already congregations named after the Trinity and as \"God's daughters\".\nIn 1537, the seven travelled to Italy to seek papal approval for their order. Pope Paul III gave them a commendation, and permitted them to be ordained priests. These initial steps led to the official founding in 1540.\nThey were ordained in Venice by the bishop of Arbe on 24 June. They devoted themselves to preaching and charitable work in Italy. The Italian War of 1536\u20131538 renewed between Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Venice, the Pope, and the Ottoman Empire, had rendered any journey to Jerusalem impossible.\nAgain in 1540, they presented the project to Paul III. After months of dispute, a congregation of cardinals reported favourably upon the Constitution presented, and Paul III confirmed the order through the bull (\"To the Government of the Church Militant\"), on 27 September 1540. This is the founding document of the Society of Jesus as an official Catholic religious order. Ignatius was chosen as the first Superior General. Paul III's bull had limited the number of its members to sixty. This limitation was removed through the bull of Julius III in 1550.\nIn 1543, Peter Canisius entered the company. Ignatius sent him to Messina, where he founded the first Jesuit college in Sicily.\nIgnatius laid out his original vision for the new order in the \"Formula of the Institute of the Society of Jesus\", which is \"the fundamental charter of the order, of which all subsequent official documents were elaborations and to which they had to conform\". He ensured that his formula was contained in two papal bulls signed by Pope Paul III in 1540 and by Pope Julius III in 1550. The formula expressed the nature, spirituality, community life, and apostolate of the new religious order. Its famous opening statement echoed Ignatius' military background:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God beneath the banner of the Cross in our Society, which we desire to be designated by the Name of Jesus, and to serve the Lord alone and the Church, his spouse, under the Roman Pontiff, the Vicar of Christ on earth, should, after a solemn vow of perpetual chastity, poverty and obedience, keep what follows in mind. He is a member of a Society founded chiefly for this purpose: to strive especially for the defence and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine, by means of public preaching, lectures and any other ministration whatsoever of the Word of God, and further by means of retreats, the education of children and unlettered persons in Christianity, and the spiritual consolation of Christ's faithful through hearing confessions and administering the other sacraments. Moreover, he should show himself ready to reconcile the estranged, compassionately assist and serve those who are in prisons or hospitals, and indeed, to perform any other works of charity, according to what will seem expedient for the glory of God and the common good.\nIn fulfilling the mission of the \"Formula of the Institute of the Society\", the first Jesuits concentrated on a few key activities. First, they founded schools throughout Europe. Jesuit teachers were trained in both classical studies and theology, and their schools reflected this. These schools taught with a balance of Aristotelian methods with mathematics.\nSecond, they sent out missionaries across the globe to evangelize those peoples who had not yet heard the Gospel, founding missions in widely diverse regions such as modern-day Paraguay, Japan, Ontario, and Ethiopia. One of the original seven arrived in India already in 1541. Finally, though not initially formed for the purpose, they aimed to stop Protestantism from spreading and to preserve communion with Rome and the pope. The zeal of the Jesuits overcame the movement toward Protestantism in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and southern Germany.\nIgnatius wrote the Jesuit \"Constitutions\", adopted in 1553, which created a centralised organization and stressed acceptance of any mission to which the pope might call them. His main principle became the unofficial Jesuit motto: (\"For the greater glory of God\"). This phrase is designed to reflect the idea that any work that is not evil can be meritorious for the spiritual life if it is performed with this intention, even things normally considered of little importance.\nThe Society of Jesus is classified among institutes as an order of clerks regular, that is, a body of priests organized for apostolic work, and following a religious rule.\nThe term \"Jesuit\" (of 15th-century origin, meaning \"one who used too frequently or appropriated the name of Jesus\") was first applied to the society in reproach (1544\u20131552). The term was never used by Ignatius of Loyola, but over time, members and friends of the society adopted the name with a positive meaning.\nWhile the order is limited to men, Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal, favored the order and she is reputed to have been admitted surreptitiously under a male pseudonym.\nEarly works.\nThe Jesuits were founded just before the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563) and ensuing Counter-Reformation that would introduce reforms within the Catholic Church, and so counter the Protestant Reformation throughout Catholic Europe.\nIgnatius and the early Jesuits did recognize, though, that the hierarchical church was in dire need of reform. Some of their greatest struggles were against corruption, venality, and spiritual lassitude within the Catholic Church. Ignatius insisted on a high level of academic preparation for the clergy in contrast to the relatively poor education of much of the clergy of his time. The Jesuit vow against \"ambitioning prelacies\" can be seen as an effort to counteract another problem evidenced in the preceding century.\nIgnatius and the Jesuits who followed him believed that the reform of the church had to begin with the conversion of an individual's heart. One of the main tools the Jesuits have used to bring about this conversion is the Ignatian retreat, called the Spiritual Exercises. During a four-week period of silence, individuals undergo a series of directed meditations on the purpose of life and contemplations on the life of Christ. They meet regularly with a spiritual director who guides their choice of exercises and helps them to develop a more discerning love for Christ.\nThe retreat follows a \"Purgative-Illuminative-Unitive\" pattern in the tradition of the spirituality of John Cassian and the Desert Fathers. Ignatius' innovation was to make this style of contemplative mysticism available to all people in active life. He used it as a means of rebuilding the spiritual life of the church. The Exercises became both the basis for the training of Jesuits and one of the essential ministries of the order: giving the exercises to others in what became known as \"retreats\".\nThe Jesuits' contributions to the late Renaissance were significant in their roles both as a missionary order and as the first religious order to operate colleges and universities as a principal and distinct ministry. By the time of Ignatius' death in 1556, the Jesuits were already operating a network of 74 colleges on three continents. A precursor to liberal education, the Jesuit plan of studies incorporated the Classical teachings of Renaissance humanism into the Scholastic structure of Catholic thought. This method of teaching was important in the context of the Scientific Revolution, as these universities were open to teaching new scientific and mathematical methodology. Further, many important thinkers of the Scientific Revolution were educated by Jesuit universities.\nIn addition to the teachings of faith, the Jesuit (1599) would standardize the study of Latin, Greek, classical literature, poetry, and philosophy as well as non-European languages, sciences, and the arts. Jesuit schools encouraged the study of vernacular literature and rhetoric, and thereby became important centres for the training of lawyers and public officials.\nThe Jesuit schools played an important part in winning back to Catholicism a number of European countries which had for a time been predominantly Protestant, notably Poland and Lithuania. Today, Jesuit colleges and universities are located in over one hundred nations around the world. Under the notion that God can be encountered through created things and especially art, they encouraged the use of ceremony and decoration in Catholic ritual and devotion. Perhaps as a result of this appreciation for art, coupled with their spiritual practice of \"finding God in all things\", many early Jesuits distinguished themselves in the visual and performing arts as well as in music. The theater was a form of expression especially prominent in Jesuit schools.\nJesuit priests often acted as confessors to kings during the early modern period. They were an important force in the Counter-Reformation and in the Catholic missions, in part because their relatively loose structure (without the requirements of living and celebration of the Liturgy of Hours in common) allowed them to be flexible and meet diverse needs arising at the time.\nExpansion of the order.\nAfter much training and experience in theology, Jesuits went across the globe in search of converts to Christianity. Despite their dedication, they had little success in Asia, except in the Philippines. For instance, early missions in Japan resulted in the government granting the Jesuits the feudal fiefdom of Nagasaki in 1580. This was removed in 1587 due to fears over their growing influence. Jesuits did, however, have much success in Latin America. Their ascendancy in societies in the Americas accelerated during the seventeenth century, wherein Jesuits created new missions in Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia. As early as 1603, there were 345 Jesuit priests in Mexico alone.\nIn 1541, Francis Xavier, one of the original companions of Loyola, arrived in Goa, Portuguese India, to carry out evangelical service in the Indies. In a 1545 letter to John III of Portugal, he requested an Inquisition to be installed in Goa to combat heresies like crypto-Judaism and crypto-Islam. Under Portuguese royal patronage, Jesuits thrived in Goa and until 1759 successfully expanded their activities to education and healthcare.\nIn 1594, they founded the first Roman-style academic institution in the East, St. Paul Jesuit College in Macau, China. Founded by Alessandro Valignano, it had a great influence on the learning of Eastern languages (Chinese and Japanese) and culture by missionary Jesuits, becoming home to the first western sinologists such as Matteo Ricci. Jesuit efforts in Goa were interrupted by the expulsion of the Jesuits from Portuguese territories in 1759 by the powerful Marquis of Pombal, the Secretary of State in Portugal.\nIn 1624, the Portuguese Jesuit Ant\u00f3nio de Andrade founded a mission in Western Tibet. In 1661, two Jesuit missionaries, Johann Grueber and Albert Dorville, reached Lhasa, in Tibet. The Italian Jesuit Ippolito Desideri established a new Jesuit mission in Lhasa and Central Tibet (1716\u201321) and gained an exceptional mastery of Tibetan language and culture, writing a long and very detailed account of the country and its religion as well as treatises in Tibetan that attempted to refute key Buddhist ideas and establish the truth of Catholic Christianity.\nJesuit missions in the Americas became controversial in Europe, especially in Spain and Portugal, where they were seen as interfering with the proper colonial enterprises of the royal governments. The Jesuits were often the only force standing between the Indigenous and slavery. Together throughout South America but especially in present-day Brazil and Paraguay, they formed Indigenous Christian city-states, called \"reductions\". These were societies set up according to an idealized theocratic model.\nThe efforts of Jesuits like Antonio Ruiz de Montoya to protect the natives from enslavement by Spanish and Portuguese colonizers contributed to the call for the society's suppression. Jesuit priests such as Manuel da N\u00f3brega and Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta founded several towns in Brazil in the 16th century, including S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and were very influential in the pacification, religious conversion, and education of indigenous nations. They built schools, organized people into villages, and created a writing system for the local languages of Brazil. Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta and Manuel da N\u00f3brega were the first Jesuits that Ignacio de Loyola sent to the Americas.\nJesuit scholars working in foreign missions were very dedicated in studying the local languages and strove to produce Latinized grammars and dictionaries. This included: Japanese (see , also known as , \"Vocabulary of the Japanese Language\", a Japanese\u2013Portuguese dictionary written 1603); Vietnamese (Portuguese missionaries created the Vietnamese alphabet, which was later formalized by Avignon missionary Alexandre de Rhodes with his 1651 trilingual dictionary); Tupi, the main language of Brazil, and the pioneering study of Sanskrit in the West by Jean Fran\u00e7ois Pons in the 1740s.\nJesuit missionaries were active among indigenous peoples in New France in North America, many of them compiling dictionaries or glossaries of the First Nations and Native American languages they had learned. For instance, before his death in 1708, Jacques Gravier, vicar general of the Illinois Mission in the Mississippi River valley, compiled a Miami\u2013Illinois\u2013French dictionary, considered the most extensive among works of the missionaries. Extensive documentation was left in the form of \"The Jesuit Relations\", published annually from 1632 until 1673.\nBritain.\nWhereas Jesuits were active in Britain in the 1500s, due to the persecution of Catholics in the Elizabethan times, an English province was only established in 1623. The first pressing issue for early Jesuits in what today is the United Kingdom, was to establish places for training priests. In 1579, an English College was opened in Rome. In 1589, a Jesuit seminary was opened at Valladolid.\nIn 1592, an English College was opened in Seville. In 1614, an English college opened in Louvain. This was the earliest foundation of what was later Heythrop College. Campion Hall, founded in 1896, has been a presence within Oxford University since then.\n16th and 17th-century Jesuit institutions intended to train priests were hotbeds for the persecution of Catholics in Britain, where men suspected of being Catholic priests were routinely imprisoned, tortured, and executed. Jesuits were among those killed, including the namesake of Campion Hall, as well as Brian Cansfield, Ralph Corbington, and many others. A number of them were canonized among the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.\nIn 2022, four Jesuit churches existed in London, with three other places of worship in England and two in Scotland.\nChina.\nThe Jesuits first entered China through the Portuguese settlement on Macau, where they settled on Green Island and founded St. Paul's College.\nThe Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy, then undergoing its own revolution, to China. The scientific revolution brought by the Jesuits coincided with a time when scientific innovation had declined in China:\n[The Jesuits] made efforts to translate western mathematical and astronomical works into Chinese and aroused the interest of Chinese scholars in these sciences. They made very extensive astronomical observation and carried out the first modern cartographic work in China. They also learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence, European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture.\nFor over a century, Jesuits such as Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci, Diego de Pantoja, Philippe Couplet, Michal Boym, and Fran\u00e7ois No\u00ebl refined translations and disseminated Chinese knowledge, culture, history, and philosophy to Europe. Their Latin works popularized the name \"Confucius\" and had considerable influence on the Deists and other Enlightenment thinkers, some of whom were intrigued by the Jesuits' attempts to reconcile Confucian morality with Catholicism.\nUpon the arrival of the Franciscans and other monastic orders, Jesuit accommodation of Chinese culture and rituals led to the long-running Chinese Rites controversy. Despite the personal testimony of the Kangxi Emperor and many Jesuit converts that Chinese veneration of ancestors and Confucius was a nonreligious token of respect, Pope Clement XI's papal decree ruled that such behavior constituted impermissible forms of idolatry and superstition in 1704.\nHis legate Tournon and Bishop Charles Maigrot of Fujian, tasked with presenting this finding to the Kangxi Emperor, displayed such extreme ignorance that the emperor mandated the expulsion of Christian missionaries unable to abide by the terms of Ricci's Chinese catechism. Tournon's summary and automatic excommunication for any violators of Clement's decree\u00a0\u2013 upheld by the 1715 bull \u00a0\u2013 led to the swift collapse of all the missions in China. The last Jesuits were expelled after 1721.\nIreland.\nThe first Jesuit school in Ireland was established at Limerick by the apostolic visitor of the Holy See, David Wolfe. Wolfe was sent to Ireland by Pope Pius IV with the concurrence of the third Jesuit superior general, Diego Laynez. He was charged with setting up grammar schools \"as a remedy against the profound ignorance of the people\".\nWolfe's mission in Ireland initially concentrated on setting the sclerotic Irish Church on a sound footing, introducing the Tridentine Reforms and finding suitable men to fill vacant sees. He established a house of religious women in Limerick known as the Menabochta (\"poor women\" ) and in 1565 preparations began for establishing a school at Limerick.\nAt his instigation, Richard Creagh, a priest of the Diocese of Limerick, was persuaded to accept the vacant Archdiocese of Armagh, and was consecrated in Rome in 1564.\nThis early Limerick school, Crescent College, operated in difficult circumstances. In April 1566, William Good sent a detailed report to Rome of his activities via the Portuguese Jesuits. He informed the Jesuit superior general that he and Edmund Daniel had arrived at Limerick city two years beforehand and their situation there had been perilous. Both had arrived in the city in very bad health, but had recovered due to the kindness of the people.\nThey established contact with Wolfe, but were only able to meet with him at night, as the English authorities were attempting to arrest the legate. Wolfe charged them initially with teaching to the boys of Limerick, with an emphasis on religious instruction, and Good translated the catechism from Latin into English for this purpose. They remained in Limerick for eight months.\nIn December 1565, they moved to Kilmallock under the protection of the Earl of Desmond, where they lived in more comfort than the primitive conditions they experienced in Limerick. They were unable to support themselves at Kilmallock and three months later they returned to Limerick in Easter 1566, and strangely set up their house in accommodation owned by the Lord Deputy of Ireland, which was conveyed to them by certain influential friends.\nThey recommenced teaching at Castle Lane, and imparting the sacraments, though their activities were restricted by the arrival of Royal Commissioners. Good reported that as he was an Englishman, English officials in the city cultivated him and he was invited to dine with them on a number of occasions, though he was warned to exercise prudence and avoid promoting the Petrine primacy and the priority of the Mass amongst the sacraments with his students and congregation, and that his sermons should emphasize obedience to secular princes if he wished to avoid arrest.\nThe number of scholars in their care was very small. An early example of a school play in Ireland is sent in one of Good's reports, which was performed on the Feast of St. John in 1566. The school was conducted in one large aula, with the students were divided into distinct classes. Good gives a highly detailed report of the curriculum taught. The top class studied the first and second parts of Johannes Despauterius's Commentarli grammatici, and read a few letters of Cicero or the dialogues of Frusius (Andr\u00e9 des Freux, SJ). The second class committed Donatus' texts in Latin to memory and read dialogues and works by \u0112valdus Gallus. Students in the third class learned Donatus by heart, translated into English rather than Latin. Young boys in the fourth class were taught to read. Progress was slow because there were too few teachers to conduct classes simultaneously.\nIn the spirit of Ignatius' Roman College founded 14 years before, no fee was requested from pupils. As a result, the two Jesuits lived in very poor conditions and were very overworked with teaching and administering the sacraments to the public. In late 1568, the Castle Lane School, in the presence of Daniel and Good, was attacked and looted by government agents sent by Sir Thomas Cusack during the pacification of Munster.\nThe political and religious climate had become more uncertain in the lead up to Pope Pius V's formal excommunication of Queen Elizabeth I, which resulted in a new wave of repression of Catholicism in England, Wales and Ireland. At the end of 1568, the Anglican Bishop of Meath, Hugh Brady, was sent to Limerick charged with a Royal Commission to seek out and expel the Jesuits. Daniel was immediately ordered to quit the city and went to Lisbon, where he resumed his studies with the Portuguese Jesuits. Good moved on to Clonmel, before establishing himself at Youghal until 1577.\nIn 1571, after Wolfe had been captured and imprisoned at Dublin Castle, Daniel persuaded the Portuguese Province to agree a surety for the ransom of Wolfe, who was quickly banished on release. In 1572, Daniel returned to Ireland, but was immediately captured. Incriminating documents were found on his person, which were taken as proof of his involvement with the rebellious cousin of the Earl of Desmond, James Fitzmaurice and a Spanish plot. He was removed from Limerick, and taken to Cork, \"just as if he were a thief or noted evildoer\". After being court-martialled by the Lord President of Munster, Sir John Perrot, he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered for treason, and refused pardon in return for swearing the Act of Supremacy. His execution was carried out on 25 October 1572. A report of it was sent by Fitzmaurice to the Jesuit Superior General in 1576, where he said that Daniel was \"cruelly killed because of me\".\nWith Daniel dead and Wolfe dismissed, the Irish Jesuit foundation suffered a severe setback. Good is recorded as resident at Rome in 1577. In 1586, the seizure of Earl of Desmond's estates resulted in a new permanent Protestant plantation in Munster, making the continuation of the Limerick school impossible for a time. It was not until the early 1600s that the Jesuit mission could again re-establish itself in the city, though the Jesuits kept a low profile existence in lodgings here and there. For instance, a mission led by Fr. Nicholas Leinagh re-established itself at Limerick in 1601, though the Jesuit presence in the city numbered no more than 1 or 2 at a time in the years immediately following.\nIn 1604, the Lord President of Munster, Sir Henry Brouncker - at Limerick, ordered all Jesuits from the city and Province, and offered \u00a37 to anyone willing to betray a Jesuit priest to the authorities, and \u00a35 for a seminarian. Jesuit houses and schools throughout the province, in the years after, were subject to periodic crackdown and the occasional destruction of schools, imprisonment of teachers and the levying of heavy money penalties on parents are recorded in publications of the time. In 1615\u201317, the Royal Visitation Books, written up by Thomas Jones, the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, records the suppression of Jesuit schools at Waterford, Limerick and Galway.\nIn spite of this occasional persecution, the Jesuits were able to exert a degree of discreet influence within the province and in Limerick. For instance in 1606, largely through their efforts, a Catholic named Christopher Holywood was elected Mayor of the city. In 1602, the resident Jesuit had raised a sum of \"200 cruzados\" for the purpose of founding a hospital in Limerick, though the project was disrupted by a severe outbreak of plague and repression by the Lord President.\nThe principal activities of the order within Limerick at this time were devoted to preaching, administration of the sacraments and teaching. The school opened and closed intermittently in or around the area of Castle Lane, near Lahiffy's lane. During demolition work stones marked I.H.S., 1642 and 1609 were, in the 19th century, found inserted in a wall behind a tan yard near St Mary's Chapel which, according to Lenihan, were thought to mark the site of an early Jesuit school and oratory. This building, at other times, had also functioned as a dance house and candle factory.\nFor much of the 1600s, the Limerick Jesuit foundation established a more permanent and stable presence and the Jesuit Annals record a 'flourishing' school at Limerick in the 1640s. During the Confederacy the Jesuits had been able to go about their business unhindered and were invited to preach publicly from the pulpit of St. Mary's Cathedral on 4 occasions. Cardinal Giovanni Rinuccini wrote to the Jesuit general in Rome, praising the work of the Rector of the Limerick College, Fr. William O'Hurley, who was aided by Fr. Thomas Burke.\nA few years later, during the Protectorate era, only 18 of the Jesuits resident in Ireland managed to avoid capture by the authorities. Lenihan records that the Limerick Crescent College in 1656 moved to a hut in the middle of a bog, which was difficult for the authorities to find. This foundation was headed up by Fr. Nicholas Punch, who was aided by Frs. Maurice Patrick, Piers Creagh and James Forde. The school attracted a large number of students from around the locality.\nAt the Restoration of Charles II, the school moved back to Castle Lane, and remained largely undisturbed for the next 40 years, until the surrender of the city to Williamite forces in 1692. In 1671, Dr. James Douley was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Limerick. During his visitation to the diocese, he reported to the Holy See that the Jesuits had a house and \"taught schools with great fruit, instructing the youth in the articles of faith and good morals.\" Douley also noted that this and other Catholic schools operating in the Diocese were also attended by local Protestants.\nThe Jesuit presence in Ireland, in the so-called Penal era after the Battle of the Boyne, ebbed and flowed. In 1700 they were only 6 or 7, recovering to 25 in 1750. Small Jesuit houses and schools existed at Athlone, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Waterford, New Ross, Wexford, and Drogheda, as well as Dublin and Galway. At Limerick there appears to have been a long hiatus following the defeat of the Jacobite forces. Fr. Thomas O'Gorman was the first Jesuit to return to Limerick after the siege, arriving in 1728. He took up residence in Jail Lane, near the Castle in the Englishtown. There he opened a school to \"impart the rudiments of the classics to the better class youth of the city.\"\nO'Gorman left in 1737 and was succeeded by Fr. John McGrath. Next came Fr. James McMahon, who was a nephew of the Primate of Armagh, Hugh MacMahon. McMahon lived at Limerick for thirteen years until his death in 1751. In 1746, Fr Joseph Morony was sent from Bordeaux to join McMahon and the others. Morony remained at the Jail Lane site teaching at a \"high class school\" until 1773, when he was ordered to close the school and oratory following the papal suppression of the Society of Jesus, 208 years after its foundation by Wolfe. Morony then went to live in Dublin and worked as a secular priest.\nDespite the efforts of the Castle authorities and English government, the Limerick school managed to survive the Protestant Reformation, the Cromwellian invasion and Williamite Wars, and subsequent Penal Laws. It was forced to close, not for religious or confessional reasons, but due to the political difficulties of the Jesuit Order elsewhere.\nFollowing the restoration of the Society of Jesus in 1814, the Jesuits gradually re-established a number of their schools throughout the country, starting with foundations at Kildare and Dublin. In 1859, they returned to Limerick at the invitation of the Bishop of Limerick, John Ryan, and re-established a school in Galway the same year.\nCanada.\nThe first Jesuit mission to Canada was on 25 October 1604, when the Jesuit Father Pierre Coton requested his General Superior Claudio Acquaviva to send two missionaries to Terre-Neuve.\nDuring the French colonization of New France in the 17th century, Jesuits played an active role in North America. Samuel de Champlain established the foundations of the French colony at Qu\u00e9bec in 1608. The native tribes that inhabited modern day Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, and the areas around Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay were the Montagnais, the Algonquins, and the Huron. Champlain believed that these had souls to be saved, so in 1614 he obtained the Recollects, a reform branch of the Franciscans in France, to convert the native inhabitants.\nIn 1624, the French Recollects realized the magnitude of their task and sent a delegate to France to invite the Society of Jesus to help with this mission. The invitation was accepted, and Jesuits Jean de Br\u00e9beuf, \u00c9nemond Mass\u00e9, and Charles Lalemant arrived in Quebec in 1625. Lalemant is considered to have been the first author of one of the \"Jesuit Relations of New France\", which chronicled their evangelization during the 17th century.\nThe Jesuits became involved in the Huron mission in 1626 and lived among the Huron peoples. Br\u00e9beuf learned the native language and created the first Huron language dictionary. Outside conflict forced the Jesuits to leave New France in 1629 when Quebec was surrendered to the English. In 1632, Quebec was returned to the French under the Treaty of Saint Germain-en-Laye and the Jesuits returned to the Huron territory. After a series of epidemics of European-introduced diseases beginning in 1634, some Huron began to mistrust the Jesuits and accused them of being sorcerers casting spells from their books.\nIn 1639, Jesuit Jerome Lalemant decided that the missionaries among the Hurons needed a local residence and established Sainte-Marie near present-day Midland, Ontario, which was meant to be a replica of European society. It became the Jesuit headquarters and an important part of Canadian history. Throughout most of the 1640s the Jesuits had modest success, establishing five chapels in Huronia and baptizing more than one thousand Huron out of a population, which may have exceeded 20,000 before the epidemics of the 1630s. However, the Iroquois of New York, rivals of the Hurons, grew jealous of the Hurons' wealth and control of the fur trade system and attacked Huron villages in 1648. They killed missionaries and burned villages, and the Hurons scattered. Both de Br\u00e9beuf and Gabriel Lalemant were tortured and killed in the Iroquois raids. For this, they have been canonized as martyrs in the Catholic Church.\nThe Jesuit Paul Ragueneau burned down Sainte-Marie, instead of allowing the Iroquois the satisfaction of destroying it. By late June 1649, the French and some Christian Hurons built Sainte-Marie II on Christian Island (Isle de Saint-Joseph). Facing starvation, lack of supplies, and constant threats of Iroquois attack, the small Sainte-Marie II was abandoned in June 1650. The remaining Christian Hurons and Jesuits departed for Quebec and Ottawa. As a result of the Iroquois raids and outbreak of disease, many missionaries, traders, and soldiers died. Today, the Huron tribe, also known as the Wyandot, have a First Nations reserve in Quebec, Canada, and three major settlements in the United States.\nAfter the collapse of the Huron nation, the Jesuits undertook the task of converting the Iroquois, something they had attempted in 1642 with little success. In 1653, the Iroquois nation had a fallout with the Dutch. They then signed a peace treaty with the French and a mission was established. The Iroquois soon turned on the French again. In 1658, the Jesuits were having little success and were under constant threat of being tortured or killed. They continued their effort until 1687, when they abandoned their permanent posts in the Iroquois homeland.\nIn 1700, Jesuits turned to maintaining Quebec, Montreal, and Ottawa without establishing new posts. During the Seven Years' War, Quebec was captured by the British in 1759 and New France came under British control. The British barred the immigration of more Jesuits to New France. In 1763, only 21 Jesuits were stationed in New France. In 1773, only 11 Jesuits remained. In 1773, the British crown declared that the Society of Jesus in New France was dissolved.\nThe dissolution of the order left in place substantial estates and investments, amounting to an income of approximately \u00a35,000 a year. The Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec, later succeeded by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, assumed the task of allocating the funds to suitable recipients, chiefly schools.\nIn 1842, the Jesuit mission in Quebec was re-established. A number of Jesuit colleges were founded in the decades following. One of these colleges evolved into present-day Laval University.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the order is best known for its missions to the Native Americans in the early 17th century, its network of colleges and universities, and in Europe before 1773, its politically conservative role in the Catholic Counter Reformation.\nThe Society of Jesus, in the United States, is organized into geographic provinces, each of which being headed by a provincial superior. Today, there are four Jesuit provinces operating in the United States: the USA East, USA Central and Southern, USA Midwest, and USA West Provinces. At their height, there were ten provinces. Though there had been mergers in the past, a major reorganization of the provinces began in early 21st century, with the aim of consolidating into four provinces by 2020.\nEcuador.\nThe Church of the Society of Jesus (), known colloquially as , is a Jesuit church in Quito, Ecuador. It is among the best-known churches in Quito because of its large central nave, which is profusely decorated with gold leaf, gilded plaster and wood carvings. Inspired by two Roman Jesuit churches \u2013 the Chiesa del Ges\u00f9 (1580) and the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola (1650) \u2013 is one of the most significant works of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America and Quito's most ornate church.\nOver the 160 years of its construction, the architects of incorporated elements of four architectural styles. Baroque is the most prominent. Mud\u00e9jar (Moorish) influence is seen in the geometrical figures on the pillars. Churrigueresque characterizes much of the ornate decoration, especially in the interior walls. The Neoclassical style adorns the Chapel of Saint Mariana de Jes\u00fas, which was a winery in its early years.\nMexico.\nThe Jesuits in New Spain distinguished themselves in several ways. They had high standards for acceptance to the order and many years of training. They attracted the patronage of elite families whose sons they educated in rigorous newly founded Jesuit (\"colleges\"), including Colegio de San Pedro y San Pablo, Colegio de San Ildefonso, and the Colegio de San Francisco Javier, Tepozotlan. Those same elite families hoped that a son with a vocation to the priesthood would be accepted as a Jesuit. Jesuits were also zealous in evangelization of the indigenous, particularly on the northern frontiers.\nTo support their and members of the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits acquired landed estates that were run with the best-practices for generating income in that era. A number of these haciendas were donated by wealthy elites. The donation of a hacienda to the Jesuits was the spark igniting a conflict between 17th-century Bishop Don Juan de Palafox of Puebla and the Jesuit \"colegio\" in that city. Since the Jesuits resisted paying the tithe on their estates, this donation effectively took revenue out of the church hierarchy's pockets by removing it from the tithe rolls.\nMany of Jesuit haciendas were huge, with Palafox asserting that just two colleges owned 300,000 head of sheep, whose wool was transformed locally in Puebla to cloth; six sugar plantations worth a million pesos and generating an income of 100,000 pesos. The immense Jesuit hacienda of Santa Luc\u00eda produced pulque, the alcoholic drink made from fermented agave sap whose main consumers were the lower classes and Indigenous peoples in Spanish cities. Although most haciendas had a free work force of permanent or seasonal labourers, the Jesuit haciendas in Mexico had a significant number of enslaved people of African descent.\nThe Jesuits operated their properties as an integrated unit with the larger Jesuit order; thus revenues from haciendas funded their . Jesuits did significantly expand missions to the Indigenous in the northern frontier area and a number were martyred, but the crown supported those missions. Mendicant orders that had real estate were less economically integrated, so that some individual houses were wealthy while others struggled economically. The Franciscans, who were founded as an order embracing poverty, did not accumulate real estate, unlike the Augustinians and Dominicans in Mexico.\nThe Jesuits engaged in conflict with the episcopal hierarchy over the question of payment of tithes, the ten percent tax on agriculture levied on landed estates for support of the church hierarchy from bishops and cathedral chapters to parish priests. Since the Jesuits were the largest religious order holding real estate, surpassing the Dominicans and Augustinians who had accumulated significant property, this was no small matter. They argued that they were exempt, due to special pontifical privileges. Bishop De Palafox took on the Jesuits over this matter and was so soundly defeated that he was recalled to Spain, where he became the bishop of the minor Diocese of Osma.\nAs elsewhere in the Spanish empire, the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767. Their haciendas were sold off and their \"colegios\" and missions in Baja California were taken over by other orders. Exiled Mexican-born Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero wrote an important history of Mexico while in Italy, a basis for creole patriotism. Andr\u00e9s Cavo also wrote an important text on Mexican history that Carlos Mar\u00eda de Bustamante published in the early 19th century. An earlier Jesuit who wrote about the history of Mexico was Diego Luis de Motezuma (1619\u201399), a descendant of the Aztec monarchs of Tenochtitlan. Motezuma's was completed in 1696. He \"aimed to show that Mexican emperors were a legitimate dynasty in the 17th-century in the European sense\".\nThe Jesuits were allowed to return to Mexico in 1840 when General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna was once more president of Mexico. Their re-introduction to Mexico was \"to assist in the education of the poorer classes and much of their property was restored to them\".\nNorthern Spanish America.\nIn 1571, the Jesuits arrived in the Viceroyalty of Peru. It was a key area of the Spanish Empire, with a large indigenous populations and huge deposits of silver at Potos\u00ed. A major figure in the first wave of Jesuits was Jos\u00e9 de Acosta (1540\u20131600), whose 1590 book introduced Europeans to Spain's American empire, via fluid prose and keen observation and explanation, based on 15 years in Peru and some time in New Spain (Mexico).\nThe Viceroy of Peru Don Francisco de Toledo urged the Jesuits to evangelize the Indigenous peoples of Peru, wanting to put them in charge of parishes, but Acosta adhered to the Jesuit position that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of bishops and to catechize in Indigenous parishes would bring them into conflict with the bishops. For that reason, the Jesuits in Peru focused on education of elite men rather than the indigenous populations.\nTo minister to newly arrived African slaves, Alonso de Sandoval (1576\u20131651) worked at the port of Cartagena de Indias. Sandoval wrote about this ministry in (1627), describing how he and his assistant Peter Claver, later canonized, met slave transport ships in the harbour, went below decks where 300\u2013600 slaves were chained, and gave physical aid with water, while introducing the Africans to Christianity. In his treatise, he did not condemn slavery or the ill-treatment of slaves, but sought to instruct fellow Jesuits to this ministry and describe how he catechized the slaves.\nRafael Ferrer was the first Jesuit of Quito to explore and found missions in the upper Amazon regions of South America from 1602 to 1610, which belonged to the Audiencia (high court) of Quito that was a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until it was transferred to the newly created Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. In 1602, Ferrer began to explore the Aguarico, Napo, and Mara\u00f1on rivers in the Sucumbios region, in what is today Ecuador and Peru. Between 1604 and 1605, he set up missions among the Cofane natives. In 1610, he was martyred by an apostate native.\nIn 1639, the Audiencia of Quito organized an expedition to renew its exploration of the Amazon river and the Quito Jesuit (Jesuita Quite\u00f1o) Crist\u00f3bal de Acu\u00f1a was a part of this expedition. In February 1639, the expedition disembarked from the Napo river. In December 1639, they arrived in what is today Par\u00e1, Brazil, on the banks of the Amazon river. In 1641, Acu\u00f1a published in Madrid a memoir of his expedition to the Amazon river entitled , which for academics became a fundamental reference on the Amazon region.\nIn 1637, the Jesuits Gaspar Cugia and Lucas de la Cueva from Quito began establishing the Mainas missions in territories on the banks of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River, around the Pongo de Manseriche region, close to the Spanish settlement of Borja. Between 1637 and 1652 there were 14 missions established along the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River and its southern tributaries, the Huallaga and the Ucayali rivers. Jesuit de la Cueva and Raimundo de Santacruz opened up two new routes of communication with Quito, through the Pastaza and Napo rivers.\nBetween 1637 and 1715, Samuel Fritz founded 38 missions along the length of the Amazon river, between the Napo and Negro rivers, that were called the Omagua Missions. Beginning in 1705, these missions were continually attacked by the Brazilian Bandeirantes. In 1768, the only Omagua mission that was left was San Joaquin de Omaguas, since it had been moved to a new location on the Napo river away from the Bandeirantes.\nIn the immense territory of Maynas, the Jesuits of Quito made contact with a number of indigenous tribes which spoke 40 different languages, and founded 173 Jesuit missions, encompassing 150,000 inhabitants. Because of the constant epidemics of smallpox and measles and warfare with other tribes and the Bandeirantes, the number of Jesuit Missions were reduced to 40 by 1744. The Jesuit missions offered the Indigenous people Christianity, iron tools, and a small degree of protection from the slavers and the colonists.\nIn exchange, the Indigenous had to submit to Jesuit discipline and adopt, at least superficially, a lifestyle foreign to their experience. The population of the missions was sustained by frequent expeditions into the jungle by Jesuits, soldiers, and Christian Indians to capture Indigenous people and force them to return or to settle in the missions. At the time when the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish America in 1767, the Jesuits registered 36 missions run by 25 Jesuits in the Audiencia of Quito \u2013 6 in the Napo and Aguarico Missions and 19 in the Pastaza and Iquitos Missions, with a population at 20,000 inhabitants.\nParaguay.\nThe Guaran\u00ed people of eastern Paraguay and neighboring Brazil and Argentina were in crisis in the early 17th century. Recurrent epidemics of European diseases had reduced their population by up 50 percent and the forced labor of the encomiendas by the Spanish and mestizo colonists had made virtual slaves of many. Franciscan missionaries began establishing missions called reductions in the 1580s. The first Jesuits arrived in Asunci\u00f3n in 1588 and founded their first mission (or reduction) of San Ignacio Guaz\u00fa in 1609. The objectives of the Jesuits were to make Christians of the Guaran\u00ed, impose European values and customs (which were regarded as essential to a Christian life), and isolate and protect the Guaran\u00ed from European colonists and slavers.\nIn addition to recurrent epidemics, the Guaran\u00ed were threatened by the slave-raiding Bandeirantes from Brazil, who captured natives and sold them as slaves to work in sugar plantations or as concubines and household servants. Having depleted native populations near S\u00e3o Paulo, they discovered the richly populated Jesuit missions. Initially, the missions had few defenses against the slavers and thousands of Guaran\u00ed were captured and enslaved.\nBeginning in 1631, the Jesuits moved their missions from the Guayr\u00e1 province (present day Brazil and Paraguay), about southwest to the three borders region of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. About 10,000 of 30,000 Guaran\u00ed in the missions chose to accompany the Jesuits. In 1641 and 1642, armed by the Jesuits, Guaran\u00ed armies defeated the Bandeirantes and ended the worst of the slave trade in their region. From this point on the Jesuit missions enjoyed growth and prosperity, punctuated by epidemics. At the peak of their importance in 1732, the Jesuits presided over 141,000 Guaran\u00ed (including a sprinkling of other peoples) who lived in about 30 missions.\nThe opinions of historians differ with regard to the Jesuit missions. The missions are much-romanticized with the Guaran\u00ed portrayed as innocent children of nature and the Jesuits as their wise and benevolent guides to an earthly utopia. \"Proponents...highlight that the Jesuits protected the Indians from exploitation and preserved the Guaran\u00ed language and other aspects of indigenous culture.\" \"By means of religion,\" wrote the 18th century philosopher Jean d'Alembert, \"the Jesuits established a monarchical authority in Paraguay, founded solely on their powers of persuasion and on their lenient methods of government. Masters of the country, they rendered happy the people under their sway.\" Voltaire called the Jesuit missions \"a triumph of humanity\".\nDetractors say that \"the Jesuits took away the Indians' freedom, forced them to radically change their lifestyle, physically abused them, and subjected them to disease.\" Moreover, the missions were inefficient and their economic success \"depended on subsidies from the Jesuit order, special protection and privileges from the Crown, and the lack of competition\" The Jesuits are portrayed as \"exploiters\" who \"sought to create a kingdom independent of the Spanish and Portuguese Crowns.\"\nThe Comunero Revolt (1721 to 1735) was a serious protest by Spanish and mestizo Paraguayans against the Jesuit missions. The residents of Paraguay violently protested the pro-Jesuit government of Paraguay, Jesuit control of Guaran\u00ed labor, and what they regarded as unfair competition for the market for products such as yerba mate. Although the revolt ultimately failed and the missions remained intact, the Jesuits were expelled from institutions they had created in Asunci\u00f3n. In 1756, the Guaran\u00ed protested the relocation of seven missions, fighting (and losing) a brief war with both the Spanish and Portuguese. The Jesuits were accused of inciting the Guaran\u00ed to rebel. In 1767, Charles III of Spain (1759\u201388) expelled the Jesuits from the Americas. The expulsion was part of an effort in the Bourbon Reforms to assert more Spanish control over its American colonies. In total, 78 Jesuits departed from the missions leaving behind 89,000 Guaran\u00ed in 30 missions.\nPhilippines.\nThe Jesuits were among the original five Catholic religious orders, alongside the Augustinians, Franciscans, Dominicans and Augustinian Recollects, who evangelized the Philippines in support of Spanish colonization. The Jesuits worked particularly hard in converting the Muslims of Mindanao and Luzon from Islam to Christianity, in which case, they were successful among the cities of Zamboanga and Manila. Zamboanga in particular was run like the Jesuit reductions in Paraguay and housed a large population of Peruvian and Latin American immigrants whereas Manila eventually became the capital of the Spanish colony. In addition to missionary work, the Jesuits compiled artifacts and chronicled the precolonial history and culture of the Philippines. Jesuit chronicler Pedro Chirino chronicled the history of the Kedatuan of Madja-as in Panay and its war against Rajah Makatunao of Sarawak as well as the histories of other Visayan kingdoms. Meanwhile, another Jesuit, Francisco Comb\u00e9s, chronicled the history of the Venice of the Visayas, the Kedatuan of Dapitan, its temporary conquest by the Sultanate of Ternate, its re-establishment in Mindanao and its alliance against the Sultanates of Ternate and Lanao as vassals under Christian Spain.\nThe Jesuits also established the first missions in Hindu-dominated Butuan, to convert it to Christianity. The Jesuits also founded many towns, farms, haciendas, educational institutes, libraries, and an observatory in the Philippines. The Jesuits were instrumental in the sciences of medicine, botany, zoology, astronomy and seismology. They trained the Philippines' second saint, Pedro Calungsod, who was martyred in Guam alongside the Jesuit priest Diego Luis de San Vitores.\nThe eventual temporary suppression of the Jesuits due their role in anti-colonial and anti-slavery revolts among the Paraguay reductions, alongside cooperation with the Recollects, allowed their vacated parishes to be put under control by the local nationalistic diocesan clergy; the martyrdom of three of them, the diocesan priests known as Gomburza, inspired Jos\u00e9 Rizal (also Jesuit-educated upon the restoration of the order), who became the Philippines' national hero. He successfully started the Philippine Revolution against Spain.\nThe Jesuits largely discredited the Freemasons, who claimed responsibility for the American and French Revolutions, by reverting Jose Rizal from Freemasonry back to Catholicism. They argued that since the Philippine Revolution was inspired by the allegedly Masonic ideals behind the French and American revolutions, the French and American Freemasons themselves betrayed their own founding ideals when the American Freemasons annexed the Philippines and killed Filipinos in the Philippine-American War and the French Freemasons assented to the Treaty of Paris (1898), this is compounded by the fact that American Freemason lodges dismissed the Philippine Revolutionary Freemason lodges as \"irregular\" and illegitimate. For the remainder of this period, Philippine Freemasonry was subservient to the Grand Lodge of California.\nIn 1953, after being expelled from China by the Communists, the Jesuits relocated their organization's nexus in Asia from China to the Philippines and brought along a sizeable Chinese diaspora. The Jesuits play a pivotal role in the nation-building of the Philippines with its various Ateneos and educational institutes training the country's intellectual elites.\nColonial Brazil.\nTom\u00e9 de Sousa, first Governor General of Brazil, brought the first group of Jesuits to the colony. The Jesuits were officially supported by the King, who instructed Tom\u00e9 de Sousa to give them all the support needed to Christianize the indigenous peoples.\nThe first Jesuits, guided by Manuel da N\u00f3brega, Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro, Leonardo Nunes, and later Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta, established the first Jesuit missions in Salvador and in S\u00e3o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, the settlement that gave rise to the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. N\u00f3brega and Anchieta were instrumental in the defeat of the French colonists of France Antarctique by managing to pacify the Tamoio natives, who had previously fought the Portuguese. The Jesuits took part in the foundation of the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1565.\nThe success of the Jesuits in converting the Indigenous peoples is linked to their efforts to understand the native cultures, especially their languages. The first grammar of the Tupi language was compiled by Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta and printed in Coimbra in 1595. The Jesuits often gathered the natives in communities (the Jesuit reductions), where the natives worked for the community and were evangelized.\nThe Jesuits had frequent disputes with other colonists who wanted to enslave the natives. The action of the Jesuits saved many natives from being enslaved by Europeans, but also disturbed their ancestral way of life and inadvertently helped spread infectious diseases against which the natives had no natural defenses. Slave labor and trade were essential for the economy of Brazil and other American colonies, and the Jesuits usually did object to the enslavement of African peoples, criticized the conditions of slavery. In cases where individual Jesuit priests criticized the institution of African slavery, they were censored and sent back to Europe.\nSuppression and restoration.\nThe suppression of the Jesuits alienated the colonial empires from the natives they governed in the Americas and Asia, as the Jesuits were active protectors of native rights against the colonial empires. With the suppression of the Order, the profitable Jesuit reductions which gave wealth and protection to natives were sequestered by royal authorities and the natives enslaved. Faced with this suppression; the natives, mestizos, and creoles were galvanized into starting the Latin American Wars of Independence. The suppression of the Jesuits in Portugal, France, the Two Sicilies, Parma, and the Spanish Empire by 1767 was deeply troubling to Pope Clement XIII, the society's defender. On 21 July 1773 his successor, Pope Clement XIV, issued the papal brief , decreeing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Having further considered that the said Company of Jesus can no longer produce those abundant fruits, ... in the present case, we are determining upon the fate of a society classed among the mendicant orders, both by its institute and by its privileges; after a mature deliberation, we do, out of our certain knowledge, and the fulness of our apostolical power, suppress and abolish the said company: we deprive it of all activity whatever. ...And to this end a member of the regular clergy, recommendable for his prudence and sound morals, shall be chosen to preside over and govern the said houses; so that the name of the Company shall be, and is, for ever extinguished and suppressed.\u2014\u200a\nThe suppression was carried out on political grounds in all countries except Prussia for a time, and Russia, where Catherine the Great had forbidden its promulgation. Because millions of Catholics (including many Jesuits) lived in the Polish provinces recently part-annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, the Society was able to maintain its continuity and carry on its work all through the stormy period of suppression. Subsequently, Pope Pius VI granted formal permission for the continuation of the society in Russia and Poland, with Stanis\u0142aw Czerniewicz elected superior of the province in 1782. He was followed by Gabriel Lenkiewicz, Franciszek Kareu and Gabriel Gruber until 1805, all elected locally as Temporary Vicars General. Pope Pius VII had resolved during his captivity in France to restore the Jesuits universally, and on his return to Rome he did so without much delay. On 7 August 1814, with the bull , he reversed the suppression of the society, and therewith another Polish Jesuit, Tadeusz Brzozowski, who had been elected as superior in Russia in 1805, acquired universal jurisdiction. On his death in 1820 the Jesuits were expelled from Russia by tsar Alexander I.\nThe period following the Restoration of the Jesuits in 1814 was marked by tremendous growth, as evidenced by the large number of Jesuit colleges and universities established during the 19th century. During this time in the United States, 22 of the society's 28 universities were founded or taken over by the Jesuits. It has been suggested that the experience of suppression had served to heighten orthodoxy among the Jesuits. While this claim is debatable, Jesuits were generally supportive of papal authority within the church, and some members became associated with the Ultramontanist movement and the declaration of papal infallibility in 1870.\nIn Switzerland, the constitution was modified and Jesuits were banished in 1848, following the defeat of the Sonderbund Catholic defence alliance. The ban was lifted on 20 May 1973, when 54.9 per cent of voters accepted a referendum modifying the constitution.\nEarly 20th century.\nIn the Constitution of Norway from 1814, a relic from the earlier anti-Catholic laws of Denmark\u2013Norway, Paragraph 2, known as the Jesuit clause, originally read: \"The Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State. Those inhabitants, who confess thereto, are bound to raise their children to the same. Jesuits and monastic orders are not permitted. Jews are still prohibited from entry to the Realm.\" Jews were first allowed into the realm in 1851 after the famous Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland had campaigned for this permission. Monastic orders were permitted in 1897, but the ban on Jesuits was only lifted in 1956.\nRepublican Spain in the 1930s passed laws banning the Jesuits on grounds that they were obedient to a power different from the state. Pope Pius XI wrote about this: \"It was an expression of a soul deeply hostile to God and the Catholic religion, to have disbanded the Religious Orders that had taken a vow of obedience to an authority different from the legitimate authority of the State. In this way it was sought to do away with the Society of Jesus \u2013 which can well glory in being one of the soundest auxiliaries of the \"Chair of Saint Peter\" \u2013 with the hope, perhaps, of then being able with less difficulty to overthrow in the near future, the Christian faith and morale in the heart of the Spanish nation, which gave to the Church of God the grand and glorious figure of Ignatius Loyola.\"\nPost-Vatican II.\nThe 20th century witnessed both growth and decline of the order. Following a trend within the Catholic priesthood at large, Jesuit numbers peaked in the 1950s and have declined steadily since. Meanwhile, the number of Jesuit institutions has grown considerably, due in large part to a post\u2013Vatican II focus on the establishment of Jesuit secondary schools in inner-city areas and an increase in voluntary lay groups inspired in part by the \"Spiritual Exercises\". Among the notable Jesuits of the 20th century, John Courtney Murray was called one of the \"architects of the Second Vatican Council\" and drafted what eventually became the council's endorsement of religious freedom, .\nIn Latin America, the Jesuits had significant influence in the development of liberation theology, a movement that was controversial in the Catholic community after the negative assessment of it by Pope John Paul II in 1984.\nUnder Superior General Pedro Arrupe, social justice and the preferential option for the poor emerged as dominant themes of the work of the Jesuits. When Arrupe was paralyzed by a stroke in 1981, Pope John Paul II, not entirely pleased with the progressive turn of the Jesuits, took the unusual step of appointing the venerable and aged Paolo Dezza for an interim to oversee \"the authentic renewal of the Church\", instead of the progressive American priest Vincent O'Keefe whom Arrupe had preferred. In 1983, John Paul gave leave for the Jesuits to appoint Peter Hans Kolvenbach as a successor to Arrupe.\nOn 16 November 1989, six Jesuit priests (Ignacio Ellacur\u00eda, Segundo Montes, Ignacio Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3, Joaquin L\u00f3pez y L\u00f3pez, Juan Ramon Moreno, and Amado L\u00f3pez), Elba Ramos their housekeeper, and Celia Marisela Ramos her daughter, were murdered by the Salvadoran military on the campus of the University of Central America in San Salvador, El Salvador, because they had been labeled as subversives by the government. The assassinations galvanized the society's peace and justice movements, including annual protests at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States, where several of the assassins had been trained under US government sponsorship.\nIn February 2001, the Jesuit priest Avery Dulles, an internationally known author, lecturer, and theologian, was created a cardinal of the Catholic Church by Pope John Paul II. The son of former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Avery Dulles was long known for his carefully reasoned argumentation and fidelity to the teaching office of the church. An author of 22 books and over 700 theological articles, Dulles died in December 2008 at Fordham University, where he had taught for twenty years as the Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society. He was, at his passing, one of ten Jesuit cardinals in the Catholic Church.\nIn 2002, Boston College president and Jesuit priest William P. Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program as a means of moving the church \"from crisis to renewal\". The initiative has provided the society with a platform for examining issues brought about by the worldwide Catholic sex abuse cases, including the priesthood, celibacy, sexuality, women's roles, and the role of the laity.\nIn April 2005, Thomas J. Reese, editor of the American Jesuit weekly magazine \"America\", resigned at the request of the society. The move was widely published in the media as the result of pressure from the Vatican, following years of criticism by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on articles touching subjects such as HIV/AIDS, religious pluralism, homosexuality, and the right of life for the unborn. Following his resignation, Reese spent a year-long sabbatical at Santa Clara University before being named a fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center in Washington, D.C., and later senior analyst for the \"National Catholic Reporter\". President Barack Obama appointed him to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2014 and again in 2016.\nIn February 2006, Peter Hans Kolvenbach informed members of the Society of Jesus that, with the consent of Pope Benedict XVI, he intended to step down as superior general in 2008, the year he would turn 80.\nOn 22 April 2006, during the Feast of Our Lady, Mother of the Society of Jesus, Pope Benedict XVI greeted thousands of Jesuits on pilgrimage to Rome, and took the opportunity to thank God \"for having granted to your Company the gift of men of extraordinary sanctity and of exceptional apostolic zeal such as St Ignatius of Loyola, St Francis Xavier, and Blessed Peter Faber\". He said \"St Ignatius of Loyola was above all a man of God, who gave the first place of his life to God, to his greater glory and his greater service. He was a man of profound prayer, which found its center and its culmination in the daily Eucharistic Celebration.\"\nIn May 2006, Benedict XVI wrote a letter to Kolvenbach on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Pope Pius XII's encyclical , on devotion to the Sacred Heart, because the Jesuits have always been \"extremely active in the promotion of this essential devotion\". In his 3 November 2006 visit to the Pontifical Gregorian University, Benedict XVI cited the university as \"one of the greatest services that the Society of Jesus carries out for the universal Church\".\nIn January 2008, the 35th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus convened and elected Adolfo Nicol\u00e1s as the new superior general on 19 January 2008. In a letter to the order, Benedict XVI wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As my Predecessors have said to you on various occasions, the Church needs you, relies on you and continues to turn to you with trust, particularly to reach those physical and spiritual places which others do not reach or have difficulty in reaching. Paul VI's words remain engraved on your hearts: \"Wherever in the Church, even in the most difficult and extreme fields, at the crossroads of ideologies, in the social trenches, there has been and there is confrontation between the burning exigencies of man and the perennial message of the Gospel, here also there have been, and there are, Jesuits\".\u2014\u200a\nIn 2013, the Jesuit cardinal Jorge Bergoglio became Pope Francis. Before he became pope, he had been appointed a bishop when he was in \"virtual estrangement from the Jesuits\" since he was seen as \"an enemy of liberation theology\" and viewed by others as \"still far too orthodox\". He was criticized for colluding with the Argentine junta, while biographers characterized him as working to save the lives of other Jesuits. As a Jesuit pope, he has stressed discernment over following rules, changing the culture of the clergy to steer away from clericalism and to move toward an ethic of service, i.e. to have the \"smell of sheep\", staying close to the people. After his papal election, Superior General Adolfo Nicol\u00e1s praised Pope Francis as a \"brother among brothers\".\nIn October 2016, the 36th General Congregation convened in Rome, convoked by Nicol\u00e1s, who had announced his intention to resign at age 80. On 14 October, the 36th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus elected Arturo Sosa, a Venezuelan, as its thirty-first superior general.\nIn 2016, the General Congregation that elected Arturo Sosa, asked him to complete the process of discerning Jesuit priorities for the time ahead. Sosa devised a plan that enlisted all Jesuits and their lay collaborators in the process of discernment over a 16-month period. In February 2019, he presented the results of the discernment, a list of four priorities for Jesuit ministries for the next ten years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPope Francis gave his approval to these priorities, saying that they were in harmony with the church's present priorities and with the programmatic letter of his pontificate, .\nIgnatian spirituality.\nThe spirituality practiced by the Jesuits, called Ignatian spirituality, ultimately based on the Catholic faith and the gospels, is drawn from the \"Constitutions\", \"The Letters\", and \"Autobiography\", and most specially from Ignatius' \"Spiritual Exercises\", whose purpose is \"to conquer oneself and to regulate one's life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment\". The \"Exercises\" culminate in a contemplation whereby one develops a facility to \"find God in all things\".\nFormation.\nThe formation (training) of Jesuits seeks to prepare men spiritually, academically, and practically for the ministries they will be called to offer the church and world. Ignatius was strongly influenced by the Renaissance, and he wanted Jesuits to be able to offer whatever ministries were most needed at any given moment and, especially, to be ready to respond to missions (assignments) from the pope. Formation for priesthood normally takes between eight and fourteen years, depending on the man's background and previous education. Final vows are taken several years after that, making Jesuit formation among the longest of any of the religious orders.\nGovernance of the society.\nThe society is headed by a Superior General, with the formal title \"Praepositus Generalis\", Latin for \"provost-general\", more commonly called Father General. He is elected by the General Congregation for life or until he resigns. He is confirmed by the pope and has absolute authority in running the Society. The Superior General of the Jesuits is the Venezuelan Arturo Sosa, who was elected in October 2016.\nThe Father General is assisted by \"assistants\". Four are \"assistants for provident care\" and serve as general advisors and a sort of inner council. Regional assistants head an \"assistancy\", which is either a geographic area, for instance the North American Assistancy, or an area of ministry, such as higher education. The assistants normally reside with the Father General in Rome and along with others form an advisory council to the General. A vicar general and secretary of the society run day-to-day administration. The General is required to have an admonitor, a confidential advisor whose task is to warn the General honestly and confidentially when he might be acting imprudently or contrary to the church's magisterium. The central staff of the General is known as the Curia.\nThe society is divided into geographic areas called provinces. Each is headed by a Provincial Superior, formally called Father Provincial, chosen by the Superior General. He has authority over all Jesuits and ministries in his area, and is assisted by a \"socius\" who acts as a sort of secretary and chief of staff. With the approval of the Superior General, the Provincial Superior appoints a novice master and a master of tertians to oversee formation, and rectors of local communities of Jesuits. For better cooperation and apostolic efficacy on each continent, the Jesuit provinces are grouped into six Jesuit Conferences worldwide.\nEach Jesuit community within a province is normally headed by a rector. He is assisted by a \"minister\", from the Latin word for \"servant\", a priest who helps oversee the community's day-to-day needs.\nThe General Congregation is a meeting of all of the assistants, provincials, and additional representatives who are elected by the professed Jesuits of each province. It meets irregularly and rarely, normally to elect a new superior general or to take up some major policy issues for the order. The Superior General meets more regularly with smaller councils composed of just the provincials.\nStatistics.\nAs of 2012[ [update]], the Jesuits formed the largest single religious order of priests and brothers in the Catholic Church. The Jesuits have experienced a decline in numbers in recent decades. In 2022, the society had 14,439 members - 10,432 priests, 837 brothers, 2,587 scholastics, and 583 novices. This represents a 59% percent decline since the Second Vatican Council of 1965, when the society had a total membership of 36,038, of which 20,301 were priests. This decline is most pronounced in Europe and the Americas, with relatively modest membership gains occurring in Asia and Africa.\nIn 2016, according to Patrick Reilly of the \"National Catholic Register\", there seems to be no \"Pope Francis effect\" in counteracting the fall of vocations among the Jesuits. In 2019, twenty-eight novices took first vows in the Jesuits in the United States and Haiti. In September 2019, the superior general of the Jesuits, Arturo Sosa, estimated that by 2034 the number would decrease to about 10,000 Jesuits, with a much younger average age than in 2019, and with a shift away from Europe and into Latin America, Africa, and India. In 2008, their average age was 57.3 years: 63.4 years for priests, 29.9 years for scholastics, and 65.5 years for brothers.\nThe Superior General of the Jesuits is Arturo Sosa. The society is characterized by its ministries in the fields of missionary work, human rights, social justice and, most notably, higher education. It operates colleges and universities in countries around the world and is particularly active in the Philippines and India. In the United States, the Jesuits have historical ties to 27 colleges and universities and 61 high schools. The degree to which the Jesuits are involved in the administration of each institution varies. In September 2018, 15 of the 27 Jesuit universities in the US had non-Jesuit lay presidents.\nAccording to a 2014 article in \"The Atlantic\", \"the number of Jesuit priests who are active in everyday operations at the schools isn't nearly as high as it once was\". Worldwide it runs 322 secondary schools and 172 colleges and\u00a0universities. A typical conception of the mission of a Jesuit school will often contain such concepts as proposing Christ as the model of human life, the pursuit of excellence in teaching and learning, lifelong spiritual and intellectual growth, and training men and women for others.\nHabit and dress.\nJesuits do not have an official habit. The society's \"Constitutions\" gives the following instructions: \"The clothing too should have three characteristics: first, it should be proper; second, conformed to the usage of the country of residence; and third, not contradictory to the poverty we profess.\" (Const. 577)\nThe traditional Jesuit-style cassock, called a \"soutane\" is similar to a robe which is wrapped around the body and was tied with a cincture, rather than the customary buttoned front cassock worn by diocesan priests. A tuftless biretta (only diocesan clergy wore tufts) and a ferraiolo (cape) completed the look.\nToday, most Jesuits in the United States wear the clerical collar and black clothing of diocesan priests while most Jesuits in Europe are dressed in civilian clothes.\nControversies.\nSlavery.\nJesuit scholar Andrew Dial has calculated that the Jesuits owned more than 20,000 slaves worldwide in 1760, the great majority of them in the Americas. The Jesuits in some places protected the indigenous people of the Americas from slavers, notably the Guaran\u00ed in South America, but in other places they enslaved indigenous people after \"just wars\" in which indigenous people who resisted European colonization were defeated.\nThe Jesuits also participated in the Atlantic slave trade, working thousands of African slaves on their large plantations scattered throughout the Americas. Antoine Lavalette, a slave-owning French Jesuit in Martinique, accumulated large debts which he was unable to pay, which led to the banning of the Jesuits in France in 1764.\nIn the United States, tobacco plantations utilizing African-American slave labor in Maryland and other states supported Jesuit institutions such as Georgetown University, from which were infamously sold 272 slaves in 1838.\nIn the 16th century, Jesuits were also complicit in the Portuguese trade in enslaved East Asians. In other parts of Europe, slaves were probably employed in Jesuit schools and institutions.\nThe Jesuits justified their ownership of slaves and participation in the slave trade as a means of converting slaves to Catholicism. \"Enslaved people...were a captive audience for evangelization.\"\nPower-seeking.\nThe \"Monita Secreta\" (Secret Instructions of the Jesuits), published in 1612 and in 1614 in Krak\u00f3w, is alleged to have been written by Claudio Acquaviva, the fifth general of the society, but was probably written by former Jesuit Jerome Zahorowski. It purports to describe the methods to be adopted by Jesuits for the acquisition of greater power and influence for the society and for the Catholic Church. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" states the book is a forgery, fabricated to ascribe a sinister reputation to the Society of Jesus.\nPolitical intrigue.\nThe Jesuits were temporarily banished from France in 1594 after a man named Jean Ch\u00e2tel tried to assassinate the king of France, Henri IV. Under questioning, Ch\u00e2tel revealed that he had been educated by the Jesuits of the Coll\u00e8ge de Clermont. The Jesuits were accused of inspiring Ch\u00e2tel's attack. Two of his former teachers were exiled and a third was hanged. The Coll\u00e8ge de Clermont was closed, and the building was confiscated. The Jesuits were banned from France, although this ban was quickly lifted and the school eventually reopened.\nIn England, Henry Garnet, one of the leading English Jesuits, was hanged for misprision of treason because of his knowledge of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot. The Plot was the attempted assassination of James VI and I, his family, and most of the Protestant aristocracy in a single attack, by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Another Jesuit, Oswald Tesimond, managed to escape arrest for his involvement in this plot.\nCasuistic justification.\nJesuits have been accused of using casuistry to obtain justifications for unjustifiable actions (cf. formulary controversy and , by Blaise Pascal). Hence, the Concise Oxford Dictionary of the English language lists \"equivocating\" as a secondary denotation of the word \"Jesuit\". Modern critics of the Society of Jesus include Avro Manhattan, Alberto Rivera, and Malachi Martin, the latter being the author of \"The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church\" (1987).\nExclusion of those of Jewish or Muslim ancestry.\nAlthough in the first 30 years of the existence of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuits who were \"conversos\" (Catholic-convert Jews and Muslims and their descendants), an anti-\"converso\" faction led to the \"Decree de genere\" (1593) which proclaimed that either Jewish or Muslim ancestry, no matter how distant, was an insurmountable impediment for admission to the Society of Jesus. This new rule was contrary to the original wishes of Ignatius who \"said that he would take it as a special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage\". The 16th-century \"Decree de genere\" was repealed in 1946.\nBylaws requiring \"blood purity\" became common across Early Modern Spain and Portugal.\nTheological debates.\nWithin the Catholic Church, there has existed a sometimes tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See, due to questioning of official church teaching and papal directives, such as those on abortion, birth control, women deacons, homosexuality, and liberation theology. At the same time, Jesuits have been appointed to prominent doctrinal and theological positions in the church; under Pope Benedict XVI, Archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer was Secretary and later, under Pope Francis, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\nNazi persecution.\nThe Catholic Church faced persecution in Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler, though baptized and confirmed in the Catholic faith and raised in a Catholic household, was anticlerical and had particular disdain for the Jesuits. According to John Pollard, the Jesuits' \"ethos represented the most intransigent opposition to the philosophy of Nazism\", and so the Nazis considered them as one of their most dangerous enemies. A Jesuit college in the city of Innsbruck served as a center for anti-Nazi resistance and was closed down by the Nazis in 1938.\nJesuits were a target for Gestapo persecution, and many Jesuit priests were deported to death camps. Jesuits made up the largest contingent of clergy imprisoned in the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp. Vincent Lapomarda lists some 30 Jesuits as having died at Dachau. Of the 152 Jesuits murdered by the Nazis across Europe, 43 died in the death camps and an additional 27 died from captivity or its results.\nThe Superior General of Jesuits at the outbreak of war was W\u0142odzimierz Led\u00f3chowski, a Pole. The Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland was particularly severe. Lapomarda wrote that Led\u00f3chowski helped \"stiffen the general attitude of the Jesuits against the Nazis\" and that he permitted Vatican Radio to carry on its campaign against the Nazis in Poland. Vatican Radio was run by the Jesuit Filippo Soccorsi and spoke out against Nazi oppression, particularly with regard to Poland and to Vichy-French antisemitism.\nSeveral Jesuits were prominent in the small German Resistance. Among the central membership of the Kreisau Circle of the Resistance were the Jesuit priests Augustin R\u00f6sch, Alfred Delp, and Lothar K\u00f6nig. The Bavarian Jesuit Provincial, Augustin R\u00f6sch, ended the war on death row for his role in the July Plot to overthrow Hitler. Another non-military German Resistance group, dubbed the \"Frau Solf Tea Party\" by the Gestapo, included the Jesuit priest Friedrich Erxleben. The German Jesuit Robert Leiber acted as intermediary between Pius XII and the German Resistance.\nAmong the Jesuit victims of the Nazis, Germany's Rupert Mayer has been beatified. Mayer was a Bavarian Jesuit who clashed with the Nazis as early as 1923. Continuing his critique following Hitler's rise to power, Mayer was imprisoned in 1939 and sent to Sachsenhausen death camp. As his health declined, the Nazis feared the creation of a martyr and sent him to the Abbey of Ettal in 1940. There he continued to give sermons and lectures against the evils of the Nazi r\u00e9gime, until his death in 1945.\nRescue efforts during the Holocaust.\nIn his history of the heroes of the Holocaust, the Jewish historian Martin Gilbert notes that in every country under German occupation, priests played a major part in rescuing Jews, and that the Jesuits were one of the Catholic Orders that hid Jewish children in monasteries and schools to protect them from the Nazis.\nFourteen Jesuit priests have been formally recognized by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, for risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust of World War II: Roger Braun (1910\u20131981) of France, Pierre Chaillet (1900\u20131972) of France, Jean-Baptist De Coster (1896\u20131968) of Belgium, Jean Fleury (1905\u20131982) of France, Emile Gessler (1891\u20131958) of Belgium, Jean-Baptiste Janssens (1889\u20131964) of Belgium, Alphonse Lambrette (1884\u20131970) of Belgium, Emile Planckaert (1906\u20132006) of France, Jacob Raile (1894\u20131949) of Hungary, Henri Revol (1904\u20131992) of France, Adam Sztark (1907\u20131942) of Poland, Henri Van Oostayen (1906\u20131945) of Belgium, Ioannes Marangas (1901\u20131989) of Greece, and Raffaele de Chantuz Cubbe (1904\u20131983) of Italy.\nSeveral other Jesuits are known to have rescued or given refuge to Jews during that period. A plaque commemorating the 152 Jesuit priests who gave their lives during the Holocaust was installed in April 2007 at the Jesuits' Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Missouri, United States.\nIn science.\nBetween the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, the teaching of science in Jesuit schools, as laid down in the \"Ratio atque Institutio Studiorum Societatis Iesu\" (\"The Official Plan of studies for the Society of Jesus\") of 1599, was almost entirely based on the works of Aristotle.\nThe Jesuits, nevertheless, have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to fields from cosmology to seismology, the latter of which has been described as \"the Jesuit science\". The Jesuits have been described as \"the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century\".\nAccording to Jonathan Wright in his book \"God's Soldiers\", by the eighteenth century the Jesuits had \"contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes \u2013 to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics, and electricity. They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on Jupiter's surface, the Andromeda nebula, and Saturn's rings. They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon affected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light.\"\nThe Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy. One modern historian writes that in late Ming courts, the Jesuits were \"regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography\". The Society of Jesus introduced, according to Thomas Woods, \"a substantial body of scientific knowledge and a vast array of mental tools for understanding the physical universe, including the Euclidean geometry that made planetary motion comprehensible\".\nNotable members.\nJesuits include missionaries, educators, scientists, artists, philosophers, and a pope. Among many distinguished early Jesuits was Francis Xavier, a missionary to Asia who converted more people to Catholicism than anyone before, and Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church. Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta and Manuel da N\u00f3brega, founders of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, were Jesuit priests. Another famous Jesuit was Jean de Br\u00e9beuf, a French missionary who was martyred during the 17th century in New France, the part that became Ontario, in Canada.\nIn Spanish America, Jos\u00e9 de Acosta wrote a major work on early Peru and New Spain with important material on indigenous peoples. In South America, Peter Claver was notable for his mission to African slaves, building on the work of Alonso de Sandoval. Francisco Javier Clavijero was expelled from New Spain during the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1767 and wrote an important history of Mexico during his exile in Italy. Eusebio Kino is renowned in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, then called the Pimer\u00eda Alta. He founded numerous missions and served as the peace-bringer between the tribes and the government of New Spain. Antonio Ruiz de Montoya was an important missionary in the Jesuit reductions of Paraguay.\nBaltasar Graci\u00e1n was a 17th-century Spanish Jesuit and baroque prose writer and philosopher. He was born in Belmonte, near Calatayud (Aragon). His writings, particularly \"El Critic\u00f3n\" (1651\u201357) and \"Or\u00e1culo Manual y Arte de Prudencia\" (\"The Art of Prudence\", 1647) were lauded by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.\nIn Scotland, John Ogilvie, a Jesuit, is the nation's only post-Reformation saint.\nGerard Manley Hopkins was one of the first English poets to use sprung verse. Anthony de Mello was a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist who became recognized for his books which introduced Westerners to the East Indian traditions of spirituality.\nDorothy Lawson was a recusant and patroness of the Society of Jesus, who met yearly at her home to discuss the mission in England after the English Reformation.\nCardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina was elected by conclave as Pope Francis on 13 March 2013, the first Jesuit to be elected pope. He served until his death in April 2025.\nThe Feast of All Jesuit Saints and Blesseds is celebrated on 5 November.\nInstitutions.\nEducational institutions.\nAlthough the work of the Jesuits today embraces a wide variety of apostolates, ministries, and civil occupations, they are probably most well known for their educational work, on all continents. Since the inception of the order, Jesuits have been teachers. Besides serving on the faculty of Catholic and secular schools, the Jesuits are the Catholic religious order with the second highest number of schools which they run: 168 tertiary institutions in 40 countries and 324 secondary schools in 55 countries. The Brothers of the Christian Schools have over 560 Lasallian educational institutions. They also run elementary schools, at which they are less likely to teach. Many of the schools are named after Francis Xavier and other prominent Jesuits.\nAfter the Second Vatican Council, Jesuit schools had become a very controversial place of instruction as they abandoned teaching traditional Catholic education with things such as the mastery of Latin and the Baltimore Catechism. Jesuit schools replaced classic theological instruction from people like Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure to people like Karl Rahner and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, which was a very controversial move at the time.\nJesuit educational institutions aim to promote the values of Eloquentia Perfecta. This is a Jesuit tradition that focuses on cultivating a person as a whole, as one learns to speak and write for the common good.\nSocial and development institutions.\nJesuits have become increasingly involved in works directed primarily toward social and economic development for the poor and marginalized. Included in this would be research, training, advocacy, and action for human development, as well as direct services. Most Jesuit schools have an office that fosters social awareness and social service in the classroom and through extracurricular programs, usually detailed on their websites. The Jesuits also run over 500 notable or stand-alone social or economic development centres in 56 countries around the world.\nPublications.\nJesuits are also known for their involvement in publications. Most Jesuit colleges and universities have their own presses which produce a variety of books, book series, textbooks, and academic publications.\n\"La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica\", a periodical produced in Rome by the Jesuits, has often been used as a semi-official platform for popes and officials of the Roman Curia to float ideas for discussion or hint at future statements or positions, though authorship is limited to Jesuits.\n\"The Way\" is an international journal of contemporary Christian spirituality published by the British Jesuits.\nIn the United States of America, \"America\" magazine has long had a prominent place in Catholic intellectual circles. Ignatius Press, founded by a Jesuit, is an independent publisher of Catholic books, most of which are of the popular academic or lay-intellectual variety.\nManresa is a review of Ignatian spirituality published in Madrid, Spain.\nIn Australia, the Jesuits produce a number of magazines, including \"Eureka Street\", \"Madonna\", \"Australian Catholics\", and \"Province Express\".\nIn Germany, the Jesuits publish the journal and the related publication \"Weltweit\" that describes their international work, the Jesuitenmission.\nIn Sweden the Catholic cultural magazine \"Signum\", edited by the Newman Institute, covers a broad spectrum of issues concerning faith, culture, research, and society. The printed version of \"Signum\" is published eight times per year.\nJesuit publishing is not limited to journals and books; they also produce digital content and podcasts to engage modern audiences. Many Jesuit provinces operate media ministries aimed at evangelization, education, and social dialogue. For instance, Jesuit Communications in India runs online platforms and short film projects that address contemporary moral and spiritual issues.\nJesuits in Canada and the U.S. have embraced video storytelling and podcasting, such as the popular \"Jesuitical\" podcast by America Media. These platforms reflect the Society's ongoing commitment to intellectual engagement and cultural dialogue in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is the author of the \"New York Times\"-bestselling Mitford novels, featuring Father Timothy Kavanagh, an Episcopal priest, and the fictional village of Mitford. Her most recent Mitford novel, \"My Beloved\", was released in October 2025.\nShe has been designated a lay Canon for the Arts in the Episcopal Diocese of Quincy (Illinois) by Keith Ackerman, Episcopal Bishop of Quincy, and in May 2000 she was awarded the Degree, Doctor of Humane Letters honoris causa by Nashotah House, a theological seminary in Nashotah, Wisconsin. {\u201cMore from Mitford\u201d Volume 4, Number 10, Fall 2000.} In 2015, she was awarded the Library of Virginia's Literary Lifetime Achievement Award.\nEarly life.\nJan Karon was born in the Blue Ridge foothills town of Lenoir, North Carolina as Janice Meredith Wilson. She was named after the novel \"Janice Meredith\". Before she was 4, her parents split up and left her with her maternal grandparents on a farm a few miles away in Hudson, North Carolina.\nHer mother Wanda, who was 15 at Jan's birth, went to Charlotte. Her father, Robert Wilson, joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. At age 12, Jan moved from Hudson to Charlotte, to rejoin her mother, who had married Toby Setzer and had two more children. She dropped out of school in ninth grade at age 14, and married Robert Freeland in South Carolina, where girls her age could do so legally. Freeland, who was five years older, worked at a Charlotte tire store, while Jan worked in a clothing store. At age 15, she gave birth to her only child, Candace Freeland.\nJan and Freeland's marriage was troubled from the beginning, and tragedy rocked it further. While Freeland was sitting in a car with one of his brothers and one or more friends, a gun was handed through the window and went off. The bullet punctured one of Robert Freeland's lungs and chipped his spine, nearly killing him and leaving him paralyzed. Jan was distraught, the marriage suffered, and she filed for divorce.\nCareer.\nJanice, age 18, was on her own with her daughter Candace. She took a receptionist job at Walter J. Klein Co., a Charlotte advertising agency. Bored with answering the phone, she submitted writing examples. Klein soon had her writing advertising copy. In her early 20s, Jan married Bill Orth, a Duke Power chemist. Orth was active with her in theater and the Unitarian Church. By the late 1960s, Jan and Orth were divorced, and she married a third time, to Arthur Karon, a clothing salesman, and became Jan Karon. Arthur moved his wife and her daughter to Berkeley, California, where they lived for three years.\nIn California, Karon practiced Judaism, but she did not convert from Christianity. Karon wanted to be a novelist, and tried all through the 1960s. When Karon's third marriage ended she returned to Charlotte and again worked in advertising. By 1985, Karon had moved to Raleigh and the McKinney &amp; Silver advertising agency, where she had worked in the late 1970s. Karon and Michael Winslow, a Mckinney designer, collaborated on a tourism campaign, interviewing artisans, musicians and others for print ads aimed at showing that North Carolina had other attractions besides theme parks and big hotels. One ad featured mountain musicians under the headline, \"The Best Place to Hear Old English Music Is 3,000 Miles West of London.\" The campaign, which ran in \"National Geographic\" and other magazines, won the 1987 Kelly Award, the print advertising equivalent of the Academy Award. Karon and Winslow split a $100,000 prize.\nIn 1988, Karon quit her job, traded her Mercedes for a used Toyota and moved to Blowing Rock, North Carolina. In Blowing Rock, Karon began writing Father Tim stories for the \"Blowing Rocket\" newspaper. An agent circulated Karon's fiction to publishers, but got only rejections. In 1994, Karon herself placed her work with a small religious publisher, which brought out a volume titled \"At Home in Mitford\". Karon kept writing, and employed her marketing skills to promote her book, writing press releases and cold-calling bookstores. But the publisher offered limited distribution and little marketing muscle of its own. Two more Mitford novels appeared. Sales remained modest. Then Karon's friend Mary Richardson, mother of Carolina Panthers' owner Jerry Richardson, showed \"At Home in Mitford\" to Nancy Olson, owner of Quail Ridge Books &amp; Music in Raleigh. Olson felt there was a large audience looking for clean, well-written fiction. She sent Karon's book to a New York agent friend, who got it to Carolyn Carlson, an editor at Viking Penguin and daughter of a Lutheran minister. Carlson faced opposition at Viking Penguin, a mainstream publisher unused to Christian fiction. But in 1996 the New York firm brought out Karon's first three titles as paperbacks. By the late 1990s, Karon's books were \"New York Times\" bestsellers.\nIn 2021 Karon founded The Mitford Museum in her former elementary school in Hudson, NC. The museum features family history as well as a wealth of information about her writing. Happy Endings Bookstore sells signed copies of her books along with Mitford-related items. The museum is open Wednesday-Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2000, Karon left Blowing Rock and moved to Albemarle County, Virginia, where she restored a historic 1816 home and 100 acre farm, Esmont Farm, built by Dr. Charles Cocke (who served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly before the American Civil War).\nWorks.\nChildren's books.\nSource:\nShort works.\n\"The Day Aunt Maude Left\" in \"Response\" 1.4 (1961)\nArchive.\nJan Karon's papers are held at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia, and regular additions are made to document Karon's new works.

{"id": "16094", "revid": "20726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16094", "title": "Joseph Haydn", "text": "Austrian composer (1732\u20131809)\nFranz Joseph Haydn ( ; ; 31 March 1732\u00a0\u2013 31 May 1809) was an Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the string quartet and piano trio. His contributions to musical form have led him to be called \"Father of the Symphony\" and \"Father of the String quartet\".\nHaydn arose from humble origins, the child of working people in a rural village. He established his career first by serving as a chorister at St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, then through an arduous period as a freelance musician. Eventually he found career success, spending much of his working life as music director for the wealthy Esterh\u00e1zy family at their palace of Eszterh\u00e1za in rural Hungary. Though he had his own orchestra there, it isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, \"forced to become original\". During this period his music circulated widely in publication, eventually making him the most celebrated composer in Europe. With the death of his patron Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy in 1790, Haydn was free to travel, and augmented his fame\u2014now as a performer before the public\u2014in both London and Vienna. The last years of his life (1803\u20131809) were spent in a state of debility, unable to compose due to poor health. He died in Vienna in 1809 at the age of 77.\nHaydn was a friend and mentor of Mozart, a teacher of Beethoven, and the elder brother of composer Michael Haydn.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nJoseph Haydn was born in Rohrau, Austria, a village that at that time stood on the border with Hungary. His father was Mathias Haydn, a wheelwright who also served as \"Marktrichter\", or marketplace supervisor. Haydn's mother Maria, n\u00e9e Koller, had worked as a cook in the palace of Count Harrach, the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Neither parent could read music; however, Mathias was an enthusiastic folk musician, who during the journeyman period of his career had taught himself to play the harp. According to Haydn's later reminiscences, his family was extremely musical, and they frequently sang together and with their neighbours.\nHaydn's parents had noticed that their son was musically gifted and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain serious musical training. It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in nearby Hainburg, that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician. Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg; he never again lived with his parents.\nLife in the Frankh household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry and humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing. However, he quickly profited from his musical training, and could soon play both harpsichord and violin; he also sang treble parts in the church choir.\nThere is reason to think that Haydn's singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739 he was brought to the attention of Georg Reutter the Younger, the director of music in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, who happened to be visiting Hainburg and was looking for new choirboys. Haydn passed his audition with Reutter, and after several months of further training moved to Vienna (1740), where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister.\nHaydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter's family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother Michael. The choirboys were instructed in Latin and other school subjects as well as voice, violin, and keyboard. Reutter was of little help to Haydn in the areas of music theory and composition, giving him only two lessons in his entire time as a chorister. However, since St. Stephen's was one of the leading musical centres in Europe, Haydn learned a great deal simply by serving as a professional musician there.\nLike Frankh before him, Reutter did not always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed. As he later told his biographer Albert Christoph Dies, Haydn was motivated to sing well, in hopes of gaining more invitations to perform before aristocratic audiences, where the singers were usually served refreshments.\nStruggles as a freelancer.\nBy 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts. Empress Maria Theresa herself complained to Reutter about his singing, calling it \"crowing\". One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister. This was enough for Reutter: Haydn was first caned, then summarily dismissed and sent into the streets. He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler, who shared his family's crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months. Haydn immediately began his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician.\nHaydn struggled at first, working at many different jobs: as a music teacher, as a street serenader, and eventually, in 1752, as valet-accompanist for the Italian composer Nicola Porpora, from whom he later said he learned \"the true fundamentals of composition\". He was also briefly in Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz's employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the Judenplatz.\nWhile a chorister, Haydn had not received any systematic training in music theory and composition. As a remedy, he worked his way through the counterpoint exercises in the text \"Gradus ad Parnassum\" by Johann Joseph Fux and carefully studied the work of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, whom he later acknowledged as an important influence. He said of C. P. E. Bach's first six keyboard sonatas, \"I did not leave my clavier till I played them through, and whoever knows me thoroughly must discover that I owe a great deal to Emanuel Bach, that I understood him and have studied him with diligence.\" According to Griesinger and Dies, in the 1750s Haydn studied an encyclopedic treatise by Johann Mattheson, a German composer.\nAs his skills increased, Haydn began to acquire a public reputation, first as the composer of an opera, \"Der krumme Teufel\", \"The Limping Devil\", written for the comic actor Joseph Felix von Kurz, whose stage name was \"Bernardon\". The work was premiered successfully in 1753, but was soon closed down by the censors due to \"offensive remarks\". Haydn also noticed, apparently without annoyance, that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops. Between 1754 and 1756 Haydn also worked freelance for the court in Vienna. He was among several musicians who were paid for services as supplementary musicians at balls given for the imperial children during carnival season, and as supplementary singers in the imperial chapel (the \"Hofkapelle\") in Lent and Holy Week.\nWith the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer in his day. Countess Thun, having seen one of Haydn's compositions, summoned him and engaged him as her singing and keyboard teacher. In 1756, Baron Carl Josef F\u00fcrnberg employed Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote his first string quartets. Their enthusiastic reception encouraged Haydn to write more. F\u00fcrnberg later recommended Haydn to Count Morzin, who, in 1757, became his first full-time employer.\nYears as Kapellmeister.\nHaydn's job title under Count Morzin was \"Kapellmeister\", that is, music director. Like many aristocrats of the Austrian Empire at the time, the Count kept his own small orchestra, which Haydn led and composed for. His salary was a respectable 200 florins a year, plus free board and lodging. The Count lived the typical aristocratic lifestyle: winters in fashionable Vienna, but in summer escaping the heat and dust of the city for the ancestral estate in the country; this was at Unterlukawitz, now in the Czech Republic. Haydn and his musicians served their employer wherever he happened to be living. For Count Morzin Haydn wrote his first symphonies (perhaps about 10-20; the number is unknown). Philip Downs comments on these first symphonies: \"the seeds of the future are there, his works already exhibit a richness and profusion of material, and a disciplined yet varied expression.\"\nIn 1760, with the security of a Kapellmeister position, Haydn married. His wife was the former Maria Anna Theresia Keller (1729\u20131800), the sister of Therese (b. 1733), with whom Haydn had previously been in love. Haydn and his wife had an unhappy marriage, from which the laws of the time permitted no escape. They produced no children, and both took lovers.\nCount Morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment, but Haydn was quickly offered a similar job (1761) by Prince Paul Anton, head of the immensely wealthy Esterh\u00e1zy family. Haydn's job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterh\u00e1zy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister Gregor Werner retaining authority only for church music. When Werner died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister.\nAs a \"house officer\" in the Esterh\u00e1zy establishment, Haydn wore livery and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the family's ancestral seat Schloss Esterh\u00e1zy in Eisenstadt and later on Esterh\u00e1za, a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s. Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing chamber music for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions. Despite this backbreaking workload, the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn. The Esterh\u00e1zy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762 to 1790 Nikolaus I) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra. During the nearly thirty years that Haydn worked at the Esterh\u00e1zy court, he produced a flood of compositions, and his musical style continued to develop.\nMuch of Haydn's activity at the time followed the musical taste of his patron Prince Nikolaus. In about 1765, the prince obtained and began to learn to play the baryton, an uncommon musical instrument similar to the bass viol, but with a set of plucked sympathetic strings. Haydn was commanded to provide music for the prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, the most notable of which are the 126 baryton trios. Around 1775, the prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theatre the prince had built at Esterh\u00e1za came to host a major season, with (per Jones) \"a schedule that soon rivalled any private or public opera house in Europe.\" Haydn served as \"de facto\" company director, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances. He wrote several of the operas performed and wrote substitution arias to insert into the operas of other composers.\n1779 was a watershed year for Haydn, as his contract was renegotiated: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterh\u00e1zy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers. Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign. His new employment contract \"acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn's career, the achievement of international popularity. By 1790, Haydn was in the paradoxical position ... of being Europe's leading composer, but someone who spent his time as a duty-bound Kapellmeister in a remote palace in the Hungarian countryside.\" The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op. 33, 50, 54/55, and 64). Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the Paris symphonies (1785\u20131786) and the original orchestral version of \"The Seven Last Words of Christ\" (1786), a commission from C\u00e1diz, Spain.\nThe remoteness of Esterh\u00e1za, which was farther from Vienna than Eisenstadt, led Haydn gradually to feel more isolated and lonely. He longed to visit Vienna because of his friendships there. Of these, a particularly important one was with Maria Anna von Genzinger (1754\u20131793), the wife of Prince Nikolaus's personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic relationship with the composer in 1789. Haydn wrote to Mrs. Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterh\u00e1za and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in Vienna. Later on, Haydn wrote to her frequently from London. Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his F minor variations for piano, Hob. XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death.\nAnother friend in Vienna was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whom Haydn had met sometime around 1784. According to later testimony by Michael Kelly and others, the two composers occasionally played in string quartets with Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (second violin) and Johann Baptist Wanhal (cello) for small gatherings attended by Giovanni Paisiello and Giovanni Battista Casti. Impressed by Mozart's work, Haydn praised it unstintingly to others. Mozart returned the esteem in his \"Haydn\" quartets. In 1785 Haydn was admitted to the same Masonic lodge as Mozart, the \"Zur wahren Eintracht\" in Vienna.\nLondon journeys.\nIn 1790, Prince Nikolaus died and was succeeded as prince by his son Anton. Following a trend of the time, Anton sought to economize by dismissing most of the court musicians. Haydn retained a nominal appointment with Anton, at a reduced salary of 400 florins, as well as a 1000-florin pension from Nikolaus. Since Anton had little need of Haydn's services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from Johann Peter Salomon, a German violinist and impresario, to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra.\nThe choice was a sensible one because Haydn was already a very popular composer there. Since the death of Johann Christian Bach in 1782, Haydn's music had dominated the concert scene in London; \"hardly a concert did not feature a work by him\". Haydn's work was widely distributed by publishers in London, including Forster (who had their own contract with Haydn) and Longman &amp; Broderip (who served as an agent in England for Haydn's Vienna publisher Artaria). Efforts to bring Haydn to London had been made since 1782, though Haydn's loyalty to Prince Nikolaus had prevented him from accepting.\nAfter fond farewells from Mozart and other friends, Haydn departed from Vienna with Salomon on 15 December 1790, arriving in Calais in time to cross the English Channel on New Year's Day of 1791. It was the first time that the 58-year-old composer had seen the sea. Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in Great Pulteney Street (London, near Piccadilly Circus) working in a borrowed studio at the Broadwood piano firm nearby.\nIt was the start of a very auspicious period for Haydn: both the 1791\u20131792 journey, along with a repeat visit in 1794\u20131795, were greatly successful. Audiences flocked to Haydn's concerts; he augmented his fame and made large profits, thus becoming financially secure. Charles Burney reviewed the first concert thus: \"Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England.\" Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with Rebecca Schroeter.\nMusically, Haydn's visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the \"Surprise\", \"Military\", \"Drumroll\" and \"London\" symphonies; the \"Rider\" quartet; and the \"Gypsy Rondo\" piano trio. The great success of the overall enterprise does not mean that the journeys were free of trouble. Notably, his first project, the commissioned opera \"L'anima del filosofo\" was duly written during the early stages of the trip, but the opera's impresario John Gallini was unable to obtain a licence to permit opera performances in the theatre he directed, the King's Theatre. Haydn was well paid for the opera (\u00a3300) but much time was wasted. Thus only two new symphonies, No. 95 and No. 96 \"Miracle\", could be premiered in the 12 concerts of Salomon's spring concert series in 1791. Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the Professional Concerts, who recruited Haydn's old pupil Ignaz Pleyel as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other's symphonies on their concert programs.\nThe end of Salomon's series in June 1791 gave Haydn a rare period of relative leisure. He spent some of the time in the country (Hertingfordbury), but also had time to travel, notably to Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university. The symphony performed for the occasion, No. 92 has since come to be known as the \"Oxford Symphony\", although it had been written two years before, in 1789. Four further new symphonies (Nos. 93, 94, 97 and 98) were performed in early 1792.\nWhile travelling to London in 1790, Haydn met the young Ludwig van Beethoven in his native city of Bonn. On Haydn's return, Beethoven came to Vienna and was Haydn's pupil up until the second London journey. Haydn took Beethoven with him to Eisenstadt for the summer, where Haydn had little to do, and taught Beethoven some counterpoint. While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodelling it. He also arranged for the performance of some of his London symphonies in local concerts.\nBy the time he arrived on his second journey to England (1794\u20131795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene. The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon's ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts. The concerts included the premieres of the 99th, 100th, and 101st symphonies. In 1795, Salomon had abandoned his own series, citing difficulty in obtaining \"vocal performers of the first rank from abroad\", and Haydn joined forces with the Opera Concerts, headed by the violinist Giovanni Battista Viotti. The location of the concerts was shifted from the Hanover Square Rooms, seating an audience of 500, to a new hall in the King's Theatre, seating 800. At these concerts were premiered Haydn's final three symphonies, 102, 103, and 104. The final benefit concert for Haydn (\"Dr. Haydn's night\"), at the end of the 1795 season, was a great success and was perhaps the peak of his English career. Haydn's biographer Griesinger wrote that Haydn \"considered the days spent in England the happiest of his life. He was everywhere appreciated there; it opened a new world to him\".\nYears of celebrity in Vienna.\nHaydn returned to Vienna in 1795. Prince Anton had died, and his successor Nikolaus II proposed that the Esterh\u00e1zy musical establishment be revived with Haydn serving again as Kapellmeister. Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis. He spent his summers with the Esterh\u00e1zys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six masses for them including the Lord Nelson mass in 1798.\nBy this time Haydn had become a public figure in Vienna. He spent most of his time in his home, a large house in the suburb of Windm\u00fchle, and wrote works for public performance. In collaboration with his librettist and mentor Gottfried van Swieten, and with funding from van Swieten's Gesellschaft der Associierten, he composed his two great oratorios, \"The Creation\" (1798) and \"The Seasons\" (1801). Both were enthusiastically received. Haydn frequently appeared before the public, often leading performances of \"The Creation\" and \"The Seasons\" for charity benefits, including Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t programs with massed musical forces. He also composed instrumental music: the popular \"Trumpet Concerto\", and the last nine in his long series of string quartets, including the \"Fifths\", \"Emperor\", and \"Sunrise\". Directly inspired by hearing audiences sing God Save the King in London, in 1797 Haydn wrote a patriotic \"Emperor's Hymn\" \"\", (\"God Save Emperor Francis\"). This achieved great success and became \"the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War\" (Jones). The melody was used for von Fallersleben's (1841), whose third stanza is today the national anthem of Germany. \nDuring the later years of this successful period, Haydn faced incipient old age and fluctuating health, and he had to struggle to complete his final works. His last major work, from 1802, was the sixth mass for the Esterh\u00e1zys, the \"Harmoniemesse\".\nRetirement, illness, and death.\nBy the end of 1803, Haydn's condition had declined to the point that he became physically unable to compose. He suffered from weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate and painfully swollen legs. Since diagnosis was uncertain in Haydn's time, it is unlikely that the precise illness can ever be identified, though Jones suggests arteriosclerosis. The illness was especially hard for Haydn because the flow of fresh musical ideas continued unabated, although he could no longer work them out as compositions. His biographer Dies reported Haydn saying in 1806:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I must have something to do\u2014usually musical ideas are pursuing me, to the point of torture, I cannot escape them, they stand like walls before me. If it's an allegro that pursues me, my pulse keeps beating faster, I can get no sleep. If it's an adagio, then I notice my pulse beating slowly. My imagination plays on me as if I were a clavier.\" Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said \"I am really just a living clavier.\"The winding down of Haydn's career was gradual. The Esterh\u00e1zy family kept him on as Kapellmeister to the very end (much as they had with his predecessor Werner long before), but they appointed new staff to lead their musical establishment: Johann Michael Fuchs in 1802 as Vice-Kapellmeister and Johann Nepomuk Hummel as Konzertmeister in 1804. Haydn's last summer in Eisenstadt was in 1803, and his last appearance before the public as a conductor was a charity performance of \"The Seven Last Words\" on 26 December 1803. As debility set in, he made largely futile efforts at composition, attempting to revise a rediscovered Missa brevis from his teenage years and complete his final string quartet. The former project was abandoned for good in 1805, and the quartet was published with just two movements.\nHaydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honours during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him. During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his \"Emperor's Hymn\". A final triumph occurred on 27 March 1808 when a performance of \"The Creation\" was organized in his honour. The very frail composer was brought into the hall on an armchair to the sound of trumpets and drums and was greeted by Beethoven, Salieri (who led the performance) and by other musicians and members of the aristocracy. Haydn was both moved and exhausted by the experience and had to depart at intermission.\nHaydn lived on for 14 more months. His final days were hardly serene, as in May 1809 the French army under Napoleon launched an attack on Vienna and on 10 May bombarded his neighbourhood. According to Griesinger, \"Four case shots fell, rattling the windows and doors of his house. He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, 'Don't be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!'. But the spirit was stronger than the flesh, for he had hardly uttered the brave words when his whole body began to tremble.\" More bombardments followed until the city fell to the French on 13 May. Haydn, was, however, deeply moved and appreciative when on 17 May a French cavalry officer named Sul\u00e9my came to pay his respects and sang, skillfully, an aria from \"The Creation\".\nOn 26 May Haydn played his \"Emperor's Hymn\" with unusual gusto three times; the same evening he collapsed and was taken to what proved to be his deathbed. He died peacefully in his own home at 12:40\u00a0a.m. on 31 May 1809, aged 77. On 15 June, a memorial service was held in the Schottenkirche at which Mozart's Requiem was performed. Haydn's remains were interred in the local Hundsturm cemetery until 1820 when they were moved to Eisenstadt by Prince Nikolaus. His head took a different journey; it was stolen by phrenologists shortly after burial, and the skull was reunited with the other remains only in 1954, now interred in a tomb in the north tower of the Bergkirche.\nCharacter and appearance.\nJames Webster writes of Haydn's public character thus: \"Haydn's public life exemplified the Enlightenment ideal of the \"honn\u00eate homme\" (\"honest man\"): the man whose good character and worldly success enable and justify each other. His modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged. These traits were not only prerequisites to his success as Kapellmeister, entrepreneur and public figure, but also aided the favourable reception of his music.\" Haydn was especially respected by the Esterh\u00e1zy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians' interests with their employer; see Papa Haydn and the tale of the \"Farewell\" Symphony. Haydn had a robust sense of humour, evident in his love of practical jokes and often apparent in his music, and he had many friends. For much of his life he benefited from a \"happy and naturally cheerful temperament\", but in his later life, there is evidence for periods of depression, notably in the correspondence with Mrs. Genzinger and in Dies's biography, based on visits made in Haydn's old age.Haydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his rosary when he had trouble composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective. He normally began the manuscript of each composition with [in the name of the Lord] and ended with [praise be to God]. He retained this practice even in his secular works; he frequently only uses the initials \"L. D.\", \"S. D. G.\" [, or [... and to Beatae Virgini Mariae] and sometimes adds, \"et oms sis\" ( \u2013 and all saints)\nWebster observes that Haydn could be sharp in his business dealings, and that some contemporaries were surprised and even shocked at this. Webster writes: \"As regards money, Haydn\u2026always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterh\u00e1zy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over [to publishers in different countries]; he regularly engaged in 'sharp practice'\" which nowadays might be regarded as plain fraud. But those were days when copyright was in its infancy, and the pirating of musical works was common. Publishers had few qualms about attaching Haydn's name to popular works by lesser composers, an arrangement that effectively robbed the lesser musician of livelihood. Webster notes that Haydn's ruthlessness in business might be viewed more sympathetically in light of his struggles with poverty during his years as a freelancer\u2014and that outside the world of business, in his dealings, for example, with relatives, musicians and servants, and in volunteering his services for charitable concerts, Haydn was a generous man \u2013 e.g., offering to teach the two infant sons of Mozart for free after their father's death. When Haydn died he was certainly comfortably off, but by middle class rather than aristocratic standards.\nHaydn was short in stature, perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth. He was not handsome, and like many in his day he was a survivor of smallpox; his face was pitted with the scars of this disease. His biographer Dies wrote: \"he couldn't understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman. 'They couldn't have been led to it by my beauty.'\"\nHaydn generally enjoyed good health, but he suffered from nasal polyps during much of his adult life, an agonizing and debilitating condition that at times prevented him from writing music.\nMusic.\nJames Webster summarizes Haydn's role in the history of classical music as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He excelled in every musical genre. [...] He is familiarly known as the \"father of the symphony\" because he composed 107 symphonies, and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet; no other composer approaches his combination of productivity, quality and historical importance in these genres.\nStructure.\nA central characteristic of Haydn's music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical motifs, often derived from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly. W. Dean Sutcliffe mentions this in a criticism of contemporary Haydn performance practice:\n[Haydn's] music sometime seems to 'live on its nerves'\u00a0... It is above all in this respect that Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing 'physiognomy' of Haydn's music, subsiding instead into an ease of manner and a concern for broader effects that they have acquired in their playing of Mozart.\nHaydn's work was central to the development of what came to be called sonata form. His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of Mozart and Beethoven, his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition. Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called monothematic exposition, in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme. Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his recapitulation sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive thematic development. Of these \"rearranged recapitulations\", Rosemary Hughes writes\n Having begun to 'develop', he could not stop; his recapitulations begin to take on irregular contours, sometimes sharply condensed, sometimes surprisingly expanded, losing their first tame symmetry to regain a balance of a far higher and more satisfying order.\nHaydn's formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the fugue into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic (see sonata rondo form). Haydn was also the principal exponent of the double variation form\u2014variations on two alternating themes, which are often major- and minor-mode versions of each other.\nCharacter.\nThe Haydn scholar Karl Geiringer has emphasized the sheer joyfulness of much of Haydn's music:\nOut of Haydn's love for the beauties of our world grew the gaiety and affirmative spirit apparent throughout all his creative periods ... Even in his advanced age, this gaiety did not entirely desert him. Nurtured by ... a victorious optimism maintained through all the vicissitudes of a long and arduous life, this radiant joyfulness again and again manifested itself, and Haydn considered it his mission to let his fellow beings share in this unique gift.\nThe sense of bliss often evident in Haydn's music was also noticed by Charles Rosen, who (describing a theme in the piano trio Hob. XV:13), wrote of \nHaydn's ability to create an emotion that was completely his own and that no other composer could duplicate \u2013 a feeling of ecstasy that is completely unsensual, almost amiable. There is no recipe for producing this effect ...\nA modest number of Haydn's works are striking exceptions to this upbeat character. Some excursions into emotional darkness include The Seven Last Words of Christ, the \"largo\" movement of the string quartet Op. 76 no. 5, which Haydn marked \"mesto\" (sorrowful), and the widely admired coda section of his Variations in F minor for piano.\nPerhaps more than any other composer's, Haydn's music is known for its humour; specifically, incongruous musical passages heard as jokes. The most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his \"Surprise\" symphony; Haydn's many other musical jokes include numerous false endings (e.g., in the quartets Op. 33 No. 2 and Op. 50 No. 3), and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of Op. 50 No. 1.\nHaydn's fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy, especially in the finales. Some characteristic examples of Haydn's \"rollicking\" finale type are found in the \"London\" Symphony No. 104, the String Quartet Op. 50 No. 1, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 27. Haydn's early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective. Later on, the emotional range of the slow movements increases, notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets Op. 76 Nos. 3 and 5, the Symphonies No. 98 and 102, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 23. The minuets tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character. Over time, Haydn turned some of his minuets into \"scherzi\" which are much faster, at one beat to the bar.\nEvolution of Haydn's style.\nHaydn's lifetime overlapped substantially with those of the most celebrated masters of Baroque music: he was born 18 years before the death of J. S. Bach and 27 years before that of Handel. Yet the models that influenced him, according to Karl Geiringer, were not at all these composers, but rather the leaders in the earliest development of the emerging Classical style, particularly in Vienna: his employer Johann Georg Reutter, Georg Christoph Wagenseil, and Georg Matthias Monn \u2013 none of whom wrote music that is widely played today. This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn was himself one of the musical explorers of this time. Fairly early in his career Haydn discovered, and quickly came to revere, the music of a composer from outside Vienna, J. S. Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Geiringer emphasizes how Haydn was struck by the emotional depth of Bach's work: \"Up to then he had been familiar with the gay and superficial idiom of the musical rococo; here he found compositions that deeply stirred and excited him.\"\nTracing Haydn's subsequent work over the six decades in which it was produced (he composed from about 1749 to 1802), one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication, which developed as Haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues. Several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of Haydn's musical style.\nIn the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as \"Sturm und Drang\" (\"storm and stress\"). This term is taken from a literary movement of about the same time, though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years. The musical language of this period is similar to what went before, but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive, especially in the works in minor keys. James Webster describes the works of this period as \"longer, more passionate, and more daring\". Some of the most famous compositions of this time are the \"Trauer\" (Mourning) Symphony No. 44, \"Farewell\" Symphony No. 45, the Piano Sonata in C minor (Hob. XVI/20, L. 33), and the six \"Sun\" Quartets Op. 20, all from c. 1771\u201372. It was also around this time that Haydn became interested in writing fugues in the Baroque style, and three of the Op. 20 quartets end with a fugue.\nFollowing the climax of the \"Sturm und Drang\", Haydn returned to a lighter, more overtly entertaining style. There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes trumpets and timpani. These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn's professional duties, which moved him away from instrumental music and toward the production of comic operas. Several of the operas were Haydn's own work (see List of operas by Joseph Haydn); these are seldom performed today. Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works, which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade.\nIn 1779, an important change in Haydn's contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer. This may have encouraged Haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of instrumental music. The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the six Op. 33 String Quartets, announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in \"a new and completely special way\". Charles Rosen has argued that this assertion on Haydn's part was not just sales talk but meant quite seriously, and he points out a number of important advances in Haydn's compositional technique that appear in these quartets, advances that mark the advent of the Classical style in full flower. These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of \"Classical counterpoint\" in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity. These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Op. 33.\nIn the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his \"popular style\", a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure. An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of folk or folk-like material (see Haydn and folk music). Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales. In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure. Haydn's popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work, including the twelve \"London\" symphonies, the late quartets and piano trios, and the two late oratorios.\nThe return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn's career. Although his musical style evolved little, his intentions as a composer changed. While he had been a servant, and later a busy entrepreneur, Haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion, with frequent deadlines. As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity. This is reflected in the subject matter of \"The Creation\" (1798) and \"The Seasons\" (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music. Haydn's new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work: both oratorios took him over a year to complete. Haydn once remarked that he had worked on \"The Creation\" so long because he wanted it to last.\nThe change in Haydn's approach was important in the history of classical music, as other composers were soon following his lead. Notably, Beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high.\nCatalogues.\nIt was a major task for scholars of the 20th century to locate and publish all of the works that Haydn composed, and also to screen out the great number of compositions by other composers that had circulated (often due to unscrupulous publishers) under Haydn's name. These studies culminated in the great catalog of Haydn's compositions, completed in 1978, by Anthony van Hoboken. His work, usually called the Hoboken catalogue assigns a catalogue number to each work, called its Hoboken number (abbreviated H. or Hob.). These Hoboken numbers are often used in identifying Haydn's compositions.\nHaydn's string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but they are usually identified instead by their opus numbers, which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together. For example, the string quartet Opus 76, No. 3 is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as Opus 76.\nInstruments.\nAn \"Anton Walter in Wien\" fortepiano used by the composer is now on display in the \"Haydn-Haus Eisenstadt\". In Vienna in 1788 Haydn bought himself a fortepiano made by Wenzel Schantz. When the composer was visiting London for the first time, an English piano builder, John Broadwood, supplied him with a concert grand.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited sources.\nBiographical sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCriticism and analysis\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "16095", "revid": "44571092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16095", "title": "Jimi Hendrix", "text": "American guitarist (1942\u20131970)\nJames Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942\u00a0\u2013 September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential guitarists of all time. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a part of his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the institution describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\".\nHendrix began playing guitar at age 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires.\nHendrix moved to England in late 1966, after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, he had formed his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience (with its rhythm section consisting of bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell), and achieved three UK top ten hits: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. His third and final studio album, \"Electric Ladyland\" (1968), became his most commercially successful release and his only number one album on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The world's highest-paid rock musician, Hendrix headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. He died in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia in September 1970, at the age of 27.\nHendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of \"Rolling Stone\" commented: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\"\nAncestry and childhood.\nHendrix was of African-American and alleged Cherokee descent. His paternal grandfather, Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix, was born in 1866 from an extramarital affair between a woman named Fanny and a wealthy grain merchant. Hendrix's paternal grandmother, Zenora \"Nora\" Rose Moore, was a former dancer and vaudeville performer who co-founded Fountain Chapel in Hogan's Alley. Hendrix and Moore relocated to Vancouver, Canada, where they had a son they named James Allen Hendrix on June 10, 1919; the family called him \"Al\".\nIn 1941, after moving to Seattle, Washington, Al met Lucille Jeter at a dance; they married on March 31, 1942. Lucille's father (Jimi's maternal grandfather) was Preston Jeter, whose mother was born in similar circumstances as Bertran Hendrix. Lucille's mother, Clarice (\"n\u00e9e\" Lawson), had African-American ancestors who had been enslaved people. Al, who had been drafted by the US Army to serve in World War II, left to begin his basic training three days after the wedding. Johnny Allen Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle; he was the first of Lucille's five children. In 1946, Johnny's parents changed his name to James Marshall Hendrix, in honor of Al and his late brother Leon Marshall.\nStationed in Alabama at the time of Hendrix's birth, Al was denied the standard military furlough afforded servicemen for childbirth; his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going AWOL to see his infant son. He spent two months locked up without trial, during which he received a telegram announcing his son's birth. During Al's three-year absence, Lucille struggled to raise their son. Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends, especially Lucille's sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding. Al received an honorable discharge from the US Army on September 1, 1945. Two months later, unable to find Lucille, Al went to the Berkeley, California, home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ, who had taken care of and attempted to adopt Hendrix; this is where Al saw his son for the first time.\nAfter returning from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but his inability to find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon in and out of foster care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela in 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.\nFirst instruments.\nAt Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle during the mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of carrying a broom with him to emulate a guitar gained the attention of the school's social worker. After more than a year of his clinging to a broom like a security blanket, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children, insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar.\nIn 1957, while helping his father with a side-job, Hendrix found a ukulele among the garbage they were removing from an older woman's home. She told him that he could keep the instrument, which had only one string. Learning by ear, he played single notes, following along to Elvis Presley songs, particularly \"Hound Dog\". By the age of 33, Hendrix's mother Lucille had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and on February 2, 1958, she died when her spleen ruptured. Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mother's funeral; he instead gave them shots of whiskey and told them that was how men should deal with loss. In 1958, Hendrix completed his studies at Washington Junior High School and began attending, but did not graduate from, Garfield High School.\nIn mid-1958, at age 15, Hendrix acquired his first acoustic guitar, for $5 (). He played for hours daily, watching others and learning from more experienced guitarists, and listening to blues artists such as Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson. The first tune Hendrix learned to play was the television theme \"Peter Gunn\". Around that time, Hendrix jammed with boyhood friend Sammy Drain and his keyboard-playing brother. In 1959, attending a concert by Hank Ballard &amp; The Midnighters in Seattle, Hendrix met the group's guitarist Billy Davis. Davis showed him some guitar licks and got him a short gig with the Midnighters. The two remained friends until Hendrix's death in 1970.\nSoon after he acquired the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, he could barely be heard over the sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band in the Jaffe Room of Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but they fired him between sets for showing off. He joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When his guitar was stolen after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.\nMilitary service.\nBefore Hendrix was 19 years old, law authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. Given a choice between prison or joining the Army, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He arrived on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: \"There's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, then when you go to jump school\u00a0... you get hell. They work you to death, fussing and fighting.\" In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar in Seattle at the home of his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: \"I really need it now.\" His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words \"Betty Jean\" to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return. In November 1961, fellow serviceman Billy Cox walked past an army club and heard Hendrix playing. Impressed by Hendrix's technique, which Cox described as a combination of \"John Lee Hooker and Beethoven\", Cox borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within weeks, they began performing at base clubs on the weekends with other musicians in a loosely organized band, the Casuals.\nHendrix completed his paratrooper training and, on January 11, 1962, Major General Charles W. G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch. By February, his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors. They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks. On May 24, Hendrix's platoon sergeant, James C. Spears, filed a report in which he stated: \"He has no interest whatsoever in the Army\u00a0... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never come up to the standards required of a soldier. I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible.\" On June 29, 1962, Hendrix was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions. Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump, but no Army records have been produced that indicate that he received or was discharged for any injuries.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nIn September 1962, after Cox was discharged from the Army, he and Hendrix moved about across the state line from Fort Campbell to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band, the King Kasuals. In Seattle, Hendrix saw Butch Snipes play with his teeth and now the Kasuals' second guitarist, Alphonso \"Baby Boo\" Young, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix also learned to play in this way. He later explained: \"The idea of doing that came to me... in Tennessee. Down there you have to play with your teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage.\"\nAlthough they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the club Del Morocco, and for the next two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R&amp;B, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, Ike &amp; Tina Turner and Jackie Wilson.\nIn January 1964, feeling he had outgrown the circuit artistically, and frustrated by having to follow the rules of bandleaders, Hendrix decided to venture out on his own. He moved into the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, where he befriended Lithofayne Pridgon, known as \"Faye\", who became his girlfriend. A Harlem native with connections throughout the area's music scene, Pridgon provided him with shelter, support, and encouragement. Hendrix also met the Allen twins, Arthur and Albert. In February 1964, Hendrix won first prize in the Apollo Theater amateur contest. Hoping to secure a career opportunity, he played the Harlem club circuit and sat in with various bands. At the recommendation of a former associate of Joe Tex, Ronnie Isley granted Hendrix an audition that led to an offer to become the guitarist with the Isley Brothers' backing band, the I.B. Specials, which he readily accepted.\nFirst recordings.\nIn March 1964, Hendrix recorded the two-part single \"Testify\" with the Isley Brothers. Released in June, it failed to chart. In May, he provided guitar instrumentation for the Don Covay song, \"Mercy Mercy\". Issued in August by Rosemart Records and distributed by Atlantic, the track reached number 35 on the \"Billboard\" chart.\nHendrix toured with the Isleys during much of 1964, but near the end of October, after growing tired of playing the same set every night, he left the band. Soon afterward, Hendrix joined Little Richard's touring band, the Upsetters. During a stop in Los Angeles in February 1965, he recorded his first and only single with Richard, \"I Don't Know What You Got (But It's Got Me)\", written by Don Covay and released by Vee-Jay Records. Richard's popularity was waning at the time, and the single peaked at number 92, where it remained for one week before dropping off the chart. Hendrix met singer Rosa Lee Brooks while staying at the Wilcox Hotel in Hollywood, and she invited him to participate in a recording session for her single, which included the Arthur Lee penned \"My Diary\" as the A-side, and \"Utee\" as the B-side. Hendrix played guitar on both tracks, which also included background vocals by Lee. The single failed to chart, but Hendrix and Lee began a friendship that lasted several years; Hendrix later became an ardent supporter of Lee's band, Love.\nIn July 1965, Hendrix made his first television appearance on \"Night Train\", a program produced and aired on Nashville TV station WLAC-TV (now WTVF). Performing in Little Richard's ensemble band, he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on \"Shotgun\". The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing. Richard and Hendrix often clashed over tardiness, wardrobe, and Hendrix's stage antics, and in late July, Richard's brother Robert fired him.\nOn July 27, Hendrix signed his first recording contract with Juggy Murray at Sue Records and Copa Management. He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers, and recorded a second single with them, \"Move Over and Let Me Dance\" backed with \"Have You Ever Been Disappointed\". Later that year, he joined a New York-based R&amp;B band, Curtis Knight and the Squires, after meeting Knight in the lobby of a hotel where both men were staying. Hendrix performed with them for eight months.\nIn October 1965, he and Knight recorded the single, \"How Would You Feel\" backed with \"Welcome Home\". Despite his two-year contract with Sue, Hendrix signed a three-year recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin on October 15. While the relationship with Chalpin was short-lived, his contract remained in force, which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix. During his time with Knight, Hendrix briefly toured with Joey Dee and the Starliters, and worked with King Curtis on several recordings including Ray Sharpe's two-part single, \"Help Me\". Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals, \"Hornets Nest\" and \"Knock Yourself Out\", released as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966.\nFeeling restricted by his experiences as an R&amp;B sideman, Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York City's Greenwich Village, which had a vibrant and diverse music scene. There, he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience. In September, they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe Au Go Go in Manhattan, as the backing group for a singer and guitarist then billed as John Hammond.\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience.\nBy May 1966, Hendrix was struggling to earn a living wage playing the R&amp;B circuit, so he briefly rejoined Curtis Knight and the Squires for an engagement at one of New York City's most popular nightspots, the Cheetah Club. During a performance, Linda Keith, the girlfriend of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, noticed Hendrix and was \"mesmerised\" by his playing. She invited him to join her for a drink, and the two became friends.\nWhile Hendrix was playing as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, Keith recommended him to Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham and producer Seymour Stein. They failed to see Hendrix's musical potential and rejected him. Keith referred him to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and was interested in managing and producing artists. Chandler saw Hendrix play in Cafe Wha?, a Greenwich Village, New York City nightclub. Chandler liked the Billy Roberts song \"Hey Joe\", and was persuaded he could create a hit single with the right artist. Impressed with Hendrix's version of the song, he brought him to London on September 24, 1966, and signed him to a management and production contract with himself and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. That night, Hendrix gave an impromptu solo performance at The Scotch of St James and began a relationship with Kathy Etchingham that lasted for two and a half years.\nFollowing Hendrix's arrival in London, Chandler began recruiting members for a band designed to highlight his talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Hendrix met guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding's knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix. Another important criterion for Hendrix was fashion\u2014according to author Keith Shadwick, \"what he really liked was Redding's hairstyle.\" Chandler asked Redding if he wanted to play bass guitar in Hendrix's band; Redding agreed. Chandler began looking for a drummer and soon after contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they found common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted. Chandler also persuaded Hendrix to change the spelling of his first name from \"Jimmy\" to the more exotic \"Jimi\".\nOn October 1, 1966, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was scheduled to perform, and where Hendrix and guitarist Eric Clapton met. Clapton later said: \"He asked if he could play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling about him.\" Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song \"Killing Floor\". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: \"He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it\u00a0... He walked off, and my life was never the same again\".\nUK success.\nIn mid-October 1966, Chandler arranged an engagement for the Experience as Johnny Hallyday's supporting act during a brief tour of France. Thus, the Jimi Hendrix Experience performed their first show on October 13, 1966, at the Novelty in Evreux. Their enthusiastically received 15-minute performance at the Olympia theatre in Paris on October 18 marks the earliest known recording of the band. In late October, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, managers of the Who, signed the Experience to their newly formed label, Track Records, and the group recorded their first song, \"Hey Joe\", on October 23. \"Stone Free\", which was Hendrix's first songwriting effort after arriving in England, was recorded on November 2.\nFrom November 8 to 11, 1966, the Jimi Hendrix Experience had a short residency at the Big Apple club in Munich, their first gigs in Germany. At this occasion Hendrix had a show experience that would define him from then on: when trying to escape in panic from a frenetic audience that had pulled him off the stage, he smashed his guitar for the first time in a sound explosion on stage, which was perceived by the audience as part of the show. Observing the audience's reaction, Chandler decided that this show of violence had to become a permanent feature of the Experience's show.\nIn mid-November, they performed at the Bag O'Nails nightclub in London, with Clapton, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, and Kevin Ayers in attendance. Ayers described the crowd's reaction as stunned disbelief: \"All the stars were there, and I heard serious comments, you know 'shit', 'Jesus', 'damn' and other words worse than that.\" The performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in \"Record Mirror\" with the headline: \"Mr. Phenomenon\". \"Now hear this\u00a0... we predict that [Hendrix] is going to whirl around the business like a tornado\", wrote Bill Harry, who asked the rhetorical question: \"Is that full, big, swinging sound really being created by only three people?\" Hendrix said: \"We don't want to be classed in any category\u00a0... If it must have a tag, I'd like it to be called, 'Free Feeling'. It's a mixture of rock, freak-out, rave and blues\". Through a distribution deal with Polydor Records, the Experience's first single, \"Hey Joe\", backed with \"Stone Free\", was released on December 16, 1966. After appearances on the UK television shows \"Ready Steady Go!\" and \"Top of the Pops\", \"Hey Joe\" entered the UK charts on December 29 and peaked at number six. Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit \"Purple Haze\", and in May with \"The Wind Cries Mary\", which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks, peaking at number six. On March 12, 1967, he performed at the Troutbeck Hotel, Ilkley, West Yorkshire, where, after about 900 people turned up (the hotel was licensed for 250) the local police stopped the gig due to safety concerns.\nOn March 31, 1967, while the Experience waited to perform at the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: \"Maybe I can smash up an elephant\", to which Altham replied: \"Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar\". Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire at the end of a 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London's press labeled Hendrix the \"Black Elvis\" and the \"Wild Man of Borneo\".\nAn enduring urban legend in the UK maintains that a possible explanation for the feral parakeets that have appeared in Great Britain since the mid-20th century may derive from a single pair of the birds that were released by Hendrix on Carnaby Street in the 1960s. According to a study, however, which mapped historical news reports of sightings of the birds, the myth is not true.\n\"Are You Experienced\".\nAfter the UK chart success of their first two singles, \"Hey Joe\" and \"Purple Haze\", the Experience began assembling material for a full-length LP. In London, recording began at De Lane Lea Studios, and later moved to the prestigious Olympic Studios. The album, \"Are You Experienced\", features a diversity of musical styles, including blues tracks such as \"Red House\" and the R&amp;B song \"Remember\". It also included the experimental science fiction piece, \"Third Stone from the Sun\" and the post-modern soundscapes of the title track, with prominent backward guitar and drums. \"I Don't Live Today\" served as a medium for Hendrix's guitar feedback improvisation and \"Fire\" was driven by Mitchell's drumming.\nReleased in the UK on May 12, 1967, \"Are You Experienced\" spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. It was prevented from reaching the top spot by the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". On May 29 he performed at the Barbeque 67 concert in Spalding, Lincolnshire, considered by some to have been the first rock festival; tickets cost \u00a31. On June 4, 1967, Hendrix opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with his rendition of \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s title track, which was released just three days previous. Beatles manager Brian Epstein owned the Saville at the time, and both George Harrison and Paul McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: \"The curtains flew back and he came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honors of my career.\" Released in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records, \"Are You Experienced\" reached number five on the \"Billboard\" 200.\nIn 1989, Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of \"Guitar World\", described \"Are You Experienced\" as \"the album that shook the world\u00a0... leaving it forever changed\". In 2005, \"Rolling Stone\" called the double-platinum LP Hendrix's \"epochal debut\", and they ranked it the 15th greatest album of all time, noting his \"exploitation of amp howl\", and characterizing his guitar playing as \"incendiary\u00a0... historic in itself\".\nMonterey Pop Festival.\nAlthough popular in Europe at the time, the Experience's first US single, \"Hey Joe\", failed to reach the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart upon its release on May 1, 1967. Their fortunes improved when McCartney recommended them to the organizers of the Monterey Pop Festival. He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix, whom he called \"an absolute ace on the guitar\". McCartney agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival in mid-June.\nOn June 18, 1967, introduced by Brian Jones as \"the most exciting performer [he had] ever heard\", Hendrix opened with a fast arrangement of Howlin' Wolf's song \"Killing Floor\", wearing what Shadwick described as \"clothes as exotic as any on display elsewhere\". Shadwick wrote: \"[Hendrix] was not only something utterly new musically, but an entirely original vision of what a black American entertainer should and could look like.\" The Experience went on to perform renditions of \"Hey Joe\", B.B. King's \"Rock Me Baby\", Chip Taylor's \"Wild Thing\", and Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\", and four original compositions: \"Foxy Lady\", \"Can You See Me\", \"The Wind Cries Mary\", and \"Purple Haze\". The set ended with Hendrix destroying his guitar and tossing pieces of it out to the audience. \"Rolling Stone\"'s Alex Vadukul wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival he created one of rock's most perfect moments. Standing in the front row of that concert was a 17-year-old boy named Ed Caraeff. Caraeff had never seen Hendrix before nor heard his music, but he had a camera with him and there was one shot left in his roll of film. As Hendrix lit his guitar, Caraeff took a final photo. It would become one of the most famous images in rock and roll.\nCaraeff stood on a chair next to the edge of the stage and took four monochrome pictures of Hendrix burning his guitar. Caraeff was close enough to the fire that he had to use his camera to protect his face from the heat. \"Rolling Stone\" later colorized the image, matching it with other pictures taken at the festival before using the shot for a 1987 magazine cover. According to author Gail Buckland, the final frame of \"Hendrix kneeling in front of his burning guitar, hands raised, is one of the most famous images in rock\". Author and historian Matthew C. Whitaker wrote that \"Hendrix's burning of his guitar became an iconic image in rock history and brought him national attention\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" asserted that, upon leaving the stage, Hendrix \"graduated from rumor to legend\". Author John McDermott wrote that \"Hendrix left the Monterey audience stunned and in disbelief at what they'd just heard and seen\". According to Hendrix: \"I decided to destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice. You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar.\" The performance was filmed by D.\u00a0A. Pennebaker and included in the concert documentary \"Monterey Pop\", which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the US public.\nAfter the festival, the Experience was booked for five concerts at Bill Graham's Fillmore, with Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. The Experience outperformed Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights and replaced them at the top of the bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction, which included a free open-air concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go, the Experience was booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees. The Monkees requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans, but their young audience disliked the Experience, who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later said he engineered the tour to gain publicity for Hendrix.\n\"Axis: Bold as Love\".\nThe second Experience album, \"\", opens with the track \"EXP\", which uses microphonic and harmonic feedback in a new, creative fashion. It also showcased an experimental stereo panning effect in which sounds emanating from Hendrix's guitar move through the stereo image, revolving around the listener. The piece reflected his growing interest in science fiction and outer space. He composed the album's title track and finale around two verses and two choruses, during which he pairs emotions with personas, comparing them to colors. The song's coda features the first recording of stereo phasing. Shadwick described the composition as \"possibly the most ambitious piece on \"Axis\", the extravagant metaphors of the lyrics suggesting a growing confidence\" in Hendrix's songwriting. His guitar playing throughout the song is marked by chordal arpeggios and contrapuntal motion, with tremolo-picked partial chords providing the musical foundation for the chorus, which culminates in what musicologist Andy Aledort described as \"simply one of the greatest electric guitar solos ever played\". The track fades out on tremolo-picked 32nd note double stops.\nThe scheduled release date for \"Axis\" was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session, but they could not match the quality of the lost mix of \"If 6 Was 9\". Redding had a tape recording of this mix, which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled. During the verses, Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals. Hendrix voiced his disappointment about having re-mixed the album so quickly, and he felt that it could have been better had they been given more time.\n\"Axis\" featured psychedelic cover art that depicts Hendrix and the Experience as various avatars of Vishnu, incorporating a painting of them by Roger Law, from a photo-portrait by Karl Ferris. The painting was then superimposed on a copy of a mass-produced religious poster. Hendrix stated that the cover, which Track spent $5,000 producing, would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his American Indian heritage. He said: \"You got it wrong\u00a0... I'm not that kind of Indian.\" Track released the album in the UK on December 1, 1967, where it peaked at number five, spending 16 weeks on the charts. In February 1968, \"Axis: Bold as Love\" reached number three in the US.\nWhile author and journalist Richie Unterberger described \"Axis\" as the least impressive Experience album, according to author Peter Doggett, the release \"heralded a new subtlety in Hendrix's work\". Mitchell said: \"\"Axis\" was the first time that it became apparent that Jimi was pretty good working behind the mixing board, as well as playing, and had some positive ideas of how he wanted things recorded. It could have been the start of any potential conflict between him and Chas in the studio.\"\n\"Electric Ladyland\".\nRecording for the Experience's third and final studio album, \"Electric Ladyland\", began as early as December 20, 1967, at Olympic Studios. Several songs were attempted; however, in April 1968, the Experience, with Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren, moved the sessions to the newly opened Record Plant Studios in New York. As the sessions progressed, Chandler became increasingly frustrated with Hendrix's perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes. Hendrix also allowed numerous friends and guests to join them in the studio, which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix. Redding later recalled: \"There were tons of people in the studio; you couldn't move. It was a party, not a session.\" Redding, who had formed his own band in mid-1968, Fat Mattress, found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience, so Hendrix played many of the bass parts on \"Electric Ladyland\". The album's cover stated that it was \"produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix\". During the \"Electric Ladyland\" recording sessions, Hendrix began experimenting with other combinations of musicians, including Jefferson Airplane's Jack Casady and Traffic's Steve Winwood, who played bass and organ, respectively, on the 15-minute slow-blues jam, \"Voodoo Chile\". During the album's production, Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with B.B. King, Al Kooper, and Elvin Bishop. \"Electric Ladyland\" was released on October 25, and by mid-November it had reached number one in the US, spending two weeks at the top spot. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his only number one album. It peaked at number six in the UK, spending 12 weeks on the chart. \"Electric Ladyland\" included Hendrix's cover of a Bob Dylan song, \"All Along the Watchtower\", which became Hendrix's highest-selling single and his only US top 40 hit, peaking at number 20; the single reached number five in the UK. \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", his first recorded song to feature a wah-wah pedal, was added to the album. It was originally released as his fourth single in the UK in August 1967 and reached number 18 on the charts.\nIn 1989, Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of \"Guitar World\", described \"Electric Ladyland\" as \"Hendrix's masterpiece\". According to author Michael Heatley, \"most critics agree\" that the album is \"the fullest realization of Jimi's far-reaching ambitions.\" In 2004, author Peter Doggett wrote: \"For pure experimental genius, melodic flair, conceptual vision and instrumental brilliance, \"Electric Ladyland\" remains a prime contender for the status of rock's greatest album.\" Doggett described the LP as \"a display of musical virtuosity never surpassed by any rock musician.\"\nBreak-up of the Experience.\nIn January 1969, after an absence of more than six months, Hendrix briefly moved back into his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham's apartment in Brook Street, London, next door to the home of the composer Handel. After a performance of \"Voodoo Child\", on BBC's \"Happening for Lulu\" show in January 1969, the band stopped midway through an attempt at their first hit \"Hey Joe\" and then launched into an instrumental version of \"Sunshine of Your Love\", as a tribute to the recently disbanded band Cream, until director and producer Stanley Dorfman was forced to bring the song to a premature end. The Experience bass player Noel Redding describes in his autobiography, \"as the minutes ticked by on his live show, short of running onto the set to stop us or pulling the plug, there was nothing he could do. We played past the point where Lulu might have joined us, played through the time for talking at the end, played through Stanley tearing his hair, pointing to his watch and silently screaming at us. We played out the show... Afterwards, Dorfman refused to speak to us, but the result is one of the most widely used bits of film we ever did. Certainly, it\u2019s the most relaxed.\" Dorfman recalls at the BBC club after the show, he found Hendrix to be \"a very sweet man, very quiet, he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d done anything wrong at all.\" However, according to rock and roll legend, Hendrix was banned from working at the BBC again. During this time, the Experience toured Scandinavia, West Germany, and gave their final two performances in France. On February 18 and 24, they played sold-out concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall, which were the last European appearances of this lineup.\nBy February 1969, Redding had grown weary of Hendrix's unpredictable work ethic and his creative control over the Experience's music. During the previous month's European tour, interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated, particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary, Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions: \"On the first day, as I nearly expected, there was nothing doing\u00a0... On the second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours, came back, and it was still ages before Jimi ambled in. Then we argued\u00a0... On the last day, I just watched it happen for a while, and then went back to my flat.\" The last Experience sessions that included Redding\u2014a re-recording of \"Stone Free\" for use as a possible single release\u2014took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21.\nThe last performance of the original Experience lineup took place on June 29, 1969, at Barry Fey's Denver Pop Festival, a three-day event held at Denver's Mile High Stadium that was marked by police using tear gas to control the audience. The band narrowly escaped from the venue in the back of a rental truck, which was partly crushed by fans who had climbed on top of the vehicle. Before the show, a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there; the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox. The next day, Redding quit the Experience and returned to London. He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career, blaming Hendrix's plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving. Redding later said: \"Mitch and I hung out a lot together, but we're English. If we'd go out, Jimi would stay in his room. But any bad feelings came from us being three guys who were traveling too hard, getting too tired, and taking too many drugs\u00a0... I liked Hendrix. I don't like Mitchell.\"\nSoon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in the hamlet of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, where he had spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery arranged the accommodations in the hope that the respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on US TV\u2014on \"The Dick Cavett Show\"\u2014where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on \"The Tonight Show\" where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.\nWoodstock.\nBy 1969, Hendrix was the world's highest-paid rock musician. In August, he headlined the Woodstock Music and Art Fair that included many of the most popular bands of the time. For the concert, he added rhythm guitarist Larry Lee and conga players Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez. The band rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance, and according to Mitchell, they never connected musically. Before arriving at the engagement, Hendrix heard reports that the size of the audience had grown enormously, which concerned him as he did not enjoy performing for large crowds. He was an important draw for the event, and although he accepted substantially less money for the appearance than his usual fee, he was the festival's highest-paid performer.\nHendrix decided to move his midnight Sunday slot to Monday morning, closing the show. The band took the stage around 8:00\u00a0a.m, by which time Hendrix had been awake for more than three days. The audience, which peaked at an estimated 400,000 people, was reduced to 30,000. The festival MC, Chip Monck, introduced the group as \"the Jimi Hendrix Experience\", but Hendrix clarified: \"We decided to change the whole thing around and call it 'Gypsy Sun and Rainbows'. For short, it's nothin' but a 'Band of Gypsys'.\"\nHendrix's performance included a rendition of the US national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", with copious feedback, distortion, and sustain to imitate the sounds made by rockets and bombs. Contemporary political pundits described his interpretation as a statement against the Vietnam War. Three weeks later Hendrix said: \"We're all Americans\u00a0... it was like 'Go America!'...\u00a0We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see.\" Immortalized in the 1970 documentary film, \"Woodstock\", Hendrix's version became part of the sixties zeitgeist. Pop critic Al Aronowitz of the \"New York Post\" wrote: \"It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock, and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties.\" Images of the performance showing Hendrix wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket with fringe, a red head-scarf, and blue jeans are regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era. He played \"Hey Joe\" during the encore, concluding the 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-day festival. Upon leaving the stage, he collapsed from exhaustion. In 2011, the editors of \"Guitar World\" named his performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" the greatest performance of all time.\nBand of Gypsys.\nA legal dispute arose in 1966 regarding a record contract that Hendrix had entered into the previous year with producer Ed Chalpin. After two years of litigation, the parties agreed to a resolution that granted Chalpin the distribution rights to an album of original Hendrix material. Hendrix decided that they would record the LP, \"Band of Gypsys\", during two live appearances. In preparation for the shows he formed an all-black power trio with Cox and drummer Buddy Miles, formerly with Wilson Pickett, the Electric Flag, and the Buddy Miles Express. Critic John Rockwell described Hendrix and Miles as jazz-rock fusionists, and their collaboration as pioneering. Others identified a funk and soul influence in their music. Concert promoter Bill Graham called the shows \"the most brilliant, emotional display of virtuoso electric guitar\" that he had ever heard. Biographers have speculated that Hendrix formed the band in an effort to appease members of the Black Power movement and others in the black communities who called for him to use his fame to speak up for civil rights.\nHendrix had been recording with Cox since April and jamming with Miles since September, and the trio wrote and rehearsed material which they performed at a series of four shows over two nights on December 31 and January 1, at the Fillmore East. They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP, which was produced by Hendrix. The album includes the track \"Machine Gun\", which musicologist Andy Aledort described as the pinnacle of Hendrix's career, and \"the premiere example of [his] unparalleled genius as a rock guitarist\u00a0... In this performance, Jimi transcended the medium of rock music, and set an entirely new standard for the potential of electric guitar.\" During the song's extended instrumental breaks, Hendrix created sounds with his guitar that sonically represented warfare, including rockets, bombs, and diving planes.\nThe \"Band of Gypsys\" album was the only official live Hendrix LP made commercially available during his lifetime; several tracks from the Woodstock and Monterey shows were released later that year. The album was released in April 1970 by Capitol Records; it reached the top ten in both the US and the UK. That same month a single was issued with \"Stepping Stone\" as the A-side and \"Izabella\" as the B-side, but Hendrix was dissatisfied with the quality of the mastering and he demanded that it be withdrawn and re-mixed, preventing the songs from charting and resulting in Hendrix's least successful single; it was also his last.\nOn January 28, 1970, a third and final Band of Gypsys appearance took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the \"Winter Festival for Peace\". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: \"[Hendrix] came in with his head down, sat on the couch alone, and put his head in his hands\u00a0... He didn't move until it was time for the show.\" Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for \"Foxy Lady\". He then began playing \"Earth Blues\" before telling the audience: \"That's what happens when earth fucks with space\". Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.\nCry of Love Tour.\nSoon after the abruptly ended Band of Gypsys performance and their subsequent dissolution, Jeffery made arrangements to reunite the original Experience lineup. Although Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding were interviewed by \"Rolling Stone\" in February 1970 as a united group, Hendrix never intended to work with Redding. When Redding returned to New York in anticipation of rehearsals with a re-formed Experience, he was told that he had been replaced with Cox. During an interview with \"Rolling Stone\"'s Keith Altham, Hendrix defended the decision: \"It's nothing personal against Noel, but we finished what we were doing with the Experience and Billy's style of playing suits the new group better.\" Although an official name was never adopted for the lineup of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox, promoters often billed them as the Jimi Hendrix Experience or just Jimi Hendrix.\nDuring the first half of 1970, Hendrix sporadically worked on material for what would have been his next LP. Many of the tracks were posthumously released in 1971 as \"The Cry of Love\". He had started writing songs for the album in 1968, but in April 1970 he told Keith Altham that the project had been abandoned. Soon afterward, he and his band took a break from recording and began the Cry of Love tour at the L.A. Forum, performing for 20,000 people. Set-lists during the tour included numerous Experience tracks as well as a selection of newer material. Several shows were recorded, and they produced some of Hendrix's most memorable live performances. At one of them, the second Atlanta International Pop Festival, on July 4, he played to the largest American audience of his career. According to authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz, as many as 500,000 people attended the concert. On July 17, they appeared at the New York Pop Festival; Hendrix had again consumed too many drugs before the show, and the set was considered a disaster. The American leg of the tour, which included 32 performances, ended in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 1, 1970. This would be Hendrix's final concert appearance in the US.\nElectric Lady Studios.\nIn 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly invested in the purchase of the Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but when an audit of Hendrix's expenses revealed that he had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking recording studios for lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided to convert the building into a studio of his own. Hendrix could then work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1\u00a0million.\nHendrix first used Electric Lady on June 15, 1970, when he jammed with Steve Winwood and Chris Wood of Traffic; the next day, he recorded his first track there, \"Night Bird Flying\". The studio officially opened for business on August 25, and a grand opening party was held the following day. Immediately afterwards, Hendrix left for England; he never returned to the States. He boarded an Air India flight for London with Cox, joining Mitchell for a performance as the headlining act of the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1970.\nEuropean tour.\nWhen the European leg of the Cry of Love tour began, Hendrix was longing for his new studio and creative outlet, and was not eager to fulfill the commitment. On September 2, 1970, he abandoned a performance in Aarhus after three songs, stating: \"I've been dead a long time\". Four days later, he gave his final concert appearance, at the Isle of Fehmarn Festival in West Germany. He was met with booing and jeering from fans in response to his cancellation of a show slated for the end of the previous night's bill due to torrential rain and risk of electrocution. Immediately following the festival, Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox traveled to London.\nThree days after the performance, Cox, who was suffering from severe paranoia after either taking LSD or being given it unknowingly, quit the tour and went to stay with his parents in Pennsylvania. Within days of Hendrix's arrival in England, he had spoken with Chas Chandler, Alan Douglas, and others about leaving his manager, Michael Jeffery. On September 16, Hendrix performed in public for the last time during an informal jam at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho with Eric Burdon and his latest band, War. They began by playing a few of their recent hits, and after a brief intermission Hendrix joined them during \"Mother Earth\" and \"Tobacco Road\". He died less than 48 hours later.\nSubstance abuse and behavioral problems.\nAlcohol.\nIn July 1962, Hendrix entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee, drawn in by live music. He stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 () that he had saved during his time in the Army. \"I went in this jazz joint and had a drink,\" he explained. \"I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I came out of that place with sixteen dollars left.\" Alcohol eventually became \"the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence\".\nLSD and other substances.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLike most acid-heads, Jimi had visions and he wanted to create music to express what he saw. He would try to explain this to people, but it didn't make sense because it was not linked to reality in any way.\n \u2014 Kathy Etchingham\nRoby and Schreiber assert that Hendrix first used LSD when he met Linda Keith in late 1966. Shapiro and Glebbeek, however, contends that Hendrix used it in June 1967 at the earliest while attending the Monterey Pop Festival. According to Hendrix biographer Charles Cross, the subject of drugs came up one evening in 1966 at Keith's New York apartment. One of Keith's friends offered Hendrix \"acid\", a street name for LSD, but Hendrix asked for LSD instead, showing what Cross describes as \"his naivete and his complete inexperience with psychedelics\". Before that, Hendrix had only sporadically used drugs, including cannabis, hashish, amphetamines, and occasionally cocaine. After 1967, he regularly used cannabis, hashish, LSD, and amphetamines, particularly while touring. According to Cross, \"few stars were as closely associated with the drug culture as Jimi\".\nViolent behavior.\nWhen Hendrix drank to excess or mixed drugs with alcohol, often he became angry and violent. His friend Herbie Worthington said Hendrix \"simply turned into a bastard\" when he drank. According to friend Sharon Lawrence, liquor \"set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise\".\nIn January 1968, the Experience travelled to Sweden to start a one-week tour of Europe. During the early morning hours of the first day, Hendrix got into a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen in Gothenburg, smashing a plate-glass window and injuring his right hand, for which he received medical treatment. The incident culminated in his arrest and release, pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine.\nIn 1969, Hendrix rented a house in Benedict Canyon, California, that was burglarized. Later, while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he accused his friend Paul Caruso of the theft, threw punches and stones at him, and chased him away from his house. A few days later Hendrix hit his girlfriend, Carmen Borrero, above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage, and gave her a cut that required stitches.\nPossession charge.\nHendrix was passing through customs at Toronto International Airport on May\u00a03, 1969, when authorities found a small amount of heroin and hashish in his luggage, and charged him with drug possession. He was released on $10,000 bail (), and was required to return on May\u00a05 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months leading up to his December 1969 trial. For the Crown to prove possession, they had to show that Hendrix knew that the drugs were there. During the jury trial, he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication which he put in his bag. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated that they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.\nDeath, post-mortem, and burial.\nDetails concerning Hendrix's last day and death are disputed. He spent much of September\u00a017, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she prepared a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel in Lansdowne Crescent, London, around 11\u00a0pm, when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove him to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45\u00a0am, where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3\u00a0am. She said that they talked until around 7\u00a0am, when they went to sleep. Dannemann awoke around 11 a.m. and found Hendrix breathing but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18\u00a0am, and it arrived nine minutes later. Ambulance staff then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbots Hospital where doctor John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45\u00a0p.m. on September\u00a018.\nCoroner Gavin Thurston ordered a post-mortem examination which was performed on September\u00a021 by Robert Donald Teare, a forensic pathologist. Thurston completed the inquest on September\u00a028 and concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. Citing \"insufficient evidence of the circumstances\", he declared an open verdict. Dannemann later revealed that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended dosage.\nDesmond Henley embalmed Hendrix's body, which was flown to Seattle on September\u00a029. Hendrix's family and friends held a service at Dunlap Baptist Church in Seattle's Rainier Valley on Thursday, October\u00a01; his body was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in nearby Renton, the location of his mother's grave. Family and friends traveled in 24 limousines, and more than 200 people attended the funeral, including Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, Miles Davis, John Hammond, and Johnny Winter.\nHendrix is often cited as one example of an allegedly disproportionate number of musicians dying at age 27, including Brian Jones, Alan Wilson, Jim Morrison, and Janis Joplin in the same era, a phenomenon referred to as the 27\u00a0Club.\nUnauthorized and posthumous releases.\nBy 1967, as Hendrix was gaining in popularity, many of his pre-Experience recordings were marketed to an unsuspecting public as Jimi Hendrix albums, sometimes with misleading later images of Hendrix. The recordings, which came under the control of producer Ed Chalpin of PPX, with whom Hendrix had signed a recording contract in 1965, were often re-mixed between their repeated reissues, and licensed to record companies such as Decca and Capitol. Hendrix publicly denounced the releases, describing them as \"malicious\" and \"greatly inferior\", stating: \"At PPX, we spent on average about one hour recording a song. Today I spend at least twelve hours on each song.\" These unauthorized releases have long constituted a substantial part of his recording catalogue, amounting to hundreds of albums.\nSome of Hendrix's unfinished fourth studio album was released as the 1971 title \"The Cry of Love\". Although the album reached number three in the US and number two in the UK, producers Mitchell and Kramer later complained that they were unable to make use of all the available songs because some tracks were used for 1971's \"Rainbow Bridge\"; still others were issued on 1972's \"War Heroes\". Material from \"The Cry of Love\" was re-released in 1997 as \"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\", along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include. Four years after Hendrix's death, producer Alan Douglas acquired the rights to produce unreleased music by Hendrix; he attracted criticism for using studio musicians to replace or add tracks.\nIn 1993, MCA Records delayed a multimillion-dollar sale of Hendrix's publishing copyrights because Al Hendrix was unhappy about the arrangement. He acknowledged that he had sold distribution rights to a foreign corporation in 1974, but stated that it did not include copyrights and argued that he had retained veto power of the sale of the catalogue. Under a settlement reached in July 1995, Al Hendrix regained control of his son's song and image rights. He subsequently licensed the recordings to MCA through the family-run company Experience Hendrix LLC, formed in 1995. In August 2009, Experience Hendrix announced that it had entered a new licensing agreement with Sony Music Entertainment's Legacy Recordings division, to take effect in 2010. Legacy and Experience Hendrix launched the 2010 Jimi Hendrix Catalog Project starting with the release of \"Valleys of Neptune\" in March of that year. In the months before his death, Hendrix recorded demos for a concept album tentatively titled \"Black Gold\", now in the possession of Experience Hendrix LLC, but it has not been released.\nEquipment.\nGuitars.\nHendrix played a variety of guitars but was most prominently associated with the Fender Stratocaster. He acquired his first in 1966, when a girlfriend loaned him enough money to purchase a used Stratocaster built around 1964. He used it often during performances and recordings. In 1967, he described the Stratocaster as \"the best all-around guitar for the stuff we're doing\"; he praised its \"bright treble and deep bass\".\nHendrix mainly played right-handed guitars that were turned upside down and restrung for left-hand playing. Because of the slant of the Stratocaster's bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound, while his highest string had a darker sound, the opposite of the intended design. Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs, a Gretsch Corvette, and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.\nAmplifiers.\nDuring 1965 and 1966, while Hendrix was playing back-up for soul and R&amp;B acts in the US, he used an 85-watt Fender Twin Reverb amplifier. When Chandler brought Hendrix to England in October 1966, he supplied him with 30-watt Burns amps, which Hendrix thought were too small for his needs. After an early London gig when he was unable to use his Fender Twin, he asked about the Marshall amps he had noticed other groups using. Years earlier, Mitch Mitchell had taken drum lessons from Marshall founder Jim Marshall, and he introduced Hendrix to Marshall. At their initial meeting, Hendrix bought four speaker cabinets and three 100-watt Super Lead amplifiers; he grew accustomed to using all three in unison. The equipment arrived on October 11, 1966, and the Experience used it during their first tour.\nMarshall amps were important to the development of Hendrix's overdriven sound and his use of feedback, creating what author Paul Trynka described as a \"definitive vocabulary for rock guitar\". Hendrix usually turned all the control knobs to the maximum level, which became known as the Hendrix setting. During the four years prior to his death, he purchased between 50 and 100 Marshall amplifiers. Jim Marshall said Hendrix was \"the greatest ambassador\" his company ever had.\nEffects.\nOne of Hendrix's signature effects was the wah-wah pedal, which he first heard used with an electric guitar in Cream's \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\", released in May 1967. That July, while performing at the Scene club in New York City, Hendrix met Frank Zappa, whose band the Mothers of Invention were performing at the adjacent Garrick Theater. Hendrix was fascinated by Zappa's application of the pedal, and he experimented with one later that evening. He used a wah pedal during the opening to \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\", creating one of the best-known wah-wah riffs of the classic rock era. He also uses the effect on \"Up from the Skies\", \"Little Miss Lover\", and \"Still Raining, Still Dreaming\".\nHendrix used a Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face and a Vox wah pedal during recording sessions and performances, but also experimented with other guitar effects. He enjoyed a fruitful long-term collaboration with electronics enthusiast Roger Mayer, whom he once called \"the secret\" of his sound. Mayer introduced him to the Octavia, an octave-doubling effect pedal, in December 1966, and he first recorded with it during the guitar solo to \"Purple Haze\".\nHendrix also used the Uni-Vibe, designed to simulate the modulation effects of a rotating Leslie speaker. He uses the effect during his performance at Woodstock and on the Band of Gypsys track \"Machine Gun\", which prominently features the Uni-vibe along with an Octavia and a Fuzz Face. For performances, he plugged his guitar into the wah-wah, which was connected to the Fuzz Face, then the Uni-Vibe, and finally a Marshall amplifier.\nInfluences.\nAs an adolescent in the 1950s, Hendrix became interested in rock and roll artists such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. In 1968, he told \"Guitar Player\" magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B. B. King inspired him during the beginning of his career; he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: \"I heard one of his records when I was a little boy and \"it scared me to death\" because I heard all of these \"sounds\".\" In 1970, he told \"Rolling Stone\" that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville, the television show the \"Grand Ole Opry\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI don't happen to know much about jazz. I know that most of those cats are playing nothing but blues, though\u2014I know that much.\n\u2014 Hendrix on jazz music\nCox stated that during their time serving in the US military, he and Hendrix primarily listened to southern blues artists such as Jimmy Reed and Albert King. According to Cox, \"King was a very, very powerful influence\". Howlin' Wolf also inspired Hendrix, who performed Wolf's \"Killing Floor\" as the opening song of his US debut at the Monterey Pop Festival. The influence of soul artist Curtis Mayfield can be heard in Hendrix's guitar playing, and the influence of Bob Dylan can be heard in Hendrix's songwriting; he was known to play Dylan's records repeatedly, particularly \"Highway 61 Revisited\" and \"Blonde on Blonde\".\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe changed everything. What \"don't\" we owe Jimi Hendrix? For his monumental rebooting of guitar culture \"standards of tone\", technique, gear, signal processing, rhythm playing, soloing, stage presence, chord voicings, charisma, fashion, and composition?\u00a0... He is guitar hero number one.\n\u2014 \"Guitar Player\" magazine, May 2012\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography for the Experience states: \"Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music. Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as wah-wah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll.\" Musicologist Andy Aledort described Hendrix as \"one of the most creative\" and \"influential musicians that has ever lived\". Music journalist Chuck Philips wrote: \"In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians, Hendrix has served as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers. His achievement was to reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s.\"\nHendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain. He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock. He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb. He applied this technique during the beginning bars of \"Little Wing\", which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand. Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing. He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings. Holly George-Warren of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\"\nWhile creating his unique musical voice and guitar style, Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&amp;B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock and roll, and jazz. Musicologist David Moskowitz emphasized the importance of blues music in Hendrix's playing style, and according to authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber, \"[He] explored the outer reaches of psychedelic rock\". His influence is evident in a variety of popular music formats, and he has contributed significantly to the development of hard rock, heavy metal, funk, post-punk, grunge, and hip hop music. His lasting influence on modern guitar players is difficult to overstate; his techniques and delivery have been abundantly imitated by others. Despite his hectic touring schedule and notorious perfectionism, he was a prolific recording artist who left behind numerous unreleased recordings. More than 40 years after his death, Hendrix remains as popular as ever, with annual album sales exceeding that of any year during his lifetime.\nAs with his contemporary Sly Stone, Hendrix embraced the experimentalism of white musicians in progressive rock in the late 1960s and inspired a wave of progressive soul musicians that emerged by the next decade. He has directly influenced numerous funk and funk rock artists, including Prince, George Clinton, John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic, and Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers. Hendrix influenced post-punk guitarists such as John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Robert Smith of The Cure. Grunge guitarists such as Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, and Mike McCready and Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam have cited Hendrix as an influence. Hendrix's influence also extends to many hip hop artists, including De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Digital Underground, Beastie Boys, and Run\u2013D.M.C. Miles Davis was deeply impressed by Hendrix, and he compared Hendrix's improvisational abilities with those of saxophonist John Coltrane. Desert blues artists from the Sahara desert region including Mdou Moctar and Tinariwen have also acknowledged Hendrix's influence.\nRock and roll fans still debate whether Hendrix actually said that Chicago co-founder Terry Kath was a better guitar player than he was, but Kath named Hendrix as a major influence: \"But then there was Hendrix, man. Jimi was really the last cat to freak me. Jimi was playing all the stuff I had in my head. I couldn't believe it, when I first heard him. Man, no one can ever do what he did with a guitar. No one can ever take his place.\"\nHendrix also influenced Black Sabbath, industrial artist Marilyn Manson, blues musician Stevie Ray Vaughan, Randy Hansen, Uli Jon Roth, Kiss's Ace Frehley, Metallica's Kirk Hammett, Aerosmith's Brad Whitford, Judas Priest's Richie Faulkner, instrumental rock guitarist Joe Satriani, King's X singer/bassist Doug Pinnick, Adrian Belew, and heavy metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, who said: \"[Hendrix] created modern electric playing, without question\u00a0... He was the first. He started it all. The rest is history.\" \"For many\", Hendrix was \"the preeminent black rocker\", according to Jon Caramanica. Members of the Soulquarians, an experimental black music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s, were influenced by the creative freedom in Hendrix's music and extensively used Electric Lady Studios to work on their own music.\nThe 90-minute 2015 documentary \"Jimi Hendrix \u2013 Electric Church\", broadcast by BBC Four in September 2025, features the 1970 Atlanta International Pop Festival, with Hendrix as the headline act, performing to the largest US audience of his career, of nearly 500,000 people, Byron, Georgia. The original concert film footage had lain undeveloped in the barn of film director Steve Rash for 30 years.\nRecognition and awards.\nHendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of \"Melody Maker\" voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, \"Billboard\" named him the Artist of the Year and \"Rolling Stone\" declared him the Performer of the Year. \"Disc and Music Echo\" honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, \"Guitar Player\" named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. \"Rolling Stone\" has ranked the band's three studio albums, \"Are You Experienced\" (1967), \"\" (1967), and \"Electric Ladyland\" (1968), in its various lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and it ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth-greatest artist of all time.\nHendrix received several prestigious rock music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of \"Melody Maker\" voted him the Pop Musician of the Year. In 1968, \"Rolling Stone\" declared him the Performer of the Year. Also in 1968, the City of Seattle gave him the keys to the city. \"Disc &amp; Music Echo\" newspaper honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970 \"Guitar Player\" magazine named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year.\n\"Rolling Stone\" ranked his three non-posthumous studio albums, \"Are You Experienced\" (1967), \"Axis: Bold as Love\" (1967), and \"Electric Ladyland\" (1968) among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They ranked Hendrix number one on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, and number six on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. \"Guitar World\"'s readers voted six of Hendrix's solos among the top 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time: \"Purple Haze\" (70), \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" (52; from \"Live at Woodstock\"), \"Machine Gun\" (32; from \"Band of Gypsys\"), \"Little Wing\" (18), \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" (11), and \"All Along the Watchtower\" (5). \"Rolling Stone\" placed seven of his recordings in their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: \"Purple Haze\" (17), \"All Along the Watchtower\" (47) \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" (102), \"Foxy Lady\" (153), \"Hey Joe\" (201), \"Little Wing\" (366), and \"The Wind Cries Mary\" (379). They also included three of Hendrix's songs in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\": \"Purple Haze\" (2), \"Voodoo Child\" (12), and \"Machine Gun\" (49).\nA star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was dedicated to Hendrix on November 14, 1991, at 6627 Hollywood Boulevard. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 1998, Hendrix was inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame during its first year. In 1999, readers of \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Guitar World\" ranked Hendrix among the most important musicians of the 20th century. In 2005, his debut album, \"Are You Experienced\", was one of 50 recordings added that year to the US National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress, \"[to] be preserved for all time\u00a0... [as] part of the nation's audio legacy\". In Seattle, November 27, 1992, which would have been Hendrix's 50th birthday, was made Jimi Hendrix Day, largely due to the efforts of his boyhood friend, guitarist Sammy Drain.\nThe blue plaque identifying Hendrix's former residence at 23 Brook Street, London, was the first issued by English Heritage to commemorate a pop star. Next door is the former residence of George Frideric Handel, 25 Brook Street, which opened to the public as the Handel House Museum in 2001. From 2016 the museum made use of the upper floors of 23 for displays about Hendrix and was rebranded as Handel &amp; Hendrix in London.\n\"The Electric Lady Studio Guitar\", a sculpture depicting Hendrix playing a Stratocaster, stands near the corner of Broadway and Pine Streets in Seattle. In May 2006, the city renamed a park near its Central District Jimi Hendrix Park, in his honor. In 2012, an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron, Georgia. The marker text reads, in part: \"Over thirty musical acts performed, including rock icon Jimi Hendrix playing to the largest American audience of his career.\"\nHendrix's music has received a number of Hall of Fame Grammy awards, starting with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992, followed by two Grammys in 1999 for his albums \"Are You Experienced\" and \"Electric Ladyland\"; \"Axis: Bold as Love\" received a Grammy in 2006. In 2000, he received a Hall of Fame Grammy award for his original composition, \"Purple Haze\", and in 2001, for his recording of Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\". Hendrix's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was honored with a Grammy in 2009.\nThe United States Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp honoring Hendrix in 2014. On August 21, 2016, Hendrix was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan. The James Marshall \"Jimi\" Hendrix United States Post Office in Renton Highlands near Seattle, about a mile from Hendrix's grave and memorial, was renamed for Hendrix in 2019.\nOn June 23, 2019, the Band of Gypsys were inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit, Michigan. Billy Cox, the last surviving member of the group, was on hand to accept, along with representatives of the Buddy Miles and Hendrix estates.\nA plaster lifecast of Hendrix's penis, created in 1968 by Cynthia Plaster Caster, was put on permanent display in the Icelandic Phallological Museum in 2022.\nDiscography.\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience\nJimi Hendrix/Band of Gypsys\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDocumentaries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16097", "revid": "20466351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16097", "title": "Johann Elert Bode", "text": "German astronomer (1747\u20131826)\nJohann Elert Bode (; 19 January 1747 \u2013 23 November 1826) was a German astronomer known for his reformulation and popularisation of the Titius\u2013Bode law. Bode determined the orbit of Uranus and suggested the planet's name.\nLife and career.\nBode was born in Hamburg. As a youth, he suffered from a serious eye disease that particularly damaged his right eye; he continued to have trouble with his eyes throughout his life.\nHis early promise in mathematics brought him to the attention of Johann Georg B\u00fcsch, who allowed Bode to use his own library for study.\nHe began his career with the publication of a short work on the solar eclipse of 5 August 1766. This was followed by an elementary treatise on astronomy entitled \"Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels\" (1768, 10th ed. 1844), the success of which led to his being invited to Berlin by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772 for the purpose of computing ephemerides on an improved plan. There in 1774, he founded the \"Astronomisches Jahrbuch\". He later compiled and issued 51 yearly volumes of it.\nHe became director of the Berlin Observatory in 1786, from which he retired in 1825.\nThere he published the \"Uranographia\" in 1801, a celestial atlas that aimed both at scientific accuracy in showing the positions of stars and other astronomical objects, as well as the artistic interpretation of the stellar constellation figures. The \"Uranographia\" marks the climax of an epoch of artistic representation of the constellations. Later atlases showed fewer and fewer elaborate figures until they were no longer printed on such tables.\nBode also published another small star atlas, intended for astronomical amateurs (\"Vorstellung der Gestirne\"). He is credited with the discovery of Bode's Galaxy (M81). Comet Bode (C/1779 A1) is named after him; its orbit was calculated by Erik Prosperin. Asteroid 998 Bodea, discovered on 6 August 1923 by Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg, was also christened in his honour, the letter 'a' added to its name to fulfil the convention that asteroids were given feminine names.\nHis name became attached to the 'law' discovered by Johann Daniel Titius in 1766. Bode first makes mention of it in the \"Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels\" in a footnote, and although it is often officially called the Titius\u2013Bode law, it is also commonly just called Bode's law. This law attempts to explain the distances of the planets from the Sun in a formula although ironically it breaks down for the planet Neptune which was later discovered in Berlin. It was the discovery of Uranus at a position predicted by the law which aroused great interest in it. There was a gap (with no planet) between Mars and Jupiter, and Bode urged a search for a planet in this region which culminated in a group formed for this purpose, the so-called \"celestial police\". However before the group initiated a search, they were trumped by the discovery of the asteroid Ceres by Giuseppe Piazzi from Palermo in 1801, at Bode's predicted position.\nLatterly, the law fell out of favour when it was realised that Ceres was only one of a small number of asteroids and when Neptune was found not to be in a position required by the law. The discovery of planets around other stars has brought the law back into discussion.\nBode himself was directly involved in research leading from the discovery of a planet \u2013 that of Uranus in 1781. Although Uranus was the first planet to be discovered by telescope, it is just about visible with the naked eye. Bode consulted older star charts and found numerous examples of the planet's position being given while being mistaken for a star, for example, John Flamsteed, Astronomer Royal in Britain, had listed it in his catalogue of 1690 as a star with the name \"34 Tauri\". These earlier sightings allowed an exact calculation of the orbit of the new planet.\nBode was also responsible for giving the new planet its name. The discoverer William Herschel proposed to name it after George III which was not accepted so readily in other countries. Bode opted for Uranus, with the apparent logic that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.\n There were further alternatives proposed, but ultimately Bode's suggestion became the most widely used \u2013 however it had to wait until 1850 before gaining official acceptance in Britain when the Nautical Almanac Office switched from using the name \"Georgium Sidus\" to \"Uranus\".\nIn 1789, Bode's Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth was inspired by Bode's name for the planet to name his newly discovered element \"uranit\", then changed to \"uranium\" in order to conform with the names of other metals.\nFrom 1787 to 1825 Bode was director of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. In 1794, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In April 1789 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.\nBode died in Berlin on 23 November 1826, aged 79.\n \"Verzeichniss\" (Containing the above star atlas, and including 5,058 stars observed by Flamsteed, Hevelius, T.

A member of the Democratic Party, Reno was the second-longest serving attorney general, behind only William Wirt, and the first woman to serve in the position.\nReno was born and raised in Miami, Florida. After leaving to attend Cornell University and Harvard Law School, she returned to Miami where she started her career at private law firms. Her first foray into government was as a staff member for the Judiciary Committee of the Florida House of Representatives. She then worked for the Dade County State Attorney's Office before returning to private practice. She was elected to the Office of State Attorney five times and was the first woman to serve as a state attorney in Florida. President Bill Clinton appointed her attorney general in 1993, a position she held until Clinton left office in 2001.\nEarly life and education.\nReno was born in Miami, Florida. Reno's mother, Jane Wallace (n\u00e9e Wood), wrote a weekly home improvement column for \"The Miami News\" under a male pseudonym and later became an investigative reporter for the paper. Janet's father, Henry Olaf Reno (n\u00e9 Rasmussen), was an emigrant from Denmark and a reporter for the \"Miami Herald\" for 43 years. Janet Reno had three younger siblings: Mark, writer Robert Reno, and Maggy Hurchalla. In 1943, the Reno family moved to a house in then-rural South Miami; it came with enough land to keep farm animals, including cows, chicken, ducks, goats, and turkeys. Reno helped her parents churn butter, which the family sold to make ends meet.\nAs the family expanded, they outgrew the house and couldn't afford a larger one. Jane Reno decided to build a new home herself near the Everglades, learning masonry, electrical work, and plumbing for the task. The Reno family moved to the house Jane built when Janet was 8 years old. The house would be Reno's lifelong home and a source of inspiration; she later said, \"the house is a symbol to me that you can do anything you really want if it's the right thing to do and you put your mind to it.\" The Renos' lot for the house originally was 21 acres, some of which they later sold to pay for the children's education.\nReno attended public school in Miami-Dade County, Florida. After she completed middle school in 1951, Reno's parents sent her to stay with her uncle who served as a U.S. military judge in Regensburg, Germany. There, Janet continued her education and traveled around Europe during breaks from school. After a year, Reno returned to Florida where she was a debating champion and salutatorian at Coral Gables Senior High School. In 1956 she enrolled at Cornell University, where she majored in chemistry, became president of the Women's Self-Government Association, and earned her room and board. After graduating from Cornell, Reno enrolled at Harvard Law School, one of 16 women in a class of 500 students. She graduated from Harvard in 1963.\nEarly career.\nFrom 1963 to 1971, Reno worked as an attorney for two Miami law firms. In 1971, she joined the staff of the Judiciary Committee of the Florida House of Representatives. The following year, Reno unsuccessfully ran for a seat in Florida's state house. In 1973, she worked on a project to revise the state's system of rules and regulations for criminal procedures. Later in the same year, she accepted a position with the Dade County State Attorney's Office led by Richard Gerstein. Shortly after joining the office, Gerstein made Reno his chief assistant. Reno did not try any cases during her time working for Gerstein. She worked for the Judiciary Circuit, and left the state attorney's office in 1976 to become a partner in a private law firm, Steel, Hector &amp; Davis. Gerstein decided to retire in 1977, creating a vacancy with Florida governor Reubin Askew to appoint a successor. Reno was one of two candidates Gerstein recommended to replace him.\nState Attorney.\nIn January 1978, Governor Askew appointed Reno the State Attorney for Dade County (now called Miami-Dade County). She was the first woman to serve as a state attorney in Florida. She was elected to the Office of State Attorney in November 1978 and was returned to office by the voters four more times. Reno ran as a liberal, pro-choice Democrat even though Miami-Dade was a conservative county. Reno did not always face serious challengers, although in 1984 Cuban-American lawyer Jose Garcia-Pedrosa ran against Reno, and picked up the endorsement of the \"Miami Herald\" editorial board. In spite of his support among Miami's Hispanic voters, Reno won the election decisively.\nThe office she led included 95 attorneys and an annual caseload that included 15,000 felonies and 40,000 misdemeanors. As state attorney, she developed a reputation for ethical behavior, going so far as to purchase a car at sticker price to avoid the appearance of impropriety.\nDrug court.\nShe established a drug court which was later replicated in other parts of the country. She worked actively in various civic organizations, including the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug Free Community and the Beacon Council, which was formed to address Miami-Dade's economic development.\nMcDuffie trial.\nIn May 1980, Reno prosecuted five white policemen who were accused of beating a black insurance salesman, Arthur McDuffie, to death. The policemen were all acquitted. During the resulting 1980 Miami riots, eighteen people were killed, with looters in Liberty City angrily chanting \"Reno! Reno! Reno!\" Reno met with nearly all of her critics, and a few months later, she won reelection in a landslide.\nChild abuse prosecutions.\nDuring Reno's tenure as state attorney, she began what the PBS series \"Frontline\" described as a \"crusade\" against accused child abusers. Reno pioneered the \"Miami Method\", \"a controversial technique for eliciting intimate details from young children and inspired passage of a law allowing them to testify by closed-circuit television, out of the possibly intimidating presence of their suspected molesters.\" Bobby Fijnje, \"a 14-year-old boy, was acquitted after his attorneys discredited the children's persistent interrogations by a psychologist who called herself the 'yucky secrets doctor'.\" Grant Snowden was acquitted, retried, convicted, and eventually freed by a federal appeals court after 12 years in prison.\"\nReno's \"model case\" was against Frank Fuster, co-owner of the Country Walk Babysitting Service in a suburb of Miami, Florida. In 1984, he was found guilty of 14 counts of abuse and sentenced to prison with a minimum of 165 years. Fuster was convicted based in large part on the testimony of his 18-year-old wife, Ileana Flores, who pleaded guilty and testified against him, after allegedly being tortured. In a 2002 episode of \"Frontline\", Flores maintained that she and her ex-husband were innocent, and that Reno personally pressured her to confess. The number and timing of Reno's visits are in dispute. As of 2020,[ [update]] Fuster remains imprisoned.\nIn 1989, as Florida state attorney, Reno pressed adult charges against 13-year-old Bobby Fijnje, who was accused of sexually molesting 21 children in his care during church services. The charges were driven by the testimony of children interviewed by mental-health professionals using techniques later discredited. Fijnje refused plea-bargain offers. During the trial, the prosecution was unable to present any witnesses to the alleged abuse. After two years of investigation and trial, Fijnje was acquitted of all charges.\nWhen Reno was nominated for attorney general in the Clinton administration, \"the Nation\" and \"Miami New Times\" raised questions about her handling of these cases, Debbie Nathan's journal article was faxed to the White House, and Fijnje's father (a Dutch diplomat) \"sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee\". However, Reno was not directly questioned about them. When she was asked in 2002, Reno said that she lacked the time to review the Country Walk case files.\nDeath penalty.\nAlthough Reno personally opposed the death penalty, her office secured 80 capital punishment convictions during her tenure. None of these were executed during her tenure, but five were later executed.\nU.S. Attorney General.\nPresident-elect Bill Clinton had vowed to assemble an administration that \"looked like America\", and it was widely assumed that one of the major cabinet posts would go to a woman. On February 11, 1993, Clinton introduced Reno as his nominee for United States Attorney General, stating that he wanted to hire a woman for the job but had also considered multiple male candidates. Both of his previous choices, Zo\u00eb Baird and Kimba Wood, faced problems because both had employed undocumented immigrants as nannies. Clinton said he had discounted Reno early in his search because she did not have experience in the Justice Department or federal law, but ultimately he came to understand that she had experience with a variety of criminal law issues from her role as State Attorney. On March 11, 1993, the Senate confirmed Reno by a vote of 98 to 0. She was sworn in the next day, becoming the first woman to serve as U.S. Attorney General. As Attorney General, Reno oversaw the Justice Department and its 95,000 employees. Reno remained Attorney General for the rest of Clinton's presidency, making her the longest-serving Attorney General since William Wirt in 1829.\nIn 1994, Reno tasked the Justice Department with compiling a report on DNA exoneration. The science was still new at that point in time. Reno commissioned the report after reading about the exoneration of a death row inmate. She wanted to know how many cases existed like the one she read about and what the Department of Justice could learn from it. The resulting report concluded there was a strong possibility that many more wrongful convictions that could be cleared with DNA evidence existed. Reno changed policies on how to interview eyewitnesses and laboratory protocols in response.\nThe following Department of Justice actions occurred during Reno's tenure:\nClinton administration investigations.\nIn 1994, Reno appointed Robert Fiske special counsel to investigate Bill Clinton's involvement in Whitewater, a controversy stemming from Clinton's business dealings during his time as Governor of Arkansas. Fiske wrapped up his criminal investigation within six months, and found no link between Whitewater and the suicide of former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Congress reauthorized the investigation and in August 1994, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals overseeing the special counsel refused to reappoint Fiske. The panel considered it a conflict of interest for Fiske to investigate Clinton because Reno, a member of the Clinton Administration, appointed Fiske. Instead, the panel appointed former member of the Reagan and Bush Administrations Ken Starr to continue the Whitewater investigation. Starr concluded the Whitewater investigation in December 1997 due to insufficient evidence. The following month, Starr received permission from Reno to redirect his probe into conduct related to the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky affairs. Starr's Report, issued in September 1998, listed eleven grounds for impeachment against Clinton.\nIn 1998, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, in a party line vote, voted to recommend the House cite Reno for contempt of Congress for not turning over two internal Justice Department memos related to a campaign finance controversy during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Reno contended she refused to turn over the documents sought because the documents would reveal prosecutor strategy in an ongoing investigation. Reno argued that her actions were in defense of the principle that prosecutors should be free of political influence. The full House of Representatives never voted on the resolution and the documents were turned over to the House.\nLater career.\nReno ran for Governor of Florida in 2002, but lost in the Democratic primary to Bill McBride 44% to 44.4%. Voting problems arose in the election, and she did not concede defeat until a week later.\nAfter her tenure as United States Attorney General and her unsuccessful gubernatorial bid, Reno toured the country giving speeches on topics relating to the criminal justice system. On March 31, 2006, she spoke at a criminology conference at the University of Pennsylvania. She stated that she believed the education system in the United States needs to be improved, as there is a link between the quality of education and the crime rate. She also believed that too much money has been diverted away from the juvenile court system and that the government should find some way to make the juvenile courts work effectively, so as to prevent problems in troubled children and adolescents before these problems are exacerbated by the time they reach adulthood.\nReno was a founding member of the board of directors for the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization which assists prisoners who may be exonerated through DNA testing, in 2004. By 2013 she was director emeritus of the board of directors.\nPersonal life.\nReno never married and did not have children. She took Spanish lessons during her time as state attorney. She remained active after her diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in 1995; she learned inline skating in 1996. After her mother's death in 1992, Reno inherited her childhood home. In response to a 1998 \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, which portrayed her as lonely, former Justice Department public affairs director Carl Stern said, \"Both in Florida and in Washington she has a great many friends whose homes she visits, and she goes to plays, her dance card is full.\"\nDeath.\nReno died from Parkinson's disease on November 7, 2016. She was surrounded by friends and family at the end of her life, including her sister Maggy and her goddaughter. Upon her death, President Barack Obama praised Reno for her \"intellect, integrity, and fierce commitment to justice\" and President Clinton released a statement thanking Reno \"for her service, counsel, and friendship\".\nAwards and honors.\n\"Glamour\" magazine named Reno one of its \"Women of the Year\" for 1993. In 2000, Reno was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In March 2008, Reno received the Council on Litigation Management's Professionalism Award, which recognizes and commemorates an individual who has demonstrated the unique ability to lead others by example in the highest standard of their profession.\nOn April 17, 2009, Reno was awarded the Justice Award by the American Judicature Society. Eric Holder, Attorney General in the Obama Administration, presented the award to Reno. Seth Andersen, Executive Vice President of AJS said the award recognizes \"her commitment to improving our systems of justice and educating Americans about our great common enterprise \u2013 to ensure equality under the law\". The award is the highest given by the AJS, and recognizes significant contributions toward improvements in the administration of justice within the United States.\nIn popular culture.\nReno had a higher profile than many of her immediate predecessors. She appeared on the cover of \"Time\" and was the subject of a \"Vanity Fair\" profile.\nFour days after the seizure of Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Reno was featured in the \"South Park\" episode \"Quintuplets 2000\".\nLate night hosts frequently joked about her height and perceived lack of traditional femininity, and Will Ferrell repeatedly portrayed Reno on \"Saturday Night Live\". In 2001, Reno appeared alongside Ferrell on \"Saturday Night Live\" in the final installment of the recurring sketch \"Janet Reno's Dance Party\".\nIn a 2007 Super Bowl XLI TV commercial, Reno was among the guests at Chad Ochocinco's Super Bowl party.\nReno curated a compilation of old-time American songs performed by contemporary artists, titled \"Song of America\". Reno worked with music producer Ed Pettersen (her niece's husband) on the project. Reno said her goal with the project was to share music with her great-nieces and great-nephews.\nIn 2013, Reno voiced herself for the \"Dark Knight Court\" episode of \"The Simpsons\".\nShe was depicted by Jane Lynch in \"\", a fictionalized account of the true story of the FBI's hunt for the Unabomber.\nAnquette, an R&amp;B girl group from Miami, dedicated a song to her on their 1988 album \"Respect\".\nThe Offspring's 2001 song \"Original Prankster\" from their album \"Conspiracy of One\" mentioned her.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16103", "revid": "36320931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16103", "title": "John Wayne", "text": "American actor (1907\u20131979)\nMarion Robert Morrison (May 26, 1907 \u2013 June 11, 1979), known professionally as John Wayne, was an American actor. Nicknamed \"Duke\", he became a popular icon through his starring roles in films which were produced during Hollywood's Golden Age, especially in Western and war movies. His career flourished from the silent film era of the 1920s through the American New Wave, as he appeared in a total of 179 film and television productions. He was among the top box-office draws for three decades and appeared with many other important Hollywood stars of his era. In 1999, the American Film Institute selected Wayne as one of the greatest male stars of classic American cinema.\nWayne was born in Winterset, Iowa, but grew up in Southern California. After losing his football scholarship to the University of Southern California due to a bodysurfing accident, he began working for the Fox Film Corporation. He appeared mostly in small parts, but his first leading role came in Raoul Walsh's Western \"The Big Trail\" (1930), an early widescreen film epic that was a box-office failure. He played leading roles in numerous B movies during the 1930s, most of them also Westerns, without becoming a major name. John Ford's \"Stagecoach\" (1939) made Wayne a mainstream star, and he starred in 142 motion pictures altogether. According to biographer Ronald Davis, \"John Wayne personified for millions the nation's frontier heritage.\"\nWayne's other roles in Westerns included a cattleman driving his herd on the Chisholm Trail in \"Red River\" (1948), a Civil War veteran whose niece is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in \"The Searchers\" (1956), a troubled rancher competing with a lawyer (James Stewart) for a woman's hand in \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962), and a cantankerous one-eyed marshal in \"True Grit\" (1969), for which he received the Academy Award for Best Actor. Wayne is also remembered for his roles in \"The Quiet Man\" (1952) with Maureen O'Hara, \"Rio Bravo\" (1959) with Dean Martin, and \"The Longest Day\" (1962). In his final screen performance, he starred as an aging gunfighter suffering from cancer in \"The Shootist\" (1976). Wayne made his last public appearance at the Academy Awards ceremony on April 9, 1979, and died of stomach cancer two months later. In 1980, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor of the United States.\nEarly life.\nWayne was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, at 224 South Second Street in Winterset, Iowa. The local paper, \"Winterset Madisonian\", reported on page 4 of the edition of May 30, 1907, that Wayne weighed 13\u00a0lb (around 6\u00a0kg) at birth. Wayne claimed his middle name was soon changed from Robert to Michael when his parents decided to name their next son Robert, but extensive research has found no such legal change, although it might have been changed informally or the documentation may have been lost. Wayne's legal name apparently remained Marion Robert Morrison his entire life, although to this day his original name is almost always referred to as Marion Michael Morrison.\nWayne's father, Clyde Leonard Morrison (1884\u20131937), was the son of Marion Mitchell Morrison (1845\u20131915), a veteran who had served in the Union army during the American Civil War. Wayne's mother, the former Mary \"Molly\" Alberta Brown (1885\u20131970), was from Lancaster County, Nebraska. Wayne had Scottish, Scotch-Irish, English, and Irish ancestry. His great-great-grandfather Robert Morrison (b. 1782) left County Antrim, Ireland, with his mother, arriving in New York in 1799 and eventually settling in Adams County, Ohio. The Morrisons were originally from the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. He was raised Presbyterian.\nWayne's family moved to Palmdale, California, and then in 1916 to Glendale at 404 Isabel Street, where his father worked as a pharmacist. He attended Glendale Union High School, where he performed well in both sports and academics. Wayne was part of his high school's football team and its debating team. He was also the president of the Latin Society and contributed to the school's newspaper sports column.\nA local fireman at the station on his route to school in Glendale started calling him \"Little Duke\" because he never went anywhere without his huge Airedale Terrier, Duke. He preferred \"Duke\" to \"Marion\", and the nickname stuck. Wayne attended Wilson Middle School in Glendale. As a teen, he worked in an ice-cream shop for a man who shod horses for Hollywood studios. He was also active as a member of the Order of DeMolay, which he was later inducted into the Hall of Fame. He played football for the 1924 league champion Glendale High School team.\nWayne applied to the U.S. Naval Academy, but was not accepted due to poor grades. Instead, he attended the University of Southern California (USC), majoring in pre-law. He was a member of the Trojan Knights and Sigma Chi fraternities. Wayne, who stood tall, also played on the USC football team under coach Howard Jones. A broken collarbone injury curtailed his athletic career; Wayne later noted that he was too terrified of Jones' reaction to reveal the actual cause of his injury, a bodysurfing accident. He lost his athletic scholarship and, without funds, had to leave the university.\nCareer.\nEarly works and first lead role.\nAs a favor to coach Jones, who had given silent Western film star Tom Mix tickets to USC games, director John Ford and Mix hired Wayne as a prop boy and extra. Wayne later credited his walk, talk, and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. Wayne soon moved to bit parts, establishing a longtime friendship with Ford, the director who provided most of those roles. Early in this period, he had a minor, uncredited role as a guard in the 1926 film \"Bardelys the Magnificent\". Wayne also appeared with his USC teammates playing football in \"Brown of Harvard\" (1926), \"The Dropkick\" (1927), and \"Salute\" (1929) and Columbia's \"Maker of Men\" (filmed in 1930, released in 1931). While working for Fox Film Corporation in bit roles, Wayne was given on-screen credit as \"Duke Morrison\" only once, in \"Words and Music\" (1929). Director Raoul Walsh saw him moving studio furniture while working as a prop boy and cast him in his first starring role in \"The Big Trail\" (1930). For his screen name, Walsh suggested \"Anthony Wayne\", after Revolutionary War General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne. Fox Studios chief Winfield Sheehan rejected it as sounding \"too Italian\". Walsh then suggested \"John Wayne\". Sheehan agreed, and the name was set. Wayne was not even present for the discussion. His pay was raised to $105 a week.\n\"The Big Trail\" was to be the first big-budget outdoor spectacle of the sound era, made at a then-staggering cost over $2\u00a0million (over $32.8\u00a0million equivalent in 2021), using hundreds of extras and wide vistas of the American Southwest, still largely unpopulated at the time. To take advantage of the breathtaking scenery, it was filmed in two versions, a standard 35 mm version and another in the new 70 mm Grandeur film process, using an innovative camera and lenses. Many in the audience who saw it in Grandeur stood and cheered, but only a handful of theaters were equipped to show the film in its widescreen process, and the effort was largely wasted at the time. The film was considered a huge box-office flop at the time, but came to be highly regarded by modern critics.\nSubsequent films and breakthrough.\nAfter the commercial failure of \"The Big Trail\", Wayne was relegated to small roles in A pictures, including Columbia's \"The Deceiver\" (1931), in which he played a corpse. He appeared in the serial \"The Three Musketeers\" (1933), an updated version of the Alexandre Dumas novel in which the protagonists were soldiers in the French Foreign Legion in then-contemporary North Africa. He played the lead, with his name over the title, in many low-budget Poverty Row Westerns, mostly at Monogram Pictures and serials for Mascot Pictures Corporation. By Wayne's own estimation, he appeared in about 80 of these horse operas from 1930 to 1939. In \"Riders of Destiny\" (1933), he became one of the first singing cowboys of film, albeit via dubbing. Wayne also appeared in some of the \"Three Mesquiteers\" Westerns, whose title was a play on the Dumas classic. He was mentored by stuntmen in riding and other Western skills. Stuntman Yakima Canutt and Wayne developed and perfected stunts and onscreen fisticuffs techniques that are still in use. One of the main innovations with which Wayne is credited in these early Poverty Row Westerns is allowing the good guys to fight as convincingly as the bad guys, by not always making them fight clean. Wayne claimed, \"Before I came along, it was standard practice that the hero must always fight clean. The heavy was allowed to hit the hero in the head with a chair or throw a kerosene lamp at him or kick him in the stomach, but the hero could only knock the villain down politely and then wait until he rose. I changed all that. I threw chairs and lamps. I fought hard and I fought dirty. I fought to win.\"\nWayne's second breakthrough role came with John Ford's \"Stagecoach\" (1939). Because of Wayne's B-movie status and track record in low-budget Westerns throughout the 1930s, Ford had difficulty getting financing for what was to be an A-budget film. After rejection by all the major studios, Ford struck a deal with independent producer Walter Wanger in which Claire Trevor\u2014a much bigger star at the time\u2014received top billing. \"Stagecoach\" was a huge critical and financial success, and Wayne became a mainstream star. Cast member Louise Platt credited Ford as saying at the time that Wayne would become the biggest star ever because of his appeal as the archetypal \"everyman\".\n1940s.\nAmerica's entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status (classified as 3-A \u2013 family deferment). Wayne repeatedly wrote to Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit. Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him, since he was their only A-list actor under contract. Herbert J. Yates, president of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract, and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.\nU.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne, in fact, did make an application to serve in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), precursor to the modern CIA, but his bid was ultimately unsuccessful. Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944, with the United Service Organizations (USO). During this trip, he carried out a request from William J. Donovan, head of the OSS, to assess whether General Douglas MacArthur, commander of the South West Pacific Area, or his staff were hindering the work of the OSS. Donovan later issued Wayne an OSS Certificate of Service to memorialize Wayne's contribution to the OSS mission. By many accounts, his failure to serve in the military later became the most painful part of his life. His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: \"He would become a 'superpatriot' for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home.\"\nWayne's first color film was \"The Shepherd of the Hills\" (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend Harry Carey. The following year, he appeared in his only film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the Technicolor epic \"Reap the Wild Wind\" (1942), in which he co-starred with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values.\nLike most Hollywood stars of his era, Wayne appeared as a guest on radio programs, such as: \"The Hedda Hopper Show\" and \"The Louella Parsons Show\". He made a number of appearances in dramatic roles, mainly recreations for radio of his own film roles, on such programs as \"Screen Directors Playhouse\" and \"Lux Radio Theatre\". For six months in 1942, Wayne starred in his own radio adventure series, \"Three Sheets to the Wind\", produced by film director Tay Garnett. In the series, an international spy/detective show, Wayne played Dan O'Brien, a detective who used alcoholism as a mask for his investigatory endeavors. The show was intended by Garnett to be a pilot of sorts for a film version, though the motion picture never came to fruition. No episodes of the series featuring Wayne seem to have survived, though a demonstration episode with Brian Donlevy in the leading role does exist. Wayne, not Donlevy, played the role throughout the series' run on NBC. Director Robert Rossen offered to Wayne the starring role in \"All the King's Men\" (1949), but Wayne refused, believing the script to be \"un-American in many ways.\" Broderick Crawford, who was eventually cast in the role, won the 1949 Oscar for Best Actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" (1949).\n1950s.\nHe lost the leading role of Jimmy Ringo in \"The Gunfighter\" (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted, but for which he refused to bend.\nBatjac, the production company co-founded by Wayne in 1952, was named after the fictional shipping company Batjak in \"Wake of the Red Witch\" (1948), a film based on the novel by Garland Roark. (A spelling error by Wayne's secretary was allowed to stand, accounting for the variation.) Batjac (and its predecessor, Wayne-Fellows Productions) was the arm through which Wayne produced many films for himself and other stars. Its best-known non-Wayne productions were \"Seven Men From Now\" (1956), which started the classic collaboration between director Budd Boetticher and star Randolph Scott, and \"Gun the Man Down\" (1956) with contract player James Arness as an outlaw.\nOne of Wayne's most popular roles was in \"The High and the Mighty\" (1954), directed by William Wellman, and based on a novel by Ernest K. Gann. His portrayal of a heroic copilot won widespread acclaim. Wayne also portrayed aviators in \"Flying Tigers\" (1942), \"Flying Leathernecks\" (1951), \"Island in the Sky\" (1953), \"The Wings of Eagles\" (1957), and \"Jet Pilot\" (1957).\nHe appeared in nearly two dozen of John Ford's films over 20 years, including \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" (1949), \"The Quiet Man\" (1952), and \"The Searchers\" (1956). The latter film was the first one in which he called someone \"Pilgrim\", and is often considered to contain Wayne's finest and most complex performance.\nOn May 14, 1958, Hal Kanter's \"I Married a Woman\" starring George Gobel and Diana Dors had its Los Angeles opening. In it, Wayne had a cameo as himself. On October 2, John Huston's \"The Barbarian and the Geisha\", in which Wayne played the lead and clashed with his director all the way, had its New York opening.\nHoward Hawks's \"Rio Bravo\" premiered on March 18, 1959. In it, Wayne plays the lead with a supporting cast including Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan and Ward Bond. Ford's \"The Horse Soldiers\" had its world premiere in Shreveport, Louisiana on June 18. Set during the Civil War, Wayne shares the lead with William Holden.\nWayne notoriously portrayed Genghis Khan in \"The Conqueror\" (1956), which was panned by critics.\n1960s.\nIn 1960, Wayne directed and produced \"The Alamo\", his directorial debut, portraying Davy Crockett, with Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie. Wayne was nominated for an Oscar as the producer in the Best Picture category. That year Wayne also played the lead in Henry Hathaway's \"North to Alaska\", also starring Stewart Granger and Ernie Kovacs. In 1961, Wayne shared the lead with Stuart Whitman in Michael Curtiz's \"The Comancheros\".\nIn 1962, Wayne starred in John Ford's \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" with James Stewart. May 29 marked the premiere of Howard Hawks' \"Hatari!\", shot on location in Africa with Wayne playing the lead capturing wild animals from the beds of trucks; all the scenes with animals in the film are real. On October 4, \"The Longest Day\" started its theatrical run, with Wayne memorably acting with an ensemble cast. Although the other top-level actors in the film accepted a token payment of only $10,000 each to play their roles, making the all-star cast feasible for the budget, Wayne was paid a quarter of a million dollars due to an earlier dispute with producer Darryl F. Zanuck. During this time, the cast of the television drama, \"Combat!\", were preparing for the inaugural season. The principal cast (including Vic Morrow) were to go through a week of basic training at the Army's Infantry Training Center at Fort Ord in northern California. Morrow noted that the instructors who worked with the cast at Fort Ord had one common request: not to act like John Wayne. \"Poor John,\" Morrow told a reporter. \"I wonder if he knows he's almost a dirty word in the Army.\"\nIn 1963, Wayne acted in a segment of \"How the West Was Won\", directed by Ford. On June 12, Wayne played the lead in his final Ford film, \"Donovan's Reef\", co-starring Lee Marvin. On November 13, another film starring Wayne premiered, Andrew V. McLaglen's \"McLintock!\", once again opposite Maureen O'Hara.\nIn 1964, Wayne played the leading role in Hathaway's \"Circus World\" with Claudia Cardinale and Rita Hayworth.\nIn 1965, Wayne played the brief cameo role of a centurion in George Stevens's \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\". On April 6, he shared the screen with Kirk Douglas and Patricia Neal in Otto Preminger's \"In Harm's Way\". On June 13, he acted in Hathaway's \"The Sons of Katie Elder\" with Dean Martin.\nIn 1966, Wayne appeared in a cameo role for Melville Shavelson's \"Cast a Giant Shadow\" starring Douglas.\nIn 1967, Wayne played the lead in Burt Kennedy's \"The War Wagon\" with Douglas as the second lead. His second movie that year, Hawks' \"El Dorado\", a highly successful partial remake of \"Rio Bravo\" with Robert Mitchum playing Martin's original role, premiered on June 7.\nIn 1968, Wayne co-directed with Ray Kellogg \"The Green Berets\", the only major film made during the Vietnam War in support of the war. Wayne wanted to make this movie because at that time Hollywood had little interest in making movies about the Vietnam War. During the filming of \"The Green Berets\", the Degar or Montagnard people of Vietnam's Central Highlands, fierce fighters against communism, bestowed on Wayne a brass bracelet that he wore in the film and all subsequent films. Also that year, Wayne played the lead in Andrew V. McLaglen's \"Hellfighters\", a film about the crews who put out oil rig fires. Katharine Ross played a supporting role.\nOn June 13, 1969, Hathaway's \"True Grit\" premiered. For his role as Rooster Cogburn, Wayne won the Best Actor Oscar at the 42nd Academy Awards. In November of that year another film starring Wayne was released, Andrew V. McLaglen's \"The Undefeated\" with Rock Hudson.\n1970s: later career.\nOn June 24, 1970, Andrew V. McLaglen's \"Chisum\" started to play in cinemas. Wayne took the role of the owner of a cattle ranch, who finds out that a businessman is trying to own neighboring land illegally. On September 16, Howard Hawks' \"Rio Lobo\" premiered. Wayne played Col. Cord McNally, who confronts Confederate soldiers who stole a shipment of gold at the end of the Civil War. This was another remake of \"Rio Bravo\", albeit without a second lead the box office caliber of Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum.\nIn June 1971, George Sherman's \"Big Jake\" made its debut. Wayne played the role of an estranged father who must track down a gang who kidnapped his grandson. The film was a critically acclaimed hit.\nIn 1972, Wayne starred in Mark Rydell's \"The Cowboys\". Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\", who did not particularly care for the film, wrote: \"Wayne is, of course, marvelously indestructible, and he has become an almost perfect father figure\". The same year, he was selected in the last round of the NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons for his past football experience, though the pick was disallowed by league officials as he was 64 years old at the time.\nOn February 7, 1973, Burt Kennedy's \"The Train Robbers\" opened; Wayne appeared alongside Ann-Margret, Rod Taylor and Ben Johnson. On June 27, Andrew V. McLaglen's \"Cahill U.S. Marshal\" premiered, with Wayne, George Kennedy and Gary Grimes. It was a box office failure.\nIn 1974, Wayne took on the role of the eponymous detective in John Sturges's crime drama \"McQ\".\nOn March 25, 1975, Douglas Hickox's \"Brannigan\" premiered. In it, Wayne played a Chicago police lieutenant named Jim Brannigan on the hunt in London for an organized-crime leader. On October 17, \"Rooster Cogburn\" started its theatrical run; Wayne reprised his role as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn with strong elements of the plot of \"The African Queen\" along with Katharine Hepburn as his leading lady.\nIn 1976, Wayne starred in Don Siegel's \"The Shootist\", also starring Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard and James Stewart. It was Wayne's final cinematic role, whose main character, J. B. Books, was dying of cancer, to which Wayne himself succumbed three years later. It contains numerous plot similarities to \"The Gunfighter\" of nearly 30 years before, a role which Wayne had wanted, but turned down. Upon its theatrical release, it grossed $13,406,138 domestically. About $6 million were earned as US theatrical rentals. The film received positive reviews. It was named one of the Ten Best Films of 1976 by the National Board of Review. Film critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" ranked \"The Shootist\" number 10 on his list of the 10 best films of 1976. The film was nominated for an Oscar, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA film award, and a Writers Guild of America award.\nPersonal life.\nWayne was married three times and divorced twice. His wives included one of Spanish American descent, Josephine Alicia Saenz, and two from Latin America, Esperanza Baur and Pilar Pallete. He had four children with Josephine: Michael Wayne (1934\u20132003), Mary Antonia \"Toni\" Wayne LaCava (1936\u20132000), Patrick Wayne (born 1939), and Melinda Wayne Munoz (1940\u20132022). He had three more children with Pilar: Aissa Wayne (born 1956), John Ethan Wayne (born 1962), and Marisa Wayne (born 1966).\nSeveral of Wayne's children entered the film and television industry. Son Ethan was billed as John Ethan Wayne in a few films, and played one of the leads in the 1990s update of the \"Adam-12\" television series. Ethan has also appeared on the History Channel show \"Pawn Stars\" to help authenticate merchandise supposedly related to his father's career. Granddaughter Jennifer Wayne, daughter of Aissa, is a member of the country music group Runaway June.\nIn 1973, Wayne was encouraged by Pilar, an avid tennis player, to build the John Wayne Tennis Club in Newport Beach, California. In 1995, the club was sold to Ken Stuart, former general manager, and became the Palisades Tennis Club. In \"The Quiet Man\" (1952), Wayne tells Michaeleen \"\u00d3g\", (Irish: Young), Flynn (portrayed by Barry Fitzgerald) that he is six feet \"four and a half\" (194\u00a0cm), an assertion corroborated by Pilar's book \"John Wayne: My Life With the Duke\".\nHis divorce from Baur, a Mexican former actress, was stormy. She believed that Wayne and co-star Gail Russell were having an affair, a claim that both Wayne and Russell denied. The night the film \"Angel and the Badman\" (1947) wrapped, the usual party was held for cast and crew, and Wayne came home very late. Esperanza was in a drunken rage by the time he arrived, and she attempted to shoot him as he walked through the front door.\nWayne had several high-profile affairs, including one with Merle Oberon that lasted from 1938 to 1947. After his separation from Pilar, in 1973, Wayne became romantically involved and lived with his former secretary Pat Stacy (1941\u20131995) until his death in 1979. Stacy published a book about her life with him in 1983, titled \"Duke: A Love Story\".\nWayne's hair began to thin in the 1940s, and he had begun to wear a hairpiece by the end of the decade. He was occasionally seen in public without the hairpiece (such as, according to \"Life\", at Gary Cooper's funeral). During an appearance at Harvard University, Wayne was asked by a student, \"Is it true that your toup\u00e9e is real mohair?\" He responded: \"sir, that's real hair. Not mine, but real hair.\"\nA close friend, California Congressman Alphonzo E. Bell Jr., wrote of Wayne: \"Duke's personality and sense of humor were very close to what the general public saw on the big screen. It is perhaps best shown in these words he had engraved on a plaque: 'Each of us is a mixture of some good and some not so good qualities. In considering one's fellow man, it's important to remember the good things.[...] We should refrain from making judgments just because a fella happens to be a dirty, rotten S.O.B.'\"\nWayne was fond of literature, his favorite authors being Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Agatha Christie. His favorite books were \"David Copperfield\", and Conan Doyle's historical novels \"The White Company\" and \"Sir Nigel\".\nWayne was a chess player. Roger Ebert recalls that on the set of \"Chisum\", \"we were playing a chess game, both of us bending over the board on an upended apple crate. Wayne, slouched in his old stitched leather director's chair, had a crowd of kibitzers: wranglers, extras, old cronies, drinking buddies, a couple of Mexican stuntmen. He studied the board, roared with laughter, and said, 'God...damn it! You've trapped my queen!' We studied the board. I made a decisive move. 'Why the hell did I just say that?' he asked. If I hadn't-a...said it, you wouldn't-a...seen it.'\" According to Michael Munn, when Wayne was asked about Rock Hudson's sexuality, he replied, \"Who the hell cares if he's a queer? The man plays great chess.\"\nHe used the same 1873 Colt Single Action Army revolver in many of the Westerns in which he appeared.\nWayne had been a chain smoker of cigarettes since young adulthood and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1964. He underwent successful surgery to remove his entire left lung and two ribs. Despite efforts by his business associates to prevent him from going public with his illness for fear that it would cost him work, Wayne announced he had cancer and called on the public to get preventive examinations. Five years later, Wayne was declared cancer-free. Wayne has been credited with coining the term \"the Big C\" as a euphemism for cancer. Wayne biographer Michael Munn chronicled Wayne's drinking habits. According to Sam O'Steen's memoir, \"Cut to the Chase\", studio directors knew to shoot Wayne's scenes before noon, because by afternoon, he \"was a mean drunk\". Ebert quotes him as saying: \"Tequila makes your head hurt. Not from your hangover. From falling over and hitting your head.\"\nWayne was a very active Freemason. He was made a Master Mason at Marion McDaniel Lodge No. 56 F&amp;AM, in Tucson, Arizona. He became a 32nd Degree Scottish Rite Mason and later joined the Al Malaikah Shrine Temple in Los Angeles, along with fellow actor Roy Rogers. He later became a member of the York Rite. During his childhood, he was a member of a local Demolay chapter in Glendale.\nDuring the early 1960s, Wayne traveled often to Panama, and he purchased the island of Taborcillo off that nation's Pacific coast. It was sold by his estate at his death.\nWayne's yacht, the \"Wild Goose\", was one of his favorite possessions. He kept it docked in Newport Beach Harbor, and it was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\nPolitical and social views.\nThroughout most of his life, Wayne was a vocally prominent conservative Republican in Hollywood, supporting anti-communist positions. However, he voted for Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election and expressed admiration for Roosevelt's successor, fellow Democratic President Harry S. Truman, despite having supported Republican candidate Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. He took part in creating the conservative Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in February 1944 before being elected its president in 1949. An ardent anti-communist and vocal supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), he made \"Big Jim McLain\" (1952) with himself as a HUAC investigator to demonstrate his support for the cause of anti-communism. His personal views found expression as a proactive inside enforcer of the \"Black List\", denying employment and undermining careers of many actors and writers who had expressed their personal political beliefs earlier in life. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin is alleged to have said that Wayne should be assassinated for his frequently espoused anti-communist politics, despite being a fan of his movies. Wayne was a supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy.\nWayne supported Vice President Richard Nixon in the presidential election of 1960, but expressed his vision of patriotism when John F. Kennedy won the election: \"I didn't vote for him, but he's my president, and I hope he does a good job.\" He used his star power to support conservative causes, including rallying support for the Vietnam War by producing, co-directing, and starring in the financially successful film \"The Green Berets\" (1968). In 1960, he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society, but quit after the organization denounced fluoridation of water supplies as a communist plot. In 1964, Wayne was a staunch supporter of Barry Goldwater, and actively campaigned for him.\nDue to his status as the highest-profile Republican star in Hollywood, wealthy Texas Republican Party backers asked Wayne to run for national office in 1968, like his friend and fellow actor Senator George Murphy. He declined, joking that he did not believe the public would seriously consider an actor in the White House. Instead, he supported his friend Ronald Reagan's campaigns for Governor of California in 1966 and 1970. He was asked to be the running mate for Democratic Alabama Governor George Wallace, who had been nominated for president by the American Independent Party, in his 1968 campaign, but he immediately rejected the offer and actively campaigned for Nixon; Wayne addressed the 1968 Republican National Convention on its opening day.\nIn 1971, Wayne wrote to President Nixon, who was a friend, to oppose Nixon's planned trip to China. Wayne enclosed some hate literature on \"that Jew, Kissinger,\" who had negotiated the historic meeting with Chinese leaders.\nWayne openly differed with many conservatives over the issue of returning the Panama Canal, as he supported the Panama Canal Treaty in the mid-1970s; while Republican leaders such as Reagan, Jesse Helms, and Strom Thurmond had wanted the U.S. to retain full control of the canal, Wayne and fellow conservative William F. Buckley believed that the Panamanians had the right to the canal and sided with President Jimmy Carter. Wayne was a close friend of Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos Herrera, and Wayne's first wife Josephine was a native of Panama. His support of the treaty brought him hate mail for the first time in his life.\nIn 1973, actor Marlon Brando refused an Oscar he had won, due to \"the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry\"; Brando did not attend the award ceremony but asked Native American civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to attend and deliver a refusal speech in the event that he won. Wayne was allegedly waiting in the wings and was so angry about her presence there that Littlefeather said \"he was coming towards me to forcibly take me off the stage, and he had to be restrained by six security men to prevent him from doing so.\" However, an investigation in 2022 found that this is unlikely to have happened, and Littlefeather had no way of witnessing this take place.\nRoger Ebert wrote that Wayne had a sense of humor about his politics. He recalls Wayne giving him a tour of his house: \"He pointed out autographed photos of Eisenhower, Nixon, Goldwater, and J. Edgar Hoover. I said I had to take a pee. On the wall of the bathroom opening off the den, he had a photo of Hubert Humphrey, inscribed 'with warm appreciation for your continued Support.'\" Colorado Congresswoman Pat Schroeder recalled that \"John Wayne gave me a silver cigarette lighter during the Vietnam War that said 'Fuck Communism' on it. I didn't know how to do that. I still don't.\"\nLeft-wing activist Abbie Hoffman paid tribute to Wayne's singularity, saying, \"I like Wayne's wholeness, his style. As for his politics, well\u2014I suppose even cavemen felt a little admiration for the dinosaurs that were trying to gobble them up.\" Maoist avant garde film maker and critic Jean Luc Godard, in his \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" text \"3000 heures de cin\u00e9ma\" (\"3000 hours of cinema\"), asked rhetorically:How can I hate John Wayne upholding Goldwater and yet love him when abruptly he takes Natalie Wood in his arms in the last reel of \"The Searchers\"?\nIn a video clip which aired posthumously on People for the American Way's 1982 \"I Love Liberty\" TV special, Wayne stated that while he disagreed with Jane Fonda, he still believed she had the right to say what she believes.\n1971 \"Playboy\" interview.\nIn May 1971, \"Playboy\" magazine published an interview with Wayne, in which he expressed his support for the Vietnam War, and made headlines for his opinions about social issues and race relations in the United States:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;With a lot of blacks, there's quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so. But we can't all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility.\n ... I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from the Indians. Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.\nIn the same \"Playboy\" interview, he also responded to questions about whether social programs were good for the country:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I know all about that. In the late '20s, when I was a sophomore at USC, I was a socialist myself\u2014but not when I left. The average college kid idealistically wishes everybody could have ice cream and cake for every meal, but as he gets older and gives more thought to his and his fellow man's responsibilities, he finds that it can't work out that way\u2014that some people just won't carry their load\u00a0... I believe in welfare\u2014a welfare work program. I don't think a fella should be able to sit on his backside and receive welfare. I'd like to know why well-educated idiots keep apologizing for lazy and complaining people who think the world owes them a living. I'd like to know why they make excuses for cowards who spit in the faces of the police and then run behind the judicial sob sisters. I can't understand these people who carry placards to save the life of some criminal, yet have no thought for the innocent victim.\nIn February 2019, the \"Playboy\" interview resurfaced, which resulted in calls for John Wayne Airport to be renamed. Wayne's son, Ethan, defended him, stating: \"It would be an injustice to judge someone based on an interview that's being used out of context.\" The calls for changing the airport's name back to Orange County Airport were renewed during the George Floyd protests in June 2020, though the name, as of 2025, remains unchanged.\nIn October 2019, student activists of Wayne's alma mater University of Southern California called for removing from the university's premises an exhibit dedicated to Wayne, citing the interview as cause. In July 2020, it was announced that the materials of the 2012-created exhibit would be moved to the USC Cinematic Arts Library for \"research,\" to \"allow scholarship to continue on the role John Wayne's films played in the history of cinema.\"\nDeath.\nAlthough he enrolled in a cancer vaccine study in an attempt to ward off the disease, Wayne died of stomach cancer on June 11, 1979, aged 72, at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was buried in the Pacific View Memorial Park Cemetery in Corona del Mar, Newport Beach. According to his son Patrick and his grandson Matthew Mu\u00f1oz, who was a priest in the California Diocese of Orange, Wayne converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before his death. He requested that his tombstone read \"\"Feo, Fuerte y Formal\" \", a Spanish epitaph Wayne described as meaning \"ugly, strong, and dignified\". His grave, which was unmarked for 20 years, has been marked since 1999 with the quotation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday.\nLegacy.\nActing evaluation.\nIn 1974, film critic Charles Champlin wrote of Wayne: \"Wayne is a motion picture actor, first, last and always, who defined as powerfully as anyone else what that means. From the lean and intense early days, in those low-cost dusters which still play on morning television, Wayne has had a presence which got through the lenses and shutters and onto the film undiminished.\" John Ford said of him: \"He's not something out of a book, governed by acting rules. He portrays John Wayne, a rugged American guy. He's not one of those method actors, like they send out here from drama schools in New York. He's real, perfectly natural.\" Lee Strasberg observed that Wayne was similar to fellow actors Spencer Tracy and Gary Cooper, who \"try not to act but be themselves\".\nWayne thought of himself as a reactor rather than an actor, and felt that the difference between good and bad acting was in acting and reacting. He explained this difference: \"In a bad picture, you see them acting all over the place. In a good picture, they react in a logical way to a situation they're in, so the audience can identify with the actors.\" When asked about his approach to acting, Wayne commented: \"I read dramatic lines undramatically and react to situations normally. This is not as simple as it sounds. I've spent a major portion of my life trying to do it well and I am not past learning it yet.\" Much like many actors of his generation, Wayne disliked method acting, and once said of them: \"Let those actors who picked their noses get all the dialogue, just give me the close-up of reaction.\"\nHoward Hawks, who directed him in five films, felt that after losing one of his lungs, Wayne became a much better actor. Hawks explained: \"Because of the lung Wayne lost, he reads his lines differently. He pauses in the strangest places simply because he hasn't got the breath he used to have. This device is terribly effective, because you keep your eyes on him and wait for him to finish, because you don't know what's coming next.\" Raoul Walsh noted: \"Wayne underacts, and it's mighty effective, not because he tries to underact\u2014it's a hard thing to do if you try\u2014but because he can't overact.\"\nDespite his popularity at the box office, Wayne was often criticized for playing the same type of character during most of his career. In a 1969 interview with Roger Ebert, Wayne remarked: \"Of course, they give me that John Wayne stuff so much, claim I always play the same role. Seems like nobody remembers how different the fellows were in \"The Quiet Man\" or \"Iwo Jima,\" or \"Yellow Ribbon,\" where I was 35 playing a man of 65. To stay a star, you have to bring along some of your own personality. Thousands of good actors can carry a scene, but a star has to carry the scene and still, without intruding, allow some of his character into it.\"\nGene Hackman said that Wayne \"was one of the best actors ever. You must admire how really good he was as an actor, in command of the scene and with such great charisma.\"\nAwards, celebrations, and landmarks.\nWayne's enduring status as an iconic American was formally recognized by the U.S. government in the form of the two highest civilian decorations. On his 72nd birthday on May 26, 1979, Wayne was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Hollywood figures and American leaders from across the political spectrum, including Maureen O'Hara, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Mike Frankovich, Katharine Hepburn, Omar Bradley, Gregory Peck, Robert Stack, James Arness, and Kirk Douglas, testified to Congress in support of the award. Robert Aldrich, president of the Directors Guild of America, made a particularly notable statement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is important for you to know that I am a registered Democrat, and to my knowledge, share none of the political views espoused by Duke. However, whether he is ill disposed or healthy, John Wayne is far beyond the normal political sharpshooting in this community. Because of his courage, his dignity, his integrity, and because of his talents as an actor, his strength as a leader, his warmth as a human being throughout his illustrious career, he is entitled to a unique spot in our hearts and minds. In this industry, we often judge people, sometimes unfairly, by asking whether they have paid their dues. John Wayne has paid his dues over and over, and I'm proud to consider him a friend and am very much in favor of my government recognizing in some important fashion the contribution that Mr. Wayne has made.\nWayne was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 9, 1980, by President Jimmy Carter. He had attended Carter's inaugural ball in 1977 \"as a member of the loyal opposition\", as he described it. In 1998, he was awarded the Naval Heritage Award by the US Navy Memorial Foundation for his support of the Navy and military during his film career. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Wayne 13th among the Greatest Male Screen Legends of classic Hollywood cinema.\nIn the essay \"John Wayne: A Love Song\", Joan Didion recalls the first time she saw Wayne in a movie: \"it was there, that summer of 1943 while the hot wind blew outside, that I first saw John Wayne. Saw the walk, heard the voice. Heard him tell the girl in a picture called \"War of the Wildcats\" that he would build her a house, 'at the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow.' As it happened I did not grow up to be kind of woman who is the heroine in a Western, and although the men I have known have had many virtues and have taken me to live in many places I have come to love, they have never been John Wayne, and they have never taken me to that bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow. Deep in that part of my heart where the artificial rain forever falls, that is still the line I want to hear... When John Wayne rode through my childhood, and perhaps through yours, he determined forever the shapes of certain of our dreams. It did not seem possible that such a man could fall ill, could carry within him that most inexplicable and ungovernable of diseases.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWayne's most enduring image is that of the displaced loner uncomfortable with the very civilization he is helping to establish and preserve...At his first appearance, we usually sense a very private person with some wound, loss or grievance from the past. At his very best he is much closer to a tragic vision of life...projecting the kind of mystery associated with great acting.\n\u2013 Film historian Andrew Sarris (1979)\nVarious public locations are named in honor of Wayne, including the John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, where a bronze equestrian statue of him stands at the entrance; the John Wayne Marina for which Wayne bequeathed the land, near Sequim, Washington; John Wayne Elementary School (P.S. 380) in Brooklyn, New York, which boasts a mosaic mural commission by New York artist Knox Martin entitled \"John Wayne and the American Frontier\"; and over named the \"John Wayne Pioneer Trail\" in Washington's Iron Horse State Park. A larger-than-life-sized bronze statue of Wayne atop a horse was erected at the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, at the former offices of the Great Western Savings and Loan Corporation, for which Wayne had made a number of commercials. In the city of Maricopa, Arizona, part of Arizona State Route 347 is named John Wayne Parkway, which runs through the center of town.\nIn 2006, friends of Wayne and his former Arizona business partner, Louis Johnson, inaugurated the \"Louie and the Duke Classics\" events benefiting the John Wayne Cancer Foundation and the American Cancer Society. The weekend-long event each fall in Casa Grande, Arizona, includes a golf tournament, an auction of John Wayne memorabilia, and a team roping competition.\nSeveral celebrations took place on May 26, 2007, the centennial of Wayne's birth. A celebration at the John Wayne birthplace in Winterset, Iowa, included chuck-wagon suppers, concerts by Michael Martin Murphey and Riders in the Sky, a Wild West Revue in the style of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, and a Cowboy Symposium with Wayne's costars, producers, and costumers. Wayne's films ran continuously at the local theater. Ground was broken for the new John Wayne Birthplace Museum and Learning Center at a ceremony consisting of over 30 of Wayne's family members, including Melinda Wayne Mu\u00f1oz, Aissa, Ethan, and Marisa Wayne. Later that year, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Wayne into the California Hall of Fame, located at the California Museum in Sacramento.\nIn 2016, Republican assemblyman Matthew Harper proposed marking May 26 as \"John Wayne Day\" in California. This resolution was struck down by a vote of 35 to 20, due to Wayne's views on race and his support of controversial organizations such as the John Birch Society and the House Un-American Activities Committee.\nAmerican icon.\nWayne rose beyond the typical recognition for a famous actor to that of an enduring icon who symbolized and communicated American values and ideals. Using the power of communication through silent films and radio, Wayne was instrumental in creating a national culture from disparate areas of the US, and made the creation of a national hero possible. By the middle of his career, Wayne had developed a larger-than-life image, and as his career progressed, he selected roles that would not compromise his off-screen image. Wayne embodied the image of strong American masculinity and rugged individualism in both his films and his life. At a party in 1957, Wayne confronted actor Kirk Douglas about the latter's decision to play the role of Vincent van Gogh in the film \"Lust for Life\", saying: \"Christ, Kirk, how can you play a part like that? There's so goddamn few of us left. We got to play strong, tough characters. Not these weak queers.\" However, actor Marlon Brando was notably critical of Wayne's public persona and of the cultural insensitivity of Wayne's characters, arguing on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" that, \"We [Americans] like to see ourselves as perhaps John Wayne sees us. That we are a country that stands for freedom, for rightness, for justice,\" before adding that \"it just simply doesn't apply.\"\nWayne's rise to being the quintessential movie war hero began to take shape four years after World War II, when \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" (1949) was released. His footprints at Grauman's Chinese theater in Hollywood were laid in concrete that contained sand from Iwo Jima. His status grew so large and legendary that when Japanese emperor Hirohito visited the United States in 1975, he asked to meet John Wayne, the symbolic representation of his country's former enemy. Likewise when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev visited the United States in 1959, he made two requests: to visit Disneyland and meet Wayne.\nIn the \"Motion Picture Herald\" Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll, Wayne was listed in 1936 and 1939. He appeared in the similar \"Box Office\" poll in 1939 and 1940. While these two polls are really an indication only of the popularity of series stars, Wayne also appeared in the Top Ten Money Makers Poll of all films from 1949 to 1957 and 1958 to 1974, taking first place in 1950, 1951, 1954, and 1971. With a total of 25 years on the list, Wayne has more appearances than any other star, surpassing Clint Eastwood (21) who is in second place.\nWayne is the only actor to appear in every edition of the annual Harris Poll of Most Popular Film Actors, and the only actor to appear on the list after his death. Wayne was in the top 10 in this poll for 19 consecutive years, starting in 1994, 15 years after his death.\nMyl\u00e8ne Demongeot declared in a 2015 filmed interview: \"Gary Cooper was sublime, there I have to say, now he, was part of the stars, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, John Wayne, those great Americans who I've met really were unbelievable guys, there aren't any like them anymore.\"\nJohn Wayne Cancer Foundation.\nThe John Wayne Cancer Foundation was founded in 1985 in honor of John Wayne, after his family granted the use of his name (and limited funding) for the continued fight against cancer. The foundation's mission is to \"bring courage, strength, and grit to the fight against cancer\". The foundation provides funds for innovative programs that improve cancer patient care, including research, education, awareness, and support.\nDispute with Duke University.\nNewport Beach, California-based John Wayne Enterprises, a business operated by Wayne's heirs, sells products, including Kentucky straight Bourbon, bearing the \"Duke\" brand and using Wayne's picture. When the company tried to trademark the image appearing on one of the bottles, Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, filed a notice of opposition. According to court documents, Duke has tried three times since 2005 to stop the company from trademarking the name. The company sought a declaration permitting registration of their trademark. The company's complaint filed in federal court said the university did \"not own the word 'Duke' in all contexts for all purposes.\" The university's official position was not to object provided Wayne's image appeared with the name. On September 30, 2014, Orange County, California federal judge David Carter dismissed the company's suit, deciding the plaintiffs had chosen the wrong jurisdiction.\nFilmography.\nBetween 1926 and 1977, Wayne appeared in over 170 films. According to Quigley Polling, Wayne was named the top money maker (as of 2005).\nAwards and nominations.\nBrass Balls Award.\nIn 1973, \"The Harvard Lampoon\", a satirical paper run by Harvard University students, invited Wayne to receive The Brass Balls Award, created in his \"honor\", after calling him \"the biggest fraud in history\". Wayne accepted the invitation as a chance to promote the recently released film \"McQ\", and a Fort Devens Army convoy offered to drive him into Harvard Square on an armored personnel carrier. The ceremony was held on January 15, 1974, at the Harvard Square Theater and the award was officially presented in honor of Wayne's \"outstanding machismo and penchant for punching people\". Although the convoy was met with protests by members of the American Indian Movement and others, some of whom threw snowballs, Wayne received a standing ovation from the audience when he walked onto the stage. An internal investigation was launched into the Army's involvement in the day.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16110", "revid": "41294494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16110", "title": "Johnny Haynes", "text": "English footballer\nJohn Norman Haynes (17 October 1934 \u2013 18 October 2005) was an English association footballer who played as an inside forward. He made 56 appearances for his country including 22 as captain. He was selected for three World Cup finals squads playing in the latter two of those. Nicknamed \"the Maestro\", his attacking play was noted for two-footed passing ability, vision and deftness of touch. Haynes is widely regarded as Fulham's greatest ever player, remaining loyal there for twenty years despite coming no nearer to a major trophy win than two FA Cup semi-final appearances. Immediately following the abolition of the \u00a320 maximum wage in 1961, he became the first player to be paid \u00a3100 a week. He also had a spell on loan with Toronto City in 1961 and ended his playing days at Durban City, winning there the only trophy he won in his football career.\nPlaying career.\nThe son of a post office engineer, Haynes was born in Kentish Town and supported Arsenal as a boy. He signed for Fulham as a 15-year-old amateur in 1950 when Fulham were in a three-season spell in the First Division. He was loaned to then non-League Wimbledon. He made his senior debut aged 18 in the 1952 Boxing Day visit of Southampton to Fulham, then in their first season back in the Second Division.\nHaynes made his debut for England in October 1954, scoring a goal in a 2\u20130 victory over Northern Ireland in Belfast. He first captained England in 1960 and played for them in two World Cups.\nHe was one of many signatories of a letter to \"The Times\" on 17 July 1958 opposing \"the policy of apartheid\" in international sport and defending \"the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games\".\nHaynes played in his first of two FA Cup semi-finals in 1958. Fulham were eliminated in a replay by the remnants of Manchester United's Busby Babes team that had been devastated by the Munich air disaster the month before. United were the first top-division team Fulham played in that cup run. Fulham were promoted to the top division after finishing runners-up behind Sheffield Wednesday in 1959. In the 1959\u201360 season, Fulham finished 10th in the First Division, which was their highest league position until finishing 9th in the 2003\u201304 Premier League season. Following the abolition of the \u00a320 maximum wage in 1961, he became Britain's first footballer to earn \u00a3100 per week. He played in a second FA Cup semi-final in 1962, losing in a replay to Burnley. In 1961, during the English off-season, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.\nIn August 1962 on Blackpool promenade, the sports car in which he was returning late to his hotel was blown by a gust of wind into the path of another vehicle. Haynes suffered broken bones in both feet and a badly injured knee. He recounted that the police officer who attended the incident reassured him by saying \"Don't worry son, you've only broken your legs\". He missed almost the entire season and, when he returned to the Fulham side, was not quite the same player. Prior to the accident, he had captained England 22 times, and, being only 27, was expected to lead them in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but he was never again selected for the national team.\nFulham were relegated in 1968. Haynes then had a single spell in football management, taking charge of Fulham for eighteen days in November that year after the dismissal of Bobby Robson as player-manager, but Haynes never had any ambition to go into coaching. That season, Fulham endured a second successive relegation. His last appearance for Fulham's first team was on 17 January 1970 in a Third Division home match against Stockport County. In total, he made 657 appearances for Fulham and scored 157 goals.\nIn 1970, Haynes announced his retirement, aged 35, and joined Durban City, playing one season and winning South Africa's 1970\u201371 National Football League. This was his only winner's medal in senior football. During the 1972\u201373 season, Haynes made three league appearances for non-League club Wealdstone.\nPost-playing career.\nOn retiring from playing in 1970 he was already an active bookmaker. He sold his chain of bookmakers to The Tote in 1976. In 1985 he moved to Edinburgh, the city of his partner Avril. Haynes first met Avril in the 1960s when she travelled down to London to buy stock for boutiques she ran in Edinburgh. On moving to Edinburgh he ran a laundry business with Avril, played golf and watched local club, Heart of Midlothian. In 2004 he and Avril married in a private ceremony at Dalkeith registry office.\nDeath.\nOn 17 October 2005, his 71st birthday, Haynes was driving his car, with Avril as passenger, on Edinburgh's Dalry Road when he suffered a brain haemorrhage, instantaneously effectively rendering him brain-dead. The vehicle veered across the road and crashed into a van. After being kept on a ventilator for some 30 hours, the ventilator was turned off on the evening of 18 October 2005. The funeral at Mortonhall Crematorium was attended by ex-players Bobby Charlton, George Cohen, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Dave Mackay, Alan Mullery, Jimmy Murray and Bobby Robson, and also George Foulkes. Avril was unable to attend due to injuries from the car accident. Haynes was survived by Avril and his two stepchildren.\nTributes.\nIn 2002 Haynes became an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his football talents and impact on the English game.\nOn the day of Haynes' death, Alan Mullery, another ex-Fulham and England player, made the following tribute:\n\"He was the only reason I went to Fulham as a young boy of 15 leaving school. He was my hero, the captain of England and Fulham. The word great rolls off the tongue quite easily these days but he really was. He was the best passer of a ball I have ever seen\u2014I don't know anyone who could pass a ball as accurately. Anyone who saw him will know what a great player he was.\"\nShortly after his death, the Stevenage Road Stand at Craven Cottage was renamed The Johnny Haynes Stand.\nGeorge Cohen, a World Cup winner for England in 1966 and a Fulham teammate of Johnny Haynes, stated:\n\"I have a hundred individual memories of the beauty of John's play. One stands out for the sheer perfection of his skill. It was a charity match which, but for that one second, has faded completely from my memory. The ball came to him at speed on a wet, slippery surface but with the slightest of adjustments, one that was almost imperceptible, he played it inside a full-back and into the path of an on-running winger. I looked at our coach Dave Sexton on the bench and he caught my glance and shook his head as if to say 'fantastic'. Haynes could give you goose bumps on a wet night in a match that didn't matter.\"\nBobby Moore, England captain from 1964 to 1973, said of him: \"Once you get used to watching that perfection you realised the rest of the secret. John was always available, always hungry for the ball, always wanting to play. I loved watching the player. Later I learnt to love the man.\" Pel\u00e9 said he had \"never seen a better passer of the ball\" than Haynes.\nThe Fulham Supporters Trust stated: \"His dedication, skill, professionalism, grace and charm\u2014both in his playing days and in retirement\u2014serve as a poignant reminder to many of today's footballers about what true greatness really means.\" On 28 July 2008, Fulham announced that fundraising had commenced, with the co-operation of a fan's group, to produce a lasting tribute to Haynes. The Johnny Haynes Statue was unveiled outside the stadium before the 0\u20130 draw v Sunderland on Saturday 18 October 2008.\n\"Scores and results list England's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Haynes goal.\"\nHonours.\nDurban City\nIndividual\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for writing and directing the films \"The Brother from Another Planet\" (1984), \"Matewan\" (1987), \"Eight Men Out\" (1988), \"Passion Fish\" (1992), \"The Secret of Roan Inish\" (1994), \"Lone Star\" (1996), \"Men with Guns\" (1997), \"Sunshine State\" (2002), and \"Silver City\" (2004).\nFor \"Eight Men Out\", Sayles was nominated for the USC Scripter Award. He has twice been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, for \"Passion Fish\" and \"Lone Star\". At the 56th Golden Globe Awards, \"Men with Guns\" was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His directorial debut, \"Return of the Secaucus 7\" (1980) as well as \"Matewan\" were added to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1997 and 2023, respectively.\nEarly life.\nSayles was born on September 28, 1950, in Schenectady, New York, the son of Mary (\"n\u00e9e\" Rausch), a teacher, and Donald John Sayles, a school administrator. Both of Sayles's parents were Catholic and of half-Irish descent. Sayles has referred to himself as a \"Catholic atheist\". He attended Williams College with frequent collaborators Gordon Clapp and David Strathairn, as well as his longtime partner, Maggie Renzi. Sayles earned a B.A. in psychology in 1972.\nCareer.\nAfter college, Sayles moved to Boston where he worked a variety of blue-collar jobs while writing short stories for \"The Atlantic\". These writings culminated in his first novel, \"The Pride of the Bimbos\", published in 1975.\nSayles began his film career working with Roger Corman, along with Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Ron Howard and James Cameron who also had stints with Corman early in their careers. Sayles was discovered by Frances Doel, who worked in the script department for Corman's New World Pictures. Sayles has been called \"the greatest screenwriter to ever work at New World.\"\nDirectorial debut.\nIn 1979, Sayles used $30,000 he earned writing scripts for Corman to fund his first film, \"Return of the Secaucus 7\". To make the film on a limited budget, he set the film in a large house so that he did not have to travel to or get permits for different locations, set the story over a three-day weekend to limit costume changes, and wrote about people his age so he could cast his friends in it. The film received near-unanimous critical acclaim at the time and has held its reputation. In November 1997, the National Film Preservation Board announced that \"Return of the Secaucus 7\" would be one of the 25 films selected that year for preservation in the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress.\nIn 1983, after the films \"Baby It's You\" (starring Rosanna Arquette) and \"Lianna\" (a story in which a married woman becomes discontented with her marriage and falls in love with another woman), Sayles received a MacArthur Fellowship. He put the money into the science fiction feature \"The Brother from Another Planet\", a film about a three-toed humanoid who escapes bondage on another world and crash-lands in New York harbor; because he is Africanoid in appearance, he finds himself at home among the people of Harlem, being pursued by European-looking alien enslaver men in black.\nIn 1989, Sayles created and wrote the pilot episode for the short-lived television show \"Shannon's Deal\" about a down-and-out Philadelphia lawyer played by Jamey Sheridan. Sayles received a 1990 Edgar Award for his teleplay for the pilot. The show ran for 16 episodes before being cancelled in 1991.\nSayles has funded most of his films by writing genre scripts, such as \"Piranha\", \"Alligator\", \"The Howling\", and \"The Challenge\". Having collaborated with Joe Dante on \"Piranha\" and \"The Howling\", Sayles acted in Dante's movie, \"Matinee\". Sayles has earned much of his funding by working as a script doctor; he did rewrites for \"Apollo 13\" and \"Mimic\".\nSayles' genre script, called \"Night Skies\", inspired what would eventually become the film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". That film's director, Steven Spielberg, later commissioned Sayles to write a script (unused) for the fourth \"Jurassic Park\" film.\nHe has written and directed his own films, including \"Lone Star\", \"Passion Fish\", \"Eight Men Out\", \"The Secret of Roan Inish,\" and \"Matewan\". He serves on the advisory board for the Austin Film Society. Maggie Renzi has been John Sayles's long-time companion (and collaborator), but they have not married. Renzi has produced most of his films since \"Lianna\". They met as students at Williams College.\nSayles works with a regular repertory of actors, most notably Chris Cooper, David Strathairn, and Gordon Clapp, each of whom has appeared in at least four of his films.\nIn early 2003, Sayles signed the Not In Our Name \"Statement of Conscience\" (along with Noam Chomsky, Steve Earle, Brian Eno, Jesse Jackson, Viggo Mortensen, Bonnie Raitt, Oliver Stone, Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon and others) which opposed the invasion of Iraq.\nIn February 2009, Sayles was reported to be writing an HBO series based on the early life of Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The drama, tentatively titled \"Scar Tissue\", would center on Kiedis's early years living in West Hollywood with his father. At that time, Kiedis's father, known as Spider, sold drugs (according to legend, his clients included The Who and Led Zeppelin) and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business.\nIn February 2010, Sayles began shooting his 17th feature film, the historical war drama \"Amigo\", in the Philippines. The film is a fictional account of events during the Philippine\u2013American War, with a cast that includes Joel Torre, Chris Cooper, and Garret Dillahunt.\nHis novel \"A Moment in the Sun\", set during the same period as \"Amigo\", in the Philippines, Cuba, and the U.S., was released in 2011 by McSweeney's. It includes an account of the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 in North Carolina, the only coup d'\u00e9tat in United States history in which a duly elected government was overthrown.\nAwards/nominations.\nFilms.\nAwards for \"Return of the Secaucus 7\":\nAwards for \"Matewan\":\nAwards for \"Shannon's Deal\":\nAwards for \"City of Hope\":\nAwards for \"Passion Fish\":\nAwards for \"The Secret of Roan Inish\":\nAwards for \"Lone Star\":\nAwards for \"Men with Guns/Hombres armados\":\nAwards for \"Limbo\":\nAwards for \"Sunshine State\":\nAward for \"Silver City\":\nAwards for \"Honeydripper\":\nOther recognition.\nSayles's first published story, \"I-80 Nebraska\", won an O. Henry Award; his novel, \"Union Dues\", was nominated for a National Book Award as well as the National Book Critics Circle Award.\nIn 1983, Sayles received the John D. MacArthur Award, given to 20 Americans in diverse fields each year for their innovative work. He has also been the recipient of the Eugene V. Debs Award, the John Steinbeck Award and the John Cassavetes Award. He was honored with the Ian McLellan Hunter Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Writers Guild of America (1999).\nIn June 2014, Sayles donated his non-film archive to the University of Michigan. It will be accessible at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. Sayles's film archive is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.\nRecurring collaborators.\nActors who have regularly worked with Sayles include Maggie Renzi, David Strathairn, Joe Morton, Chris Cooper, Mary McDonnell, Vincent Spano, Kevin Tighe, Josh Mostel, Tom Wright, Gordon Clapp and Angela Bassett.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As well as achieving success as a solo act, he has collaborated with Sasha as Sasha &amp; John Digweed, and with Nick Muir as Bedrock. Digweed was voted as No. 1 DJ in DJ Mag in 2001.\nBiography.\nDigweed began DJing at the age of 15, and made a name for himself in his home town of Hastings, where he put on successful club nights, the most famous of which were his successful raves on Hastings Pier, where the likes of Carl Cox and The Prodigy performed. His breakthrough came in 1993, when he sent a mixtape demo to Geoff Oakes, founder of the Renaissance nightclub in Mansfield, who played it to fellow DJ Alexander Coe (aka Sasha). The two DJs struck up a long-term friendship and working relationship, despite Sasha twice failing to turn up for gigs that Digweed had booked him for in Hastings.\nIn partnership with Sasha, Digweed is known for promoting progressive house and notable for producing the first commercial compilation for a nightclub, when they released their 1994 compilation of mixes from Renaissance entitled \"\". Until then, mixtapes from clubs had only been circulated by DJs on an amateur basis. The Renaissance CD was the first time that a compilation CD had been planned strategically for marketing, from artwork to promotion. The two DJs famously followed this up with their \"Northern Exposure\" compilations and those on \"Global Underground\".\nDigweed then started the record label Bedrock Records to further promote the music that he was playing at the time. He and his friend Nick Muir went on to produce under the Bedrock alias, getting their big break when their first track \"For What You Dream Of\" was used in the film \"Trainspotting\". The Bedrock duo also produced the soundtrack for the MTV adult cartoon superhero drama series, \"\" in 2003. In his sets, Digweed is noted for adopting tracks with new and different styles.\nBetween 2000 and 2005, Digweed promoted his \"Bedrock\" sound with monthly club nights for club members and newcomers to the electronic music scene. He played on Thursday nights at Heaven in London, and on Friday nights in a smaller club night at The Beach in Brighton. These nights featured numerous guest DJs, including Danny Howells, Phil Thompson, Hernan Cattaneo and Chris Fortier. As Digweed's international schedule increased, these events drew to a close, although occasional reunions have been held at Heaven since. He celebrated ten years of his Bedrock club night on 10 October 2008 at Matter in London, with a near on ten-hour set.\nDigweed has enjoyed popularity throughout North America as well as Europe. He and Sasha established a monthly residency at the now defunct New York club Twilo, which proved a key location for the American electronic music scene. The residency began in 1997 with a lukewarm reception, but grew into one of the most popular club nights in New York City by the end of its run in 2001. He also played in 2001 for 11 hours at the Cavo Paradiso, located at the island of Mykonos in Greece. Sasha and Digweed played at Twilo on the last Friday of every month, playing sets that lasted between eight and twelve hours. In early 2001, Sasha suffered an ear injury and was unable to play for their last four dates before Twilo was closed by the New York City authorities. Digweed continued to play the time-slot by himself until 6 May 2001, when Twilo was raided by the NYPD and subsequently forced to close down.\nDigweed has a cameo of himself playing music in Greg Harrison's 2000 movie \"Groove\", which tells the story of an all-night rave in San Francisco.\nIn early 2002, Digweed along with Sasha and Jimmy Van M undertook a six-week countrywide tour of the United States called Delta Heavy. The tour was promoted by Clear Channel and attendance reached 85,000. It took place in a variety of venues but was completely self-reliant from a technical point of view; sound, lights, and visual setups were brought along to every gig of the tour. Also in 2002, Digweed curated and compiled the soundtrack to the film \"Stark Raving Mad\".\nFrom September 2000 to January 2011, Digweed hosted a weekly two-hour radio show on Kiss 100 in the UK, in which he played the first hour of music and a guest DJ played the second hour. Beginning in September 2006, his show was available on all three Kiss radio stations. By that time, the show's name had become Transitions, which was also the name of a four-volume series of mix albums by Digweed that was released every six months during 2006\u20132008. In January 2011, Transitions aired for the last time on Kiss 100, but the show continues to be broadcast online. On December 27, 2019, Transitions aired its 800th episode.\n2008 saw Digweed and Sasha reuniting for a Spring Club Tour that once again featured performances all over North America. In 2011, Digweed's music was featured in the film movie adaptation of Irvine Welsh's best-selling novel\n\"Irvine Welsh's Ecstasy\".\nHe featured among the top ten artists from 1998 to 2008 and was voted DJ Mag's number 1 DJ in 2001. In 2010, he was voted number 29 in DJ Mag's annual Top 100 DJs vote. In 2013, Digweed was ranked the number 17 best DJ in the world in Resident Advisor's top 100 DJ charts; he was number 43 in June 2016.\nJohn is the brother of 28 times World Clay Shooting Champion George Digweed, MBE.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "16118", "revid": "40414428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16118", "title": "Jacob", "text": "Hebrew patriarch and forefather of the Israelites\nJacob, later known as Israel, is a Hebrew patriarch of the Abrahamic religions. He first appears in the Torah, where he is described in the Book of Genesis as a son of Isaac and Rebecca. Accordingly, alongside his older fraternal twin brother Esau, Jacob's paternal grandparents are Abraham and Sarah and his maternal grandfather is Bethuel, whose wife is not mentioned. He is said to have bought Esau's birthright and, with his mother's help, deceived his aging father to bless him instead of Esau. Then, following a severe drought in his homeland Canaan, Jacob and his descendants migrated to neighbouring Egypt through the efforts of his son Joseph, who had become a confidant of the pharaoh. After dying in Egypt at the age of 147, he is supposed to have been buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron.\nPer the Hebrew Bible, Jacob's progeny were beget by four women: his wives (and maternal cousins) Leah and Rachel; and his concubines Bilhah and Zilpah. His sons were, in order of their birth: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. He also had a daughter named Dinah, born to his first wife Leah. The descendants of Jacob's sons were collectively known as the Israelites, with each son being the forefather of one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, of whom all but the Tribe of Levi were allotted territory in the Land of Israel. The Genesis narrative also states that Jacob displayed favoritism among his wives and children, preferring Rachel and her sons Joseph and Benjamin to the rest\u2014culminating in Joseph's older brothers selling him into slavery out of resentment.\nScholars have taken a mixed view as to Jacob's historicity, with archaeology so far producing no evidence for his existence. Archaeologist and scholar William Albright initially dated Jacob to the 19th century BCE, but later scholars, such as John J. Bimson and Nahum Sarna, argued against using archaeological evidence to support such claims due to limited knowledge of that period. Recent scholarship by Thomas L. Thompson and William Dever suggest that these narratives are late literary compositions with ideological purposes rather than historical accounts.\nEtymology.\nHebrew.\nAccording to the folk etymology found in Genesis 25:26, the name is derived from \"heel\", as Jacob was born grasping the heel of his twin brother Esau. The historical origin of the name is uncertain, although similar names have been recorded. is recorded as a place name in a list by Thutmose III (15th century BC), and later as the \"nomen\" of a Hyksos pharaoh. The hieroglyphs are ambiguous, and can be read as \"Yaqub-Har\", \"Yaqubaal\", or \"Yaqub El\". The same name is recorded earlier still, in c.\u20091800 BC, in cuneiform inscriptions (spelled \"ya-ah-qu-ub-el\", \"ya-qu-ub-el\"). The suggestion that the personal name may be shortened from this compound name, which would translate to \"may El protect\", originates with Bright (1960). In the Amorite language, parallel forms of Jacob's name are attested as \"ia-a\u1e2b-q\u00fa-ub-DINGIR\" and \"ia-a\u1e2b-q\u00fa-bu-um\".\nThe name \"Israel\" given to Jacob following the episode of his wrestling with the angel (Genesis 32:22\u201332) is etymologized as composition of \"el\" \"god\" and the root \"\u015barah\" \"to rule, contend, have power, prevail over\":\u00a0 (KJV: \"a prince hast thou power with God\"); alternatively, the \"el\" can be read as the subject, for a translation of \"El rules/contends/struggles\". The word \"strive\" is often used for the proposed etymon \u05e9\u05e8\u05d4, but as Genesis novelly uses the word without defining it, this interpretation is merely based upon the context in the story.\nGreek.\nThe Septuagint renders the name \"I\u00e1kobos\" (), whence Latin , English \"Jacob\".\nGenesis narrative.\nThe biblical account of the life of Jacob is found in the Book of Genesis, chapters 25\u201350.\nBirth to Isaac and Rebecca.\nJacob and his twin brother, Esau, were born to Isaac and Rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when Isaac was 60 years of age. Rebecca was uncomfortable during her pregnancy and went to inquire of God why she was suffering. She received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives, even after they became two separate nations. The prophecy also said that \"the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger\" http://.\nWhen the time came for Rebecca to give birth, the firstborn, Esau, came out covered with red hair, as if he were wearing a hairy garment, and his heel was grasped by the hand of Jacob, the secondborn. According to Genesis 25, Isaac and Rebecca named the first son Esau (). The second son they named Jacob (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1, Ya'aqob or Ya'aqov, meaning \"heel-catcher\", \"supplanter\", \"leg-puller\", \"he who follows upon the heels of one\", from , \"'aqab\" or \"'aqav\", \"seize by the heel\", \"circumvent\", \"restrain\", a wordplay upon , \"'iqqebah\" or \"'iqqbah\", \"heel\").\nThe boys displayed very different natures as they matured: \"... and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a simple man, dwelling in tents\". Moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: \"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebecca loved Jacob.\"\nAcquiring Esau's birthright.\nGenesis 25:29\u201334 tells the account of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob. This passage tells that Esau, returning famished from the fields, begged Jacob to give him some of the stew that Jacob had just made. (Esau referred to the dish as \"that same red pottage\", giving rise to his nickname, (\"'Edom\", meaning \"Red\").) Jacob offered to give Esau a bowl of stew in exchange for his birthright, to which Esau agreed.\nBlessing of Isaac.\nAs Isaac aged, he became blind and was uncertain when he would die, so he decided to bestow Esau's birthright upon him. He requested that Esau go out to the fields with his weapons (quiver and bow) to kill some venison. Isaac then requested that Esau make \"savory meat\" for him out of the venison, according to the way he enjoyed it the most, so that he could eat it and bless Esau.\nRebecca overheard this conversation. It is suggested that she realized prophetically that Isaac's blessings would go to Jacob, since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger. Rebecca blessed Jacob and she quickly ordered Jacob to bring her two kid goats from their flock so that he could take Esau's place in serving Isaac and receiving his blessing. Jacob protested that his father would recognize their deception since Esau was hairy and he himself was smooth-skinned. He feared his father would curse him as soon as he felt him, but Rebecca offered to take the curse herself, then insisted that Jacob obey her. Jacob did as his mother instructed and, when he returned with the kids, Rebecca made the savory meat that Isaac loved. Before she sent Jacob to his father, she dressed him in Esau's garments and laid goatskins on his arms and neck to simulate hairy skin.\nDisguised as Esau, Jacob entered Isaac's room. Surprised that Esau was back so soon, Isaac asked how it could be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, \"Because the LORD your God brought it to me.\" Rashi says Isaac's suspicions were aroused even more, because Esau never used the personal name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, \"The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau!\" Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him directly, \"Art thou my very son Esau?\" and Jacob answered simply, \"I am.\" Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him. As Jacob kissed his father, Isaac smelled the clothes which belonged to Esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was Esau. Isaac then blessed Jacob with the blessing that was meant for Esau. Genesis 27:28\u201329 states Isaac's blessing: \"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heavens, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: Let people serve thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.\"\nJacob had scarcely left the room when Esau returned from the hunt to prepare his game and receive the blessing. The realization that he had been deceived shocked Isaac, yet he acknowledged that Jacob had received the blessings by adding, \"Indeed, he will be [or remain] blessed!\" (27:33).\nEsau was heartbroken by the deception and begged for his own blessing. Having made Jacob a ruler over his brothers, Isaac could only promise, \"By your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck\" (27:39\u201340).\nAlthough Esau sold Jacob his own birthright, which was his blessing, for \"red pottage,\" Esau still hated Jacob for receiving his blessing that their father Isaac unknowingly had given to him. He vowed to kill Jacob as soon as Isaac died. When Rebecca heard about his murderous intentions, she ordered Jacob to travel to her brother Laban's house in Haran, until Esau's anger subsided. She convinced Isaac to send Jacob away by telling him that she despaired of his marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of Canaan (as Esau had done). After Isaac sent Jacob away to find a wife, Esau realized his own Canaanite wives were evil in his father's eyes and so he took a daughter of Isaac's half-brother, Ishmael, as another wife.\nJacob's Ladder.\nNear Luz en route to Haran, Jacob experienced a vision of a ladder, or staircase, reaching into heaven with angels going up and down it, subsequently referred to in popular culture as \"Jacob's ladder.\" He heard the voice of God, who repeated many of the blessings upon him, coming from the top of the ladder.\nAccording to Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer, the ladder signified the exiles that the Jewish people would suffer before the coming of the Jewish Messiah: the angels that represented the exiles of Babylonia, Persia, and Greece each climbed up a certain number of steps, paralleling the years of the exile, before they \"fell down\"; but the angel representing the last exile, that of Edom, kept climbing higher and higher into the clouds. Jacob feared that his descendants would never be free of Esau's domination, but God assured him that at the End of Days, Edom too would come falling down.\nIn the morning, Jacob awakened and continued on his way to Haran, after naming the place where he had spent the night \"Bethel\", \"God's house.\"\nMarriages.\nArriving in Haran, Jacob saw a well where shepherds were gathering their flocks to water them and met Laban's younger daughter, Rachel, Jacob's first cousin; she was working as a shepherdess. Jacob was 77 years old, and he loved Rachel immediately. After spending a month with his relatives he asked for her hand in marriage in return for working seven years for Laban the Aramean. Laban agreed to the arrangement. These seven years seemed to Jacob \"but a few days, for the love he had for her.\" When they were complete and he was 84 years old he asked for his wife, but Laban deceived him by switching Rachel for her older sister, Leah, as the veiled bride. In the morning, when the truth became known, Laban justified his action, saying that in his country it was unheard of to give a younger daughter before the older. However, he agreed to give Rachel in marriage as well if Jacob would work another seven years. After the week of wedding celebrations with Leah, Jacob married Rachel, and he continued to work for Laban for another seven years.\nIn those seven years, Jacob fathered twelve children. He loved Rachel more than Leah, and Leah felt hated. God opened Leah's womb and she gave birth to four sons rapidly: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. Rachel, however, remained barren. Following the example of Sarah, who gave her handmaid to Abraham after years of infertility, Rachel gave her handmaid Bilhah to Jacob so that Rachel could raise children through her. Bilhah gave birth to Dan and Naphtali. Seeing that she had left off childbearing temporarily, Leah then gave her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob so that Leah could raise more children through her. Zilpah gave birth to Gad and Asher. Afterwards, Leah became fertile again and gave birth to Issachar, Zebulun, and Dinah, Jacob's only daughter. God remembered Rachel, who gave birth to Joseph, and later, Benjamin.\nAfter Joseph was born, Jacob decided to return home to his parents. Laban the Aramean was reluctant to release him, as God had blessed his flock on account of Jacob. Laban asked what he could pay Jacob. Jacob suggested that all the spotted, speckled, and brown goats and sheep of Laban's flock, at any given moment, would be his wages. Jacob placed rods of poplar, hazel, and chestnut, all of which he peeled \"white streaks upon them,\" within the flocks' watering holes or troughs, associating the stripes of the rods with the growth of stripes on the livestock. Despite this practicing of magic, later on Jacob says to his wives that it was God who made the livestock give birth to the convenient offspring, in order to turn the tide against the deceptive Laban. As time passed, Laban's sons noticed that Jacob was taking the better part of their flocks, and so Laban's friendly attitude towards Jacob began to change. The angel of the Lord, in a dream back during the breeding season, told Jacob \"Now lift your eyes and see [that] all the he goats mounting the animals are ringed, speckled, and striped, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you\", that he is the God whom Jacob met at Bethel, and that Jacob should leave and go back to the land where he was born, which he and his wives and children did without informing Laban. Before they left, Rachel stole the \"teraphim,\" considered to be household idols, from Laban's house.\nLaban pursued Jacob for seven days. The night before he caught up to him, God appeared to Laban in a dream and warned him not to say anything good or bad to Jacob. When the two met, Laban said to Jacob, \"What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?\" He also asked for his stolen \"teraphim\" back. Knowing nothing about Rachel's theft, Jacob told Laban that whoever stole them should die and stood aside to let him search. When Laban reached Rachel's tent, she hid the \"teraphim\" by sitting on them and stating she could not get up because she was menstruating. Jacob and Laban then parted from each other with a pact to preserve the peace between them near Gilead. Laban returned to his home and Jacob continued on his way.\nJourney back to Canaan.\nAs Jacob neared the land of Canaan as he passed Mahanaim, he sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau. They returned with the news that Esau was coming to meet Jacob with an army of 400 men. With great apprehension, Jacob prepared for the worst. He engaged in earnest prayer to God, then sent on before him a tribute of flocks and herds to Esau, \"A present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob.\"\nJacob then transported his family and flocks across the ford Jabbok by night, then recrossed back to send over his possessions, being left alone in communion with God. There, a mysterious being appeared (\"man,\" Genesis 32:24, 28; or \"God,\" Genesis 32:28, 30, Hosea 12:3, 5; or \"angel,\" Hosea 12:4), and the two wrestled until daybreak. When the being saw that he did not overpower Jacob, he touched Jacob on the sinew of his thigh (the \"gid hanasheh\", \u05d2\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e9\u05d4), and, as a result, Jacob developed a limp (Genesis 32:31). Because of this, \"to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket\" This incident is the source of the mitzvah of porging.\nJacob then demanded a blessing, and the being declared in Genesis 32:28 that, from then on, Jacob would be called \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, Israel (\"Yisra'el\", meaning \"one that struggled with the divine angel\" (Josephus), \"one who has prevailed with God\" (Rashi), \"a man seeing God\" (Whiston), \"he will rule as God\" (Strong), or \"a prince with God\" (Morris), from , \"prevail,\" \"have power as a prince\"). While he is still called Jacob in later texts, his name Israel makes some consider him the eponymous ancestor of the Israelites.\nJacob asked the being's name, but he refused to answer. Afterwards, Jacob named the place Penuel (\"Penuw'el\", \"Peniy'el\", meaning \"face of God\"), saying: \"I have seen God face to face and lived.\"\nBecause the terminology is ambiguous (\"el\" in \"Yisra'el\") and inconsistent, and because this being refused to reveal his name, there are varying views as to whether he was a man, an angel, or God. Josephus uses only the terms \"angel\", \"divine angel,\" and \"angel of God,\" describing the struggle as no small victory. According to Rashi, the being was the guardian angel of Esau himself, sent to destroy Jacob before he could return to the land of Canaan. Trachtenberg theorized that the being refused to identify itself for fear that, if its secret name was known, it would be conjurable by incantations. Literal Christian interpreters like Henry M. Morris say that the stranger was \"God Himself and, therefore, Christ in His preincarnate state\", citing Jacob's own evaluation and the name he assumed thereafter, \"one who fights victoriously with God\", and adding that God had appeared in the human form of the Angel of the Lord to eat a meal with Abraham in Genesis 18. Geller wrote that, \"in the context of the wrestling bout, the name implies that Jacob won this supremacy, linked to that of God's, by a kind of theomachy.\"\nIn the morning, Jacob assembled his four wives and 11 sons, placing the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. Some commentators cite this placement as proof that Jacob continued to favor Joseph over Leah's children, as presumably the rear position would have been safer from a frontal assault by Esau, which Jacob feared. Jacob himself took the foremost position. Esau's spirit of revenge, however, was apparently appeased by Jacob's bounteous gifts of camels, goats and flocks. Their reunion was an emotional one.\nEsau offered to accompany them on their way back to Israel, but Jacob protested that his children were still young and tender (born six to 13 years prior in the narrative); Jacob suggested eventually catching up with Esau at Mount Seir. According to the Sages, this was a prophetic reference to the End of Days, when Jacob's descendants will come to Mount Seir, the home of Edom, to deliver judgment against Esau's descendants for persecuting them throughout the millennia. Jacob actually diverted himself to Succoth and was not recorded as rejoining Esau until, at Machpelah, the two bury their father Isaac, who lived to be 180, and was 60 years older than they were.\nJacob then arrived in Shechem, where he bought a parcel of land, now identified as Joseph's Tomb. In Shechem, Jacob's daughter Dinah was kidnapped and raped by the ruler's son, who desired to marry the girl. Dinah's brothers, Simeon and Levi, agreed in Jacob's name to permit the marriage as long as all the men of Shechem first circumcised themselves, ostensibly to unite the children of Jacob in Abraham's covenant of familial harmony. On the third day after the circumcisions, when all the men of Shechem were still in pain, Simeon and Levi put them all to death by the sword and rescued their sister Dinah, and their brothers plundered the property, women, and children. Jacob condemned this act, saying: \"You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land.\" He later rebuked his two sons for their anger in his deathbed blessing (Genesis 49:5\u20137).\nJacob returned to Bethel, where he had another vision of blessing. Although the death of Rebecca, Jacob's mother, is not explicitly recorded in the Bible, Deborah, Rebecca's nurse, died and was buried at Bethel, at a place that Jacob calls \"Allon Bachuth\" (\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05ea), \"Oak of Weepings\" (Genesis 35:8). According to the Midrash, the plural form of the word \"weeping\" indicates the double sorrow that Rebecca also died at this time.\nJacob then made a further move while Rachel was pregnant; near Bethlehem, Rachel went into labor and died as she gave birth to her second son, Benjamin (Jacob's twelfth son). Jacob buried her and erected a monument over her grave. Rachel's Tomb, just outside Bethlehem, remains a popular site for pilgrimages and prayers to this day. Jacob then settled in Migdal Eder, where his firstborn, Reuben, slept with Rachel's servant Bilhah; Jacob's response was not given at the time, but he did condemn Reuben for it later, in his deathbed blessing. Jacob was finally reunited with his father Isaac in Mamre (outside Hebron).\nWhen Isaac died at the age of 180, Jacob and Esau buried him in the Cave of the Patriarchs, which Abraham had purchased as a family burial plot. At this point in the biblical narrative, two genealogies of Esau's family appear under the headings \"the generations of Esau\". A conservative interpretation is that, at Isaac's burial, Jacob obtained the records of Esau, who had been married 80 years prior, and incorporated them into his own family records, and that Moses augmented and published them.\nIn Hebron.\nThe house of Jacob dwelt in Hebron, in the land of Canaan. His flocks were often fed in the pastures of Shechem as well as Dothan. Of all the children in his household, he loved Rachel's firstborn son, Joseph, the most. Thus Joseph's half brothers were jealous of him and they ridiculed him often. Joseph even told his father about all of his half brothers' misdeeds. When Joseph was 17 years old, Jacob made a long coat or tunic of many colors for him. Seeing this, the half brothers began to hate Joseph. Then Joseph began to have dreams that implied that his family would bow down to him. When he told his brothers about such dreams, it drove them to conspire against him. When Jacob heard of these dreams, he rebuked his son for proposing the idea that the house of Jacob would even bow down to Joseph. Yet, he contemplated his son's words about these dreams.\nSometime afterward, the sons of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob wanted to know how things were doing, so he asked Joseph to go down there and return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up receiving came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood from a goat. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried, \"It is my son's tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.\" He tore his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement.\nThe truth was that Joseph's older brothers had turned on him, apprehended him and ultimately sold him into slavery on a caravan headed for Egypt.\nFamine of the Near East.\nTwenty years later, throughout the Middle East a severe famine occurred like none other that lasted seven years. It crippled nations. The word was that the only kingdom prospering was Egypt. In the second year of this great famine, when Israel (Jacob) was about 130 years old, he told his 10 sons of Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, to go to Egypt and buy grain. Israel's youngest son Benjamin, born from Rachel, stayed behind by his father's order to keep him safe.\nNine of the sons returned to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father all that had happened in Egypt. They spoke of being accused as spies and that their brother Simeon had been taken prisoner. When Reuben, the eldest, mentioned that they needed to bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove their word as honest men, their father became furious with them. He couldn't understand how they were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.\nIt turned out that Joseph, who identified his brothers in Egypt, was able to secretly return the money that they used to pay for the grain, back to them. When the house of Israel consumed all the grain that they brought from Egypt, Israel told his sons to go back and buy more. This time, Judah spoke to his father in order to persuade him about having Benjamin accompany them, so as to prevent Egyptian retribution. In hopes of retrieving Simeon and ensuring Benjamin's return, Israel told them to bring the best fruits of their land, including: balm, honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds. Israel also mentioned that the money that was returned to their money sacks was probably a mistake or an oversight on their part. So, he told them to bring that money back and use double that amount to pay for the new grain. Lastly, he let Benjamin go with them and said \"may God Almighty give you mercy... If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!\"\nMigration to Egypt.\nWhen the sons of Israel (Jacob) returned to Hebron from their second trip, they came back with 20 additional donkeys carrying all kinds of goods and supplies as well as Egyptian transport wagons. When their father came out to meet them, his sons told him that Joseph was still alive, that he was the governor over all of Egypt and that he wanted the house of Israel to move to Egypt. Israel's heart \"stood still\" and just couldn't believe what he was hearing. Looking upon the wagons he declared \"Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.\"\nIsrael and his entire house of 70, gathered up with all their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. En route, Israel stopped at Beersheba for the night to make a sacrificial offering to his God, Yahweh. Apparently he had some reservations about leaving the land of his forefathers, but God reassured him not to fear that he would rise again. God also assured that he would be with him, he would prosper, and he would also see his son Joseph who would lay him to rest. Continuing their journey to Egypt, when they approached in proximity, Israel sent his son Judah ahead to find out where the caravans were to stop. They were directed to disembark at Goshen. It was here, after 22 years, that Jacob saw his son Joseph once again. They embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. Israel then said, \"Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.\"\nPharaoh's meeting.\nThe time had come for Joseph's family to personally meet the Pharaoh of Egypt. After Joseph prepared his family for the meeting, the brothers came before the Pharaoh first, formally requesting to pasture in Egyptian lands. The Pharaoh honored their stay and even made the notion that if there were any competent men in their house, then they may elect a chief herdsman to oversee Egyptian livestock. Finally, Joseph's father was brought out to meet the Pharaoh. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal, it was an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh. The two chatted for a bit, the Pharaoh even inquiring of Israel's age which happened to be 130 years old at that time. After the meeting, the families were directed to pasture in the land of Ramses where they lived in the province of Goshen. The house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of 17 years, even through the worst of the seven-year famine.\nFinal days: Blessing of Jacob.\nIsrael (Jacob) was 147 years old when he called to his favorite son Joseph and pleaded that he not be buried in Egypt. Rather, he requested to be carried to the land of Canaan to be buried with his forefathers. Joseph swore to do as his father asked of him. Not too long afterward, Israel had fallen ill, losing much of his vision. When Joseph came to visit his father, he brought with him his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel declared that they would be heirs to the inheritance of the house of Israel, as if they were his own children, just as Reuben and Simeon were. Then Israel laid his right hand on the younger Ephraim's head and his left hand on the eldest Manasseh's head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father's right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father's hands. But Israel refused saying, \"but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.\" A declaration he made, just as Israel himself was to his firstborn brother Esau. Then Israel called all of his sons in and prophesied their blessings or curses to all twelve of them in order of their ages.\nDeath.\nAfterward, Israel died and the family, including the Egyptians, mourned him 70 days. Israel was embalmed for 40 days and a great ceremonial journey to Canaan was prepared by Joseph. He led the servants of Pharaoh, and the elders of the houses Israel and Egypt beyond the Jordan River to Atad where they observed seven days of mourning. Their lamentation was so great that it caught the attention of surrounding Canaanites who remarked \"This is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.\" This spot was then named Abel Mizraim. Then they buried him in the cave of Machpelah, the property of Abraham when he bought it from the Hittite Ephron.\nChildren of Israel.\nJacob, through his two wives and his two concubines had 12 biological sons; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali,\nGad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph and Benjamin. The scene of Jacob mourning Joseph makes mention of him having a number of daughters, but no details are provided. Only one daughter, Dinah, is known by name. In addition, Jacob also adopted the two sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim.\nThe offspring of Jacob's sons became the tribes of Israel following the Exodus, when the Israelites conquered and settled in the Land of Israel.\nReligious perspectives.\nJudaism.\nThere are two opinions in the Midrash as to how old Rebecca was at the time of her marriage and, consequently, at the twins' birth. According to the traditional counting cited by Rashi, Isaac was 37 years old at the time of the Binding of Isaac, and news of Rebecca's birth reached Abraham immediately after that event. In that case, since Isaac was 60 when Jacob and Esau were born and they had been married for 20 years, then Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebecca (Gen. 25:20), making Rebecca three years old at the time of her marriage, and 23 years old at the birth of Jacob and Esau. According to the second opinion, Rebecca was 14 years old at the time of their marriage, and 34 years old at the birth of Jacob and Esau. In either case, Isaac and Rebecca were married for 20 years before Jacob and Esau were born. The Midrash says that during Rebecca's pregnancy whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would agitate to come out.\nRashi explained that Isaac, when blessing Jacob instead of Esau, smelled the heavenly scent of Gan Eden (Paradise) when Jacob entered his room and, in contrast, perceived Gehenna opening beneath Esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by Esau's show of piety.\nAccording to the Talmud, Jacob did not flee directly to Haran (as would seem from the Biblical text), but rather studied for 14 years at the study house of Shem and Eber before continuing towards Haran.\nWhen Laban planned to deceive Jacob into marrying Leah instead of Rachel, the Midrash recounts that both Jacob and Rachel suspected that Laban would pull such a trick; Laban was known as the \"Aramean\" (deceiver), and changed Jacob's wages ten times during his employ (Genesis 31:7). The couple therefore devised a series of signs by which Jacob could identify the veiled bride on his wedding night. But when Rachel saw her sister being taken out to the wedding canopy, her heart went out to her for the public shame Leah would suffer if she were exposed. Rachel therefore gave Leah the signs so that Jacob would not realize the switch.\nJacob had still another reason for grieving the loss of Joseph. God had promised to him: \"If none of your sons dies during your lifetime, you may look upon it as a token that you will not be put in (Hell of) Gehenna after your death.\" Thinking Joseph to be dead, Jacob had his own destiny to lament because he considered that he was doomed to that Hell.\nJewish apocalyptic literature of the Hellenistic period includes many ancient texts with narratives about Jacob, many times with details different from Genesis. The more important are the Book of Jubilees and the Book of Biblical Antiquities. Jacob is also the protagonist of the Testament of Jacob, of the Ladder of Jacob and of the Prayer of Joseph, which interpret the experience of this Patriarch in the context of merkabah mysticism.\nChristianity.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite see Jacob's dream as a prophecy of the incarnation of the Logos, whereby Jacob's ladder is understood as a symbol of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), who, according to Eastern Orthodox theology, united heaven and earth in her womb. The biblical account of this vision is one of the standard Old Testament readings at Vespers on Great Feasts of the Theotokos.\nThe Eastern and Western Churches consider Jacob as a saint along with other biblical patriarchs. Along with other patriarchs his feast day is celebrated in the Byzantine rite on the Second Sunday before the Advent (December 11\u201317), under the title \"the Sunday of the Forefathers\".\nIslam.\nTwo further references to Isra'il (Arabic: \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0622\u0626\u0650\u06cc\u0644 [\"\u02c8isra\u0101\u02c8iyl\"]; Classical/ Quranic Arabic: \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0622\u0621\u0650\u06cc\u0652\u0644 [\"\u02c8isra\u0101\u00e3\u02c8iyl\"]) are believed to be mention of Jacob. The Arabic form Ya'q\u016bb () may be direct from the Hebrew or indirect through Syriac.\nHe is recognized in Islam as a prophet who received inspiration from God. He is acknowledged as a patriarch of Islam. Muslims believe that he preached the same monotheistic faith as his forefathers \u02beIbr\u0101h\u012bm, \u02beIs\u1e25\u0101q and Ism\u0101'\u012bl. Jacob is mentioned 16 times in the Quran. In the majority of these references, Jacob is mentioned alongside fellow prophets and patriarchs as an ancient and pious prophet. According to the Quran, Jacob remained in the company of the elect throughout his life. (38:47) The Quran specifically mentions that Jacob was guided (6:84) and inspired (4:163) and was chosen to enforce the awareness of the Hereafter. (38:46) Jacob is described as a good-doer (21:72) and the Quran further makes it clear that God inspired Jacob to contribute towards purification and hold the contact prayer. (21:73) Jacob is further described as being resourceful and a possessor of great vision (38:45) and is further spoken of as being granted a \"tongue [voice] of truthfulness to be heard.\" (19:50)\nOf the life of Jacob, the Quran narrates two especially important events. The first is the role he plays in the story of his son Joseph. The Quran narrates the story of Joseph in detail, and Jacob, being Joseph's father, is mentioned thrice and is referenced another 25 times. In the narrative, Jacob does not trust some of his older sons (12: 11, 18, 23) because they do not respect him. (12: 8, 16\u201317) Jacob's prophetic nature is evident from his foreknowledge of Joseph's future greatness (12:6), his foreboding and response to the supposed death of Joseph (12: 13, 18) and in his response to the sons' plight in Egypt. (12: 83, 86\u201387, 96) Islamic literature fleshes out the narrative of Jacob, and mentions that his wives included Rachel. Jacob is later mentioned in the Quran in the context of the promise bestowed to Zechariah, regarding the birth of John the Baptist. (19:6) Jacob's second mention is in the Quran's second chapter. As Jacob lay on his deathbed, he asked his 12 sons to testify their faith to him before he departed from this world to the next. (2:132) Each son testified in front of Jacob that they would promise to remain Muslim (in submission to God) until the day of their death; that is they would surrender their wholeselves to God alone and would worship only Him.In contrast to the Judeo-Christian view of Jacob, one main difference is that the story of Jacob's blessing, in which he deceives Isaac, is not accepted in Islam. The Quran makes it clear that Jacob was blessed by God as a prophet and, therefore, Muslims believe that his father, being a prophet as well, also knew of his son's greatness. Jacob is also cited in the \"Hadith\" as an example of one who was patient and trusting in God in the face of suffering.\nNation of Islam.\nAccording to the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI), the original inhabitants of the world were black (referred to as the \"Asiatic Blackman\"), while the white race are \"devils\" who were created 6,000 years ago on what is today the Greek island of Patmos by the biblical and quranic Jacob, whom the group refers to as the \"bigheaded scientist\" Yakub. Though rejected by the vast majority of American Muslims, several NOI breakaway sects, including the Five-Percent Nation, subscribe to this narrative. The Nuwaubian Nation, an NOI offshoot headed by Malachi Z. York, promotes an alternative version of the Yakub story. In contrast to both the Bible and Qu\u2019ran, the NOI and its offshoots teach that Yakub was born in Mecca.\nHistoricity.\nAlthough archaeologist and biblical scholar William F. Albright maintained (c. 1961) that the narratives of Abraham and Jacob could be dated to about the 19th century BCE, John J. Bimson wrote in 1980: \"Since then ... there has been a strong reaction against the use of archaeological evidence in support of the biblical traditions, and Albright's comment could not be repeated with any truth today.\" Nahum M. Sarna (1978) noted that an inability to date the narratives of the patriarchs does not necessarily invalidate their historicity, a view supported by Bimson, who admitted that \"Our knowledge of the centuries around 2000 BCE is very small, and our ignorance very great.\"\nGerhard von Rad, in his \"Old Testament Theology\" (1962) postulated that the patriarchal narratives describe actual events subsequently interpreted by the community through its own experience.\nOther scholars, such as Thomas L. Thompson, view the narratives as late literary compositions (6th and 5th centuries BCE) that have ideological and theological purposes but are unreliable for historical reconstruction of the pre-settlement period of the Israelites. In \"The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives\" (1974), Thompson suggested that the narratives arose in a response to some emergent situation, expressed as an imaginative picture of the past to embody hope.\nIn \"The Ascent of Man\" (1973), Jacob Bronowski pointed out similarities between Jacob and Bakhtyar, who lends his name to Iran's Bakhtiari people. Both were herdsmen who had two wives, and are regarded as the ancestral patriarch of their nomadic people.\nArchaeologist William G. Dever wrote in 2001: \"After a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob 'historical figures.'\"\nExcavations in the Timna Valley produced what may be the earliest camel bones found in Israel or even outside the Arabian Peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen by some as evidence that the stories of Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph (said to have taken place a thousand years earlier) were written no earlier than the 10th century BCE.\nIsrael Finkelstein proposed the Jacob-Esau narratives could have originated from 8th century BCE Kingdom of Israel because the conflict with Edom fits well not only in a Judahite context but also in 8th century BCE Israelite context. Other scholars have suggested that the story could fit also in a 2nd millennium BCE context. Finkelstein suggests there is an archaeological evidence that 8th century Israel interacted with Edom: the graffiti of Kuntillet Ajrud that mention both a \"YHWH of Samaria\" (center of Israel) and a \"YHWH of Teman\" (center of Edom). He proposed the Jacob-Laban narrative might stem from the 8th century BCE as Haran was then the western capital of the Assyrian empire. He also proposed that the earliest layer of Jacob cycle or the oldest Jacob tradition, which is the story of him and his uncle Laban establishing the border between them, might be a pre-monarchic tradition and could be originated from Gilead.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16119", "revid": "69412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16119", "title": "Jehoshaphat", "text": "Fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah\nJehoshaphat (; alternatively spelled Jehosaphat, Jehosophat, Josaphat, or Yehoshafat; Hebrew: , \u00a0, \u00a0, \"Yahweh has judged\"; ; ), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the son of Asa, and the fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, in succession to his father. His children included Jehoram, who succeeded him as king. His mother was Azubah. Historically, his name has sometimes been connected with the Valley of Josaphat.\nReign.\n2 Chronicles chapters 17 to 21 are devoted to the reign of Jehoshaphat. First Kings treats him more briefly: 1 Kings 15:24 mentions him as successor to Asa, and 1 Kings 22:1\u201350 summarizes the events of his life. The Jerusalem Bible states that \"the Chronicler sees Asa as a type of the peaceful, Jehoshaphat of the strong king\". According to these passages, Jehoshaphat ascended the throne at the age of thirty-five and reigned for twenty-five years. He \"walked in the ways\" of his father or ancestor, King David. He spent the first years of his reign fortifying his kingdom against the Kingdom of Israel. His zeal in suppressing the idolatrous worship of the \"high places\" is commended in 2 Chronicles 17:6.\nIn the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the Law, an activity which was commanded for a Sabbatical year in Deuteronomy 31:10\u201313 (taking place in Jerusalem). Later reforms in Judah instituted by Jehoshaphat appear to have included further religious reforms, appointment of judges throughout the cities of Judah and a form of \"court of appeal\" in Jerusalem. Ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions, according to 2 Chronicles 19:11, were by royal command kept distinct.\nThe author of the Books of Chronicles generally praises his reign, stating that the kingdom enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people \"in their basket and their store\".\nAlliances.\nJehoshaphat also pursued alliances with the kingdom of Israel in the North. Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram married Athaliah, daughter of king Ahab of Israel. In the eighteenth year of his reign Jehosaphat visited Ahab in Samaria, and nearly lost his life accompanying his ally to the siege of Ramoth-Gilead. While Jehoshaphat safely returned from this battle, he was reproached by the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, about this alliance. We are told that Jehoshaphat repented, and returned to his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and promoting the worship of God and in the government of his people.\nLater it appears that Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with Ahaziah of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. He subsequently joined Jehoram of Israel in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. The Moabites were subdued, but seeing Mesha's act of offering his own son (and singular heir) as a propitiatory human sacrifice on the walls of Kir of Moab filled Israel with horror, and they withdrew and returned to their own land.\nVictory over Moabite alliance.\nAccording to \"Chronicles\", the Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and marched against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Ein Gedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm. The king prayed in the court of the Temple, \"O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do; but our eyes are upon you.\" The voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that the next day all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarreled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. Soon after this victory Jehoshaphat died after a reign of twenty-five years at the age of sixty. According to some sources (such as the eleventh-century Jewish commentator Rashi), he actually died two years later, but gave up his throne earlier for unknown reasons. As with his father Asa, a bonfire was lit in his honor.\nHe also had the ambition to emulate Solomon's maritime ventures to Ophir, and built a large vessel for Tarshish. But when this boat was wrecked at Ezion-Geber he relinquished the project.\nIn I Kings xxii. 43 the piety of Jehoshaphat is briefly dwelt on. Chronicles, in keeping with its tendency, elaborates this trait of the king's character. According to its report, Jehoshaphat organized a missionary movement by sending out his officers, the priests, and the Levites to instruct the people throughout the land in the Law of YHWH, the king himself delivering sermons.\nUnderlying this ascription to the king of the purpose to carry out the Priestly Code, is the historical fact that Jehoshaphat took heed to organize the administration of justice on a solid foundation, and was an honest worshiper of YHWH. In connection with this the statement that Jehoshaphat expelled the \"\u1e32edeshim\" (R. V. \"Sodomites\") from the land (1 Kings 22:46) is characteristic; while 2 Chron. 19:3 credits him with having cut down the Asherot. The report that he took away the \"high places\" (and the Asherim) conflicts with 1 Kings 22:44 (A. V. v. 43) and 2 Chron. 20:33. The account of Jehoshaphat's tremendous army (1,160,000 men) and the rich tribute received from (among others) the Philistines and the Arabs is not historical. It is in harmony with the theory worked out in Chronicles that pious monarchs have always been the mightiest and most prosperous.\nRabbinic literature.\nThe question that puzzled Heinrich Ewald and others, \"Where was the brazen serpent till the time of Hezekiah?\" occupied the Talmudists also. They answered it in a very simple way: Asa and Joshaphat, when clearing away the idols, purposely left the brazen serpent behind, in order that Hezekiah might also be able to do a praiseworthy deed in breaking it.\nIn Christianity.\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jehoshaphat appears in the genealogy of Jesus.\nChronological notes.\nWilliam F. Albright estimated the reign of Jehoshaphat to 873\u2013849 BCE. Edwin R. Thiele held that he became coregent with his father Asa in Asa's 39th year, 872/871 BCE, the year Asa was infected with a severe disease in his feet, and then became sole regent when Asa died of the disease in 870/869 BCE, his own death occurring in 848/847 BCE. So Jehoshaphat's dates are taken as one year earlier: co-regency beginning in 873/871, sole reign commencing in 871/870, and death in 849/848 BCE.\nThe calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Jehoshaphat, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of the beginning of his sole reign to some time between Tishri 1 of 871 BCE and the day before Nisan 1 of 870 BCE. For calculation purposes, this should be taken as the Judean year beginning in Tishri of 871/870 BCE. His death occurred at some time between Nisan 1 of 848 BCE and Tishri 1 of that same year.\nIn popular culture.\nThe king's name in the oath \"jumping Jehosaphat\" was likely popularized by the name's utility as a euphemism for Jesus. The phrase, spelled \"Jumpin' Geehosofat\", is first recorded in the 1865\u20131866 novel \"The Headless Horseman\" by the Irish-American novelist Thomas Mayne Reid. The novel also uses \"Geehosofat\", standing alone, as an exclamation. The longer version \"By the shaking, jumping ghost of Jehosaphat\" is seen in the 1865 novel \"Paul Peabody\" by the English journalist Percy Bolingbroke St John.\nAnother theory is that the reference is to Joel 3:11\u201312, where the prophet Joel says, speaking of the judgment of the dead, \"Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.\"\nIn the 1956 Warner Brothers Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoon short, \"Yankee Dood It,\" based on the fairy tale of The Elves and the Shoemaker, Jehosephat figures prominently as an invocation to turn elves into mice. On the TV series \"Car 54, Where Are You?\", the character Francis Muldoon cited his partner's frequent use of the phrase \"Jumpin' Jehosephat!\" as a source of annoyance in the episode entitled \"Change Your Partners\". The televised \"Batman\" live-action program of the 1960s also featured Robin, played by Burt Ward, uttering the phrase as an emphatic exclamation, and it was also incorporated into the talking alarm clock alarms voiced again by Burt Ward in 1974 in the \"talking Batman &amp; Robin alarm clock\" made by Janex.\n'Jehoshaphat!' was the standard curse-word used by Elijah Baley, protagonist of the first three science-fiction novels of Isaac Asimov's \"Robot\" series.\nAnother reference comes in Keno Don Rosa's \"The Invader of Fort Duckburg\", a Scrooge McDuck \"Life and Times\" story. Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt exclaims 'Great Jumping Jehoshaphat!!' when confronted with Scrooge McDuck's illegal occupation of the fictitious Fort Duckburg, also in Disney's 1963 animated film \"The Sword in the Stone\", Merlin uses \"Jehoshaphat\" to express alarm and annoyance. Furthermore, in Disney's 1977 animated film \"The Rescuers\", Bernard exclaims \"Jehoshaphat!\" during the bayou chase scene.\nRapper MF Doom used the phrase \"Jumpin' Jehosephat!\" in his song \"I Hear Voices\", featured on the 2001 re-release of his 1999 debut album \"\".\nIn 'The Five Doctors' 20th Anniversary episode of BBC series 'Doctor Who' (1983), Jon Pertwee (playing the Third Doctor) used Jehoshaphat as an exclamation when recognising Anthony Ainley's Tremus incarnation of their enemy, The Master in the Gallifreyan 'Death Zone'. Whilst The Third Doctor had used this exclamation as a truncation of 'Jumping Jehoshaphat' on several occasions during his tenure, many younger and casual viewers mistakenly took 'Jehoshaphat' to be The Master's real name, used by The Doctor because they had been childhood friends.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution:"}
{"id": "16120", "revid": "47179870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16120", "title": "Jehu", "text": "Tenth king of Israel\nJehu (; , meaning \"Yah is He\"; ; ) was the tenth king of the northern Kingdom of Israel since Jeroboam I, noted for exterminating the house of Ahab. He was the son of Jehoshaphat, grandson of Nimshi, and possibly great-grandson of Omri, although the latter notion is not supported by the biblical text. His reign lasted 28 years.\nWilliam F. Albright has dated Jehu's reign to 842\u2013815 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 841\u2013814 BCE. The principal source for the events of his reign comes from 2 Kings.\nBiblical narrative.\nProclamation as king.\nJehu was anointed King of Israel by one of the sons of the prophets at the behest of Elisha the prophet in 2 Kings 9; 1-13 ( The reign of Jehu's predecessor, Jehoram, was marked by the Battle of Ramoth-Gilead against the army of the Arameans. Jehoram was wounded and returned to Jezreel to recover. He was attended by Ahaziah, king of Judah, who was also his nephew, son of his sister Athaliah. Meanwhile, according to the writer of the Books of Kings, the prophet Elisha ordered one of his students to go to Ramoth-Gilead and separate Jehu, a military commander at the time, from his companions. There, he was to anoint Jehu as king in an inner chamber and explain to him that he was to act as an agent of divine judgment against the house of Ahab. The student followed these instructions, and upon completion he ran away. Jehu initially dismissed the student as a \"madman\", but nonetheless told his companions about his anointing. His companions later enthusiastically blew their trumpets and proclaimed him their king.\nJezreel and the deaths of Jehoram and Jezebel.\nWith a chosen band, Jehu planned his conspiracy against King Jehoram and secretly entered Jezreel. Jehoram tried to flee, but Jehu shot an arrow that pierced his heart. Jehu later threw his body on Naboth's vineyard, to avenge Naboth, whom Jehoram's father and mother had murdered. King Ahaziah fled after seeing Jehoram's death but Jehu wounded him. Ahaziah fled to Megiddo, where he died.\nJehu proceeded to enter the premises of the palace at Jezreel. Jezebel watched him with contempt from the palace window and mockingly compared him to King Zimri. Jehu later commanded Jezebel's eunuchs to throw her out of the palace window. They obeyed his commands and Jezebel was instantly killed. Jehu trampled over her body, and when he decided later to arrange a proper burial due to her royal descent, only her skull, hands and feet remained. The rest of her body had been eaten by dogs.\nNow master of Jezreel, Jehu wrote to command the chief men in Samaria to hunt down and kill all the royal princes. They did so, and the next day they piled the 70 heads in two heaps outside the city gate, as Jehu commanded. Ahab's entire family was slain. Shortly afterward, Jehu encountered the 42 \"brothers of Ahaziah\" (since the brothers of Ahaziah had been taken away and probably killed by the Philistines, these must have been relatives of Ahaziah in a broader sense, like nephews and cousins) at \"Beth-eked of the shepherds\". They told Jehu they were visiting the royal family. Jehu killed them all at \"the pit of Beth-eked\".\nAfter Jehu's slaughter of the House of Ahab, he met Jehonadab the Rechabite and convinced him that he was pro-Yahwist. Jehonadab quickly allied with him, and they entered the capital together. In control of Samaria, he invited the worshippers and priests of Baal to a ceremony, then trapped and killed them. He then destroyed their idols and temple, and turned the temple into a latrine.\nReign.\nOther than Jehu's bloody seizure of power and tolerance for the golden calves at Dan and Bethel, which was criticized as a \"heretical\" interpretation of Yahwism, little else is known of his reign. He was hard pressed by Hazael, king of the Arameans, who defeated his armies \"throughout all of the territories of Israel\" beyond the Jordan River, in the lands of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh.\nThis suggests that Jehu offered tribute to Shalmaneser III, as depicted on his Black Obelisk, in order to gain a powerful ally against the Arameans. \"Bit-Khumri\" was used by Tiglath-Pileser III for the non-Omride kings Pekah (733) &amp; Hoshea (732), hence House/Land/Kingdom of Omri could apply to later Israelite kings not necessarily descended from Omri. According to others, this description should be taken very literally, as in this period Assyrians were very closely following the events in this area, with control slipping in later years.\nThe destruction of the house of Ahab is commended by the author of 2 Kings as a form of divine punishment. Yahweh rewards Jehu for being a willing executor of divine judgment by allowing four generations of kings to sit on the throne of Israel. Jehu and his descendants Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and Zachariah ruled Israel for 102 years. Nonetheless, according to the Book of Hosea, God punished the House of Jehu through the hands of the Assyrians for Jehu's massacre at Jezreel, and some Biblical commentators reasoned that this was because Jehu's motives may not have been entirely pure in his massacre.\nArchaeological evidences.\nTel Dan Stele.\nThe author of the Tel Dan Stele (9th century BCE, found in 1993 and 1994) claimed to have slain both Ahaziah of Judah and Jehoram of Israel. Most scholars identify Hazael of Damascus (c. 842 \u2013 806 BCE) as the author, the Damascan king who fought a great war against Israel and Juda. Apparently the coalition that had been forged between Ahab and Hadadezer, who had provided the main force that stopped the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar, had fallen apart under their successors and in the succeeding war between Israel-Juda against Aram-Damascus the kings of Israel and Juda were killed. Jehu, already an important military leader, then became king after this event.\nBlack Obelisk.\nAside from the Hebrew Scriptures, Jehu appears in Assyrian documents, notably in the Black Obelisk, where he is depicted as kissing the ground in front of Shalmaneser III and presenting a gift (\"maddattu \u0161a Ia-\u00fa-a...kaspu m\u00e2du\" \"tribute of Jehu...much silver\"). In the Assyrian documents, Jehu is simply called \"son of Omri\" (, possibly expressing his having been the ruler of \"the House of Omri\", a later Assyrian designation for the Kingdom of Israel), but since his grandfather Nimshi might have been a son of Omri, it could have been just describing a well-known descendency. This tribute is dated ca. 841 BCE by a fragment from Calah. It is the earliest preserved depiction of an Israelite. One more argument that Jehu was or styled himself as a descendent of Omri is the fact that he moved the capital back to Samaria, which was the capital in Omri's days.\nAccording to the Obelisk, Jehu severed his alliances with Phoenicia and Judah, and became subject to Assyria. Apparently, faced with the aggression of Aram-Damascus in the north and also rebellion of the Moabites (see Mesha stele) in the east, Jehu had no other options then yield to the Assyrians, who would resume their attacks at Aram-Damascus, thus relieving the pressure on Israel.\nIn popular culture.\nJehu is portrayed by George Nader in the film \"Sins of Jezebel\" (1953).\nDrive Like Jehu was an American post-hardcore band from San Diego active from 1990 to 1995. The band's name was derived from 2 Kings 9:20: \"And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving [is] like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

'Yahweh is salvation'), Jehoshua, or Josue, was Moses' assistant in the books of Exodus and Numbers, and later succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelite tribes in the Book of Joshua of the Hebrew Bible. His name was Hoshea (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7\u200e \"H\u014d\u0161\u0113a\u02bf\",\u200d lit. 'Save') the son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, but Moses called him \"Yehoshua\" (translated as \"Joshua\" in English), the name by which he is commonly known in English. According to the Bible, he was born in Egypt prior to the Exodus.\nIn , the Hebrew Bible identifies Joshua as one of the twelve spies of Israel sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. After the death of Moses, he led the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan, and allocated lands to the tribes. According to biblical chronology, Joshua lived some time in the Bronze Age. According to Joshua died at the age of 110.\nJoshua holds a position of respect among Muslims, who also see him as the leader of the faithful following the death of Moses. In Islam, it is also believed that Yusha bin Nun (Joshua) was the \"attendant\" of Moses mentioned in the Quran before Moses meets Khidr. Joshua plays a role in Islamic literature, with significant narration in the hadith.\nName.\nThe English name \"Joshua\" is a rendering of the Hebrew \"Yehoshua\", and is mostly interpreted as \"Yahweh is salvation\"; although others have also alternatively interpreted it as \"Yahweh is lordly\". The theophoric name appears to be constructed from a combination of the Tetragrammaton with the Hebrew noun \u05d9\u05b0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b8\u05d4 (Modern: \"y\u0259\u0161\u016b\u02bfa\", Tiberian: \"y\u0103\u0161\u016b\u02bf\u0101\"), meaning \"salvation\"; derived from the Hebrew root \u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 (\"y-\u0161-\u02bf\"), meaning \"to save/help/deliver\". Other theophoric names sharing a similar meaning can also be found throughout the Hebrew Bible, such as that of the son of David \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7 (\"\u02be\u0114l\u012b\u0161\u016ba\u02bf\"), whose name means \"My El (God) is salvation\".\n\"Jesus\" is the English derivative of the Greek transliteration of \"Yehoshua\" via Latin. In the Septuagint, all instances of the word \"Yehoshua\" are rendered as \"\" (I\u0113s\u00fbs), the closest Greek pronunciation of the . Thus, in modern Greek, Joshua is called \"Jesus son of Naue\" (, \"t\u00fb Nau\u1e17\") to differentiate him from Jesus. This is also true in some Slavic languages following the Eastern Orthodox tradition (e.g. \"\", \"Iis\u00fas Nav\u00edn\", in Bulgarian, Serbian and Russian, but not Czech).\nBiblical narrative.\nThe Exodus.\nJoshua was a major figure in the events of the Exodus. He was charged by Moses with selecting and commanding a militia group for their first battle after exiting Egypt, against the Amalekites in Rephidim, in which they were victorious.\nHe later accompanied Moses when he ascended biblical Mount Sinai to commune with God, visualize God's plan for the Israelite tabernacle, and receive the Ten Commandments. Joshua was with Moses when he descended from the mountain, heard the Israelites' celebrations around the Golden Calf, and broke the tablets bearing the words of the commandments. Similarly, in the narrative which refers to Moses being able to speak with God in his tent of meeting outside the camp, Joshua is seen as custodian of the tent ('tabernacle of meeting') when Moses returned to the Israelite encampment. However, when Moses returned to the mountain to re-create the tablets recording the Ten Commandments, Joshua was not present, as the biblical text states \"no man shall come up with you\".\nLater, Joshua was identified as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore and report on the land of Canaan, and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report, a reward for which would be that only these two of their entire generation would enter the promised land.\nAccording to Joshua 1:1, God appointed Joshua to succeed Moses as leader of the Israelites along with giving him a blessing of invincibility during his lifetime. The first part of the book of Joshua covers the period when he led the conquest of Canaan.\nConquest of Canaan.\nAt the Jordan River, the waters parted, as they had for Moses at the Red Sea. The first battle after the crossing of the Jordan was the fall of Jericho. Joshua led the destruction of Jericho, then moved on to Ai, a small neighboring city to the west. However, they were defeated with thirty-six Israelite deaths. The defeat was attributed to Achan taking an \"accursed thing\" from Jericho; and was followed by Achan and his family and animals being stoned to death to restore God's favor. Joshua then went to defeat Ai.\nThe Israelites faced an alliance of five Amorite kings from Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. At Gibeon, Joshua asked the LORD to cause the Sun and Moon to stand still, so that he could finish the battle in daylight. According to the text, the Sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. This event is most notable because \"There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD heeded the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.\" The LORD also fought for the Israelites in this battle, for he hurled huge hailstones from the sky which killed more Canaanites than those which the Israelites slaughtered. From there on, Joshua was able to lead the Israelites to several victories, securing much of the land of Canaan. He presided over the Israelite gatherings at Gilgal and Shiloh which allocated land to the tribes of Israel (Joshua 14:1\u20135 and 18:1\u201310), and the Israelites rewarded him with the Ephraimite city of Timnath-heres or Timnath-serah, where he settled (Joshua 19:50).\nAccording to the Talmud, Joshua in his book enumerated only those towns on the frontier.\nDeath.\nWhen he was \"old and well advanced in years\", Joshua convened the elders and chiefs of the Israelites and exhorted them to have no fellowship with the native population, because it could lead them to be unfaithful to God. At a general assembly of the clans at Shechem, he took leave of the people, admonishing them to be loyal to their God, who had been so mightily manifested in the midst of them. As a witness of their promise to serve God, Joshua set up a great stone under an oak by the sanctuary of God. Soon afterward he died, at the age of 110, and was buried at Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.\nHistoricity.\nCurrent mainstream opinion.\nThe prevailing scholarly view is that the Book of Joshua is not a factual account of historical events. The apparent setting of Joshua is the 13th century BCE which was a time of widespread city-destruction, but with a few exceptions (Hazor, Lachish) the destroyed cities are not the ones the Bible associates with Joshua, and the ones it does associate with him show little or no sign of even being occupied at the time. Given its lack of historicity, Carolyn Pressler in her commentary for the \"Westminster Bible Companion\" series suggests that readers of Joshua should give priority to its theological message (\"what passages teach about God\") and be aware of what these would have meant to audiences in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE. Richard Nelson explained that the needs of the centralised monarchy favoured a single story of origins, combining old traditions of an exodus from Egypt, belief in a national god as \"divine warrior,\" and explanations for ruined cities, social stratification and ethnic groups, and contemporary tribes.\nIt has been argued that the Book of Joshua holds little historical value. The archaeological evidence shows that Jericho and Ai were not occupied in the Near Eastern Late Bronze Age, although recent excavations at Jericho have questioned this. The story of the conquest perhaps represents the nationalist propaganda of the eighth century BCE kings of Judah and their claims to the territory of the Kingdom of Israel, incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king Josiah (reigned 640\u2013609\u00a0BCE). The book was probably revised and completed after the fall of Jerusalem to the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, and possibly after the return from the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE.\nM. Noth (1930s).\nIn the 1930s Martin Noth made a sweeping criticism of the usefulness of the Book of Joshua for history. Noth was a student of Albrecht Alt, who emphasized form criticism and the importance of etiology. Alt and Noth posited a peaceful movement of the Israelites into various areas of Canaan, \"contra\" the Biblical account.\nW.F. Albright (1930s).\nWilliam Foxwell Albright questioned the \"tenacity\" of etiologies, which were key to Noth's analysis of the campaigns in Joshua. Archaeological evidence in the 1930s showed that the city of Ai, an early target for conquest in the putative Joshua account, had existed and been destroyed, but in the 22nd century BCE. Some alternate sites for Ai have been proposed which would partially resolve the discrepancy in dates, but these sites have not been widely accepted.\nK. Kenyon (1951).\nIn 1951 Kathleen Kenyon showed that City IV at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) was destroyed at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2100\u20131550 BCE), not during the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550\u20131200 BCE). Kenyon argued that the early Israelite campaign could not be historically corroborated, but rather explained as an etiology of the location and a representation of the Israelite settlement.\nG.E. Wright (1955).\nIn 1955, G. Ernest Wright discussed the correlation of archaeological data to the early Israelite campaigns, which he divided into three phases per the Book of Joshua. He pointed to two sets of archaeological findings that \"seem to suggest that the biblical account is in general correct regarding the nature of the late thirteenth and twelfth-eleventh centuries in the country\" (i.e., \"a period of tremendous violence\"). He gives particular weight to what were then recent digs at Hazor by Yigael Yadin.\nReligious views.\nIn Judaism.\nIn rabbinical literature.\nIn rabbinic literature Joshua is regarded as a faithful, humble, deserving, wise man. Biblical verses illustrative of these qualities and of their reward are applied to him. \"He that waits on his master shall be honored\" is construed as a reference to Joshua, as is also the first part of the same verse, \"Whoso keeps the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof\". That \"honor shall uphold the humble in spirit\" is proved by Joshua's victory over Amalek. Not the sons of Moses\u2014as Moses himself had expected\u2014but Joshua was appointed as Moses' successor. Moses was shown how Joshua reproved that Othniel.\n\"God would speak to Moses face to face, like someone would speak to his friend. Then he would return to the camp. But his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not leave the tent. Joshua never moved from the tent\". Didn't Joshua leave the tent to eat, sleep or attend to his needs? This praise shows that Joshua had complete faith in Moses, the Tzaddik. One who has this faith is cognizant of the tzaddik in everything he does; he remains steadfastly with the tzaddik whatever he does.\nAccording to rabbinic tradition, Joshua, when dividing the Land of Canaan among the twelve tribes of Israel, planted sea squill () to mark off the butts and bounds of tribal properties.\nMoreover, Joshua, on dividing the land of Canaan amongst the tribes of Israel, made the tribes agree to ten conditions, the most important of which being the common use of the forests as pasture for cattle, and the common right of fishing in the Sea of Tiberias. Natural springs were to be used for drinking and laundry by all tribes, although the tribe to which the water course fell had the first rights. Prickly burnet (\"Sarcopoterium spinosum\") and the camelthorn (\"Alhagi maurorum\") could be freely collected as firewood by any member of any tribe, in any tribal territory.\nIn prayer.\nAccording to Jewish religious tradition, upon making Aliyah by crossing the Jordan River to enter the Land of Israel, Joshua composed the Aleinu prayer thanking God. This idea was first cited in the Kol Bo of the late 14th Century. Several medieval commentators noticed that Joshua's shorter birth name, Hosea, appears in the first few verses of Aleinu in reverse acrostic: \u05e2 \u2013 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5, \u05e9 \u2013 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e9\u05dd, \u05d5 \u2013 \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d4 \u2013 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5. The Teshuvot HaGeonim, a Geonic responsum, discussed that Joshua composed the Aleinu because although the Israelites had made Aliyah to the Promised Land, they were surrounded by other peoples, and he wanted the Jews to draw a clear distinction between themselves, who knew and accepted the sovereignty of God, and those nations of the world which did not. In the modern era, religious Jews still pray the Aliyah inspired Aleinu three times daily, including on the High Holidays. The Aleinu prayer begins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is our duty to praise the Master of all, to exalt the Creator of the Universe, who has not made us like the nations of the world and has not placed us like the families of the earth, who has not designed our destiny to be like theirs, nor our lot like that of all their multitude.\nIn Christianity.\nMost modern Bibles translate to identify Jesus as a better Joshua, as Joshua led Israel into the rest of Canaan, but Jesus leads the people of God into \"God's rest\". Among the early Church Fathers, Joshua is considered a type of Jesus Christ.\nThe story of Joshua and the Canaanite kings is also alluded to in the 2 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\nIn Islam.\nQuranic references.\nJoshua (, \"Y\u016b\u0161a\u02bf ibn N\u016bn\" , is not mentioned by name in the Quran, but his name appears in other Islamic literature. In the Quranic account of the conquest of Canaan, Joshua and Caleb are referenced, but not named, as two God-fearing men on whom God \"had bestowed His grace\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They said, \"Moses, there is a fearsome people in this land. We will not go there until they leave. If they leave, then we will enter.\" Yet the two men whom God had blessed among those who were afraid said, \"Go in to them through the gate and when you go in you will overcome them. If you are true believers, put your trust in God.\u2014\u200a\nJoshua is also referred to in the journey Musa (Moses) took with him to find Khidr. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And remember when Moses said to his young assistant, \"I will never give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I travel for ages\". But when they finally reached the point where the seas met, they forgot their salted fish, and it made its way into the sea, slipping away wondrously. He replied, \"Do you remember when we rested by the rock? That is when I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously\". Moses responded, \"That is exactly what we were looking for\". So they returned, retracing their footsteps. There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy from Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own.\u2014\u200a\nThe narration collected by Bukhari reports that a man approached Moses after he gave a talk and asked him, \"Who is the most knowledgeable person on earth?\" Moses responded, \"That would be me!\" So Allah revealed to Moses that he should not have said this and there was in fact someone who was more knowledgeable than him. Moses was commanded to travel to meet this man, named Al-Kha\u1e0dir, at the junction of the two seas. Islamic scholars have argued this could be the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, the southern part of Sinai where the Rea Sea splits into the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba, or the Bosporus in Istanbul which is a strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara.\nHadith, exegesis, traditions.\nJoshua was regarded by some classical scholars as the prophetic successor to Moses () Al-Tabari relates in his \"History of the Prophets and Kings\" that Joshua was one of the twelve spies, and Muslim scholars believe that the two believing spies referred to in the Quran are Joshua and Caleb. Joshua was exceptional among the Israelites for being one of the few faithful followers of Allah.\nSignificant events from Joshua's Muslim narratives include the crossing of the Jordan River and the conquest of \"Bait al-Maqdis\". \nThe traditional Muslim scholastic commentaries has narrated the miracle which shown by Joshua as a sign that he is a prophet in Islam. Ibn Kathir gave commentary of Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal Hadith that during the siege of Jerusalem, Yoshua prayed to God to withheld the sun until he won, which resulted in the day did not cease, and the sun only set after the Israelites under Joshua manage to capture the city. \"al-Jalalayn\" says, \"Ahmad [b. Hanbal] reported in his Musnad, the [following] had\u012bth, 'The sun was never detained for any human, except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem]'.\" According to Islamic tradition, Joshua lived for about 110 years, and his shrine is located in the city of H\u0101rith in the region of Sh\u0101m (Greater Syria).\nMuslim literature includes traditions of Joshua not found in the Hebrew Bible. Joshua is credited with being present at Moses's death and literature records that Moses's garments were with Joshua at the time of his departure. In Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, Joshua is mentioned as Yusha' bin Nun and is the attendant to Moses during his meeting with Khidr. This hadith episode was used by scholars for the exegesis of Quran scripture chapter Al-Kahf about the journey of Moses.\nIn art and literature.\nIn the literary tradition of medieval Europe, Joshua is known as one of the Nine Worthies. In \"The Divine Comedy\" Joshua's spirit appears to Dante in the Heaven of Mars, where he is grouped with the other \"warriors of the faith.\"\nBaroque composer Georg Frideric Handel composed the oratorio \"Joshua\" in 1747. Composer Franz Waxman composed an oratorio \"Joshua\" in 1959. Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed \"Josue\" (H.404 and H.404 a), an oratorio for soloists, double chorus, double orchestra and continuo, in 1680.\nNomenclature in biology.\nAccording to legend, Mormon pioneers in the United States first referred to the \"yucca brevifolia\" agave plant as the Joshua tree because its branches reminded them of Joshua stretching his arms upward in supplication, guiding the travelers westward.\nJoshua is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of snake, Joshua's blind snake (\"Trilepida joshuai\"), the holotype of which was collected at Jeric\u00f3, Antioquia, Colombia.\nJewish holidays.\nReligious holiday.\nThe annual commemoration of Joshua's yahrtzeit (the anniversary of his death) is marked on the 26th of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar. Thousands make the pilgrimage to the Tomb of Joshua at Kifl Haris near Nablus, West Bank, on the preceding night.\nIsraeli Zionist holiday.\nYom HaAliyah (Aliyah Day; ) is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan, as per the opening clause of the Yom HaAliyah Law, as a Zionist celebration of \"Jewish immigration to the Land of Israel as the basis for the existence of the State of Israel\", and secondarily \"to mark the date of entry into the Land of Israel\", i.e. to commemorate Joshua having led the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the Ark of the Covenant.\nTomb of Joshua.\nSamaritan and Jewish traditions.\nAccording to a Samaritan tradition, noted in 1877, the tombs of Joshua and Caleb were in Kifl Haris.\nAccording to , the tomb of Joshua is in Timnath-heres, and Jewish tradition also places the tombs of Joshua's father, Nun, and his companion, Caleb, at that site, which is identified by Orthodox Jews with Kifl Haris. Thousands make the pilgrimage to the tombs on the annual commemoration of Joshua's death, 26th of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar.\nIt seems that old Jewish traditions once associated Meron in the Upper Galilee with the burial site of Joshua.\nIslamic sites.\nJoshua is believed by some Muslims to be buried on Joshua's Hill in the Beykoz district of Istanbul. Alternative traditional sites for his tomb are situated in Israel (the Shia shrine at Al-Nabi Yusha'), Jordan (An-Nabi Yusha' bin Noon, a Sunni shrine near the city of Al-Salt), Iran (Historical cemetery of Takht e Foolad in Esfahan) and Iraq (the Nabi Yusha' shrine of Baghdad). A local tradition combining three versions of three different Yushas, including biblical Joshua, places the tomb inside a cave in the Tripoli Mountains, overlooking the coastal town of el-Minyieh near Tripoli, Lebanon.\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the book of 1 Kings, he reigned for 22 years and \"there was war continually between Rehoboam and Jeroboam\". Jeroboam also fought Abijam son of Rehoboam king of Judah. Jeroboam is often described as \"doing evil in the sight of the Lord\"\nWilliam F. Albright has dated his reign from 922 to 901 BC, while Edwin R. Thiele offers the dates 931 to 910 BC.\nThere has been much academic discussion in recent years on whether Jeroboam I existed and whether he may be a retrojection of Jeroboam II, though there is not a consensus on the topic.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Y\u0101r\u014f\u1e07\u2018\u0101m\" &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05dd\u200e is commonly held to have been derived from \"r\u012b\u1e07\" &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d1\u200e and \"\u02bfam\" &lt;templatestyles src=\"Script/styles_hebrew.css\" /&gt;\u05e2\u05b7\u05dd\u200e, signifying \"the people contend\" or \"he pleads the people's cause\".

In the Septuagint he is called \"Hieroboam\" (\u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03bf\u03ac\u03bc).\nBiblical background.\nJeroboam was the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zereda. His mother, named Zeruah (\u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2 \"leprous\") was a widow. He had at least two sons, Abijah and Nadab; Nadab succeeded Jeroboam on the throne.\nKing Solomon made the young Jeroboam a over his tribesmen in the building of the fortress Millo in Jerusalem and of other public works, where he became conversant with the widespread discontent caused by the extravagances which marked the reign of Solomon.\nInfluenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the aim of becoming king; but these plans were discovered, and he fled to Egypt, where he remained under the protection of Pharaoh Shishak until the death of Solomon. After learning of Solomon\u2019s death, Jeroboam returned and participated in a delegation sent to ask the new king Rehoboam to reduce taxes. After Rehoboam rejected their petition, ten of the tribes withdrew their allegiance to the House of David and proclaimed Jeroboam their king, forming the northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria). Only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained to form the rump kingdom of Judah, loyal to Rehoboam.\nTemples.\nJeroboam rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of the northern kingdom. Fearing that the pilgrimages to the temple in Jerusalem prescribed by the Law might provide an occasion for his people to go back to their old allegiances, Jeroboam built two state temples with golden calves, one in Bethel and the other in Dan. This act is condemned by an unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 13, where the Lord declares that Jeroboam has cast YHWH behind his back. Jeroboam further deviated from normative Torah law by declaring the holiday of Sukkot in the eighth month of the calendar instead of the seventh (perhaps by adding a leap month in Elul).\nAccording to 1 Kings, while Jeroboam was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a \"man of God\" warned him that \"a son named Josiah will be born to the house of David\", who would destroy the altar (referring to King Josiah of Judah who would rule approximately three hundred years later). When Jeroboam attempted to have the prophet arrested for his bold words of defiance, the king's hand was \"dried up\", and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At the entreaty of the man of God, his hand was restored to him again, but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. Jeroboam offered hospitality to the man of God but this was declined, not out of contempt but in obedience to the command of God. The prophecy is fulfilled in 2 Kings.\nIdentity of related figures.\nJosephus and Jerome identify the \"man of God\" who warned Jeroboam as the seer named Iddo.\nThe wife of Jeroboam is a character in the Hebrew Bible. Though unnamed in the Masoretic Text, she appears in the Septuagint as an Egyptian princess called Ano:\n\"And Sousakim gave to Jeroboam Ano the eldest sister of Thekemina his wife, to him as wife; she was great among the king's daughters...\"\nIn 1 Kings, Jeroboam's son Abijah falls ill, and Jeroboam sends his wife to the prophet Ahijah. Ahijah's message, however, is that Abijah will die, which he does. According to \"The Jewish Encyclopedia\", the good that Abijah did for which he would be laid in the grave (\"Rabbinical Literature: The passage, I Kings, xiv. 13, in which there is a reference to \"some good thing [found in him] toward the Lord God of Israel\") is interpreted (M. \u1e32. 28b) as an allusion to Abijah's courageous and pious act in removing the sentinels placed by his father on the frontier between Israel and Judah to prevent pilgrimages to Jerusalem. Some assert that Abijah himself undertook a pilgrimage.\" Nevertheless, these sentinels on the frontier were not removed until the reign of Hoshea, last king of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The Rabbis explain the description of Hoshea \"And he did what was evil in the eyes of the L\u2011rd, though not like the kings of Israel who had preceded him.\"\nWar with Judah.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, Jeroboam was in \"constant war with the house of Judah\". While the southern kingdom made no serious military effort to regain power over the north, there was a long-lasting boundary dispute, fighting over which lasted most of Jeroboam\u2019s reign. \nIn the eighteenth year of Jeroboam's reign, Abijah (also known as Abijam), Rehoboam's son, became king of Judah. During his short reign of three years, Abijah went to considerable lengths to bring the Kingdom of Israel back under his control. He waged a major battle against Jeroboam in the mountains of Ephraim. According to the Book of Chronicles Abijah had a force of 400,000 and Jeroboam 800,000. The Biblical sources mention that Abijah addressed the armies of Israel, urging them to submit and to let the Kingdom of Israel be whole again, but his plea fell on deaf ears. The biblical account states that his elite warriors fended off a pincer movement and routed Jeroboam's troops, killing 500,000 of them.\nJeroboam was crippled by this severe defeat to Abijah and posed little threat to the Kingdom of Judah for the rest of his reign. He also lost the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. Bethel was an important centre for Jeroboam's Golden Calf cult (which used non-Levites as priests), located on Israel's southern border, which had been allocated to the Tribe of Benjamin by Joshua, as was Ephron, which is believed to be the Ophrah that was allocated to the Tribe of Benjamin by Joshua.\nJeroboam died soon after Abijam.\nRabbinic literature.\nAccording to Rabbinic literature, Gehazi possessed a magnet by which he lifted up the idol made by Jeroboam, so that it was seen between heaven and earth; he had \"Yhwh\" engraved on it, and in consequence the idol (a calf) pronounced the first two words of the Decalogue\nThat Ahijah, though one of the pillars of righteousness, should have been sent to Jeroboam with a divine message inducing him to establish his idolatrous kingdom is explained by the rabbis in the following manner: They say that he was entrapped by a ruse of Jeroboam's idolatrous friends, who circulated a document requesting Jeroboam to become king and stipulating that, if he were elected, he set up a golden calf at Dan and Beth-El. Ahijah signed this document, believing firmly that Jeroboam would not betray his trust. In this he was mistaken. Jeroboam had shown great wisdom and learning, and appeared to Ahijah \"as pure as the new garment\" he wore when Ahijah saw him coming out of Jerusalem (). Moreover, as he excelled all the rest of the students, he had been initiated by Ahijah into the innermost secrets of the Law. Just as the words said of Isaac, \"his eyes were dim, so that he could not see\" (), are taken to refer to spiritual blindness (because he favored his wicked son Esau), so the words, \"Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set by reason of his age\" (), imply spiritual blindness on the part of Ahijah, who favored a wicked student and set him up as ruler. For this reason Ahijah was stricken with the plague.\nJeroboam became for the rabbinical writers a prototypical evildoer. This appears in the Septuagint (2d recension), where even his mother is represented as a disreputable woman. His name is explained as \"one that caused strife among the people,\" or \"one that caused strife between the people and their Heavenly Father\". The name (Nebat) of his father is construed as implying some defect in his progenitor. Although Jeroboam reached the throne because he reproved Solomon, he was nevertheless punished for doing so publicly. In the meeting between Jeroboam and Ahijah, the Rabbis detect indications of Jeroboam's presumption, his zeal for impious innovations. His arrogance brought about his doom. His political reasons for introducing idolatry are condemned. As one that led many into sin, the sins of many cling to him. He is said to have invented 103 interpretations of the law in reference to the priests to justify his course. At first God was pleased with him and his sacrifice because he was pious, and in order to prevent his going astray proposed to His council of angels to remove him from earth, but He was prevailed upon to let him live; and then Jeroboam, while still a lad, turned to wickedness. God had offered to raise him into Gan Eden; but when Jeroboam heard that David would enjoy the highest honors there, he refused. Jeroboam had even learned the \"mysteries of the chariot\". Jeroboam is excluded from the world to come. Nevertheless, he will still arise when the time of resurrection arrives, as compensation for the fact that many years after he died his remains were ignominiously burned in fire.\nAn account of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi tells how in the fourth compartment of Gehenna are ten nations presided over by Jeroboam. Jeroboam, however, has immunity for he himself had studied the Law, and he comes from those who had said: \"We will do and hearken.\"\nCommentary on sources.\nThe account of Jeroboam's life, like that of all his successors, ends with the formula \"And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel\".\n\"The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel\", likely compiled by or derived from these kings' own scribes, is likely the source for the basic facts of Jeroboam's life and reign, though the compiler(s) of the extant Book of Kings clearly made selective use of it and added hostile commentaries. His family was eventually wiped out.\nThe prophecies of doom concerning the fall of both the House of Jeroboam and the northern kingdom as a whole (\"For the Lord shall smite Israel..., and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river\", might have been composed retroactively, after the events described had already come to pass. Alternatively, the prophecy could have been a logical deduction. Judah had just been conquered and turned into a vassal of Egypt, while Israel stood between the Egyptian and Mesopotamian empires.\nOded and Sperling argued that the story of the golden calf in the wilderness was composed as a polemic against Jeroboam's cultic restoration by claiming that its origins were inconsistent with worship of YHWH.\nThomas R\u00f6mer argued that Jeroboam I may not have existed and that Deuteronomistic redactors transferred data from the reign of Jeroboam II to Jeroboam I, although Lester L. Grabbe finds this theory unlikely.\nIn popular culture.\nJeroboam is portrayed by Nickolas Grace in \"Solomon &amp; Sheba\" (1995) and by Richard Dillane in \"Solomon\" (1997). Both of these are television films.\nWithin the range of standard liquor bottle sizes, a Jeroboam (also called a Double Magnum) contains 3 liters (101.4 fluid ounces). A Rehoboam contains 4.5 liters (152.2 fluid ounces).\n\"The Jeroboam\" is the name of a whaling ship in \"Moby Dick\". Ahab and Ishmael's ship, the \"Pequod\", meets the Jeroboam in Chapter 71, and learns of its trials.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16125", "revid": "2300625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16125", "title": "John the Baptist", "text": "1st-century prophet\nJohn the Baptist (c.\u20096 BC \u2013 ) was a Jewish preacher active in the area of the Jordan River in the early first century AD. He is also known as Saint John the Forerunner in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, Saint John the Immerser in the Baptist tradition, and as the prophet Yahya ibn Zakariya in Islam. He is sometimes referred to as John the Baptiser.\nJohn is mentioned by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, and he is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, the Druze faith, and Mandaeism; in the last of these he is considered to be the final and most vital prophet. He is considered to be a prophet of God by all of the aforementioned faiths, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian denominations. According to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself; in the Gospels, he is portrayed as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus himself identifies John as \"Elijah who is to come\", which is a direct reference to the Book of Malachi (Malachi 4:5), as confirmed by the angel Gabriel, who announced John's birth to his father Zechariah. According to the Gospel of Luke, John and Jesus were relatives.\nSome scholars think that John belonged to the Essenes, a semi-ascetic Jewish sect who expected a messiah and practised ritual baptism. John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement. Most biblical scholars agree that John baptized Jesus, and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus's early followers had previously been followers of John. According to the New Testament, John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas around AD 30 after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife and then unlawfully wedding Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod Philip I. Josephus also mentions John in the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" and states that he was executed by order of Herod Antipas in the fortress at Machaerus.\nFollowers of John existed into the second century AD, and some proclaimed him to be the Messiah awaited by Jews. In modern times, the followers of John the Baptist are the Mandaeans, an ancient ethnoreligious group who believe that he is their greatest and final prophet. In the Roman martyrology, John is the only saint whose birth and death are both commemorated.\nGospel narratives.\nJohn the Baptist is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels and the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes. The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke) describe John baptising Jesus; in the Gospel of John this is inferred by many to be referred to in John 1:32.\nIn Mark.\nThe Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfilment of a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah, which is a conflation of texts from Isaiah, Malachi, and Exodus, about a messenger being sent ahead, and a voice crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing clothes of camel's hair, and living on locusts and wild honey. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\nJesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how, as he emerges from the water, Jesus sees the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him \"like a dove\", and he hears a voice from heaven that says, \"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased\".\nLater in the gospel there is an account of John's death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch Herod Antipas, hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying Herodias, the ex-wife of his brother, named here as Philip. Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who \"liked to listen\" to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a \"righteous and holy man\".\nThe account then describes how Herodias' unnamed daughter dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John's disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.\nThe Gospel refers to Antipas as \"King\" and the ex-husband of Herodias is named as Philip, but he is known to have been called Herod II. Although the wording implies the girl was the daughter of Herodias, many texts describe her as \"Herod's daughter, Herodias\". Since these texts are early and significant and the reading is 'difficult', many scholars see this as the original version, altered in later versions and in Matthew and Luke. Josephus says that Herodias had a daughter by the name of Salome.\nScholars have speculated about the origins of the story. Since it shows signs of having been composed in Aramaic, which Mark apparently did not speak, he is likely to have got it from a Palestinian source. There are a variety of opinions about how much actual historical material it contains, especially given the alleged factual errors. Many scholars have seen the story of John arrested, executed, and buried in a tomb as a conscious foreshadowing of the fate of Jesus.\nIn Matthew.\nThe Gospel of Matthew account begins with the same modified quotation from Isaiah,moving the Malachi and Exodus material to later in the text, where it is quoted by Jesus. The description of John is possibly taken directly from Mark (\"clothing of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey\"), along with the proclamation that one was coming who would baptize with the Holy Spirit \"and fire\". The book of Matthew next has Jesus coming to John to be baptized, but John objects because he is not worthy because Jesus is the one that brings the baptism in the Spirit.\nUnlike Mark, Matthew describes John as critical of Pharisees and Sadducees and as preaching \"the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" and a \"coming judgment\".\nMatthew shortens the account of the beheading of John, and adds two elements: that Herod Antipas wants John dead, and that the death is reported to Jesus by his disciples. Matthew's approach is to shift the focus away from Herod and onto John as a prototype of Jesus. Where Mark has Herod killing John reluctantly and at Herodias' insistence, Matthew describes him as wanting John dead.\nIn Luke and Acts.\nThe Gospel of Luke adds an account of John's infancy, introducing him as the miraculous son of Zechariah, an old priest, and his wife Elizabeth, who was past menopause and therefore unable to have children. According to this account, the birth of John was foretold by the angel Gabriel to Zechariah while he was performing his functions as a priest in the temple of Jerusalem. Since he is described as a priest of the course of Abijah and Elizabeth as one of the daughters of Aaron, this would make John a descendant of Aaron on both his father's and mother's side. On the basis of this account, the Catholic as well as the Anglican and Lutheran liturgical calendars placed the feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist on 24 June, six months before Christmas.\nElizabeth is described as a \"relative\" of Mary the mother of Jesus, in Luke 1:36. There is no mention of a family relationship between John and Jesus in the other Gospels, and Raymond E. Brown has described it as \"of dubious historicity\". G\u00e9za Vermes has called it \"artificial and undoubtedly Luke's creation\". The many similarities between Luke's story of the birth of John and the Old Testament account of the birth of Samuel suggest that Luke's account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus are modelled on that of Samuel.\nUniquely in the Gospel of Luke, John explicitly teaches charity, baptizes tax-collectors, and advises soldiers. He teaches his disciples to pray. Frederic Farrar notes that John travels around the Jordan region to reach people, whereas in the accounts in the other gospels, the crowds come to him.\nThe text briefly mentions that John is imprisoned and later beheaded by Herod, but the Gospel of Luke lacks the story of a step-daughter stripping for Herod and requesting John's head.\nThe Book of Acts portrays some disciples of John becoming followers of Jesus, a development not reported by the gospels except for the early case of Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.\nIn the Gospel of John.\nThe fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as \"a man sent from God\" who \"was not the light\", but \"came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe\". John confirms that he is not the Christ nor Elijah nor 'the prophet' when asked by Jewish priests and Pharisees; instead, he described himself as the \"voice of one crying in the wilderness\".\nUpon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the \"testifier and confessor \"par excellence\"\", particularly when compared to figures like Nicodemus.\nJesus's baptism is implied but not depicted. Unlike the other gospels, it is John himself who testifies to seeing \"the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him\". John explicitly announces that Jesus is the one \"who baptizes with the Holy Spirit\" and John even professes a \"belief that he is the Son of God\" and \"the Lamb of God\".\nThe Gospel of John reports that Jesus' disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification. In this debate John argued that Jesus \"must become greater,\" while he (John) \"must become less.\"\nThe Gospel of John then points out that Jesus' disciples were baptizing more people than John. Later, the Gospel relates that Jesus regarded John as \"a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light\".\nComparative analysis.\nAll four Gospels start Jesus' ministry in association with the appearance of John the Baptist. Simon J. Joseph has argued that the Gospel demotes the historical John by depicting him as a prophetic forerunner to Jesus whereas his ministry actually complemented Jesus'.\nThe prophecy of Isaiah.\nAlthough the Gospel of Mark implies that the arrival of John the Baptist is the fulfilment of a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah, the words quoted (\"I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way \u2013 a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'\") are a composite of texts from Isaiah, Malachi and the Book of Exodus. Matthew and Luke do not include the first part of the reference.\nBaptism of Jesus.\nThe gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, it is Jesus who sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy\". They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the \"voice came out of heaven\" are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down \"out of heaven\" (John 12:28\u201330, John 1:32).\nIn Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead \"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.\"\nIn the Gospel of John, John the Baptist sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus's status.\nJohn's knowledge of Jesus.\nJohn's knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.\nJohn and Elijah.\nThe Gospels vary in their depiction of John's relationship to Elijah. Matthew and Mark describe John's attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in , who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is \"Elijah who was to come\" (Matthew 11:14 \u2013 see also Matthew 17:11\u201313); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah's successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah. In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and tells him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah.\"\nThe following comparison table is primarily based on the New International Version (NIV) English translation of the New Testament. The account of Flavius Josephus in \"Antiquities of the Jews\" was translated by William Whiston.\nIn Josephus's \"Antiquities of the Jews\".\nAn account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by Flavius Josephus (37\u2013100):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's [Antipas's] army came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable to him, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away [or the remission] of some sins [only], but for the purification of the body; supposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death. Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a mark of God's displeasure to him.\nAccording to this passage, the execution of John was blamed for the defeat Herod suffered. Some have claimed that this passage indicates that John died near the time of the destruction of Herod's army in AD 36. However, in a different passage, Josephus states that the end of Herod's marriage with Aretas's daughter (after which John was killed) was only the beginning of hostilities between Herod and Aretas, which later escalated into the battle.\nBiblical scholar John Dominic Crossan differentiates between Josephus's account of John and Jesus, saying, \"John had a monopoly, but Jesus had a franchise.\" To get baptized, Crossan writes, a person went only to John; to stop the movement one only needed to stop John (therefore his movement ended with his death). Jesus invited all to come and see how he and his companions had already accepted the government of God, entered it and were living it. Such a communal praxis was not just for himself, but could survive without him, unlike John's movement.\nRelics.\nMatthew 14:12 records that \"his disciples came and took away [John's] body and buried it.\" Theologian Joseph Benson refers to a belief that they managed to do so because \"it seems that the body had been thrown over the prison walls, without burial, probably by order of Herodias.\"\nThe fate of his head.\nWhat became of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine. Ancient historians Josephus, Nicephorus and Symeon Metaphrastes assumed that Herodias had it buried in the fortress of Machaerus.\nAn Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that, after being buried, the head was discovered by John's followers and was taken to the Mount of Olives, where it was twice buried and discovered, the latter events giving rise to the Orthodox feast of the First and Second Finding of the Head of St. John the Baptist. Other writers say that it was interred in Herod's palace in Jerusalem; there it was found during the reign of Constantine, and thence secretly taken to Emesa (modern Homs, in Syria), where it was concealed, the place remaining unknown for years, until it was manifested by revelation in 452, an event celebrated in the Orthodox Church as the Third Finding.\nTwo Catholic churches and one mosque claim to have the head of John the Baptist: the Umayyad Mosque, in Damascus (Syria); the church of San Silvestro in Capite, in Rome; and Amiens Cathedral, in France (the French king would have had it brought from Constantinople after the Fourth Crusade). A fourth claim is made by the Residenz Museum in Munich, Germany, which keeps a reliquary containing what the Wittelsbach rulers of Bavaria believed to be the head of Saint John.\nRight hand relics.\nAccording to the Christian Arab Ibn Butlan, the church of Cassian in Antioch held the right arm of John the Baptist until it was smuggled to Chalcedon and later to Constantinople. An Orthodox Christian monastery in Cetinje, Montenegro, and the Catholic Cathedral of Siena, in Italy, both claim to have John the Baptist's right arm and hand, with which he baptised Jesus. According to the Catholic account, in 1464 Pope Pius II donated what was identified as the right arm and hand of John the Baptist to the Siena Cathedral. The donation charter identifies the relic as \"the arm of blessed John the Baptist. And this is the very arm that baptized the Lord.\" The relic is displayed on the high altar of the Siena Cathedral annually in June.\nTopkapi Palace, in Istanbul, claims to have John's right hand index finger.\nVarious relics and traditions.\nRight hand \u2013 St. John the Baptist Church of Chinsurah (India).\nJohn the Baptist's right hand is allegedly preserved in the Armenian Apostolic Church of St. John at Chinsurah, West Bengal, in India, where each year on \"Chinsurah Day\" in January it blesses the Armenian Christians of Calcutta.\nDecapitation cloth.\nThe decapitation cloth of Saint John, the cloth which covered his head after his execution, is said to be kept at the Aachen Cathedral, in Germany.\nHistoric Armenia.\nAccording to Armenian tradition, the remains of John the Baptist would in some point have been transferred by Gregory the Illuminator to the Saint Karapet Armenian Monastery.\nBulgaria.\nIn 2010, bones were discovered in the ruins of a Bulgarian church in the St. John the Forerunner Monastery (4th\u201317th centuries) on the Black Sea island of Sveti Ivan and two years later, after DNA and radio carbon testing proved the bones belonged to a Middle Eastern man who lived in the first century AD, scientists said that the remains could conceivably have belonged to John the Baptist. The remains, found in a reliquarium, are presently kept in the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Sozopol.\nEgypt.\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church also have claimed to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist. A crypt and relics said to be John's and mentioned in eleventh- and sixteenth-century manuscripts, were discovered in 1969 during restoration of the Church of St. Macarius at the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great in Scetes, Egypt.\nNagorno-Karabakh.\nAdditional relics are claimed to reside in Gandzasar Monastery's Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, in Nagorno-Karabakh.\nPurported left finger bone.\nThe bone of one of John the Baptist's left fingers is said to be at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri. It is held in a Gothic-style monstrance made of gilded silver that dates back to fourteenth-century Lower Saxony.\nHalifax, England.\nAnother obscure claim relates to the town of Halifax in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, where, as patron saint of the town, John the Baptist's head appears on the official coat-of-arms. One legend (among others) bases the etymology of the town's place-name on \"halig\" (holy) and \"fax\" (hair), claiming that a relic of the head, or face, of John the Baptist once existed in the town.\nReligious views.\nChristianity.\nThe Gospels describe John the Baptist as having had a specific role ordained by God as forerunner or precursor of Jesus, who was the foretold Messiah. The New Testament Gospels speak of this role. In Luke 1:17 the role of John is referred to as being \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" In Luke 1:76 as \"thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\" and in Luke 1:77 as being \"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.\"\nThere are several passages within the Old Testament which are interpreted by Christians as being prophetic of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the Book of Malachi that refers to a prophet who would \"prepare the way of the Lord\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Malachi 3:1\nAlso at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5\u20136 it says,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Jews of Jesus' day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; some present day Jews continue to await Elijah's coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the Passover Seder. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in Matthew 17:10, \"Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?\"The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\" Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.\u2014\u200a\nThese passages are applied to John in the Synoptic Gospels. But where Matthew specifically identifies John the Baptist as Elijah's spiritual successor, the gospels of Mark and Luke are silent on the matter. The Gospel of John states that John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not deny, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ.\" They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\"\u2014\u200a\nInfluence on Paul.\nMany scholars believe there was contact between the early church in the Apostolic Age and what is called the \"Qumran-Essene community\". The Dead Sea Scrolls were found at Qumran, which the majority of historians and archaeologists identify as an Essene settlement. John the Baptist is thought to have been either an Essene or \"associated\" with the community at Khirbet Qumran. According to the Book of Acts, Paul met some \"disciples of John\" in Ephesus.\nCatholic Church.\nThe Catholic Church commemorates Saint John the Baptist on two feast days:\nAccording to Frederick Holweck, at the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary to his mother Elizabeth, as recounted in Luke 1:39\u201357, John, sensing the presence of his Jesus, upon the arrival of Mary, leaped in the womb of his mother; he was then cleansed from original sin and filled with the grace of God. In her \"Treatise of Prayer\", Saint Catherine of Siena includes a brief altercation with the Devil regarding her fight due to the Devil attempting to lure her with vanity and flattery. Speaking in the first person, Catherine responds to the Devil with the following words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] humiliation of yourself, and you answered the Devil with these words: \"Wretch that I am! John the Baptist never sinned and was sanctified in his mother's womb. And I have committed so many sins [...]\"\u2014\u200a\nEastern Christianity.\nThe Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox faith believe that John was the last of the Old Testament prophets, thus serving as a bridge between that period of revelation and the New Covenant. They also teach that, following his death, John descended into Hades and there once more preached that Jesus the Messiah was coming, so he was the Forerunner of Christ in death as he had been in life. Eastern Catholic and Orthodox churches will often have an icon of Saint John the Baptist in a place of honour on the iconostasis, and he is frequently mentioned during the Divine Services. Every Tuesday throughout the year is dedicated to his memory.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church remembers Saint John the Forerunner on six separate feast days, listed here in order in which they occur during the church year (which begins on 1 September):\n20 January In the Serbian Orthodox Church, the feast day of Saint John the Baptist is called \"Jovanjdan\" and is celebrated on 20 January (according to the Gregorian calendar).\nKey points about Jovanjdan:\nName: \"Jovanjdan\" directly translates to \"John's Day\" in Serbian.\nSignificance: This is a major feast day for Serbian Orthodox Christians, often considered a family \"Slava\" (patron saint day) where families celebrate with a special feast.\nCalendar note: While the Gregorian calendar date is 20 January, the Serbian Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar, which can result in a slightly different date.\nIn addition to the above, 5 September is the commemoration of Zacharias and Elizabeth, Saint John's parents.\nThe Russian Orthodox Church observes 12 October as the Transfer of the Right Hand of the Forerunner from Malta to Gatchina (1799).\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that modern revelation confirms the biblical account of John and also makes known additional events in his ministry. According to this belief, John was \"ordained by the angel of God\" when he was eight days old \"to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews\" and to prepare a people for the Lord. Latter-day Saints also believe that \"he was baptized while yet in his childhood.\"\nJoseph Smith said: \"Let us come into New Testament times \u2013 so many are ever praising the Lord and His apostles. We will commence with John the Baptist. When Herod's edict went forth to destroy the young children, John was about six months older than Jesus, and came under this hellish edict, and Zecharias caused his mother to take him into the mountains, where he was raised on locusts and wild honey. When his father refused to disclose his hiding place, and being the officiating high priest at the Temple that year, was slain by Herod's order, between the porch and the altar, as Jesus said.\"\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints teaches that John the Baptist appeared on the banks of the Susquehanna River near Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, as a resurrected being to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on 15 May 1829, and ordained them to the Aaronic priesthood. According to the Church's dispensational view of religious history, John's ministry has operated in three dispensations: he was the last of the prophets under the law of Moses; he was the first of the New Testament prophets; and he was sent to restore the Aaronic priesthood in our day (the dispensation of the fulness of times). Latter-day Saints believe John's ministry was foretold by two prophets whose teachings are included in the Book of Mormon: Lehi and his son Nephi.\nUnification Church.\nThe Unification Church teaches that God intended John to help Jesus during his public ministry in Judea. In particular, John should have done everything in his power to persuade the Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah. He was to become Jesus' main disciple and John's disciples were to become Jesus' disciples. Unfortunately, John did not follow Jesus and continued his own way of baptizing people. Moreover, John also denied that he was Elijah when queried by several Jewish leaders, contradicting Jesus who stated John is Elijah who was to come. Many Jews therefore could not accept Jesus as the Messiah because John denied being Elijah, as the prophet's appearance was a prerequisite for the Messiah's arrival as stated in Malachi 4:5. According to the Unification Church, \"John the Baptist was in the position of representing Elijah's physical body, making himself identical with Elijah from the standpoint of their mission.\"\nAccording to Matthew 11:11, Jesus stated \"there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist.\" However, in referring to John's blocking the way of the Jews' understanding of him as the Messiah, Jesus said \"yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\" John's failure to follow Jesus became the chief obstacle to the fulfilment of Jesus' mission.\nSyrian-Egyptian Gnosticism.\nAmong the early Judeo-Christian Gnostics the Ebionites held that John, along with Jesus and James the Just \u2013 all of whom they revered \u2013 were vegetarians. Epiphanius of Salamis records that this group had amended their Gospel of Matthew \u2013 known today as the Gospel of the Ebionites \u2013 to change where John eats \"locusts\" to read \"honey cakes\" or \"manna\".\nMandaeism.\nJohn the Baptist, or Yuhana Ma\u1e63bana ( ) is considered the greatest prophet of the Mandaeans. Mandaeans also refer to him as (John, son of Zechariah). He plays a large part in their religious texts such as the Ginza Rabba and the Mandaean Book of John. Mandaeans believe that they descend directly from John's original disciples but they do not believe that their religion began with John, tracing their beliefs back to their first prophet Adam. According to Mandaeism, John was a great teacher, a Nasoraean and renewer of the faith. John is a messenger of Light () and Truth () who possessed the power of healing and full Gnosis (). Mandaean texts make it abundantly clear that early Mandaeans were extremely loyal to John and viewed him as a prophetic reformer of the ancient Mandaean/Israelite tradition. Scholars such as Rudolf Mac\u00fach, E. S. Drower, Jorunn J. Buckley, and \u015einasi G\u00fcnd\u00fcz believe that the Mandaeans likely have a historical connection with John's original disciples. Mandaeans believe that John was married, with his wife named Anhar, and had children.\nEni\u0161bai (Elizabeth) is mentioned as the mother of John the Baptist in chapters 18, 21, and 32 of the Mandaean Book of John.\nIslam.\nIn Islam, John the Baptist is known as Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn Zakariy\u0101 () and considered the maternal cousin of Jesus as well as a prophet. He is also believed by Muslims to have been a witness to the word of God who would herald the coming of Jesus. His father Zechariah was also an Islamic prophet. Islamic tradition maintains that John met Muhammad on the night of the Mi'raj, along with Jesus in the second heaven. John's story was also told to the Abyssinian king during the Muslim refugees' Migration to Abyssinia. According to the Quran, John was one on whom God sent peace on the day that he was born and the day that he died.\nQuranic mentions.\nThe Quran claims that John the Baptist was the first to receive this name (Quran https://) but since the name Yo\u1e25anan occurs many times before John the Baptist, this verse is referring either to Islamic scholar consensus that \"Ya\u1e25y\u0101\" is not the same name as \"Yo\u1e25anan\" or to the Biblical account of the miraculous naming of John, which accounted that he was almost named \"Zacharias\" (Greek: ) after his father's name, as no one in the lineage of his father Zacharias (also known as Zechariah) had been named \"John\" (\"Yohanan\"/\"Yoannes\") before him.\nIn the Quran, God frequently mentions Zechariah's continuous praying for the birth of a son. Zechariah's wife, mentioned in the New Testament as Elizabeth () was barren and therefore the birth of a child seemed impossible. As a gift from God, Zechariah () was given a son by the name of \"Ya\u1e25ya\" or \"John\", a name specially chosen for this child alone. In accordance with Zechariah's prayer, God made John and Jesus, who according to exegesis was born six months later, renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and lost by the Israelites. The Quran says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\u02f9The angels announced,\u02fa \"O Zachariah! Indeed, We give you the good news of \u02f9the birth of\u02fa a son, whose name will be John\u2014a name We have not given to anyone before.\"\nHe wondered, \"My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren, and I have become extremely old?\"\nAn angel replied, \"So will it be! Your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, just as I created you before, when you were nothing!'\"\nZachariah said, \"My Lord! Grant me a sign.\" He responded, \"Your sign is that you will not \u02f9be able to\u02fa speak to people for three nights, despite being healthy.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nAccording to the Quran, John was exhorted to hold fast to scripture and was given wisdom by God while still a child. He was pure and devout, and walked well in the presence of God. He was dutiful towards his parents and he was not arrogant or rebellious. John's reading and understanding of the scriptures, when only a child, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time. Muslim exegesis narrates that Jesus sent John out with twelve disciples, who preached the message before Jesus called his own disciples. The Quran says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u02f9It was later said,\u02fa \"O John! Hold firmly to the Scriptures.\" And We granted him wisdom while \u02f9he was still\u02fa a child,\nJohn was a classical prophet, who was exalted high by God for his bold denouncing of all things sinful. Furthermore, the Quran speaks of John's gentle piety and love and his humble attitude towards life, for which he was granted the Purity of Life:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;as well as purity and compassion from Us. And he was God-fearing,\nand kind to his parents. He was neither arrogant nor disobedient.\nPeace be upon him the day he was born, and the day of his death, and the day he will be raised back to life.&lt;/poem&gt;\nJohn is also honoured highly in Sufism, primarily because of the Quran's description of John's chastity and kindness. Sufis have frequently applied commentaries on the passages on John in the Quran, primarily concerning the God-given gift of \"Wisdom\" which he acquired in youth as well as his parallels with Jesus. Although several phrases used to describe John and Jesus are virtually identical in the Quran, the manner in which they are expressed is different.\nDruze view.\nDruze tradition honours several \"mentors\" and \"prophets\", and John the Baptist is honoured as a prophet. Druze venerate John the Baptist and he is considered a central figure in Druzism. Druze, like some Christians, believe that Elijah (al-Khidr) came back as John the Baptist, since they believe in reincarnation and the transmigration of the soul.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed view.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith considers John to have been a prophet of God who like all other prophets was sent to instill the knowledge of God, promote unity among the people of the world, and to show people the correct way to live. There are numerous quotations in the writings of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, mentioning John the Baptist. He is regarded by Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds as a lesser Prophet. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h claimed that his forerunner, the B\u00e1b, was the spiritual return of John the Baptist. In his letter to Pope Pius IX, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;O followers of the Son! We have once again sent John unto you, and He, verily, hath cried out in the wilderness of the Bay\u00e1n: O peoples of the world! Cleanse your eyes! The Day whereon ye can behold the Promised One and attain unto Him hath drawn nigh! O followers of the Gospel! Prepare the way! The Day of the advent of the Glorious Lord is at hand! Make ready to enter the Kingdom. Thus hath it been ordained by God, He Who causeth the dawn to break.\nJohn is believed to have had the specific role of foretelling and preparing the way for Jesus. In condemning those who had 'turned aside' from him, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h compared them to the followers of John the Baptist, who, he said, \"protested against Him Who was the Spirit (Jesus) saying: 'The dispensation of John hath not yet ended; wherefore hast thou come?'\" Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h believed that the B\u00e1b played the same role as John in preparing the people for his own coming. As such, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h refers to the B\u00e1b as 'My Forerunner', the Forerunner being a title that Christians reserve for John the Baptist. However, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds consider the B\u00e1b to be a greater Prophet (Manifestation of God) and thus possessed of a far greater station than John the Baptist.\nScholarship.\nScholars studying John the Baptist's relationship with Jesus of Nazareth have commented on the differences in their respective approaches.\nJames F. McGrath writes \"In the first half of the twentieth century, the Mandaeans received significant attention from New Testament scholars who thought that their high view of John the Baptist might mean they were the descendants of his disciples. Many historians think that Jesus of Nazareth was a disciple of John the Baptist before breaking away to form his own movement, and I am inclined to agree.\"\nL. Michael White says John the Baptist should be thought of \"...primarily as one who was calling for a return to an intensely Jewish piety [...] to follow the way of the Lord [...] to make oneself pure... to be right with God [...] And it seems to be that he calls for baptism as a sign of rededication or repurification of life in a typically Jewish way before God.\"\nJohn Dominic Crossan sees John the Baptist as an apocalyptic eschatologist, whose message was that \"God, very soon, imminently, any moment, is going to descend to eradicate the evil of this world in a sort of an apocalyptic consummation...\" When Jesus says John is the greatest person ever born on earth, but the least in the Kingdom of God is greater than John, it means Jesus is changing his vision of God and the Kingdom of God from what he has taken from John. For Crossan, Jesus is an ethical eschatologist that sees \"...the demand that God is making on us, not us on God so much as God on us, to do something about the evil in the world.\"\nMichael H. Crosby states there was \"no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus.\" He believes that John's concept of what a messiah should be was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus. Crosby states, \"an unbiased reading leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus' messiahship...\" Crosby considers John's effectiveness as a \"precursor\" in encouraging others to follow Jesus as very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers having become Jesus' disciples. Charles Croll points out that five of John's disciples immediately followed Jesus, four of whom became apostles, one third of the twelve.\nProfessor Candida Moss said that John and Jesus become \"de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace.\" After baptizing Jesus, John did not follow Jesus but maintained a separate ministry. After John's death, Jesus' followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, \"countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead.\" Moss also references the incident in Matthew 16 where disciples indicated some people believed Jesus was John the Baptist.\nPastor Robert L. Deffinbaugh views John's sending two of his disciples to ask Jesus if he were the Messiah or whether another should be sought as the Baptist's issuing a public challenge since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd. Deffinbaugh suggests that John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was presenting, as John had previously warned that the \"Messiah would come with fire.\" Jesus answered by indicating his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity: \"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor\". Charles Croll counters this view, suggesting that John had realized that his time of preparing the way was over and he was saying to Jesus that he now had to testify himself that he was the Coming One. Jesus' affirmative yet indirect response was two fold, first by pointing out that he was doing the work expected of the Messiah, referencing his commissioning text in Isaiah. Secondly, he affirmed John's ministry and message by identifying him as the unshakeable prophet of Malachi 3:1, who was among the greatest people who have ever lived and was not one to bend in the wind (Luke 7:18-35).\nHarold W. Attridge agrees with Crossan that John was an apocalyptic preacher. Attridge says most contemporary scholars would see the idea of John as the \"forerunner\" of Jesus as a construct developed by the early church to help explain the relationship between the two. \"For the early church it would have been something of an embarrassment to say that Jesus, who was in their minds superior to John the Baptist, had been baptized by him, and thereby proclaimed some sort of subordination to him, some sort of disciple relationship to him...\"\nBarbara Thiering questions the dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls and suggests that the Teacher of Righteousness (leader of the Essenes) preached coming fiery judgement, said \"the axe is laid to the roots of the tree\", called people \"vipers\", practised baptism and lived in the wilderness of Judea. Due to these reasons, she believes there is a strong possibility that the Teacher of Righteousness was John the Baptist. Charles Croll says that the similarities are very superficial and there are many substantial differences between John the Baptist and the Qumran sect.\nIn art.\nEarly Christian art.\nThe earliest depictions of St John are found in the \"Baptism of Christ\", one of the earliest scenes from the \"Life of Christ\" to be frequently depicted in Early Christian art, and John's tall, thin, even gaunt, and bearded figure is already established by the fifth century. Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus.\nByzantine and Eastern Orthodox art.\nIn Byzantine and later Eastern Orthodox art, John the Baptist and the Holy Virgin Mary often flank Jesus on either side. The composition of the \"Deesis\" came to be included in every Eastern Orthodox church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the Theotokos (Mary the \"God-bearer\") flank a Christ Pantocrator and intercede for humanity.\nIn Eastern Orthodox icons, he often has angel's wings, since Mark 1:2 describes him as a messenger.\nWestern art.\nAfter the earliest images showing the Baptism of the Lord follow ones with St John shown as an ascetic wearing camel hair, with a staff and scroll inscribed (in Western art) , or bearing a book or dish with a lamb on it.\nThe Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, where the donor was named for him or where there was some other patronage connection. John the Baptist is the patron saint of Florence and has often been depicted in the art of that city, and also frequently appears in baptistries, which are very often dedicated to him. Major works depicting St John the Baptist can be found in the Florence Baptistery, including the mosaics on the vault, the bronze doors by Andrea Pisano, and the great silver altar now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo.\nA number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the predella of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably in the frescoes by Giotto for the in the church of Santa Croce, the large series in grisaille fresco in the Chiostro dello Scalzo, which was Andrea del Sarto's largest work, and the frescoed \"Life\" by Domenico Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel, all in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by Filippo Lippi in Prato Cathedral. These include the typical scenes: the Annunciation to Zechariah; John's birth; his naming by his father; the Visitation; John's departure for the desert; his preaching in the desert; the Baptism of Christ; John before Herod; the dance of Herod's stepdaughter, Salome; his beheading; and the daughter of Herodias Salome carrying his head on a platter.\nHis birth, which unlike the Nativity of Jesus allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late Middle Ages, with depictions by Jan van Eyck in the Turin-Milan Hours and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown; by the fifteenth century, scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular; sometimes, as in an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem, the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod's court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint. The execution was usually by a swordsman, with John kneeling in prayer, Salome often standing by with an empty platter, and Herod and Herodias at table in a cut-through view of a building in the background.\nSalome bearing John's head on a platter equally became a subject for the Power of Women group: a Northern Renaissance fashion for images of glamorous but dangerous women (Delilah, Judith and others). It was often painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder and engraved by the Little Masters. When the head is brought to the table by Salome, Herod may be shown as startled, if not disgusted, but Herodias is usually not. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with Carlo Dolci painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from Pieter Brueghel the Elder and his successors. The isolated motif of the severed head, often on its platter, was a frequent image, often in sculpture, from the late Middle Ages onwards, known as (Latin for \"John on a plate\").\nAs a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the fifteenth century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the Holy Family, the Presentation of Christ, the Marriage of the Virgin and the Holy Kinship. In the Baptism of Christ his presence was obligatory. Leonardo da Vinci's two versions of the \"Virgin of the Rocks\" were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the Madonna and Child which included John. Raphael in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the \"Alba Madonna\", , the \"Garvagh Madonna\", the , and the , which are among his best-known works.\nJohn was also often shown by himself as an adolescent or adult, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross \u2013 another theme influenced by Leonardo, whose equivocal composition, with the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael, Titian and Guido Reni among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many Early Netherlandish paintings which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes, or a red robe over a not very clearly indicated camel skin. Caravaggio painted an especially large number of works depicting John, from at least five largely nude youths attributed to him, to three late works on his death \u2013 the great \"Execution\" in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, one in Madrid, and one in London.\nAmiens Cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the sixteenth century. This includes the execution and the disposal of the saint's remains, which according to legend were burnt in the reign of Julian the Apostate (fourth century) to prevent pilgrimages.\nA remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is \"Christ in the House of His Parents\" by John Everett Millais. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into Joseph's carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join Mary, Joseph, and Mary's mother Anne in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the nineteenth century with Symbolist painters such as Gustave Moreau and Puvis de Chavannes (National Gallery, London). Oscar Wilde's play \"Salome\" was illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley, giving rise to some of his most memorable images.\nIn poetry.\nThe Italian Renaissance poet Lucrezia Tornabuoni chose John the Baptist as one of the biblical figures on which she wrote poetry.\nHe is also referenced in \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" by T. S. Eliot in stanza 12.\nIn film and television.\nJohn the Baptist has appeared in a number of screen adaptations of the life of Jesus. Actors who have played John include James D. Ainsley in \"From the Manger to the Cross\" (1912), Nigel De Brulier in \"Salome\" (1923), Alan Badel in \"Salome\" (1953), Robert Ryan in \"King of Kings\" (1961), Mario Socrate in \"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\" (1964), Charlton Heston in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965), David Haskell in \"Godspell\" (1973), Michael York in \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977), Eli Cohen in \"Jesus\" (1979), Andre Gregory in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), Christopher Routh in \"Mary, Mother of Jesus\" (1999), David O'Hara in \"Jesus\" (1999), Scott Handy in \"The Gospel of John\" (2003), Aidan McArdle in \"Judas\" (2004), Daniel Percival in \"Son of God\" (2014), Abhin Galeya in \"Killing Jesus\" (2015), and David Amito in \"The Chosen\" (2019\u20132022).\n\"Snapaka Yohannan\" (\"John the Baptist\"), a 1963 Indian Malayalam-language film depicts life of St. John the Baptist and his death at the hands of Salome, Herod Antipas and Herodias.\nCommemoration.\nDenominational festivals.\nChristian festivals associated with Saint John the Baptist and Forerunner are celebrated at various days by different denominations and are dedicated to his conception, birth, and death, as well as in correlation to the baptism of Jesus. The Eastern Church has feast days for the finding of his head (first, second, and third finding), as well as for his parents, Elizabeth and Zechariah. In the Russian Orthodox Church there is a feast day of the Transfer of the Right Hand of the Forerunner from Malta to Gatchina.\nAssociation with summer solstice.\nThe Feast of the nativity of Saint John closely coincides with the June solstice, also referred to as Midsummer in the Northern Hemisphere. The Christian holy day is fixed at 24 June; but in most countries festivities are mostly held the night before, on Saint John's Eve. \"In England, 'Saint John's Tide' is combined with a midsummer celebration. Instead of the date of the summer solstice, they chose June 24. This may be because of the Baptist's own words, 'He must increase, but I must decrease' (John 3:30). John was, of course, referring to Jesus. John's day comes at the time when the sun is beginning to decrease...\"\nPatron saint and local festivals.\nMiddle East.\nSaint John the Baptist's beheading is said to have taken place in Machaerus, in central Jordan.\nEurope.\nIn Spain, Saint John was venerated during the feast of the Alhansara in Granada, and also in Gaztelugatxe\nIn the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of Penzance, Cornwall. In Scotland, he is the patron saint of Perth, which used to be known as St. John's Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city's professional football club is called St Johnstone F.C.\nAlso, on the night of 23 June on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of Porto, the second largest city in Portugal. An article from June 2004 in \"The Guardian\" remarked that \"Porto's is one of Europe's liveliest street festivals, yet it is relatively unknown outside the country\".\nAs patron saint of the original Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John, he is the patron of the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, Malta, Florence, Cesena, Turin and Genoa, Italy; as well as of Malta as a whole and of Xewkija and Gozo in Malta, which remember him with a great feast on the Sunday nearest to 24 June.\nAmericas.\nSaint John's Day, celebrated on June 24, is one of the most important dates in Brazil\u2019s traditional June Festivals, known as \"Festas Juninas\". These festivities are deeply rooted in the country\u2019s rural heritage and Catholic traditions, honoring Saint John the Baptist. Across Brazil, especially in the Northeast, cities like Campina Grande and Caruaru host massive celebrations with bonfires, \"quadrilhas\" (square dance), colorful customs, fireworks, and traditional foods, specially made from corn and peanut, such as \"pamonha\", \"canjica\", and \"p\u00e9-de-moleque\". In the North, particularly in the state of Amazonas, the \"Festival de Parintins\" adds a unique dimension to the June celebrations with the \"Boi-Bumb\u00e1\" folklore, perform theatrical retellings of Amazonian myths, mixing indigenous, African, and European cultural elements. More than a religious observance, the \"Festa de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o\" represents a vibrant expression of Brazilian folklore, reinforcing communal bonds and celebrating the diverse cultural identities that shape the nation.\nSaint John the Baptist is the patron saint of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its capital city, San Juan. In 1521, the island was given its formal name, , following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which Christopher Columbus had originally given the island. The names and were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a cartographic error. By 1746, the city's name () had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island () had become that of the city. The official motto of Puerto Rico also references the saint: .\nHe is also a patron saint of French Canada and Newfoundland. The Canadian cities of St. John's, Newfoundland (1497), Saint John, New Brunswick (1604), and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (1665), were all named in his honour.

His 1968 novel \"Stand on Zanzibar\", about an overpopulated world, won the 1969 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel and the BSFA Award the same year. \"The Jagged Orbit\" won the BSFA Award in 1970. His first novel, \"Galactic Storm,\" was written under the pen-name Gill Hunt when he was seventeen. He did not start writing full-time until 1958, some years after his military service.\nLife.\nBrunner was born in 1934 in Preston Crowmarsh, near Wallingford in Oxfordshire, and went to school at St Andrew's Prep School, Pangbourne. He did his upper studies at Cheltenham College. He served as an officer in the Royal Air Force from 1953 to 1955. He married Marjorie Rosamond Sauer on 12 July 1958.\nBrunner had an uneasy relationship with British new wave writers, who often considered him too American in his settings and themes. He attempted to shift to a more mainstream readership in the early 1980s, without success. Before his death, most of his books had fallen out of print. Brunner accused publishers of a conspiracy against him, although he was known to be difficult to deal with. His wife, Marjorie Brunner, had handled his publishing relations before she died.\nBrunner's health began to decline in the 1980s and worsened with the death of his wife in 1986. He remarried, to Li Yi Tan, on 27 September 1991. He died of a heart attack in Glasgow on 25 August 1995, while attending the World Science Fiction Convention there.\nLiterary works.\nAt first writing conventional space opera, Brunner later began to experiment with the novel form. His 1968 novel \"Stand on Zanzibar\" exploits the fragmented organizational style that American writer John Dos Passos created for his \"U.S.A.\" trilogy, but updates it in terms of the theory of media popularised by Canadian academic Marshall McLuhan, a major cultural figure of the period.\n\"The Jagged Orbit\" (1969) is set in a United States dominated by weapons proliferation and interracial violence. Its 100 numbered chapters vary in length from a single syllable to several pages. \"The Sheep Look Up\" (1972) depicts ecological catastrophe in America.\nBrunner is credited with coining the term \"worm\" (in computing) and predicting the emergence of computer viruses in his 1975 novel \"The Shockwave Rider\", in which he used the term to describe software that reproduces itself across a computer network. Brunner's work has also been credited for prefiguring modern developments such as genetic engineering, same-sex marriage, online encyclopedias, the legalization of cannabis, and the development of Viagra.\nThese four novels \"Stand on Zanzibar\" (1968), \"The Jagged Orbit\" (1969), \"The Sheep Look Up\" (1972) and \"The Shockwave Rider\" (1975), have been called the \"Club of Rome Quartet\", named after the Club of Rome, whose 1972 report \"The Limits to Growth\" warned of the dire effects of overpopulation.\nBrunner's pen names include K. H. Brunner (Kilian Houston Brunner), Gill Hunt, John Loxmith, Trevor Staines, Ellis Quick, Henry Crosstrees Jr., and Keith Woodcott.\nIn addition to fiction, Brunner wrote poetry and published many unpaid articles in a variety of venues, particularly fanzines. He also published 13 letters to the \"New Scientist\" and an article about the educational relevance of science fiction in \"Physics Education\". Brunner was an active member of the organisation Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and wrote the words to \"The H-Bomb's Thunder\", which was sung on the Aldermaston Marches. He was a linguist, translator, and Guest of Honour at the first European Science Fiction Convention \"Eurocon-1\" in Trieste in 1972.\nFilm and TV.\nBrunner wrote the screenplay for the science fiction film \"The Terrornauts\" (1967) by Amicus Productions.\nTwo of his short stories, \"Some Lapse of Time\" and \"The Last Lonely Man\", were adapted as TV plays in the BBC science fiction series \"Out of the Unknown\", in series 1 (1965) and series 3 (1969), respectively.\nWorks.\nSpy.\nMax Curfew Series\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "16130", "revid": "36378140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16130", "title": "Jack B. Yeats", "text": "Irish artist (1871\u20131957)\nJack Butler Yeats RHA (29 August 1871 \u2013 28 March 1957) was an Irish artist. Born into a family of impoverished Anglo-Irish landholders, his father was the painter John Butler Yeats, and his brother was the poet W. B. Yeats. Jack B. was born in London but was raised in County Sligo with his maternal grandparents, before returning to London in 1887 to live with his parents. Afterwards he travelled frequently between the two countries; while in Ireland he lived mainly in Greystones, County Wicklow and in Dublin city. \nYeats's first solo exhibition \"Sketches of Life in the West of Ireland\" was held in 1898. He began as an illustrator and watercolourist until moving to oil paint around 1906. His early pictures are lyrical depictions of landscapes and figures predominantly from the west of Ireland. His early oil paintings are heavily influenced by Romanticism, before he adopted Expressionism c. 1910, for which he became famous.\nHe died in Dublin in 1957, aged 85 years. The National Gallery of Ireland holds a significant collection of his paintings, as well as his personal archive.\nEarly life.\nYeats was born in London, England. He was the youngest son of the Irish portraitist John Butler Yeats and the brother of W. B. Yeats (William Butler), who received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Literature. He grew up in Sligo with his maternal grandparents, before returning to his parents' home in London in 1887. Yeats attended the Chiswick School of Art with his sisters Elizabeth and Susan, learning \"Freehand drawing in all its branches, practical Geometry and perspective, pottery and tile painting, design for decorative purposes \u2013 as in Wall-papers, Furniture, Metalwork, Stained Glass\". He briefly attended The High School Dublin as a pupil alongside his brother.\nEarly in his career, Yeats worked as an illustrator for magazines like the \"Boy's Own Paper\" and \"Judy\", drew comic strips, including the Sherlock Holmes parody \"Chubb-Lock Homes\" for \"Comic Cuts\", and wrote articles for \"Punch\" under the pseudonym \"W. Bird\". In 1894 he married Mary Cottenham White, a fellow student, also a native of England and two years his senior. At the 1911 Census they lived in Greystones in County Wicklow.\nCareer.\nFrom around 1920, he developed into an intensely Expressionist artist, moving from illustration to Symbolism. He was sympathetic to the Irish Republican cause, but not politically active. However, he believed that 'a painter must be part of the land and of the life he paints', and his own artistic development, as a Modernist and Expressionist, helped articulate a modern Dublin of the 20th century, partly by depicting specifically Irish subjects, but also by doing so in the light of universal themes such as the loneliness of the individual, and the universality of the plight of man. Samuel Beckett wrote that \"Yeats is with the great of our time... because he brings light, as only the great dare to bring light, to the issueless predicament of existence.\" The Marxist art critic and author John Berger also paid tribute to Yeats from a very different perspective, praising the artist as a \"great painter\" with a \"sense of the future, an awareness of the possibility of a world other than the one we know\".\nHis favourite subjects included the Irish landscape, horses, circus and travelling players. His early paintings and drawings are distinguished by an energetic simplicity of line and colour, and his later paintings by an extremely vigorous and experimental treatment of often thickly applied paint. He frequently abandoned the brush altogether, applying paint in a variety of different ways, and was deeply interested in the expressive power of colour. Despite his position as the most important Irish artist of the 20th century (and the first to sell for over \u00a31m), he took no pupils and allowed no one to watch him work, so he remains a unique figure. The artist closest to him in style is his friend, the Austrian painter Oskar Kokoschka.\nIn 1943, Yeats accepted Victor Waddington as his sole dealer and business manager. Waddington played a crucial role in building his career and reputation.\nBesides painting, Yeats had a significant interest in theatre and in literature. He was a close friend of the playwright and novelist Samuel Beckett. He designed sets for the Abbey Theatre and three of his own plays were produced there. His literary works include \"The Careless Flower\", \"The Amaranthers\" (much admired by Beckett), \"Ah Well, A Romance in Perpetuity\", \"And To You Also\", and \"The Charmed Life\". Yeats's paintings usually bear poetic and evocative titles. He was elected a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1916. \nWhen Yeats's wife, Cottie, died in 1947, his art took on a more metaphysical tone and became more nostalgic and optimistic. He continued working through the final years of his life and died in Dublin in 1957. He is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.\nYeats holds the distinction of being Ireland's first medallist at the Olympic Games in the wake of the creation of the Irish Free State. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Yeats' painting \"The Liffey Swim\" won a silver medal in the arts and culture segment of the Games. In the competition records the painting is simply entitled \"Swimming\".\nWorks.\nIn November 2010, one of Yeats's works, \"A Horseman Enters a Town at Night\", painted in 1948 and previously owned by novelist Graham Greene, sold for nearly \u00a3350,000 at a Christie's auction in London. A smaller work, \"Man in a Room Thinking\", painted in 1947, sold for \u00a366,000 at the same auction. His painting \"Sleep Sound\" (1955) was bought by David Bowie in 1993 for \u00a345,500 and sold at auction in 2016 for \u00a3233,000.\nIn 1999 the painting, \"The Wild Ones\", sold at Sotheby's in London for over \u00a31.2m. Whyte's Auctioneers hold the world record sale price for a Yeats painting, \"Reverie\" (1931), which sold for \u20ac1,400,000 in November 2019.\nPublic collections.\nYeats paintings are held, among others, in the following public collections:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
