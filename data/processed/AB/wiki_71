Many \"kami\" are considered the ancient ancestors of entire clans (some ancestors became \"kami\" upon their death if they were able to embody the values and virtues of \"kami\" in life). Traditionally, great leaders like the Emperor could be or became \"kami\".\nIn Shinto, \"kami\" are not separate from nature, but are of nature, possessing positive and negative, and good and evil characteristics. They are manifestations of , the interconnecting energy of the universe, and are considered exemplary of what humanity should strive towards. \"Kami\" are believed to be \"hidden\" from this world, and inhabit a complementary existence that mirrors our own: . To be in harmony with the awe-inspiring aspects of nature is to be conscious of .\nMeaning.\n\"Kami\" is the Japanese word for a deity, divinity, or spirit. It has been used to describe mind, God, Supreme Being, one of the Shinto deities, an effigy, a principle, and anything that is worshipped.\nAlthough \"deity\" is the common interpretation of \"kami\", some Shinto scholars argue that such a translation can cause a misunderstanding of the term.\nSome etymological suggestions are:\nIn terms of meaning, in his , Motoori Norinaga gave a definition of \"kami\" as: \"any being whatsoever which possesses some eminent quality out of the ordinary, and is awe-inspiring, is called kami.\"\nBecause Japanese does not normally distinguish grammatical number in nouns (most do not have singular and plural forms), it is sometimes unclear whether \"kami\" refers to a single or multiple entities. When a singular concept is needed, is used as a suffix. The reduplicated term generally used to refer to multiple \"kami\" is \"kamigami\".\nHistory.\nWhile Shinto has no founder, no overarching doctrine, and no religious texts, the (Records of Ancient Matters), written in 712 CE, and the (Chronicles of Japan), written in 720 CE, contain the earliest record of Japanese creation myths. The also includes descriptions of various \"kami\".\nIn the ancient traditions there were five defining characteristics of \"kami\":\n\"Kami\" are an ever-changing concept, but their presence in Japanese life has remained constant. The \"kami's\" earliest roles were as earth-based spirits, assisting the early hunter-gatherer groups in their daily lives. They were worshipped as gods of the earth (mountains) and sea. As the cultivation of rice became increasingly important and predominant in Japan, the \"kami's\" identity shifted to more sustaining roles that were directly involved in the growth of crops; roles such as rain, earth, and rice. This relationship between early Japanese people and the \"kami\" was manifested in rituals and ceremonies meant to entreat the \"kami\" to grow and protect the harvest. These rituals also became a symbol of power and strength for the early Emperors.\nThere is a strong tradition of myth-histories in the Shinto faith; one such myth details the appearance of the first emperor, grandson of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu. In this myth, when Amaterasu sent her grandson to earth to rule, she gave him five rice grains, which had been grown in the fields of heaven (Takamagahara). This rice made it possible for him to transform the \"wilderness\".\nSocial and political strife have played a key role in the development of new sorts of \"kami\", specifically the \"gory\u014d-shin\" (the sacred spirit \"kami\"). \"Gory\u014d\" are the vengeful spirits of the dead whose lives were cut short, but they were calmed by the devotion of Shinto followers and are now believed to punish those who do not honor the \"kami\".\nThe pantheon of \"kami\", like the \"kami\" themselves, is forever changing in definition and scope. As the needs of the people have shifted, so too have the domains and roles of the various \"kami\". Some examples of this are related to health, such as the \"kami\" of smallpox whose role was expanded to include all contagious diseases, or the \"kami\" of boils and growths who has also come to preside over cancers and cancer treatments.\nIn ancient animistic Japanese belief, \"kami\" were understood as simply the divine forces of nature. Worshippers in ancient Japan revered \"kami\" of nature which exhibited a particular beauty and power such as ghosts, the ocean, the sun, waterfalls, mountains, boulders, animals, trees, grasses, rice paddies, thunder, echoes, foxes and fox spirits, and Asian dragons. They strongly believed the spirits or resident \"kami\" deserved respect.\nIn 927 CE, the was promulgated in fifty volumes. This, the first formal codification of Shinto rites and \"norito\" (liturgies and prayers) to survive, became the basis for all subsequent Shinto liturgical practice and efforts. It listed all of the 2,861 Shinto shrines existing at the time, and the 3,131 official-recognized and enshrined \"kami\". The number of \"kami\" has grown and far exceeded this figure through the following generations as there are over 2,446,000 individual \"kami\" enshrined in Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine alone.\nShinto belief.\n\"Kami\" are the central objects of worship in Shinto. The best English translation of \"kami\" is 'spirits', but this is an over-simplification of a complex concept\u2014\"kami\" can be elements of the landscape or forces of nature. \"Kami\" are believed to have influence over the forces of nature and over the affairs of humans. The ancient animistic spirituality of Japan was the beginning of modern Shinto, which became a formal spiritual institution later, in an effort to preserve the traditional beliefs from the encroachment of imported religious ideas. As a result, the nature of what can be called \"kami\" is very general and encompasses many different concepts and phenomena.\nSome of the objects or phenomena designated as \"kami\" are qualities of growth, fertility, and production; natural phenomena like wind and thunder; natural objects like the sun, mountains, rivers, trees, and rocks; some animals; and ancestral spirits. Included within the designation of ancestral spirits are spirits of the ancestors of the Imperial House of Japan, but also ancestors of noble families, as well as the spirits of the ancestors of all people, which, when they died, were believed to be the guardians of their descendants.\nThere are other spirits designated as \"kami\" as well. For example, the guardian spirits of the land, occupations, and skills; spirits of Japanese heroes; those of outstanding deeds or virtues; those who have contributed to civilization, culture, and human welfare; those who have died for the state or the community; and the pitiable deceased. Not only spirits superior to humans can be considered \"kami\": spirits that are considered pitiable or weak have also been considered \"kami\" in Shinto.\nThe concept of \"kami\" has been changed and refined since ancient times, although anything considered to be \"kami\" by ancient people will still be considered \"kami\" in modern Shinto. Even within modern Shinto, no clearly defined criteria exist for what should or should not be worshipped as \"kami\". The difference between modern Shinto and the ancient animistic religions is mainly a refinement of the \"concept, rather than a difference in definitions.\nAlthough the ancient designations are still adhered to, in modern Shinto, many priests also consider \"kami\" to be anthropomorphic spirits with nobility and authority. One such example is the mythological figure Amaterasu-\"\u014dmikami\", the sun goddess of the Shinto pantheon. Although \"kami\" can be considered deities, they are not necessarily considered omnipotent or omniscient; like the ancient Greek gods, \"kami\" have flawed personalities and are incapable of ignoble acts. In the myths of Amaterasu, for example, she could see the events of the human world, but had to use divination rituals to see the future.\nThere are considered to be three main variations of \"kami\": , , and . \"\" literally means eight million, but idiomatically it expresses \"uncountably many\" and \"all-around\"\u2014like many East Asian cultures, the Japanese often use the number 8, representing the cardinal and ordinal directions, to symbolize ubiquity. These classifications of \"kami\" are not considered strictly divided, due to the fluid and shifting nature of \"kami\", but are instead held as guidelines for grouping them.\nThe ancestors of one's family can also be worshipped as \"kami\". In this sense, these \"kami\" are worshipped not because of their godly powers, but because of a distinctive quality or virtue. An example of this is Tenjin, who was Sugawara no Michizane (845\u2013903 CE) in life. These \"kami\" are celebrated regionally, and miniature shrines (\"hokora\") have been built in their honor.\nWithin Shinto, it is believed that the nature of life is sacred because the \"kami\" began human life. Yet humans cannot perceive the sacredness the \"kami\" created without assistance. Therefore, , or purification, is necessary to see the divine nature. This purification can only be granted by the \"kami\". To please the \"kami\" and earn \"magokoro\", Shinto followers are taught to uphold the four affirmations of Shinto.\nThe first affirmation is to hold fast to tradition and one's family line. Family is seen as the main mechanism by which traditions are preserved. For instance, a given tradition may be observed and passed on to future generations at marriage or birth. The second affirmation is to have a love of nature. Nature objects are worshipped as sacred because the \"kami\" inhabit them. Therefore, to be in contact with nature means to be in contact with the gods. The third affirmation is to maintain physical cleanliness. Followers of Shinto take baths, wash their hands, and rinse out their mouths often. The last affirmation is to practice \"matsuri\", which is the worship and honor given to the \"kami\" and ancestral spirits.\nShinto followers also believe that the \"kami\" are the ones who can either grant blessings or curses to a person. Shinto believers desire to appease the evil \"kami\" to \"stay on their good side\" and please the good \"kami\". In addition to practicing the four affirmations daily, Shinto believers also wear \"omamori\" to aid them in remaining pure and protected. Mamori are charms that keep the evil \"kami\" from striking a human with sickness or causing disaster to befall them.\nThe \"kami\" are both worshipped and respected within the religion of Shinto. The goal of life to Shinto believers is to obtain \"magokoro\", a pure sincere heart, which can only be granted by the \"kami\". As a result, Shinto followers are taught that humankind should venerate both the living and the nonliving, because both possess a divine superior spirit within: the \"kami\".\nAmatsukami and Kunitsukami.\nAmatsukami and Kunitsukami are categories of \"kami\" in Japanese mythology.\n\"Amatsukami\" is a generic term for the gods in Takamagahara, or those who descended from Tenson k\u014drin, while \"Kunitsukami\" is a generic term for the gods who appeared on the earth (Ashihara no Nakatsukuni).\nIn Japanese mythology, the acceptance of the transfer of the land (Ashihara no Nakatsukuni) by the Kunitsukami to the Amatsu deities led by Ninigi-no-Mikoto is described as \"kuni-yuzuri\". It is thought that the deity worshipped by the people of the region pacified by the Yamato Kingship (i.e., the Emishi, Hayato, etc.) became the Kunitsukami; the deities worshipped by the imperial family and powerful clans of the Yamato Kingship became the Amatsukami. Many of the original traditions of the Kunitsukami were altered when they were incorporated into the \"Nihon Shoki\" (The Chronicles of Japan); many did not survive. The Chronicles of Japan give some references to earlier traditions (e.g., \"Ichi Sho Saying\" and \"Aru Hon Yun\" in most volumes of the \"Nihon Shoki\"), but the original recorded documents have been lost.\n\"Tsu\" is a case particle in Old Japanese, meaning \"god of heaven\" or \"god of the country\" in modern Japanese. Sometimes written \"Amatsugami\" or \"Kunitsugami.\nAmatsukami are also called Tenjin, and Kunitsukami are called . Some people believe that the names \" and \" are derived from the Chinese classics. A different theory that the concept is completely different and different from the Japanese one has been presented.\nAnother similar concept is .\n (Tenchi-Shinmei) is a Japanese four-character idiom that refers to the gods of heaven and earth. It is used in expressions such as \"I swear by the gods of heaven and earth\" and conveys a sense of reverence and commitment. The origins of the term can be traced back to ancient Chinese classical texts, where the expression \" (Tenchi) and \" (Shinmei) were often used together to refer to the gods of heaven and earth, or to the gods and the universe as a whole. However, there are also instances where the expression was used to refer specifically to the gods of heaven and earth. In Japan, the term has been in use for centuries and is often associated with the image of the numerous gods and deities that have been worshipped in Japanese folklore and mythology.\nSusanoo-no-Mikoto, who was cast out of Takamagahara, and his descendants, such as \u014ckuninushi, are considered to be Kunitsukami.\nOgasawara Shozo proposed a system justifying Japanese Imperialism wherein Japanese people in the colonies were seen as Amatsukami and natives were seen as Kunitsukami. However, he was later censored, as his position was considered too supportive of the rights of colonized peoples.\nCeremonies and festivals.\nOne of the first recorded rituals is , the ceremony in which the emperor of Japan offers newly harvested rice to the \"kami\" to secure their blessing for a bountiful harvest. A yearly festival, Niiname-sai, is also performed when a new emperor comes to power, in which case it is called . In the ceremony, the emperor offers crops from the new harvest to the \"kami\", including rice, fish, fruits, soup, and stew. The emperor first feasts with the deities, then the guests. The feast could go on for some time; for example, Emperor Sh\u014dwa's feast spanned two days.\nVisitors to a Shinto shrine follow a purification ritual before presenting themselves to the \"kami\". This ritual begins with hand washing and swallowing and later spitting a small amount of water in front of the shrine to purify the body, heart, and mind. Once this is complete, they focus on gaining the \"kami's\" attention. The traditional method of doing this is to bow twice, clap twice, and bow again, alerting the \"kami\" to their presence and desire to commune with them. During the last bow, the supplicant offers words of gratitude and praise to the \"kami\"; if they are offering a prayer for aid, they will also state their name and address. After the prayer and/or worship, they repeat the two bows, two claps, and a final bow in conclusion.\nShinto practitioners also worship at home. This is done at a \"kamidana\" (household shrine), on which an \"ofuda\" with the name of their protector or ancestral \"kami\" is positioned. Their protector \"kami\" is determined by their or their ancestors' relationship to the \"kami\".\nAscetic practices, shrine rituals and ceremonies, and Japanese festivals are the most public ways Shinto devotees celebrate and offer adoration for the \"kami\". \"Kami\" are celebrated during their distinct festivals that usually take place at the shrines dedicated to their worship. Many festivals involve believers, who are oftentimes intoxicated, parading, sometimes running, toward the shrine while carrying mikoshi (portable shrines) as the community gathers for the festival ceremony. Yamamoto Guji, the high priest at the Tsubaki Grand Shrine, explains that this practice honors the \"kami\" because \"it is in the festival, the matsuri, the greatest celebration of life can be seen in the world of Shinto and it is the people of the community who attend festivals as groups, as a whole village who are seeking to unlock the human potential as children of kami\". During the New Year Festival, families purify and clean their houses in preparation for the upcoming year. Offerings are also made to the ancestors so that they will bless the family in the future year.\nShinto ceremonies are so long and complex that in some shrines, it can take ten years for the priests to learn them. The priesthood was traditionally hereditary. Some shrines have drawn their priests from the same families for over a hundred generations. It is not uncommon for the clergy to be female priestesses. The priests (\"kannushi\") may be assisted by \"miko\", young unmarried women acting as shrine maidens. Neither priests nor priestesses live as ascetics; in fact, it is common for them to be married, and they are not traditionally expected to meditate. Rather, they are considered specialists in the art of maintaining the connection between the \"kami\" and the people.\nIn addition to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are the birth of a child and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born, they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the \"kami\" can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the \"kami\"'s protection and to pray for continued health.\nShinto believers practice many other rites of passage, and there are also many other festivals. The main reason for these ceremonies is so that Shinto followers can appease the \"kami\" in order to reach \"magokoro\". \"Magokoro\" can only be received through the \"kami\". Ceremonies and festivals are long and complex because they need to be perfect to satisfy the \"kami\". If the \"kami\" are not pleased with these ceremonies, they will not grant a Shinto believer \"magokoro\".\nIn popular culture.\nKami appear as a creature group in the trading card game , specifically within the Kamigawa extensions.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word \"kayak\" originates from the Inuktitut word \"qajaq\" (). In British English, the kayak is also considered to be a kind of canoe.\nThere are countless different types of kayaks due to the craft being easily adaptable for different environments and purposes. The traditional kayak has an enclosed deck and one or more cockpits, each seating one occupant or kayaker, differentiating the craft from an open-deck canoe. The cockpit is sometimes covered by a spray deck that prevents unwanted entry of water from waves or splashes. Even within these confines, kayaks vary vastly in respect to materials, length, and width, with some kayaks such as the sprint kayak designed to be fast and light, and others such as the whitewater kayak designed to be sturdy and maneuverable.\nSome modern paddlecrafts, which still claim the title \"kayak\", remove integral parts of the traditional design; for instance, by eliminating the cockpit and seating the paddler on top of a canoe-like open deck, commonly known as a sit-on-top kayak. Other designs include inflated air chambers surrounding the craft; replacing the single hull with twin hulls; and replacing handheld paddles with other human-powered propulsion methods such as pedal-driven propeller and \"flippers\". Some kayaks are also fitted with external sources of propulsion, such as a battery-powered electric motor to drive a propeller or flippers, a sail (which essentially modifies it into a sailboat), or even a completely independent gasoline outboard engine (which converts it into a \"de facto\" motorboat).\nThe kayak was first used by the indigenous Aleut, Inuit, Yupik and possibly Ainu hunters in subarctic regions of the world.\nHistory.\nOriginal Aleutian kayaks (Inuktitut: \"qajaq\" (\u1583\u152d\u1585 ), Yup'ik: \"qayaq\" (from \"qai-\" \"surface; top\"), Aleut: \"Iqyax\") were originally developed by the Inuit, Yup'ik, and Aleut. They used the boats to hunt on inland lakes, rivers and coastal waters of the Arctic Ocean, North Atlantic, Bering Sea and North Pacific oceans. These first kayaks were constructed from stitched seal or other animal skins stretched over a wood or whalebone-skeleton frame. (Western Alaskan Natives used wood whereas the eastern Inuit used whalebone due to the treeless landscape.) Kayaks are believed to be at least 4,000 years old. The oldest kayaks remaining are exhibited in the North America department of the State Museum of Ethnology in Munich, with the oldest dating from 1577.\nSubarctic people made many types of boats for different purposes. The Aleut baidarka was made in double or triple cockpit designs, for hunting and transporting passengers or goods. An umiak is a large open-sea canoe, ranging from , made with seal skins and wood, originally paddled with single-bladed paddles and typically had more than one paddler.\nSubarctic builders designed and built their boats based on their own experience and that of the generations before them passed on through oral tradition. The word \"kayak\" means \"man's boat\" or \"hunter's boat\", and subarctic kayaks were a personal craft, each built by the man who used it and closely fitting his size for maximum maneuverability. For this reason, kayaks were often designed ergonomically using one's own body proportions as units of measure. The paddler wore a tuilik, a garment that was stretched over the rim of the kayak coaming and sealed with drawstrings at the coaming, wrists, and hood edges. This enabled the \"eskimo roll\" and rescue to become the preferred methods of recovery after capsizing, especially as few Inuit could swim; their waters are too cold for a swimmer to survive for long.\nInstead of a \"tuilik\", most traditional kayakers today use a spray deck made of waterproof synthetic material stretchy enough to fit tightly around the cockpit rim and body of the kayaker, and which can be released rapidly from the cockpit to permit easy exit (in particular in a wet exit after a capsizing).\nInuit kayak builders had specific measurements for their boats. The length was typically three times the span of his outstretched arms. The width at the cockpit was the width of the builder's hips plus two fists (sometimes less). The typical depth was his fist plus the outstretched thumb (hitch hiker). Thus typical dimensions were about long by wide by deep.\nTraditional kayaks encompass three types: \"Baidarkas\", from the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, the oldest design, whose rounded shape and numerous chines give them an almost blimp-like appearance; \"West Greenland\" kayaks, with fewer chines and a more angular shape, with gunwales rising to a point at the bow and stern; and \"East Greenland\" kayaks that appear similar to the West Greenland style, but often fit more snugly to the paddler and possess a steeper angle between gunwale and stem, which lends maneuverability.\nMost of the Aleut people in the Aleutian Islands eastward to Greenland Inuit relied on the kayak for hunting a variety of prey\u2014primarily seals, though whales and caribou were important in some areas. Skin-on-frame kayaks are still being used for hunting by Inuit in Greenland, because the smooth and flexible skin glides silently through the waves.\n20th century &amp; contemporary kayaks.\nContemporary traditional-style kayaks trace their origins primarily to the native boats of Alaska, northern Canada, and Southwest Greenland. The use of fabric kayaks on wooden frames called a foldboat or folding kayak (German Faltboot or Hadernkahn) became widely popular in Europe beginning in 1907 when they were mass-produced by Johannes Klepper and others. This type of kayak was introduced to England and Europe by John MacGregor in 1860, but Klepper was the first person to mass-produce these boats made of collapsible wooden frames covered by waterproof rubberized canvas. By 1929, Klepper and Company were making 90 foldboats a day. Joined by other European manufacturers, by the mid-1930s there were an estimated half-million foldboat kayaks in use throughout Europe. First Nation masters of the roll taught this technique to Europeans during this time period.\nThese boats were tough and intrepid individuals were soon doing amazing things in them. In June 1928, a 29-year-old German kayaker named Franz Romer rigged his foldboat with a sail and departed from Las Palmas in the Canary Islands carrying of tinned food and of fresh water, reaching Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands after and 58 days, becoming the first recorded person to traverse the Atlantic Ocean on a sea kayak. Romer continued west to Puerto Rico after resting for six weeks, planning to eventually arrive at New York City, but unfortunately perished at sea after leaving Port of San Juan on September 11 (missing the hurricane warning by merely an hour) and running into the devastating Okeechobee hurricane some two days later at the southwestern edge of the Bermuda Triangle (likely near the northeastern shores of the Dominican Republic) during his journey towards Florida. Four years later in May 1932, another German named Oskar Speck left Ulm and paddled his foldboat kayak southeast down the Danube, eventually reaching the Torres Strait Islands on the Australian north coast seven years later in September 1939, after having traveled roughly along the shores of the Eastern Mediterranean, Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, Java Sea and Coral Sea.\nThese watercraft were brought to the United States and used competitively in 1940 at the first National Whitewater Championship held in America near Middledam, Maine, on the Rapid River (Maine). One \"winner,\" Royal Little, crossed the finish line clinging to his overturned foldboat. Upstream, the river was \"strewn with many badly buffeted and some wrecked boats.\" Two women were in the competition, Amy Lang and Marjory Hurd. With her partner Ken Hutchinson, Hurd won the double canoe race. Lang won the doubles foldboat event with her partner, Alexander \"Zee\" Grant.\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, Alexander \"Zee\" Grant was most likely America's best foldboat pilot. Grant kayaked the Gates of Lodore on the Green River (Colorado River tributary) in Dinosaur National Monument in 1939 and the Middle Fork Salmon River in 1940. In 1941, Grant paddled a foldboat through Grand Canyon National Park. He outfitted his foldboat, named Escalante, with a sponson on each side of his boat and filled the boat with beach balls. As with nearly all American foldboat enthusiasts of the day, he did not know how to roll his boat.\nFiberglass mixed with resin composites, invented in the 1930s and 1940s, were soon used to make kayaks and this type of watercraft saw increased use during the 1950s, including in the US. Kayak Slalom World Champion Walter Kirschbaum built a fiberglass kayak and paddled it through Grand Canyon in June 1960. He knew how to roll and only swam once, in Hance Rapid (see List of Colorado River rapids and features). Like Grant's foldboat, Kirschbaum's fiberglass kayak had no seat and no thigh braces. In June 1987, Ed Gillet, using a stock off the shelf \"traditional design\" 20 foot long by 31 inch wide fiberglass tandem kayak paddled over 2,000 miles non-stop from Monterey, California to Hawaii, landing his vessel there on August 27, 1987, after 64 days of paddling. Gillet had navigated his kayak by using a traditional sextant and compass, along with approximately 600 pounds of food and water, including a device to convert sea water to fresh water. Within six days of reaching Hawaii, both he and his yellow kayak were featured on \"The Tonight Show\", hosted by Johnny Carson.\nInflatable rubberized fabric boats were first introduced in Europe and rotomolded plastic kayaks first appeared in 1973. Most kayaks today are made from roto-molded polyethylene resins. The development of plastic and rubberized inflatable kayaks arguably initiated the development of freestyle kayaking as we see it today since these boats could be made smaller, stronger, and more resilient than fiberglass boats.\nDesign principles.\nTypically, kayak design is largely a matter of trade-offs: directional stability (\"tracking\") vs maneuverability; stability vs speed; and primary vs secondary stability. Multihull kayaks face a different set of trade-offs. The paddler's body shape and size is an integral part of the structure, and will also affect the trade-offs made.\nAttempting to lift and carry a kayak by oneself or improperly is a significant cause of kayaking injuries. Good lifting technique, sharing loads, and not using needlessly large and heavy kayaks prevent injuries.\nDisplacement.\nIf the displacement of a kayak is not enough to support the passenger(s) and gear, it will sink. If the displacement is excessive, the kayak will float too high, catch the wind and waves uncomfortably, and handle poorly; it will probably also be bigger and heavier than it needs to be. Being excessively big will create more drag, and the kayak will move more slowly and take more effort. Rolling is easier in lower-displacement kayaks. On the other hand, a higher deck will keep the paddler(s) drier and make self-rescue and coming through surf easier. Many beginning paddlers who use a sit-in kayak feel more secure in a kayak with a weight capacity substantially more than their own weight. Maximum volume in a sit-in kayak is helped by a wide hull with high sides. But paddling ease is helped by lower sides where the paddler sits and a narrower width.\nWhile the kayak's buoyancy must be more than the loaded kayak, the optimal amount of excess buoyancy varies somewhat with kayak type, purpose, and personal taste (squirt boats, for instance, have very little positive buoyancy). Displacements vary with paddler weight. Most manufacturers include kayaks for paddlers weighing , with some kayaks for paddlers down to . Kayaks made for paddlers under are almost all very beamy and intended for beginners.\nLength.\nAs a general rule, a longer kayak is faster: it has a higher hull speed. It can also be narrower for a given displacement, reducing the drag, and it will generally track (follow a straight line) better than a shorter kayak. On the other hand, it is less maneuverable. Very long kayaks are less robust, and may be harder to store and transport. Some recreational kayak makers try to maximize hull volume (weight capacity) for a given length as shorter kayaks are easier to transport and store.\nKayaks that are built to cover longer distances such as touring and sea kayaks are longer, generally . With touring kayaks the keel is generally more defined (helping the kayaker track in a straight line). Whitewater kayaks, which generally depend upon river current for their forward motion, are short, to maximize maneuverability. These kayaks rarely exceed in length, and \"play boats\" may be only long. Recreational kayak designers try to provide more stability at the price of reduced speed, and compromise between tracking and maneuverability, ranging from .\nRocker.\nLength alone does not fully predict a kayak's maneuverability: a second design element is \"rocker\", i.e. its lengthwise curvature. A heavily \"rockered\" boat curves more, shortening its effective waterline. For example, an kayak with no rocker is in the water from end to end. In contrast, the bow and stern of a rockered boat are out of the water, shortening its lengthwise waterline to only . Rocker is generally most evident at the ends, and in moderation improves handling. Similarly, although a rockered whitewater boat may only be about a meter shorter than a typical recreational kayak, its waterline is far shorter and its maneuverability far greater. When surfing, a heavily rockered boat is less likely to lock into the wave as the bow and stern are still above water. A boat with less rocker cuts into the wave and makes it harder to turn while surfing.\nBeam profile.\nThe overall width of a kayak's cross-section is its \"beam\". A wide hull is more stable and packs more displacement into a shorter length. A narrow hull has less drag and is generally easier to paddle; in waves, it will ride more easily and stay dryer.\nA narrower kayak makes a somewhat shorter paddle appropriate and a shorter paddle puts less strain on the shoulder joints. Some paddlers are comfortable with a sit-in kayak so narrow that their legs extend fairly straight out. Others want sufficient width to permit crossing their legs inside the kayak.\nTypes of stability.\n\"Primary\" (sometimes called \"initial\") stability describes how much a boat tips, or rocks back and forth when displaced from level by paddler weight shifts. \"Secondary\" stability describes how stable a kayak feels when put on edge or when waves are passing under the hull perpendicular to the length of the boat. For kayak rolling, \"tertiary\" stability, or the stability of an upside-down kayak, is also important (lower tertiary stability makes rolling up easier).\nPrimary stability is often a big concern to a beginner, while secondary stability matters both to beginners and experienced travelers. By example, a wide, flat-bottomed kayak will have high primary stability and feel very stable on flat water. However, when a steep wave breaks on such a boat, it can be easily overturned because the flat bottom is no longer level. By contrast, a kayak with a narrower, more rounded hull with more hull flare can be edged or leaned into waves and (in the hands of a skilled kayaker) provides a safer, more comfortable response on stormy seas. Kayaks with only moderate primary, but excellent secondary stability are, in general, considered more seaworthy, especially in challenging conditions.\nThe shape of the cross section affects stability, maneuverability, and drag. Hull shapes are categorized by roundness, flatness, and by the presence and angle of chines. This cross-section may vary along the length of the boat.\nA chine typically increases secondary stability by effectively widening the beam of the boat when it heels (tips). A V-shaped hull tends to travel straight (track) well but makes turning harder. V-shaped hulls also have the greatest secondary stability. Conversely, flat-bottomed hulls are easy to turn, but harder to direct in a constant direction. A round-bottomed boat has minimal area in contact with the water, and thus minimizes drag; however, it may be so unstable that it will not remain upright when floating empty, and needs continual effort to keep it upright. In a skin-on-frame kayak, chine placement may be constrained by the need to avoid the bones of the pelvis.\nSea kayaks, designed for open water and rough conditions, are generally narrower at and have more secondary stability than recreational kayaks, which are wider , and have a flatter hull shape and more primary stability.\nStability from body shape and skill level.\nThe body of the paddler must also be taken into account. A paddler with a low center of gravity (COG) will find all boats more stable; for a paddler with a high center of gravity, all boats will feel tippier. On average, women have a lower COG than men. Women generally may fit a kayak about 10% narrower than the kayak that would fit a similarly sized man. Commercial kayaks made for women are rare. Unisex kayaks are built for men. Younger children have proportionately smaller and lighter bodies, but near-adult-size heads, and thus a higher center of gravity. A paddler with narrow shoulders will also want a narrower kayak.\nNewcomers will often want a craft with high primary stability (see above). The southern method is a wider kayak. The West Greenland method is a removable pair of outriggers, lashed across the stern deck. Such an outrigger pair is often homemade of a small plank and found floats such as empty bottles or plastic ducks. Outriggers are also made commercially, especially for fishing kayaks and sailing. If the floats are set so that they are both in the water, they give primary stability, but produce more drag. If they are set so that they are both out of the water when the kayak is balanced, they give secondary stability.\nHull surface profile.\nSome kayak hulls are categorized according to the shape from bow to stern\nCommon shapes include:\nSeating position and contact points.\nTraditional-style and some modern types of kayaks (e.g. sit-on-top) require that paddler be seated with their legs stretched in front of them, in a right angle, in a position called the \"L\" kayaking position. Other kayaks offer a different sitting position, in which the paddler's legs are not stretched out in front of them, and the thigh brace bears more on the inside than the top of the thighs (see diagram).\nA kayaker must be able to move the hull of their kayak by moving their lower body, and brace themselves against the hull (mostly with the feet) on each stroke. Most kayaks therefore have footrests and a backrest. Some kayaks fit snugly on the hips; others rely more on thigh braces. Mass-produced kayaks generally have adjustable bracing points. Many paddlers also customize their kayaks by putting in shims of closed-cell foam (usually EVA), or more elaborate structures, to make it fit more tightly.\nPaddling puts substantial force through the legs, alternately with each stroke. The knees should therefore not be hyperextended. Separately, if the kneecap is in contact with the boat, or the knee joint is in torsion, this will cause pain and may injure the knee. Insufficient foot space will cause painful cramping and inefficient paddling. The paddler should generally be in a comfortable position.\nMaterials and construction.\nToday almost all kayaks are commercial products intended for sale rather than for the builder's personal use.\nFiberglass hulls are stiffer than polyethylene hulls, but they are more prone to damage from impact, including cracking. Most modern kayaks have steep V sections at the bow and stern, and a shallow V amidships. Fiberglass kayaks may be \"laid-up\" in a mold by hand, in which case they are usually more expensive than polyethylene kayaks, which are rotationally molded in a machine. The deck and hull are often made separately and then joined at a horizontal seam.\nPlastic kayaks are rotationally molded ('rotomolded') from a various grades and types of polyethylene resins ranging from soft to hard. Such kayaks are seamless and particularly resistant to impact, but heavy.\nInflatable kayaks are increasingly popular due to their ease of storage and transport, as well as the ability to be deflated for extended portage. Although slower than hardshell kayaks, many higher-end models often constructed of hypalon, as opposed to cheaper PVC designs, begin to approach the performance of traditional sea kayaks. Being inflatable they are virtually unsinkable and often more stable than hardshell designs. New drop-stitch technology means slab, rather than tube shapes are used in the designs with higher inflation pressures (up to ), leading to considerably faster, though often less stable kayaks which rival hardshell boats in performance.\nSolid wooden hulls don't necessarily require significant skill and handiwork, depending on how they are made. Three main types are popular, especially for the home builder: plywood stitch &amp; glue (S&amp;G), strip-built, and hybrids which have a stitch &amp; glue hull and a strip-built deck. Kayaks made from wood sheathed in fiberglass have proven successful, especially as the price of epoxy resin has decreased in recent years.\nStitch &amp; glue designs typically use modern, marine-grade plywood with a thickness of about . After cutting out the required pieces of hull and deck (kits often have these pre-cut), a series of small holes are drilled along the edges. Copper wire is then used to \"stitch\" the pieces together through the holes. After the pieces are temporarily stitched together, they are glued with epoxy and the seams reinforced with fiberglass. When the epoxy dries, the copper stitches are removed. Sometimes the entire boat is then covered in fiberglass for additional strength and waterproofing though this adds greatly to the weight and is unnecessary. Construction is fairly straightforward, but because plywood does not bend to form compound curves, design choices are limited. This is a good choice for the first-time kayak builder as the labor and skills required (especially for kit versions) is considerably less than for strip-built boats which can take three times as long to build.\nStrip-built designs are similar in shape to rigid fiberglass kayaks but are generally both lighter and tougher. Like their fiberglass counterparts the shape and size of the boat determines performance and optimal uses. The hull and deck are built with thin strips of lightweight wood, often thuja (Western Red cedar), pine or redwood. The strips are edge-glued together around a form, stapled or clamped in place, and allowed to dry. Structural strength comes from a layer of fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin, layered inside and outside the hull. Strip\u2013built kayaks are sold commercially by a few companies, priced US$4,000 and up. An experienced woodworker can build one for about US$400 in 200 hours, though the exact cost and time depend on the builder's skill, the materials and the size and design. As a second kayak project, or for the serious builder with some woodworking expertise, a strip\u2013built boat can be an impressive piece of work. Kits with pre-cut and milled wood strips are commercially available.\nSkin-on-frame (SOF) boats are often more traditional in design, materials, and construction. They were traditionally made with driftwood frames, jointed, pegged, and lashed together, and covered with stretched seal skin, as those were the most readily available materials in the Arctic regions (other skins and baleen framing members were also used at need). A \"poor man's kayak\" might be frameless and stuffed with a snow \"frame\". Today, seal skin is usually replaced with canvas or nylon cloth covered with paint, polyurethane, or a hypalon rubber coating, on a wooden or aluminum frame. Modern skin-on-frame kayaks often possess greater impact resistance than their fiberglass counterparts, but are less durable against abrasion or sharp objects. They are often the lightest kayaks. Like the older skin-on-frame kayaks, they are often home-built to fit a specific paddler. Engineer Xyla Foxlin built a kayak out of transparent fibreglass as well as LEDs to create a floating vessel that lights up at night, which she calls the \"Rainbowt\".\nA special type of skin-on-frame kayak is the folding kayak. It has a collapsible frame, of wood, aluminum or plastic, or a combination thereof, and a skin of water-resistant and durable fabric. Many types have air sponsons built into the hull, making the kayak float even if flooded.\nModern design.\nMost modern kayaks differ greatly from the original traditional subarctic kayaks in design, manufacturing and usage. They are often designed with computer-aided design (CAD) software, often in combination with CAD customized for naval design.\nModern kayaks serve diverse purposes, ranging from slow and easy touring on placid water, to racing and complex maneuvering in fast-moving whitewater, to fishing and long-distance ocean excursions. Modern forms, materials and construction techniques make it possible to effectively serve these needs while continuing to leverage the insights of the original Arctic inventors.\nTypes.\nModern kayaks have evolved into specialized types that may be broadly categorized according to their application as \"sea or touring kayaks\", \"whitewater\" (or \"river\") \"kayaks\", \"surf kayaks\", \"racing kayaks\", \"fishing kayaks,\" and \"recreational\" kayaks. The broader kayak categories today are 'sit-in' (SI), which is inspired mainly by traditional kayak forms, 'sit-on-top' (SOT), which evolved from paddle boards that were outfitted with footrests and a backrest, 'hybrid', which are essentially canoes featuring a narrower beam and a reduced free board enabling the paddler to propel them from the middle of the boat, using a double blade paddle (i.e. 'kayak paddle'), and twin hull kayaks offering each of the paddler's legs a narrow hull of its own.\nIn recent decades, kayaks design have proliferated to a point where the only broadly accepted denominator for them is their being designed mainly for paddling using a kayak paddle featuring two blades i.e. 'kayak paddle'. However, even this inclusive definition is being challenged by other means of human powered propulsion, such as foot activated pedal drives combined with rotating or sideways moving propellers, electric motors, and even outboard motors.\nRecreational.\nRecreational kayaks are designed for the casual paddler interested in fishing, photography, or a peaceful paddle on a lake, flatwater stream or protected salt water away from strong ocean waves. These boats presently make up the largest segment of kayak sales. Compared to other kayaks, recreational kayaks have a larger cockpit for easier entry and exit and a wider beam () for more stability. They are generally less than in length and have limited cargo capacity. Less expensive materials like polyethylene and fewer options keep these boats relatively inexpensive. Most canoe/kayak clubs offer introductory instruction in recreational boats. They do not perform as well in the sea. The recreational kayak is usually a type of touring kayak.\nSea.\n\"Sea kayaks\" are typically designed for travel by one, two or even three paddlers on open water and in many cases trade maneuverability for seaworthiness, stability, and cargo capacity. Sea-kayak sub-types include \"skin-on-frame\" kayaks with traditionally constructed frames, open-deck \"sit-on-top\" kayaks, and recreational kayaks.\nThe sea kayak, though descended directly from traditional types, is implemented in a variety of materials. Sea kayaks typically have a longer waterline, and provisions for below-deck storage of cargo. Sea kayaks may also have rudders or skegs (fixed rudder) and upturned bow or stern profiles for wave shedding. Modern sea kayaks usually have two or more internal bulkheads. Some models can accommodate two or sometimes three paddlers.\nSit-on-top.\nSealed-hull (\"unsinkable\") craft were developed for leisure use, as derivatives of surfboards (e.g. paddle or wave skis), or for surf conditions. Variants include planing surf craft, touring kayaks, and sea marathon kayaks. Increasingly, manufacturers build leisure 'sit-on-top' variants of extreme sports craft, typically using polyethylene to ensure strength and affordability, often with a skeg for directional stability.\nSit-on-top kayaks come in 1\u20134 paddler configurations. Sit-on-top kayaks are particularly popular for fishing and SCUBA diving, since participants need to easily enter and exit the water, change seating positions, and access hatches and storage wells. Ordinarily the seat of a sit-on-top is slightly above water level, so the center of gravity for the paddler is higher than in a traditional kayak. To compensate for the higher center of gravity, sit-on-tops are often wider and slower than a traditional kayak of the same length.\nWater that enters the cockpit of a sit-on-top kayak drains out through scupper holes\u2014tubes that run from the cockpit to the bottom of the hull. The \"cockpit\" is thus self-bailing. The hull may be sealed, or perforated by hatches and deck fixtures. Contrary to popular belief, the sit-on-top kayak \"hull\" is not self-bailing, since water penetrating it does not drain out automatically, as it does in bigger boats equipped with self-bailing systems. Furthermore, the sit-on-top hull cannot be molded in a way that would assure water tightness, and water may get in through various holes in its hull, usually around hatches and deck accessories. If the sit-on-top kayak is loaded to a point where such perforations are covered with water, or if the water paddled is rough enough that such perforations often go under water, the sit-on-top hull may fill with water without the paddler noticing it in time. If a sealed hull develops a split or hole, it will also fill and sink.\nSurf.\nSpecialty surf boats typically have flat bottoms, and hard edges, similar to surf boards. The design of a surf kayak promotes the use of an ocean surf wave (moving wave) as opposed to a river or feature wave (moving water). They are typically made from rotomolded plastic, or fiberglass.\nSurf kayaking comes in two main varieties, High Performance (HP) and International Class (IC). High Performance boats tend to have a lot of nose rocker, little to no tail rocker, flat hulls, sharp rails and up to four fins set up as either a three fin thruster or a quad fin. This enables them to move at high speed and maneuver dynamically. International Class boats have to be at least long and until a recent rule change had to have a convex hull; now flat and slightly concave hulls are also allowed, although fins are not. Surfing on international boats tends to be smoother and more flowing, and they are thought of as kayaking's \"long boarding\". Surf boats come in a variety of materials ranging from tough but heavy plastics to super light, super stiff but fragile foam\u2013cored carbon fiber. Surf kayaking has become popular in traditional surfing locations, as well as new locations such as the Great Lakes.\nWaveskis.\nA variation on the closed-cockpit surf kayak is called a waveski. Although the waveski offers dynamics similar to a sit\u2013on\u2013top, its paddling technique and surfing performance and construction can be similar to surfboard designs.\nWhitewater.\nWhitewater kayaks are rotomolded in a semi-rigid, high impact plastic, usually polyethylene. Careful construction ensures that the boat remains structurally sound when subjected to fast-moving water. The plastic hull allows these kayaks to bounce off rocks without leaking, although they scratch and eventually puncture with enough use. Whitewater kayaks range from long. There are two main types of whitewater kayak, playboats and river-running boats. Creekboats (for small rivers) and squirt boats are more specialized.\nPlayboat.\nOne type, the \"playboat\", is short, with a scooped bow and blunt stern. These trade speed and stability for high maneuverability. Their primary use is performing tricks in individual water features or short stretches of river. In playboating or \"freestyle\" competition (also known as \"rodeo\" boating), kayakers exploit the complex currents of rapids to execute a series of tricks, which are scored for skill and style.\nCreekboats and river-running kayaks.\nThe other primary type is the creek boat, which gets its name from its purpose: running narrow, low-volume waterways. Creekboats are longer and have far more volume than playboats, which makes them more stable, faster and higher-floating. Many paddlers use creekboats in \"short boat\" downriver races, and they are often seen on large rivers where their extra stability and speed may be necessary to get through rapids.\nBetween the creekboat and playboat extremes is a category called \"river\u2013running\" kayaks. These medium\u2013sized boats are designed for rivers of moderate to high volume, and some, known as \"river running playboats\", are capable of basic playboating moves. They are typically owned by paddlers who do not have enough whitewater involvement to warrant the purchase of more\u2013specialized boats.\nSquirt boats.\nSquirt boating involves paddling both on the surface of the river and underwater. Squirt boats must be custom-fitted to the paddler to ensure comfort while maintaining the low interior volume necessary to allow the paddler to submerge completely in the river.\nRacing.\nWhitewater.\nWhite water racers combine a fast, unstable lower hull portion with a flared upper hull portion to combine flat water racing speed with extra stability in open water: they are not fitted with rudders and have similar maneuverability to flat water racers. They usually require substantial skill to achieve stability, due to extremely narrow hulls. Whitewater racing kayaks, like all racing kayaks, are made to regulation lengths, usually of fiber reinforced resin (usually epoxy or polyester reinforced with Kevlar, glass fiber, carbon fiber, or some combination). This form of construction is stiffer and has a harder skin than non-reinforced plastic construction such as rotomolded polyethylene: stiffer means faster, and harder means fewer scratches and therefore also faster.\nFlatwater sprint.\nSprint kayak is a sport held on calm water. Crews or individuals race over 200\u00a0m, 500\u00a0m, 1000\u00a0m or 5000\u00a0m with the winning boat being the first to cross the finish line. The paddler is seated, facing forward, and uses a double-bladed paddle pulling the blade through the water on alternate sides to propel the boat forward. In competition the number of paddlers within a boat is indicated by a figure besides the type of boat; K1 signifies an individual kayak race, K2 pairs, and K4 four-person crews. Kayak sprint has been in every summer olympics since it debuted at the 1936 summer olympics. Racing is governed by the International Canoe Federation.\nSlalom.\nSlalom kayaks are flat\u2013hulled, and\u2014since the early 1970s\u2014feature low profile decks. They are highly maneuverable, and stable but not fast in a straight line.\nSurfskis.\nA specialized variant of racing craft called a \"surf ski\" has an open cockpit and can be up to long but only wide, requiring expert balance and paddling skill. Surf skis were originally created for surf and are still used in races in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. They have become popular in the United States for ocean races, lake races and even downriver races.\nMarathon.\nMarathon races vary in distances from ten kilometres to over 1000 kilometres for multi-day stage races.\nSpecialty and hybrids.\nThe term \"kayak\" is increasingly applied to craft that look little like traditional kayaks.\nInflatable.\nInflatables, also known as the \"duckies\" or \"IKs\", can usually be transported by hand using a carry bag. They are generally made of hypalon (a kind of neoprene), nitrilon (nitrile-rubberized fabric), PVC, or polyurethane-coated cloth. They can be inflated with foot, hand or electric pumps. Multiple compartments in all but the least expensive increase safety. They generally use low pressure air, almost always below .\nWhile many inflatables are non-rigid, essentially pointed rafts, best suited for use on rivers and calm water, the higher-end inflatables are designed to be hardy, seaworthy vessels. Recently some manufacturers have added an internal frame (folding-style) to a multi-section inflatable sit-on-top kayak to produce a seaworthy boat. Fully drop-stitch inflatable kayaks are also available, which are inflated to 8\u201310 PSI. They are much stiffer, which enhances their paddling characteristics to vastly outperform traditional inflatable kayaks.\nThe appeal of inflatable kayaks is their portability, their durability (they don't dent), ruggedness in white water (they bounce off rocks rather than break) and their easy storage. In addition, inflatable kayaks generally are stable, have a small turning radius and are easy to master, although some models take more effort to paddle and are slower than traditional kayaks.\nBecause inflatable kayaks aren't as sturdy as traditional, hard-shelled kayaks, a lot of people tend to steer away from them. However, there have been considerable advancements in inflatable kayak technology over recent years.\nFolding.\nFolding kayaks are direct descendants of the skin-on-frame boats used by the Inuit and Greenlandic peoples. Modern folding kayaks are constructed from a wooden or aluminum frame over which is placed a synthetic skin made of polyester, cotton canvas, polyurethane, or Hypalon. They are more expensive than inflatable kayaks, but have the advantage of greater stiffness and consequently better seaworthiness.\nWalter H\u00f6hn (English Hoehn) had built, developed and then tested his design for a folding kayak in the white-water rivers of Switzerland from 1924 to 1927. In 1928, on emigrating to Australia, he brought 2 of them with him, lodged a patent for the design and proceeded to manufacture them.\nIn 1942 the Australian Director of Military operations approached him to develop them for Military use. Orders were placed and eventually a total of 1024, notably the MKII &amp; MKIII models, were produced by him and another enterprise, based on his 1942 patent (No. 117779)\nPedal.\nPedal kayaks represent a pioneering type of watercraft engineered for hands-free functionality, utilizing a propulsion system operated by the kayaker's feet. This mechanism usually consists of pedals that are rotated in a circular motion, akin to bicycling, generating forward momentum through a propeller or fins situated beneath the kayak. Steering is managed by a rudder or steering mechanism, typically operated by a hand lever or supplementary foot pedals for directional control.\nTwin hull and outrigger.\nTraditional multi-hull vessels such as catamarans and outrigger canoes benefit from increased lateral stability without sacrificing speed, and these advantages have been successfully applied in twin hull kayaks. \"Outrigger kayaks\" attach one or two smaller hulls to the main hull to enhance stability, especially for fishing, touring, kayak sailing and motorized kayaking.\nTwin hull kayaks feature two long and narrow hulls, and since all their buoyancy is distributed as far as possible from their center line, they are more stable than mono hull kayaks outfitted with outriggers.\nFishing.\nWhile native people of the Arctic regions hunted rather than fished from kayaks, in recent years kayak sport fishing has become popular in both fresh and salt water, especially in warmer regions. Traditional fishing kayaks are characterized by wide beams of up to that increase their lateral stability. Some are equipped with outriggers that increase their stability, and others feature twin hulls enabling stand up paddling and fishing. Compared with motorboats, fishing kayaks are inexpensive and have few maintenance costs. Many kayak anglers like to customize their kayaks for fishing, a process known as 'rigging'.\nMilitary.\nKayaks were adapted for military use in the Second World War. Used mainly by British Commandos and special forces, principally the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (COPPs), the Special Boat Service and the Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment. The latter made perhaps the best known use of them in the Operation Frankton raid on Bordeaux harbor. Both the Special Air Service (SAS) and the Special Boat Service (SBS) used kayaks for reconnaissance in the 1982 Falklands War. US Navy SEALs reportedly used them at the start of Unified Task Force operations in Somalia in 1992. The SBS currently use Klepper two-person folding kayaks that can be launched from surfaced submarines or carried to the surface by divers from submerged ones. They can be parachuted from transport aircraft at sea or dropped from the back of Chinook helicopters. US Special Forces have used Kleppers but now primarily use Long Haul folding kayaks, which are made in the US.\nThe Australian Military MKII and MKIII folding kayaks were extensively used during WWII in the Pacific Theater for some 33 raids and missions on and around the South-East Asian islands. Documentation for this will be found in the National Archives of Australia official records, reference No. NAA K1214-123/1/06. They were deployed from disguised watercraft, submarines, Catalina aircraft, P.T. boats, motor launches and by parachute.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It grew out of the small Prussian Navy (from 1867 the North German Federal Navy), which was mainly for coast defence. Kaiser Wilhelm II greatly expanded the navy. The key leader was Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, who greatly expanded the size and quality of the navy, while adopting the sea power theories of American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. The result was a naval arms race with Britain, as the German navy grew to become one of the greatest maritime forces in the world, second only to the Royal Navy.\nThe German surface navy proved ineffective during the First World War; its only major engagement, the Battle of Jutland, was a draw, but it kept the surface fleet largely in port for the rest of the war. The submarine fleet was greatly expanded and threatened the British supply system during the U-boat campaign. As part of the Armistice, the Imperial Navy's main ships were ordered to be turned over to the Allies but they were instead scuttled by their own crews. All ships of the Imperial Navy bore the prefix \"SMS\", for (His Majesty's Ship).\nAchievements.\nThe Imperial Navy achieved some important operational feats. At the Battle of Coronel, it inflicted the first major defeat on the Royal Navy in over one hundred years, although the German squadron of ships was subsequently defeated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands, only one ship escaping destruction. The Navy also emerged from the fleet action of the Battle of Jutland having destroyed more ships than it lost, although the strategic value of both of these encounters was minimal.\nThe Imperial Navy was the first to operate submarines successfully on a large scale in wartime, with 375 submarines commissioned by the end of the First World War, and it also operated zeppelins. Although it was never able to match the number of ships of the Royal Navy, it had technological advantages, such as better shells and propellant for much of the Great War, meaning that it never lost a ship to a catastrophic magazine explosion from an above-water attack, although the elderly pre-dreadnought sank rapidly at Jutland after a magazine explosion was caused by an underwater attack.\n1871 to 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm I.\nThe unification of Germany under Prussian leadership was the defining point for the creation of the Imperial Navy in 1871. The newly created emperor, Wilhelm I, as King of Prussia, had previously been head of state of the strongest state forming part of the new empire. The navy remained the same as that operated by the empire's predecessor organisation in the unification of Germany, the North German Confederation, which itself in 1867 had inherited the navy of the Kingdom of Prussia. Article 53 of the new Empire's constitution recognised the existence of the Navy as an independent organisation, but until 1888 it was commanded by army officers and initially adopted the same regulations as the Prussian army. Supreme command was vested in the emperor, but its first appointed chief was (General of the Infantry) Albrecht von Stosch. Kiel on the Baltic Sea and Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea served as the Navy's principal naval bases. The former Navy Ministry became the Imperial Admiralty on 1 February 1872, while Stosch became formally an admiral in 1875. Initially the main task of the new Imperial Navy was coastal protection, with France and Russia seen as Germany's most likely future enemies. The Imperial Navy's tasks were then to prevent any invasion force from landing and to protect coastal towns from possible bombardment.\nIn March 1872 a German Imperial Naval Academy was created at Kiel for training officers, followed in May by the creation of a 'Machine Engineer Corps', and in February 1873 a 'Medical Corps'. In July 1879 a separate 'Torpedo Engineer Corps' was created dealing with torpedoes and mines. In May 1872 a ten-year building programme was instituted to modernise the fleet. This called for eight armoured frigates, six armoured corvettes, twenty light corvettes, seven monitors, two floating batteries, six avisos, eighteen gunboats and twenty-eight torpedo boats, at an estimated cost of 220\u00a0million gold marks. The building plan had to be approved by the \"Reichstag\", which controlled the allocation of funds, although one-quarter of the money came from French war reparations.\nIn 1883 Stosch was replaced by another general, Count Leo von Caprivi. At this point the navy had seven armoured frigates and four armoured corvettes, 400 officers and 5,000 ratings. The objectives of coastal defence remained largely unchanged, but there was a new emphasis on development of the torpedo, which offered the possibility of relatively small ships successfully attacking much larger ones. In October 1887 the first torpedo division was created at Wilhelmshaven and the second torpedo division based at Kiel. In 1887 Caprivi requested the construction of ten armoured frigates.\nGreater importance was placed at this time on development of the army, which was expected to be more important in any war. However, the Kiel Canal was commenced in June 1887, which connected the North Sea with the Baltic through the Jutland peninsula, allowing German ships to travel between the two seas avoiding waters controlled by other countries. This shortened the journey for commercial ships, but specifically united the two areas principally of concern to the German navy, at a cost of 150\u00a0million marks. Later, the protection of German maritime trade routes became important. This soon involved the setting up of some overseas supply stations, so called \"Ausw\u00e4rtige Stationen\" (foreign stations) and in the 1880s the Imperial Navy played a part in helping to secure the establishment of German colonies and protectorates in Africa, Asia and Oceania.\n1888 to 1897, under Kaiser Wilhelm II.\nIn June 1888 Wilhelm II became Emperor after the death of his father Frederick III, who ruled for only 99 days. He started his reign with the intention of doing for the navy what his grandfather Wilhelm I had done for the army. The creation of a maritime empire to rival the British and French empires became an ambition to mark Germany as a truly global great power. Wilhelm became Grand Admiral of the German Navy, but also was awarded honorific titles from all over Europe, becoming admiral in the British, Russian, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Austro-Hungarian and Greek navies. On one occasion he wore the uniform of a British admiral to receive the visiting British ambassador. At this time the Imperial Navy had 534 officers and 15,480 men.\nThe concept of expanding naval power, inevitably at the cost of not expanding other forces, was opposed by the three successive heads of the German armed forces, Waldersee, Schlieffen and Moltke between 1888 and 1914. It would also have been more widely opposed, had the Kaiser's intentions been widely known. Instead, he proceeded with a plan to expand the navy slowly, justifying enlargement step by step. In July 1888 Wilhelm II appointed Vice-Admiral Alexander von Monts as head of the admiralty. Monts oversaw the design of the , four of which were constructed by 1894 at a cost of 16\u00a0million marks each and displacement of 10,000 tons.\nIn 1889 Wilhelm II reorganised top level control of the navy by creating a Navy Cabinet (\"Marine-Kabinett\") equivalent to the German Imperial Military Cabinet which had previously functioned in the same capacity for both the army and navy. The Head of the navy cabinet was responsible for promotions, appointments, administration and issuing orders to naval forces. Captain Gustav von Senden-Bibran was appointed as its first head and remained so until 1906, when he was replaced by the long-serving Admiral Georg Alexander von M\u00fcller. The existing Imperial admiralty was abolished and its responsibilities divided between two organisations. A new position of Chief of the Imperial Naval High Command was created, being responsible for ship deployments, strategy and tactics, an equivalent to the supreme commander of the Army. Vice admiral Max von der Goltz was appointed in 1889 and remained in post until 1895. Construction and maintenance of ships and obtaining supplies was the responsibility of the State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office (\"Reichsmarineamt\"), responsible to the chancellor and advising the Reichstag on naval matters. The first appointee was Rear Admiral Karl Eduard Heusner, followed shortly by Rear Admiral Friedrich von Hollmann from 1890 to 1897. Each of these three heads of department reported separately to Wilhelm II.\nIn 1895 funding was agreed for five battleships of the , completed by 1902. The ships were innovative for their time, introducing a complex system of watertight compartments and storing coal along the sides of the ship to help absorb explosions. However, the ships went against the trend for increasingly larger main guns, having smaller diameter guns than the \"Brandenburg\" design, but with a quick-loading design and more powerful secondary armaments. Costs rose to 21\u00a0million marks each, as had size to 11,500 tons.\nIn 1892 Germany had launched the protected cruiser , the first navy ship to have triple propellers. She was succeeded by five protected cruisers, the last 'protected', as distinct from 'armoured' cruiser class constructed by Germany. The ships, completed between 1898 and 1900, had deck armour but not side armour and were intended for overseas duties. Shortages of funding meant it was not possible to create several designs of cruisers specialised for long range work, or more heavily armoured for fleet work. Work commenced on an armoured cruiser design, started in 1896 and commissioned in 1900.\n1897 to 1906, Tirpitz and the Navy bills.\nOn 18 June 1897 Rear-Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was appointed State Secretary of the Navy, where he remained for nineteen years. Tirpitz advocated the cause of an expanded navy necessary for Germany to defend her territories abroad. He had great success in persuading parliament to pass successive Navy bills authorising expansions of the fleet. German foreign policy as espoused by Otto von Bismarck had been to deflect the interest of great powers abroad while Germany consolidated her integration and military strength. Now Germany was to compete with the rest. Tirpitz started with a publicity campaign aimed at popularising the navy. He created popular magazines about the navy, arranged for Alfred Thayer Mahan's \"The Influence of Sea Power upon History\", which argued the importance of naval forces, to be translated into German and serialised in newspapers, arranged rallies in support and invited politicians and industrialists to naval reviews. Various pressure groups were formed to lobby politicians and spread publicity. One such organisation, the navy league or \"Flottenverein\", was organized by principals in the steel industry (Alfred Krupp), ship yards and banks, gaining more than one million members. Political parties were offered concessions, such as taxes on imported grain, in exchange for their support for naval bills.\nOn 10 April 1898 the first Navy Bill was passed by the \"Reichstag\". It authorised the maintenance of a fleet of 19 battleships, 8 armoured cruisers, 12 large cruisers and 30 light cruisers to be constructed by 1 April 1904. Existing ships were counted in the total, but the bill provided for ships to be replaced every 25 years on an indefinite basis. Five million marks annually was allocated to run the navy, with a total budget of 408\u00a0million marks for shipbuilding. This would bring the German fleet to a strength where it could contemplate challenging France or Russia, but would remain clearly inferior to the world's largest fleet, the Royal Navy.\nFollowing the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Boer War, a second navy bill was passed on 14 June 1900. This approximately doubled the allocated number of ships to 38 battleships, 20 armoured cruisers, 38 light cruisers. Significantly, the bill set no overall cost limit for the building program. Expenditure for the navy was too great to be met from taxation: the Reichstag had limited powers to extend taxation without entering into negotiations with the constituent German states, and this was considered politically unviable. Instead, the bill was financed by massive loans. Tirpitz, in 1899 was already exploring the possibilities for extending the battleship total to 45, a target which rose to 48 by 1909.\nTirpitz's ultimate goal was a fleet capable of rivaling the Royal Navy. As British public opinion was turned against Germany, Admiral Sir John Fisher twice \u2013 in 1904 and 1908 \u2013 proposed using Britain's current naval superiority to 'Copenhagen' the German fleet, that is, to launch pre-emptive strikes against the Kiel and Wilhelmshaven naval bases as the Royal Navy had done against the Danish navy in 1801 and 1807.\" Tirpitz argued that if the fleet could achieve two-thirds the number of capital ships possessed by Britain then it stood a chance of winning in a conflict. Britain had to maintain a fleet throughout the world and consider other naval powers, whereas the German fleet could be concentrated in German waters. Attempts were made to play down the perceived threat to Britain, but once the German fleet reached the position of equalling the other second-rank navies, it became impossible to avoid mention of the one great fleet it was intended to challenge. Tirpitz hoped that other second-rank powers might ally with Germany, attracted by its navy. The policy of commencing what amounted to a naval arms race did not properly consider how Britain might respond. British policy, stated in the Naval Defence Act of 1889, was to maintain a navy superior to Britain's two largest rivals combined. The British Admiralty estimated that the German navy would be the world's second largest by 1906.\nMajor reforms of the Royal Navy were undertaken, particularly by Fisher as First Sea Lord from 1904 to 1909. 154 older ships, including 17 battleships, were scrapped to make way for newer vessels. Reforms in training and gunnery were introduced to make good perceived deficiencies, which in part Tirpitz had counted upon to provide his ships with a margin of superiority. More capital ships were stationed in British home waters. A treaty with Japan in 1902 meant that ships could be withdrawn from East Asia, while the \"Entente Cordiale\" with France in 1904 meant that Britain could concentrate on guarding Channel waters, including the French coast, while France would protect British interests in the Mediterranean. By 1906 it was considered that Britain's only likely naval enemy was Germany.\nFive battleships of the were constructed from 1899 to 1904 at a cost of 22\u00a0million marks per ship. Five ships of the were built between 1901 and 1906 for the slightly greater 24\u00a0million marks each. Technological improvements meant that rapid fire guns could be made larger, so the \"Braunschweig\" class had a main armament of guns. Due to torpedo improvements in range and accuracy, emphasis was placed on a secondary armament of smaller guns to defend against them. The five s constructed between 1903 and 1908 had similar armament as the \"Braunschweig\" class, but heavier armour, for the slightly greater sum of 24.5\u00a0million marks each.\nDevelopment of armoured cruisers also continued. \"F\u00fcrst Bismarck\"'s design was improved upon in the subsequent , completed in 1902. Two ships of the were commissioned in 1904, followed by two similar armoured cruisers commissioned in 1905 and 1906, at costs around 17\u00a0million marks each. and followed, between 1904 and 1908, and cost an estimated for 20.3\u00a0million marks. Main armament was eight guns, but with six and eighteen guns for smaller targets. Eight light cruisers were constructed between 1902 and 1907, developed from the earlier . The ships had ten guns and were named after German towns. was the first German cruiser to be fitted with turbine engines, which were also trialled in torpedo boat \"S-125\". Turbines were faster, quieter, lighter, more reliable and more fuel efficient at high speeds. The first British experimental design (the destroyer ) had been constructed in 1901 and as a result Tirpitz had set up a special commission to develop turbines. No reliable German design was available by 1903, so British Parsons turbines were purchased.\nCommand reorganisation.\nIn 1899, the Imperial Naval High Command was replaced by the German Imperial Admiralty Staff (\"Admiralstab\") responsible for planning, the training of officers, and naval intelligence. In time of war it was to assume overall command, but in peace acted only advisory. Direct control of various elements of the fleet was subordinated to officers commanding those elements, accountable to the Kaiser. The reorganisations suited the Kaiser who wanted to maintain direct control of his ships. A disadvantage was that it split apart the integrated military command structure which before had balanced the importance of the navy within overall defence considerations. It suited Alfred von Tirpitz, because it removed the influence of the admiralty staff from naval planning, but left him the possibility, in wartime, to reorganise command around himself. Wilhelm II, however, never agreed to relinquish direct control of his fleet.\n1906 to 1908, the Dreadnought and innovation: First \"Novelle\".\nOn 3 December 1906 the Royal Navy received a new battleship, . She became famous as the first of a new concept in battleship design, using all big gun, single size of calibre armament. She used turbine propulsion for greater speed and less space required by the machinery, and guns arranged so that three times as many could be brought to bear when firing ahead, and twice as many when firing broadside. The design was not a uniquely British concept as similar ships were being built around the world, nor was it uniquely intended as a counter to German naval expansion, but the effect was to immediately require Germany to reconsider its naval building program. The battleship design was complemented by the introduction of a variant with lighter armour and greater speed, which became the battlecruiser.\nThe revolution in design, together with improvements in personnel and training severely brought into question the German assumption that a fleet of two-thirds the size of the Royal Navy would at least stand a chance in an engagement. By 1906 Germany was already spending 60% of revenue upon the army. Either an enormous sum now had to be found to develop the navy further, or naval expansion had to be abandoned. The decision to continue was taken by Tirpitz in September 1905 and agreed by Chancellor Bernhard von B\u00fclow and the Kaiser, while \"Dreadnought\" was still at the planning stage. The larger ships would naturally be more expensive, but also would require enlargement of harbours, locks and the Kiel canal, all of which would be enormously expensive. Estimated cost for new dreadnoughts was placed at 36.5\u00a0million marks for 19,000 tons displacement ships (larger than \"Dreadnought\" at 17,900 tons), and 27.5\u00a0million marks for battle-cruisers. 60\u00a0million mark was allocated for dredging the canal. The Reichstag was persuaded to agree to the program and passed a \"Novelle\" (a supplementary law) amending the navy bills and allocating 940\u00a0million marks for a dreadnought program and the necessary infrastructure. Two dreadnoughts and one battlecruiser were to be built each year.\nConstruction of four s began in 1907 under the greatest possible secrecy. The chief German naval designer was Hans B\u00fcrkner. A principle was introduced that the thickness of side armour on a ship would equal the calibre of the large guns, while ships were increasingly divided internally into watertight compartments to make them more resistant to flooding when damaged. The design was hampered by the necessity to use reciprocating engines instead of the smaller turbines, since no sufficiently powerful design was available and acceptable to the German navy. Turrets could not be placed above the centre of the ship and instead had to be placed at the side, meaning two of the six turrets would always be on the wrong side of the ship when firing broadsides. Main armament was twelve 28\u00a0cm guns. The ships were all completed by 1910, over budget, averaging 37.4\u00a0million marks each. In 1910 they were transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven, where two new large docks had been completed and more were under construction.\nThe first German battlecruiser\u2014\u2014was commenced March 1908. Four Parsons turbines were used, improving speed to 27 knots and reducing weight. Four twin turrets mounted 28\u00a0cm guns; although the two centre turrets were still placed one either side of the ship, they were offset so could now fire either side. The design was considered a success, but the cost at 35.5\u00a0million marks was significantly above the 1906 allocation. Light cruiser development continued with the light cruisers, which were to become famous for their actions in the start of World War I in the Pacific. The ships were 3,300 tons, and armed with ten 10.5\u00a0cm rapid fire guns and a speed around 24 knots. cost 7.5\u00a0million marks, and 6\u00a0million marks. Four were produced between 1907 and 1911 at 4,400 tons and around 8\u00a0million marks each. These had turbines, twelve 10.5\u00a0cm guns as main armament, but were also equipped to carry and lay 100 mines. From 1907 onward, all torpedo boats were constructed using turbine engines.\nDespite their ultimate importance, the German navy declined to take up the cause of another experiment, the submarine, until 1904. The first submarine, was delivered in December 1906, built by Krupp's Germania yard in Kiel. The first submarine had 238 ton displacement on the surface and 283 tons submerged. The kerosene engine developed 10 knots on the surface with a range of . Submerged, the ship could manage 50 nautical miles at 5 knots using battery electric propulsion. The ships followed a design by Maxime Laubeuf first used successfully in 1897, having a double hull and flotation tanks around the outside of the main crew compartments. The submarine had just one torpedo tube at the front and a total of three torpedoes. The early engines were noisy and smoky, so that a considerable boost to the usefulness of the submarine came with the introduction of quieter and cleaner diesel engines in 1910, which were much more difficult for an enemy to detect.\n1908 to 1912, Second \"Novelle\".\nGerman expenditure on ships was steadily rising. In 1907, 290\u00a0million marks was spent on the fleet, rising to 347\u00a0million marks or 24 percent of the national budget in 1908, with a predicted budget deficit of 500\u00a0million marks. By the outbreak of World War I, one billion marks had been added to Germany's national debt because of naval expenditures. While each German ship was more expensive than the last, the British managed to reduce the cost of the succeeding generations of (3 ships) and (3) battleships. Successive British battlecruisers were more expensive, but less so than their German equivalents. Overall, German ships were some 30% more expensive than the British. This all contributed to growing opposition in the Reichstag to any further expansion, particularly when it was clear that Britain intended to match and exceed any German expansion program. In the fleet itself, complaints were beginning to be made in 1908 about underfunding and shortages of crews for the new ships. The State Secretary of the Treasury, Hermann von Stengel, resigned because he could see no way to resolve the budget deficit.\nThe elections of 1907 had returned a \"Reichstag\" more favourable to military exploits, following the refusal of the previous parliament to grant funds to suppress uprisings in colonies in German South-West Africa. Despite the difficulties, Tirpitz persuaded the Reichstag to pass a further \"Novelle\" in March 1908. This reduced the service life for ships from 25 years to 20 years, allowing for faster modernisation, and increased the building rate to four capital ships per year. Tirpitz's target was a fleet of 16 battleships and 5 battlecruisers by 1914, and 38 battleships and 20 battlecruisers by 1920. There were also to be 38 light cruisers, and 144 torpedo boats. The bill contained a restriction, that building would fall to two ships per year in 1912, but Tirpitz was confident of changing this at a later date. He anticipated that German industry, now heavily involved in shipbuilding, would back a campaign to maintain a higher construction rate.\nFour battleships of the were laid down in 1909\u201310, with displacements of 22,800 tons, twelve guns in 6 turrets, reciprocating engines generating a maximum speed of 21 knots, and a price tag of 46\u00a0million marks. Again, the turret configuration was dictated by the need to use the centre of the ship for machinery, despite the disadvantage of the turret layout. The ships were now equipped with torpedoes.\nThe s built between 1909 and 1913 introduced a change in design as turbine engines were finally approved. The ships had ten 30.5\u00a0cm guns, losing two of the centre side turrets but gaining an additional turret astern on the centre line. As with the \"Von der Tann\" design, which was drawn up at a similar time, all guns could be fired either side in broadsides, meaning more guns could come to bear than with the \"Helgoland\" design, despite having fewer in total. Five ships were constructed rather than the usual four, one to act as a fleet flagship. One ship, the , was equipped with only two turbines rather than three, with the intention of having an additional diesel engine for cruising, but the Howaldt engine could not be developed in time. \"Luitpold\" had a top speed of 20 knots as a result, compared to 22 knots for the other ships. The ships were larger than the preceding class at 24,700 tons, but cheaper at 45\u00a0million marks. They formed part of the third squadron of the High Seas Fleet as it was constituted for World War I.\nBetween 1908 and 1912 two s were constructed, adding an extra turret on the centre line astern, raised above the aft turret, but still using 28\u00a0cm guns. became part of the High Seas Fleet, but became part of the Mediterranean squadron and spent World War I as part of the Ottoman navy. The ships cost 42.6 and 41.6\u00a0million marks, with maximum speed of 28 knots. was constructed as a slightly enlarged version of the \"Moltke\" design, reaching a maximum speed of 29 knots. All cruisers were equipped with turbine engines from 1908 onwards. Between 1910 and 1912 four light cruisers were constructed of 4,600 tons, at around 7.4\u00a0million marks each. The ships were fitted with oil burners to improve the effectiveness of their main coal fueling. These were followed by the similar but slightly enlarged and marginally faster and light cruisers.\nIn 1907 a naval artillery school was established at Sonderburg (north of Kiel). This aimed to address the difficulties with the new generation of guns, which with potentially greater range required aiming devices capable of directing them at targets at those extreme ranges. By 1914, experiments were being conducted with guns in increasing sizes up to . Capital ships were fitted with spotting tops high up on masts with range finding equipment, while ship design was altered to place turrets on the centre line of the ship for improved accuracy.\nThe four s were commenced between October 1911 and May 1912 and entered service in 1914 at a cost of 45\u00a0million marks, forming the other part of the Third Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. They were 28,500 tons, with a maximum speed of 21 knots from three triple-stage Brown-Boverie-Parsons turbines. Main armament was five double turrets housing twin 30.5\u00a0cm guns, arranged with two turrets fore and aft and one in the centre of the ship. The second turret at either end was raised higher than the outer so that it could fire over the top (superfiring). As with \"Prinzregent Luitpold\", the ships were originally intended to have one diesel engine for cruising, but these were never developed and turbines were fitted instead. The ships were equipped with torpedo nets, trailed along the hull intended to stop torpedoes, but these reduced maximum speed to an impractical 8 knots and were later removed.\nConstruction began in 1910 of the first submarine powered by twin diesel engines. \"U-19\" was twice the size of the first German submarine, had five times the range at cruising at 8 knots, or 15 knots maximum. There were now two bow and two stern torpedo tubes, with six torpedoes carried. The ships were designed to operate at a depth of , though could go to .\n1912 to 1914, Third \"Novelle\".\nSpending on the navy increased inexorably year by year. In 1909 Chancellor Bernhard von B\u00fclow and Treasury Secretary Reinhold von Sydow attempted to pass a new budget boosting taxes in an attempt to reduce the deficit. The Social Democratic parties refused to accept the increased taxes on goods, while the conservatives opposed increases in inheritance taxes. B\u00fclow and Sydow resigned in defeat and Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg became Chancellor. His attempted solution was to initiate negotiations with Britain for an agreed slow down in naval building. Negotiations came to nothing when in 1911 the Agadir Crisis brought France and Germany into conflict. Germany attempted to 'persuade' France to cede territory in the Middle Congo in return for giving France a free hand in Morocco. The effect was to raise concerns in Britain over Germany's expansionist aims, and encouraged Britain to form a closer relationship with France, including naval cooperation. Tirpitz saw this once again as an opportunity to press for naval expansion and the continuation of the four capital ships per year building rate into 1912. The January 1912 elections brought a Reichstag where the Social Democrats, opposed to military expansion, became the largest party.\nThe German army, mindful of the steadily increasing proportion of spending going to the navy, demanded an increase of 136,000 men to bring its size closer to that of France. In February 1912 the British war minister, Viscount Haldane, came to Berlin to discuss possible limits to naval expansion. Meanwhile, in Britain, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill made a speech describing the German navy as a 'luxury', which was considered an insult when reported in Germany. The talks came to nothing, ending in recriminations over who had offered what. Bethmann Hollweg argued for a guaranteed proportion of expenditure for the army, but failed when army officers refused to support him publicly. Tirpitz argued for six new capital ships, and got three, together with 15,000 additional sailors in a new combined military budget passed in April 1912. The new ships, together with the existing reserve flagship and four reserve battleships were to become one new squadron for the High Seas Fleet. In all the fleet would have five squadrons of eight battleships, twelve large cruisers and thirty small, plus additional cruisers for overseas duties. Tirpitz intended that with the rolling program of replacements, the existing coastal defence squadron of old ships would become a sixth fleet squadron, while the eight existing battle-cruisers would be joined by eight more as replacements for the large cruisers presently in the overseas squadrons. The plan envisaged a main fleet of 100,000 men, 49 battleships and 28 battlecruisers by 1920. The Kaiser commented of the British, \"... we have them up against the wall.\"\nAlthough Tirpitz had succeeded in getting more ships, the proportion of military expenditure on the navy declined in 1912 and thereafter, from 35% in 1911 to 33% in 1912 and 25% in 1913. This reflected a change in attitude amongst military planners that a land war in Europe was increasingly likely, and a turning away from Tirpitz's scheme for worldwide expansion using the navy. In 1912 General von Moltke commented, \"I consider war to be unavoidable, and the sooner the better.\" The Kaiser's younger brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia, considered that the cost of the navy was now too great. In Britain, Churchill announced an intention to build two capital ships for every one constructed by Germany, and reorganised the fleet to move battleships from the Mediterranean to Channel waters. A policy was introduced of promoting British naval officers by merit and ability rather than time served, which saw rapid promotions for Jellicoe and Beatty, both of whom had important roles in the forthcoming World War I. By 1913 the French and British had plans in place for joint naval action against Germany, and France moved its Atlantic fleet from Brest to Toulon, replacing British ships.\nBritain also escalated the arms race by expanding the capabilities of its new battleships. The five 1912 of 32,000 tons would have guns and would be completely oil-fuelled, allowing a speed of 25 knots. For 1912\u201313 Germany concentrated on battlecruisers, with three ships of 27,000 tons and 26\u201327 knots maximum speed, costing 56\u201359\u00a0million marks each. These had four turrets mounting two 30.5\u00a0cm guns arranged in two turrets either end, with the inner turret superfiring over the outer. was the first German ship to have anti-aircraft guns fitted.\nIn 1913, Germany responded to the British challenge by laying down two battleships. These did not enter service until after the Battle of Jutland, so failed to take part in any major naval action of the war. They had displacement of 28,600 tons, a crew of 1,100 and a speed of 22 knots, costing 50\u00a0million marks. Guns were arranged in the same pattern as the preceding battle-cruisers, but were now increased to diameter. The ships had four 8.8\u00a0cm anti-aircraft and also sixteen 15\u00a0cm lighter guns, but were coal fuelled. It was considered that coal bunkers at the sides of the ship added to protection against penetrating shells, and Germany also did not have a reliable supply of fuel oil. Two more ships of the class were later laid down, but never completed.\nThree light cruisers commenced construction in German yards in 1912\u20131913 ordered by the Russian Navy, costing around 9\u00a0million marks. The ships were seized at the outbreak of World War I becoming , and . Two larger cruisers, and were also commenced and entered service in 1915. More torpedo boats were constructed, with gradually increasing sizes having reached 800 tons for the V-25 to V-30 craft constructed by AG Vulcan in Kiel before 1914. In 1912 Germany created a Mediterranean squadron consisting of the battlecruiser \"Goeben\" and light cruiser \"Breslau\".\nAir power.\nNaval trials of balloons began in 1891, but the results were unsatisfactory and none were purchased by the navy. In 1895 Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin attempted to interest both the army and navy in his new rigid airships, but without success. The Zeppelin rigids were considered too slow and there were concerns with their reliability operating over water. In 1909 the navy rejected proposals for aircraft to be launched from ships, and again in 1910 declined Zeppelin's airships. Finally in 1911, trials with aircraft began and in 1912 Tirpitz agreed to purchase the first airship for naval reconnaissance at a cost of 850,000 marks.\nThe machine had insufficient range () to operate over Britain, but had machine guns for use against aircraft and experimental bombs. The following year ten more were ordered and a new naval air division was created at Johannisthal, near Berlin. However, in September 1913 L 1 was destroyed in a storm, while the following month L 2 was lost in a gas explosion. Orders for the undelivered machines were cancelled, leaving the navy with one machine, the L 3.\nIn 1910 Prince Heinrich had learned to fly and supported the cause of naval aviation. In 1911 experiments took place with Albatros seaplanes and in 1912 Tirpitz authorized 200,000 marks for seaplane trials. The Curtiss seaplane was adopted. By 1913 there were four aeroplanes, now including a British Sopwith, and long-term plans to create six naval air stations by 1918. By 1914, the \"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\", the naval counterpart to the well-established \"Fliegertruppe\" land-based aviation units of the Army, comprised twelve seaplanes and one landplane and disposed of a budget of 8.5\u00a0million marks. Trials in 1914 using seaplanes operating with the fleet were less than impressive; out of four taking part one crashed, one was unable to take off and only one succeeded in all tasks. The most successful aircraft had been the British design, and indeed experiments in Britain had been proceeding with the support of Winston Churchill, and included converting ferries and liners into seaplane carriers.\nWorld War I.\nBy the start of the First World War, the German Imperial Navy possessed 22 pre-Dreadnoughts, 14 dreadnought battleships and 4 battle-cruisers. A further three ships of the \"K\u00f6nig\" class were completed between August and November 1914, and two \"Bayern\"-class battleships entered service in 1916. The battlecruisers \"Derfflinger\", , and were completed in September 1914, March 1916, and May 1917, respectively. All but the latest pre-Dreadnoughts were soon decommissioned, so that their crews could be transferred to more useful vessels. The main fighting forces of the navy were to become the High Seas Fleet and the U-boat fleet. Smaller fleets were deployed to the German overseas protectorates, the most prominent being assigned to the East Asia Squadron at Qingdao. The German Navy's U-boats were also instrumental in the sinking of the passenger liner and auxiliary cruiser, the on 7 May 1915, which was one of the main events that led to the USA joining the war two years later in 1917.\nEngagements.\nNotable battles fought by the Navy were:\nNotable minor battles:\nMinor engagements included the commerce raiding carried out by the \"Emden\", , and the sailing ship and commerce raider . The Imperial Navy carried out land operations, e.g. operating the long-range Paris Gun which was based on a naval gun. The Siege of Tsingtao (Qingdao) used naval troops as Qingdao was a naval base, and also as the Imperial Navy was directly under the Imperial Government (the German Army was made up of regiments from the various states). Following the Battle of Jutland, the capital ships of the Imperial Navy had been confined to inactive service in harbor. In October 1918, the Imperial Naval Command in Kiel under Admiral Franz von Hipper, without authorization, planned to dispatch the fleet for a last battle against the Royal Navy in the English Channel. The naval order of 24 October 1918 and the preparations to sail first triggered the Kiel Mutiny among the affected sailors and then a general revolution which was to sweep aside the monarchy within a few days.\nMarines.\nThe Marines were referred to as Seebataillone (sea battalions). They served in the Prussian Navy, the North German Federal Navy, the Imperial German Navy and in the modern German Navy.\nNaval aviation.\nThe \"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\" consisted of Zeppelins (airships), observation balloons and fixed-wing aircraft. The main use of the Zeppelins was in reconnaissance over the North Sea and the Baltic, where the endurance of the craft led German warships to a number of Allied vessels. Zeppelin patrolling had priority over any other airship activity. During the entire war around 1,200 scouting flights were made. During 1915 the German Navy had some 15 Zeppelins in commission and was able to have two or more patrolling continuously at any one time. They kept the British ships from approaching Germany, spotted when and where the British were laying sea-mines, and later aided in the destruction of those mines. Zeppelins would sometimes land on the sea surface next to a minesweeper, bring aboard an officer and show him the lay of the mines. The Naval and Army Air Services also directed a number of strategic raids against Britain, leading the way in bombing techniques and also forcing the British to bolster their anti-aircraft defences. The possibility of airship raids were approved by the Kaiser on 9 January 1915, although he excluded London as a target and further demanded that no attacks be made on historic or government buildings or museums. The night-time raids were intended to target only military sites on the east coast and around the Thames estuary, but difficulties in navigation and the height from which the bombs were dropped made accurate bombing impossible, and most bombs fell on civilian targets or open countryside.\nStationed in North Sea coastal airfields, German naval aircraft often fought against their British counterparts of the Royal Naval Air Service. Naval pilots flew aircraft that were also used by the German Army's \"Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte\" in addition to seaplanes. Theo Osterkamp was one of the original naval pilots, the first German pilot to fly a land-based aircraft to England on a reconnaissance mission, and its leading ace with 32 victories. By war's end, the roster of German naval flying aces also included Gotthard Sachsenberg (31 victories), Alexander Zenzes (18 victories), Friedrich Christiansen (13 victories), Karl Meyer (8 victories), Karl Scharon (8 victories), and Hans Goerth (7 victories). Another decorated aviator was Gunther Pl\u00fcschow who shot down a Japanese plane during the Siege of Tsingtao and was the only German combatant to escape from a prison camp in Britain.\nList of aircraft that were assigned to naval air service:\nNaval Air Service Units included \"Marine Jagdgruppe Flandern\" composed of:\nPost-war.\nAfter the end of World War I, the bulk of the navy's modern ships (74 in all) were interned at Scapa Flow (November 1918), where the entire fleet (with a few exceptions) was scuttled by its crews on 21 June 1919 on orders from its commander, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.\nErnest Cox subsequently salvaged many of the Scapa Flow ships. The surviving ships of the Imperial Navy became the basis for the \"Reichsmarine\" of the Weimar Republic.\nCommand, leadership and control.\nThe administration of the Imperial German Navy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was characterized by a complex, fragmented hierarchy under the direct authority of the German Emperor (Kaiser). From 1899 onward, the Kaiser served as the supreme commander of the navy, with a variety of offices and commands reporting directly to him. These included the heads of the Naval Cabinet, the Naval Staff, the High Seas Fleet Command, the Cruiser Squadron, the naval stations on the North and Baltic Seas, commanders of ships on foreign stations, and the State Secretary of the Naval Administration, a post notably held by Grand Admiral von Tirpitz. Tirpitz oversaw a broad naval administration encompassing personnel, technical, and educational departments, yet he was denied overall operational command, a situation that contributed to conflicting strategic directives within the navy. \nUnlike the centralized command structure of the German Army, the navy lacked unified professional leadership. All significant orders required the personal approval of the Kaiser, which both limited efficient decision-making and fostered bureaucratic rivalries. Tirpitz\u2019s efforts to consolidate command under his authority were rebuffed, and he was eventually removed in March 1916. Not until September 1918, with Admiral Reinhard Scheer\u2019s establishment of the Seekriegsleitung (Operational Command) at the Grand Headquarters at Spa, did the navy briefly achieve something approaching a centralized high command, effectively reducing the emperor\u2019s direct control. Administratively, the navy was divided into territorial and overseas commands. The North Sea and Baltic coasts each had their own naval station, while six overseas stations oversaw foreign deployments. The principal German overseas base was at Qingdao in China, with other ships dispersed in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, East Africa, West Africa, and the South Pacific. The office of Inspector-General, held by Grand Admiral Prince Heinrich von Preussen, provided an additional layer of oversight. \nThe legal basis for the Kaiser\u2019s authority over the navy was enshrined in Article 53 of the 1871 Constitution, which vested supreme command, organization, and officer appointments in the monarch, who also received the direct oath of allegiance from naval officers. Kaiser Wilhelm II, upon his accession, further centralized and personalized naval administration, reorganizing his military entourage into a maison militaire and establishing the Navy Cabinet (Marine-Kabinett) in 1889 as a counterpart to the Military Cabinet. The Navy Cabinet handled the transmission of imperial orders, personnel appointments, honorary matters, and naval correspondence. Gustav Freiherr von Senden-Bibran led the Navy Office until 1906, succeeded by Georg Alexander von M\u00fcller until the end of the monarchy in 1918. \nAdministrative and operational responsibilities were further divided in 1889, when the Imperial Admiralty was dissolved. Strategic command was given to a new Chief of the High Command of the Navy (Oberkommando), equivalent to a commanding general in the army, while administrative control fell to the State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office (Reichs-Marine-Amt), who managed construction, maintenance, and a wide array of non-operational matters. The Navy Office grew to encompass ten major departments covering central administration, shipyards, logistics, armaments, medical affairs, intelligence, general naval affairs, construction, navigation, and legal matters. In 1899, Wilhelm II replaced the High Command with the Admiralty Staff (Admiralstab), a small body with limited peacetime functions related to strategy, training, intelligence, and planning. Its wartime role, however, was to conduct naval operations, though always subject to the Kaiser\u2019s approval. Leadership of the fleet itself shifted over time, eventually consolidating under the Chief of the High Sea Fleet after 1907. \nRecruitment and Training.\nOfficers.\nThe training and recruitment process of the Imperial German Navy was marked by rigorous selection procedures, a strong emphasis on social background, and an extensive system of education and training for its officer candidates. The main body responsible for officer recruitment was the Inspektion des Bildungswesens der Marine (Education Department of the Navy), which was established as an independent authority in 1895 and placed in charge of the Sea Cadet Entrance Commission. The inspector of this department had significant autonomy, especially in the selection of naval officer cadets, with final authority resting with the Kaiser. Even after a 1907 reorganization placed the department under the command of the Baltic naval station and revoked its direct reporting to the Kaiser, the inspector retained decisive control over the admission of sea cadets and could appoint his own commission members.\nThe Sea Cadet Entrance Commission operated with considerable discretion, holding closed deliberations, keeping no formal records, and issuing decisions that were not subject to appeal except in the case of high-profile applicants. The selection process was guided by clear social and educational principles, reflecting the long-standing values of the German officer corps. Emphasis was placed on recruiting candidates of high social standing and appropriate upbringing, as set out by Wilhelm I in 1879, who prioritized the quality and homogeneity of cadet backgrounds over sheer numbers, aiming to foster cohesion within the officer corps. Although a reformist \u201cNew Course\u201d in officer selection was briefly introduced at the close of the nineteenth century, this was soon abandoned by Wilhelm II, who instead favored candidates from established officer families, loyal monarchist lineages, and families notable in Prussian or German state history.\nA close study of the 1907 cadet intake, known as the \u201cCrew of 1907,\u201d provides insight into the typical social background of naval officer recruits. Of the 197 accepted applicants, only 11 percent were from noble families, most of them Prussian, while the majority were drawn from the educated and loyal Prussian middle class. Fathers of these cadets were often academics, officers, merchants, professionals, or estate owners. Educational backgrounds varied: most had completed the Abitur (the German university entrance qualification), but others came from primary or secondary schools, and some entered from military academies without the Abitur. Geographically, most cadets hailed from northern Germany, especially Prussia and the coastal regions, with only a minority from the south. Notably, there was a conscious, if limited, effort to include a small proportion of cadets from lower social strata, possibly as a gesture to the Reichstag.\nApplications for the navy had to be submitted in August and September of the previous year and had to include school reports covering all subjects and a medical certificate. In addition, parents had to submit a commitment to pay the 300 marks for initial equipment and the annual payments of 200 marks and monthly payments of 10 marks. In total, parents had to pay a sum of approximately 6765 marks during their son's first eight to nine years of service, even though he was already being paid. \nTraining at the Naval School in Kiel was strict and disciplined, with cadets expected to conduct themselves as officers and gentlemen. The school imposed a spartan lifestyle: drinking, smoking, gambling, and music-making were forbidden in quarters. The curriculum was intensive, with 41 hours of instruction in the summer and 39 in the winter. Navigation and seamanship received the greatest emphasis, followed by mechanics, artillery, hydraulics, mathematics, shipbuilding, and, interestingly, even dancing. Additional instruction covered ship types, mine deployment, foreign languages, gymnastics, and horseback riding.\nThe pathway for officer candidates began with entry as a naval cadet at M\u00fcrwik in April, followed by basic infantry training lasting one and a half months. This was succeeded by ten and a half months of practical training aboard training ships, focusing on navigation, engine tending, and stoking. Advancement to the rank of midshipman (F\u00e4hnrich zur See) was followed by a year at the Naval School at Kiel with a strong focus on science and engineering, culminating in a main examination for executive officers. Further specialized training in gunnery, torpedo warfare, and infantry practice lasted six months, after which cadets served aboard warships for a year, with promotion and commissioning as ensigns upon successful performance.\nRatings.\nBeyond the ranks of the officer corps, the Imperial German Navy implemented a comprehensive system of conscription and voluntary service to meet its personnel needs. All men over seventeen who had acquired at least three months\u2019 experience on ships or rivercraft were subject to conscription for military service. Technical volunteers, often drawn from specialized professions, committed to three years of active service and then entered the reserve for an additional four years. Boys could join the navy from the age of sixteen, and after their initial training, they could qualify as theoretical non-commissioned officers, thereby opening a pathway for early advancement within the naval hierarchy.\nWithin this broader framework, the system of Einj\u00e4hrig-Freiwillige (one-year volunteers) provided further avenues for service and advancement. Eligible for this pathway were conscripts from the rural population who possessed a certificate of scientific aptitude for one-year voluntary service. These individuals could serve in the naval artillery and marine infantry without exception, in the shipyard divisions and among the engineering personnel of the torpedo departments if they could demonstrate two years of practical experience in steam engine construction, or in the shipyard divisions if they had studied shipbuilding or mechanical engineering at a technical university.\nProfessional sailors and engineers who worked on sea and river steamers enjoyed certain privileges during their year of service, notably exemption from having to provide their own clothing, equipment, and food\u2014provisions that otherwise applied to one-year volunteers as they did in the army. One-year volunteers were generally free to choose their naval base and garrison within specified limits; for professional sailors and engineers, special requests were considered when service requirements allowed.\nThe training and advancement opportunities for one-year volunteers were structured to identify and nurture those suitable for higher responsibility. Volunteers deemed suitable for potential officer careers received special training. Those who met expectations were typically promoted after six months to the status of supernumerary petty officers\u2014such as corporals, senior seaman artillerymen, and senior engineer cadets\u2014and in the later months of their year to full petty officers (non-commissioned officers). Upon completion of their service year, these individuals were appointed as officer cadets. Other one-year volunteers, if judged suitable, could also be promoted during their service to supernumerary petty officers and, upon discharge, to non-commissioned officers in the reserve, and might be considered for appointment as deck officer (deputy officer) candidates. The same progression was possible for three-year and multi-year volunteers when vacancies permitted.\nTraining for sailors was centralized in the main sailor divisions located in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, ensuring uniformity and high standards in naval education. At the ship's boy division in Friedrichsort, special emphasis was placed on cultivating a capable and disciplined new generation of non-commissioned officers, particularly for assignment within the broader sailor divisions. In this way, the navy maintained a steady flow of technically skilled and socially reliable personnel, whether through direct conscription, voluntary service, or specialized youth training. The system as a whole reflected both the navy\u2019s operational needs and the broader social values of Imperial Germany, combining structured opportunity with selective advancement to create a professional and disciplined force.\nRanks and ratings.\nThe Imperial German Navy's rank and rating system combined that of Prussia's with the navies of other northern states.\nWar crimes.\nThe Imperial German Navy was implicated in several war crimes committed during the First World War, most notably:\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It superseded the Imperial German Navy of the German Empire (1871\u20131918) and the inter-war (1919\u20131935) of the Weimar Republic. The was one of three official branches, along with the and the , of the , the German armed forces from 1935 to 1945.\nIn violation of the Treaty of Versailles, the grew rapidly during the German naval rearmament in the 1930s. The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of submarines.\n ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention, but in reality supporting the Nationalists against the Spanish Republicans.\nIn January 1939, Plan Z, a massive shipbuilding programme, was ordered, calling for surface naval parity with the British Royal Navy by 1944. When World War II broke out in September 1939, Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building programme for submarines (U-boats) instead of capital surface warships, and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources.\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the (as for all branches of the armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power) was Adolf Hitler, who exercised his authority through the ('High Command of the Navy').\nAmong the 's most significant ships were its U-boats, most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II. Wolfpacks were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic, but this tactic was largely abandoned by May 1943, when U-boat losses mounted. Along with the U-boats, surface commerce raiders (including auxiliary cruisers) were used to disrupt Allied shipping in the early years of the war, the most famous of these being the heavy cruisers \"Admiral Graf Spee\" and \"Admiral Scheer\" and the battleship \"Bismarck\". However, the adoption of convoy escorts, especially in the Atlantic, greatly reduced the effectiveness of surface commerce raiders against convoys.\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, the 's remaining ships were divided up among the Allied powers and were used for various purposes including minesweeping. Some were loaded with superfluous chemical weapons and scuttled.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nPost\u2013World War I origins.\nUnder the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Germany was only allowed a minimal navy of 15,000 personnel, six capital ships of no more than 10,000 tons, six cruisers, twelve destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, and no submarines or aircraft carriers. Military aircraft were also banned, so Germany could have no naval aviation. Under the treaty Germany could only build new ships to replace old ones. All the ships allowed and personnel were taken over from the \"Kaiserliche Marine\", which was renamed the .\nFrom the outset, Germany worked to circumvent the military restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. The Germans continued to develop U-boats through a submarine design office in the Netherlands (\"NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw\") and a torpedo research program in Sweden where the G7e torpedo was developed.\nEven before the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933 the German government decided on 15 November 1932 to launch a prohibited naval re-armament program that included U-boats, airplanes, and an aircraft carrier.\nThe launching of the first pocket battleship, in 1931 (as a replacement for the old pre-dreadnought battleship ) was a step in the formation of a modern German fleet. The building of the \"Deutschland\" caused consternation among the French and the British as they had expected that the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles would limit the replacement of the pre-dreadnought battleships to coastal defence ships, suitable only for defensive warfare. By using innovative construction techniques, the Germans had built a heavy ship suitable for offensive warfare on the high seas while still abiding by the letter of the treaty.\nNazi control.\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Hitler soon began to more brazenly ignore many of the Treaty restrictions and accelerated German naval rearmament. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 18 June 1935 allowed Germany to build a navy equivalent to 35% of the British surface ship tonnage and 45% of British submarine tonnage; battleships were to be limited to 35,000 tons. That same year the \"Reichsmarine\" was renamed as the \"Kriegsmarine\". In April 1939, as tensions escalated between the United Kingdom and Germany over Poland, Hitler unilaterally rescinded the restrictions of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.\nThe building-up of the German fleet in the time period of 1935\u20131939 was slowed by problems with marshaling enough manpower and material for ship building. This was because of the simultaneous and rapid build-up of the German Army and Air Force which demanded substantial effort and resources. Some projects, like the D-class cruisers and the P-class cruisers, had to be cancelled.\nSpanish Civil War.\nThe first military action of the \"Kriegsmarine\" came during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939). Following the outbreak of hostilities in July 1936 several large warships of the German fleet were sent to the region. The heavy cruisers \"Deutschland\" and , and the light cruiser were the first to be sent in July 1936. These large ships were accompanied by the 2nd Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The German presence was used to covertly support Francisco Franco's Nationalists although the immediate involvement of the \"Deutschland\" was humanitarian relief operations and evacuating 9,300 refugees, including 4,550 German citizens. Following the brokering of the International Non-Intervention Patrol to enforce an international arms embargo, the \"Kriegsmarine\" was allotted the patrol area between Cabo de Gata (Almeria) and Cabo de Oropesa. Numerous vessels served as part of these duties including . On 29 May 1937 the \"Deutschland\" was attacked off Ibiza by two bombers from the Republican Air Force. Total casualties from the Republican attack were 31 dead and 110 wounded, 71 seriously, mostly burn victims. In retaliation the \"Admiral Scheer\" shelled Almeria on 31 May killing 19\u201320 civilians, wounding 50 and destroying 35 buildings. Following further attacks by Republican submarines against the off the port of Oran between 15 and 18 June 1937 Germany withdrew from the Non-Intervention Patrol.\nU-boats also participated in covert action against Republican shipping as part of Operation Ursula. At least eight U-boats engaged a small number of targets in the area throughout the conflict. (By comparison the Italian \"Regia Marina\" operated 58 submarines in the area as part of the \"Sottomarini Legionari\".)\nPlan Z.\nThe \"Kriegsmarine\" saw as her main tasks the controlling of the Baltic Sea and winning a war against France in connection with the German army, because France was seen as the most likely enemy in the event of war. But in 1938 Hitler wanted to have the possibility of winning a war against Great Britain at sea in the coming years. Therefore, he ordered plans for such a fleet from the \"Kriegsmarine\". From the three proposed plans (X, Y and Z) he approved Plan Z in January 1939. This blueprint for the new German naval construction program envisaged building a navy of approximately 800 ships during the period 1939\u20131947. Hitler demanded that the program be completed by 1945. The main force of Plan Z were six H-class battleships. In the version of Plan Z drawn up in August 1939, the German fleet was planned to consist of the following ships by 1945:\nPersonnel strength was planned to rise to over 200,000.\nThe planned naval program was not very far advanced by the time World War II began. In 1939 two s and two H-class battleships were laid down and parts for two further H-class battleships and three s were in production. The strength of the German fleet at the beginning of the war was not even 20% of Plan Z. On 1 September 1939, the navy still had a total personnel strength of only 78,000, and it was not at all ready for a major role in the war. Because of the long time it would take to get the Plan Z fleet ready for action and shortage in workers and material in wartime, Plan Z was essentially shelved in September 1939 and the resources allocated for its realisation were largely redirected to the construction of U-boats, which would be ready for war against the United Kingdom more quickly.\nWorld War II.\nThe \"Kriegsmarine\" took part in the Battle of Westerplatte and the Battle of the Danzig Bay during the invasion of Poland. In 1939, major events for the \"Kriegsmarine\" were the sinking of the British aircraft carrier and the British battleship and the loss of at the Battle of the River Plate. Submarine attacks on Britain's vital maritime supply routes (Battle of the Atlantic) started immediately at the outbreak of war, although they were hampered by the lack of well placed ports from which to operate. Throughout the war the \"Kriegsmarine\" was responsible for coastal artillery protecting major ports and important coastal areas. It also operated anti-aircraft batteries protecting major ports.\nIn April 1940, the German Navy was heavily involved in the invasion of Norway, where it suffered significant losses, which included the heavy cruiser sunk by artillery and torpedoes from Norwegian shore batteries at the Oscarsborg Fortress in the Oslofjord. Ten destroyers were lost in the Battles of Narvik (half of German destroyer strength at the time), and two light cruisers, the \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" which was bombed and sunk by Royal Navy aircraft in Bergen, and the \"Karlsruhe\" which was sunk off the coast of Kristiansand by a British submarine. The \"Kriegsmarine\" did in return sink some British warships during this campaign, including the aircraft carrier .\nThe losses in the Norwegian Campaign left only a handful of undamaged heavy ships available for the planned, but never executed, invasion of the United Kingdom (Operation Sea Lion) in the summer of 1940. There were serious doubts that the invasion sea routes could have been protected against British naval interference. The Fall of France and the conquest of Norway gave German submarines greatly improved access to British shipping routes in the Atlantic. At first, British convoys lacked escorts that were adequate either in numbers or equipment and, as a result, the submarines had much success for few losses (this period was dubbed the First Happy Time by the Germans).\nItaly entered the war in June 1940, and the Battle of the Mediterranean began: from September 1941 to May 1944 some 62 German submarines were transferred there, sneaking past the British naval base at Gibraltar. The Mediterranean submarines sank 24 major Allied warships (including 12 destroyers, 4 cruisers, 2 aircraft carriers, and 1 battleship) and 94 merchant ships (449,206 tons of shipping). None of the Mediterranean submarines made it back to their home bases, as they were all either sunk in battle or scuttled by their crews at the end of the war.\nIn 1941, one of the four modern German battleships, sank while breaking out into the Atlantic for commerce raiding. The \"Bismarck\" was in turn hunted down by much superior British forces after being crippled by an air-launched torpedo. She was subsequently scuttled after being rendered a burning wreck by two British battleships.\nIn November 1941 during the Battle of the Mediterranean, German submarine \"U-331\" sank the British battleship \"Barham\", which had a magazine explosion and sank in minutes, with the loss of 862, or 2/3 of her crew.\nDuring 1941, the \"Kriegsmarine\" and the United States Navy became \"de facto\" belligerents, although war was not formally declared, leading to the sinking of the . This course of events were the result of the American decision to support Britain with its Lend-Lease program and the subsequent decision to escort Lend-Lease convoys with US war ships through the western part of the Atlantic.\nThe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent German declaration of war against the United States in December 1941 led to another phase of the Battle of the Atlantic. In Operation Drumbeat and subsequent operations until August 1942, a large number of Allied merchant ships were sunk by submarines off the US coast as the Americans had not prepared for submarine warfare, despite clear warnings (this was the so-called Second Happy Time for the German Navy). The situation became so serious that military leaders feared for the whole Allied strategy. The vast American ship building capabilities and naval forces were however now brought into the war and soon more than offset any losses inflicted by the German submariners. In 1942, the submarine warfare continued on all fronts, and when German forces in the Soviet Union reached the Black Sea, a few submarines were eventually transferred there.\nIn February 1942, the three large warships stationed on the Atlantic coast at Brest were evacuated back to German ports for deployment to Norway. The ships had been repeatedly damaged by air attacks by the RAF, the supply ships to support Atlantic sorties had been destroyed by the Royal Navy, and Hitler now felt that Norway was the \"zone of destiny\" for these ships. The two battleships and and the heavy cruiser passed through the English Channel (Channel Dash) on their way to Norway despite British efforts to stop them. Not since the Spanish Armada in 1588 had any warships in wartime done this. It was a tactical victory for the \"Kriegsmarine\" and a blow to British morale, but the withdrawal removed the possibility of attacking allied convoys in the Atlantic with heavy surface ships.\nWith the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 Britain started to send Arctic convoys with military goods around Norway to support their new ally. In 1942 German forces began heavily attacking these convoys, mostly with bombers and U-boats. The big ships of the \"Kriegsmarine\" in Norway were seldom involved in these attacks, because of the inferiority of German radar technology, and because Hitler and the leadership of the \"Kriegsmarine\" feared losses of these precious ships. The most effective of these attacks was the near destruction of Convoy PQ 17 in July 1942. Later in the war German attacks on these convoys were mostly reduced to U-boat activities and the mass of the allied freighters reached their destination in Soviet ports.\nThe Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 was an attempt by a German naval surface force to attack an Allied Arctic convoy. However, the advantage was not pressed home and they returned to base. There were serious implications: this failure infuriated Hitler, who nearly enforced a decision to scrap the surface fleet. Instead, resources were diverted to new U-boats, and the surface fleet became a lesser threat to the Allies.\nAfter December 1943 when had been sunk in an attack on an Arctic convoy in the Battle of North Cape by , most German surface ships in bases at the Atlantic were blockaded in, or close to, their ports as a \"fleet in being\", for fear of losing them in action and to tie up British naval forces. The largest of these ships, the battleship , was stationed in Norway as a threat to Allied shipping and also as a defence against a potential Allied invasion. When she was sunk, after several attempts, by British bombers in November 1944 (Operation Catechism), several British capital ships could be moved to the Far East.\nFrom late 1944 until the end of the war, the surviving surface fleet of the \"Kriegsmarine\" (heavy cruisers: , , , , light cruisers: , , ) was heavily engaged in providing artillery support to the retreating German land forces along the Baltic coast and in ferrying civilian refugees to the western Baltic Sea parts of Germany (Mecklenburg, Schleswig-Holstein) in large rescue operations. Large parts of the population of eastern Germany fled the approaching Red Army out of fear for Soviet retaliation (mass rapes, killings, and looting by Soviet troops did occur). The \"Kriegsmarine\" evacuated two million civilians and troops in the evacuation of East Prussia and Danzig from January to May 1945. It was during this activity that the catastrophic sinking of several large passenger ships occurred: and were sunk by Soviet submarines, while was sunk by British bombers, each sinking claiming thousands of civilian lives. The \"Kriegsmarine\" also provided important assistance in the evacuation of the fleeing German civilians of Pomerania and Stettin in March and April 1945.\nA desperate measure of the \"Kriegsmarine\" to fight the superior strength of the Western Allies from 1944 was the formation of the \"Kleinkampfverb\u00e4nde\" (Small Battle Units). These were special naval units with frogmen, manned torpedoes, motorboats laden with explosives and so on. The more effective of these weapons and units were the development and deployment of midget submarines like the \"Molch\" and \"Seehund\". In the last stage of the war, the \"Kriegsmarine\" also organised a number of divisions of infantry from its personnel.\nBetween 1943 and 1945, a group of U-boats known as the \"Monsun\" Boats (\"Monsun Gruppe\") operated in the Indian Ocean from Japanese bases in the occupied Dutch East Indies and Malaya. Allied convoys had not yet been organised in those waters, so initially many ships were sunk. However, this situation was soon remedied. During the later war years, the \"Monsun\" Boats were also used as a means of exchanging vital war supplies with Japan.\nDuring 1943 and 1944, due to Allied anti-submarine tactics and better equipment, the U-boat fleet started to suffer heavy losses. The turning point of the Battle of the Atlantic was during Black May in 1943, when the U-boat fleet started suffering heavy losses and the number of Allied ships sunk started to decrease. Radar, longer range air cover, sonar, improved tactics, and new weapons all contributed. German technical developments, such as the \"Schnorchel\", attempted to counter these. Near the end of the war a small number of the new \"Elektroboot\" U-boats (types XXI and XXIII) became operational, the first submarines designed to operate submerged at all times. The \"Elektroboote\" had the potential to negate the Allied technological and tactical advantage, although they were deployed too late to see combat in the war.\nEvacuations by the Kriegsmarine (1943\u20131945).\nThe failure of German evacuation attempts in the Tunisia Campaign in 1943 had a profound impact on the operational planning of the Wehrmacht and the Kriegsmarine. During the final phase of the North African campaign, the Kriegsmarine was unable to evacuate the forces. More than 130,000 German soldiers, supplemented by approximately 120,000 Italian troops, could not be safely withdrawn and were ultimately captured by the Allied forces. The resulting chaos and loss of manpower and equipment served as a harsh lesson for the German high command. Subsequently, future withdrawals were planned earlier, coordinated more centrally, and conducted wherever possible under naval protection.\nFrom mid-1943 onward, the Kriegsmarine increasingly assumed the role of a specialized evacuation force. Only two months after the fall of Tunis, German forces conducted the evacuation of Sicily between July and August 1943 with relatively low losses, followed by an orderly withdrawal from Sardinia in September. Between September and October 1943, Corsica was fully evacuated, with German units withdrawn without significant casualties. At the same time, the Kriegsmarine executed a large-scale withdrawal from the Kuban bridgehead on the Eastern Front, removing over 200,000 troops and considerable quantities of equipment.\nIn 1944, the Kriegsmarine continued to expand its evacuation operations. The withdrawal from Crimea between April and May, though conducted under heavy pressure from the Red Army, successfully evacuated tens of thousands of troops. Later that year, German forces executed a disciplined evacuation from the Scheldt during the Battle of the Scheldt, removing significant units from the Western Scheldt.\nThe final and largest series of evacuations took place between 1944 and 1945, when the Kriegsmarine coordinated the mass evacuation of military personnel and civilians from East Prussia, Pomerania, and the Baltic States. Operations such as Operation Hannibal transported millions of people \u2013 including soldiers, wounded personnel, and refugees \u2013 across the Baltic Sea despite overwhelming Soviet opposition. These large-scale operations illustrate how, by the end of the war, the Kriegsmarine had evolved into a highly organized maritime evacuation machine, capable of conducting complex and dangerous withdrawals while balancing both military and civilian priorities.\nWar crimes.\nFollowing the capture of Liep\u0101ja in Latvia by the Germans on 29 June 1941, the town came under the command of the \"Kriegsmarine\". On 1 July 1941, the town commandant \"Korvettenkapit\u00e4n\" Stein ordered that ten hostages be shot for every act of sabotage, and further put civilians in the zone of targeting by declaring that Red Army soldiers were hiding among them in civilian attire.\nOn 5 July 1941 \"Korvettenkapit\u00e4n\" Br\u00fcckner, who had taken over from Stein, issued a set of anti-Jewish regulations in the local newspaper, \"Kurzemes V\u0101rds\". Summarized, the regulations were as follows:\nOn 16 July 1941, \"Fregattenkapit\u00e4n\" Dr. Hans Kawelmacher was appointed the German naval commandant in Liep\u0101ja. On 22 July, Kawelmacher sent a telegram to the German Navy's Baltic Command in Kiel, which stated that he wanted 100 SS and fifty \"Schutzpolizei\" (protective police) men sent to Liep\u0101ja for \"quick implementation Jewish problem\". Kawelmacher hoped to accelerate the killings, complaining: \"Here about 8,000 Jews... with present SS-personnel, this would take one year, which is untenable for [the] pacification of Liep\u0101ja.\" Kawelmacher telegram on 27 July 1941 read: \"Jewish problem Libau largely solved by execution of about 1,100 male Jews by Riga SS commando on 24 and 25.7.\"\nIn September 1939, U-boat commander Fritz-Julius Lemp of \"U-30\" sank SS Athenia (1922) after mistaking it for a legitimate military target, resulting in the deaths of 117 civilians. Germany did not admit responsibility for the incident until after the war. Lemp was killed in action in 1941. U-247 was alleged to have shot at sunken ship survivors, but as the vessel was lost at sea with its crew, there was no investigation.\nIn 1945, U-boat Commander Heinz-Wilhelm Eck of was tried along with four of his crewmen for shooting at survivors. All were found guilty, with three of them, including Eck, being executed. In 1946, Hellmuth von Ruckteschell was sentenced to 10 years in prison, reduced to 7 years on appeal, for the illegal sinking of ships and criminal negligence for failing to protect the downed crew of the SS Anglo Saxon. Ruckteschell died in prison in 1948.\nPost-war division.\nAfter the war, the German surface ships that remained afloat (only the cruisers and , and a dozen destroyers were operational) were divided among the victors by the Tripartite Naval Commission. The US used the heavy cruiser in nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll in 1946 as a target ship for the Operation Crossroads. Some (like the unfinished aircraft carrier ) were used for target practice with conventional weapons, while others (mostly destroyers and torpedo boats) were put into the service of Allied navies that lacked surface ships after the war. The training barque SSS \"Horst Wessel\" was recommissioned USCGC \"Eagle\" and remains in active service, assigned to the United States Coast Guard Academy. The British, French, and Soviet navies received the destroyers, and some torpedo boats went to the Danish and Norwegian navies. For the purpose of mine clearing, the Royal Navy employed German crews and minesweepers from June 1945 to January 1948, organised in the German Mine Sweeping Administration (GMSA), which consisted of 27,000 members of the former \"Kriegsmarine\" and 300 vessels.\nThe destroyers and the Soviet share light cruiser were all retired by the end of the 1950s, but five escort destroyers were returned from the French to the new West German Navy in the 1950s and three 1945 scuttled type XXI and XXIII U-boats were raised by West Germany and integrated into their new navy. In 1956, with West Germany's accession to NATO, a new navy was established and was referred to as the \"Bundesmarine\" (Federal Navy). Some \"Kriegsmarine\" commanders like Erich Topp and Otto Kretschmer went on to serve in the \"Bundesmarine\". In East Germany the \"Volksmarine\" (People's Navy) was established in 1956. With the reunification of Germany in 1990, it was decided to use the name \"Deutsche Marine\" (German Navy).\nShips.\nBy the start of World War II, much of the \"Kriegsmarine\" were modern ships: fast, well-armed, and well-armoured. This had been achieved by concealment but also by deliberately flouting World War I peace terms and those of various naval treaties. However, the war started with the German Navy still at a distinct disadvantage in terms of sheer size with what were expected to be its primary adversaries \u2013 the navies of France and Great Britain. Although a major re-armament of the navy (Plan Z) was planned, and initially begun, the start of the war in 1939 meant that the vast amounts of material required for the project were diverted to other areas. The sheer disparity in size when compared to the other European powers navies prompted Raeder to write of his own navy once the war began \"The surface forces can do no more than show that they know how to die gallantly.\" A number of captured ships from occupied countries were added to the German fleet as the war progressed. Though six major units of the \"Kriegsmarine\" were sunk during the war (both \"Bismarck\"-class battleships and both \"Scharnhorst\"-class battleships, as well as two heavy cruisers), there were still many ships afloat (including four heavy cruisers and four light cruisers) as late as March 1945.\nSome ship types do not fit clearly into the commonly used ship classifications. Where there is argument, this has been noted.\nSurface ships.\nThe main combat ships of the \"Kriegsmarine\" (excluding U-boats):\nAircraft carriers.\nConstruction of Graf Zeppelin was started in 1936 and construction of an unnamed sister ship was started two years later in 1938, but neither ship was completed. In 1942 conversion of three German passenger ships (\"Europa\", \"Potsdam\", \"Gneisenau\") and two unfinished cruisers, the captured French light cruiser and the German heavy cruiser , to auxiliary carriers was begun. In November 1942 the conversion of the passenger ships was stopped because these ships were now seen as too slow for operations with the fleet. But conversion of one of these ships, the \"Potsdam\", to a training carrier was begun instead. In February 1943 all the work on carriers was halted because of the German failure during the Battle of the Barents Sea, which convinced Hitler that large warships were useless.\nAll engineering of the aircraft carriers like catapults, arresting gears and so on were tested and developed at the \"Erprobungsstelle See Travem\u00fcnde\" (Experimental Agency Sea in Travem\u00fcnde) including the airplanes for the aircraft carriers, the Fieseler Fi 167 ship-borne biplane torpedo and reconnaissance bomber and the naval versions of two key early war \"Luftwaffe\" aircraft: the Messerschmitt Bf 109T fighter and the Junkers Ju 87C Stuka dive bomber.\nBattleships.\nThe \"Kriegsmarine\" completed four battleships during its existence. The first pair were the 11-inch gun , consisting of the and , which participated in the invasion of Norway in 1940, and then in commerce raiding until the \"Gneisenau\" was heavily damaged by a British air raid in 1942 and the \"Scharnhorst\" was sunk in the Battle of the North Cape in late 1943. The second pair were the 15-inch gun , consisting of the and . The \"Bismarck\" was sunk on her first sortie into the Atlantic in 1941 (Operation Rhein\u00fcbung) although she did sink the battlecruiser \"Hood\" and severely damaged the battleship \"Prince of Wales\", while the \"Tirpitz\" was based in Norwegian ports during most of the war as a fleet in being, tying up Allied naval forces, and subject to a number of attacks by British aircraft and submarines. More battleships were planned (the H-class), but construction was abandoned in September 1939.\nPre-dreadnought battleships.\nThe World War I-era pre-dreadnought battleships and were used mainly as training ships, although they also participated in several military operations, with the latter bearing the distinction of firing the opening shots of World War II. and were converted into radio-guided target ships in 1928 and 1930 respectively. was decommissioned in 1931 and struck from the naval register in 1936. Plans to convert her into a radio-controlled target ship for aircraft was cancelled because of the outbreak of war in 1939.\nBattlecruisers.\nThree O-class battlecruisers were ordered in 1939, but with the start of the war the same year there were not enough resources to build the ships.\n\"Panzerschiffe\" and Heavy cruisers.\nThe Deutschland-class cruisers were the (renamed \"L\u00fctzow\"), , and . Modern commentators favour classifying these as \"heavy cruisers\" and the \"Kriegsmarine\" itself reclassified these ships as such (\"Schwere Kreuzer\") in 1940. In German language usage these three ships were designed and built as \"armoured ships\" (\"Panzerschiffe\") \u2013 \"pocket battleship\" is an English label.\nThe \"Graf Spee\" was scuttled by her own crew in the Battle of the River Plate, in the Rio de la Plata estuary in December 1939. \"Admiral Scheer\" was bombed on 9 April 1945 in port at Kiel and badly damaged, essentially beyond repair, and rolled over at her moorings. After the war that part of the harbor was filled in with rubble and the hulk buried. \"L\u00fctzow\" (ex-\"Deutschland\") was bombed 16 April 1945 in the Baltic off Swinem\u00fcnde just west of Stettin, and settled on the shallow bottom. With the Red Army advancing across the Oder, the ship was destroyed in place to prevent the Soviets capturing anything useful. The wreck was dismantled and scrapped in 1948\u20131949.\nThe Admiral Hipper-class cruisers in active service were , , and . Cruisers , and were never completed.\nLight cruisers.\nThe term \"light cruiser\" is a shortening of the phrase \"light armoured cruiser\". Light cruisers were defined under the Washington Naval Treaty by gun calibre. Light cruiser describes a small ship that was armoured in the same way as an armoured cruiser. In other words, like standard cruisers, light cruisers possessed a protective belt and a protective deck. Prior to this, smaller cruisers tended to be of the protected cruiser model and possessed only an armoured deck. The Kriegsmarine light cruisers were as follows:\nNever completed: three M-class cruisers\nNever completed: KH-1 and KH-2 (\"Kreuzer\" (cruiser) Holland 1 and 2). Captured in the Netherlands 1940. Both being on the stocks and building continued for the \"Kriegsmarine\".\nIn addition, the former \"Kaiserliche Marine\" light cruiser was captured by the Germans on 11 September 1943 after the capitulation of Italy. She was pressed into \"Kriegsmarine\" service for a brief time before being destroyed by British MTBs.\nAuxiliary cruisers.\nDuring the war, some merchant ships were converted into \"auxiliary cruisers\" and nine were used as commerce raiders sailing under false flags to avoid detection, and operated in all oceans with considerable effect. The German designation for the ships was \"'Handelst\u00f6rkreuzer\"' thus the HSK serial assigned. Each had as well an administrative label more commonly used, e.g. Schiff 16 = Atlantis, Schiff 41 = Kormoran, etc. The auxiliary cruisers were:\nDestroyers.\nAlthough the German World War II destroyer (\"Zerst\u00f6rer\") fleet was modern and the ships were larger than conventional destroyers of other navies, they had problems. Early classes were unstable, wet in heavy weather, suffered from engine problems, and had short range. Some problems were solved with the evolution of later designs, but further developments were curtailed by the war and, ultimately, by Germany's defeat. In the first year of World War II, they were used mainly to sow offensive minefields in shipping lanes close to the British coast.\nTorpedo boats.\nThese vessels evolved through the 1930s from small vessels, relying almost entirely on torpedoes, to what were effectively small destroyers with mines, torpedoes, and guns. Two classes of fleet torpedo boats were planned, but not built, in the 1940s.\nE-boats (\"Schnellboote\").\nThe E-boats were fast attack craft with torpedo tubes. Over 200 boats of this type were built for the \"Kriegsmarine\".\nTroop ships.\n, \"Goya\", , , \"Wilhelm Gustloff\".\nMiscellaneous.\nThousands of smaller warships and auxiliaries served in the \"Kriegsmarine\", including minelayers, minesweepers, mine transports, netlayers, floating AA and torpedo batteries, command ships, decoy ships (small merchantmen with hidden weaponry), gunboats, monitors, escorts, patrol boats, sub-chasers, landing craft, landing support ships, training ships, test ships, torpedo recovery boats, dispatch boats, aviso, fishery protection ships, survey ships, harbor defense boats, target ships and their radio control vessels, motor explosive boats, weather ships, tankers, colliers, tenders, supply ships, tugs, barges, icebreakers, hospital and accommodation ships, floating cranes and docks, and many others. The \"Kriegsmarine\" employed hundreds of auxiliary \"Vorpostenboote\" during the war, mostly civilian ships that were drafted and fitted with military equipment, for use in coastal operations.\nSubmarines.\nThe Submarine Arm of the \"Kriegsmarine\" was titled the \"U-bootwaffe\" (\"submarine force\"). At the outbreak of war, it had a fleet of 57 submarines. This was increased steadily until mid-1943, when losses from Allied counter-measures matched the new vessels launched.\nThe principal types were the Type IX, a long range type used in the western and southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans; the Type VII, the most numerous type, used principally in the north Atlantic; and the small Type II, for coastal waters. Type X was a small class of minelayers and Type XIV was a specialised type used to support distant U-boat operations \u2013 the \"\"Milchkuh\" (Milkcow).\nTypes XXI and XXIII, the \"Elektroboot\"\", could have negated much of the Allied anti-submarine tactics and technology, but only a few of this new type of U-boat became ready for combat at the end of the war. Post-war, they became the prototype for modern conventional submarines, such as the Soviet .\nDuring World War II, about 60% of all U-boats commissioned were lost in action; 28,000 of the 40,000 U-boat crewmen were killed during the war and 8,000 were captured. The remaining U-boats were either surrendered to the Allies or scuttled by their own crews at the end of the war.\nCaptured ships.\nThe military campaigns in Europe yielded a large number of captured vessels, many of which were under construction. Nations represented included Austria (riverine craft), Czechoslovakia (riverine craft), Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States (several landing craft), and Italy (after the armistice). Few of the incomplete ships of destroyer size or above were completed, but many smaller warships and auxiliaries were completed and commissioned into \"Kriegsmarine\" during the war. Additionally many captured or confiscated foreign civilian ships (merchantmen, fishing boats, tugboats etc.) were converted into auxiliary warships or support ships.\nMajor enemy warships sunk or destroyed.\nOn 3 September 1939, during the early days of the invasion of Poland, the Polish destroyer of the Polish Navy, was sunk by German Ju 87 dive bombers belonging to Tr\u00e4gergeschwader 186\u2014a \"Luftwaffe\" unit established for naval aviation and intended for deployment aboard the aircraft carrier \"Graf Zeppelin\". However, as the \"Graf Zeppelin\" was not operational and never saw combat, these aircraft conducted their attacks from land-based airfields under Kriegsmarine direction.\nOrganisation.\nCommand structure.\nAdolf Hitler was the Supreme Commander of all German forces, including the \"Kriegsmarine\". His authority was exercised through the \"Oberkommando der Marine\" (OKM) with a Commander-in-Chief (\"Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine\"), a Chief of Naval General Staff (\"Chef des Stabes der Seekriegsleitung\"), and a Chief of Naval Operations (\"Chef der Operationsabteilung\"). The first Commander-in-Chief of the OKM was Erich Raeder who was the Commander-in-Chief of the \"Reichsmarine\" when it was renamed and reorganised in 1935. Raeder held the post until falling out with Hitler after the German failure in the Battle of the Barents Sea. He was replaced by Karl D\u00f6nitz on 30 January 1943 who held the command until he was appointed President of Germany upon Hitler's suicide in April 1945. Hans-Georg von Friedeburg was then Commander-in-Chief of the OKM for the short period of time until Germany surrendered in May 1945.\nSubordinate to these were regional, squadron, and temporary flotilla commands. Regional commands covered significant naval regions and were themselves sub-divided, as necessary. They were commanded by a \"Generaladmiral\" or an Admiral. There was a \"Marineoberkommando\" for the Baltic Fleet, \"Nord\", \"Nordsee\", \"Norwegen\", \"Ost/Ostsee\" (formerly Baltic), \"S\u00fcd\", and \"West\". The \"Kriegsmarine\" used a form of encoding called \"Gradnetzmeldeverfahren\" to denote regions on a map.\nEach squadron (organised by type of ship) also had a command structure with its own Flag Officer. The commands were Battleships, Cruisers, Destroyers, Submarines (\"F\u00fchrer der Unterseeboote\"), Torpedo Boats, Minesweepers, Reconnaissance Forces, Naval Security Forces, Big Guns and Hand Guns, and Midget Weapons.\nMajor naval operations were commanded by a \"Flottenchef\". The \"Flottenchef\" controlled a flotilla and organized its actions during the operation. The commands were, by their nature, temporary.\nThe \"Kriegsmarine\"'s ship design bureau, known as the \"Marineamt\", was administered by officers with experience in sea duty but not in ship design, while the naval architects who did the actual design work had only a theoretical understanding of design requirements. As a result, the German surface fleet was plagued by design flaws throughout the war.\nCommunication was undertaken using an eight-rotor system of Enigma encoding.\nAir units.\nThe \"Luftwaffe\" had a near-complete monopoly on all German military aviation, including naval aviation, a source of great interservice rivalry with the \"Kriegsmarine\". Catapult-launched spotter planes like Arado Ar 196 twin-float seaplanes were manned by the so-called \"Bordfliegergruppe 196\" (shipboard flying group 196). \"Tr\u00e4gergeschwader 186\" (Carrier Air Wing 186) operated two \"Gruppen\" (\"Tr\u00e4gergruppe I/186\" and \"Tr\u00e4gergruppe II/186\") equipped with navalized Messerschmitt Bf 109T and Junkers Ju 87C Stuka; these units were intended to serve aboard the aircraft carrier which was never completed, yet provided the \"Kriegsmarine\" with some air-power from bases on land. Five coastal groups (\"K\u00fcstenfliegergruppen\") with reconnaissance aircraft, torpedo bombers, \"Minensuch\" aerial minesweepers, and air-sea rescue seaplanes supported the \"Kriegsmarine\", although with lesser resources as the war progressed.\nCoastal artillery, flak and radar units.\nThe coastal batteries of the \"Kriegsmarine\" were stationed on the German coasts. With the conquering and occupation of other countries coastal artillery was stationed along the coasts of these countries, especially in France and Norway as part of the Atlantic Wall. Naval bases were protected by flak-batteries of the \"Kriegsmarine\" against enemy air raids. The \"Kriegsmarine\" also manned the \"Seetakt\" sea radars on the coasts.\nMarines.\nAt the beginning of World War II, on 1 September 1939, the \"Marinesto\u00dftruppkompanie\" (Naval Shock Troop Company) landed in Danzig from the old battleship for conquering a Polish bastion at Westerplatte. A reinforced platoon of the \"Marine Sto\u00dftrupp Kompanie\" landed with soldiers of the German Army from destroyers on 9 April 1940 in Narvik. In June 1940 the \"Marine Sto\u00dftrupp Abteilung\" (Marine Attack Troop Battalion) was flown in from France to the Channel Islands to occupy this British territory.\nIn September 1944 amphibious units unsuccessfully tried to capture the strategic island Suursaari in the Gulf of Finland from Germany's former ally Finland (Operation Tanne Ost).\nWith the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 and the Soviet advance from the summer of 1944 the \"Kriegsmarine\" started to form regiments and divisions for the battles on land with superfluous personnel. With the loss of naval bases because of the Allied advance more and more navy personnel were available for the ground troops of the \"Kriegsmarine\". About 40 regiments were raised and from January 1945 on six divisions. Half of the regiments were absorbed by the divisions.\nRanks and uniforms.\nMany different types of uniforms were worn by the \"Kriegsmarine\"; here is a list of the main ones:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17387", "revid": "11570102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17387", "title": "Knights of Labor", "text": "US-based labor federation\nThe Knights of Labor (K of L), officially the Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor, was the largest American labor movement of the 19th century, claiming for a time nearly one million members. It operated in the United States as well in Canada, and had chapters also in Great Britain and Australia. Its most important leader was Terence V. Powderly. The Knights of Labor promoted the social and cultural uplift of the worker, and demanded the eight-hour day. In some cases it acted as a labor union, negotiating with employers, but it was never well organized or funded. It was notable in its ambition to organize across lines of gender and race and in the inclusion of both skilled and unskilled labor. It grouped all workers, regardless of occupation, into a single body. After a rapid expansion in the mid-1880s, it suddenly lost its new members and succumbed to a jurisdictional battle with the new American Federation of Labor. The Knights of Labor had served as the first mass organization of the working class in the United States.\nFounded by Uriah Stephens on December 28, 1869, the Knights of Labor reached 28,000 members in 1880, and 100,000 in 1884. By 1886, it had nearly 800,000 members: 20% of all workers. Its frail organizational structure could not cope as charges of failure, violence, allegations, and backlash following the 1886 Haymarket Square riot battered it. Most members abandoned the movement in 1886\u20131887, leaving at most 100,000 members in 1890. Many opted to join groups that helped to identify their specific needs instead of the KOL which addressed many different types of issues. The Panic of 1893, the largest economic depression in US history at the time, ended the Knights of Labor's importance. While their national headquarters closed in 1917, remnants of the Knights of Labor survived until 1949, when the group's last 50-member local dropped its affiliation.\nOrigins.\nIn 1869, Uriah Smith Stephens, James L. Wright, and a small group of Philadelphia tailors founded a secret organization known as the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor. The collapse of the National Labor Union in 1873 left a vacuum for workers looking for organization. The Knights became better organized with a national vision when, in 1879, they replaced Stephens with Terence V. Powderly, who was just 30 years old at the time. The body became popular with trade unions and Pennsylvania coal miners during the economic depression of the mid-1870s, then it grew rapidly. The KOL was a diverse industrial union open to all workers. The leaders felt that it was best to have a versatile population in order to get points of view from all aspects. The Knights of Labor barred five groups from membership: bankers, land speculators, lawyers, liquor dealers and gamblers. Its members included low skilled workers, railroad workers, immigrants, and steel workers. This helped the workers to get an organizational identity. As one of the largest labor organizations in the nineteenth century, Knights wanted to classify the workers, as it was a time where large scale factories and industries were rapidly growing. Even though skilled workers were prioritized at the beginning 1880s, by the time of 1886, nearly a million workers were enrolled.\nAs membership expanded, the Knights began to function more as a labor union and less as a secret organization. During the 1880s, the Knights of Labor played a massive role in independent and third-party movements. Local assemblies began to emphasize cooperative enterprises and initiate strikes to win concessions from employers. The Knights of Labor brought together workers of different religions, races, and genders and helped them all create a bond and unify all for the exact cause. The new leader, Powderly, opposed strikes as a \"relic of barbarism\", but the size and the diversity of the Knights afforded local assemblies a great deal of autonomy.\u00a0 \u00a0\nIn 1882, the Knights ended their membership rituals and removed the words \"Noble Order\" from their name. This was intended to mollify the concerns of Catholic members and the bishops who wanted to avoid any resemblance to freemasonry. Though initially averse to strikes to advance their goals, the Knights did aid various strikes and boycotts. The Wabash Railroad strike in 1885 became successful thanks to the support of the railroad brotherhoods and communities along the railroad. The railroad communities were also able to successfully strike against one of the railroad financiers, Jay Gould. The strike included stopping track, yard, engine maintenance, the control or sabotage of equipment, and the occupation of shops and roundhouses. Gould met with Powderly and told him any strike that is against the Texas and Pacific would be considered as a contest between his order and the laws of land. This gave momentum to the Knights and membership surged. By 1886, the Knights had more than 700,000 members.\nThe Knights' primary demand was for the eight-hour workday. They also called for legislation to end child and convict labor as well as a graduated income tax. They also supported cooperatives. The only woman to hold office in the Knights of Labor, Leonora Barry, worked as an investigator. She described the horrific conditions in factories employing women and children. These reports made Barry the first person to collect national statistics on the American working woman.\nPowderly and the Knights tried to avoid divisive political issues, but in the early 1880s, many Knights had become followers of Henry George's ideology known now as Georgism. In 1883, Powderly officially recommended George's book and announced his support of \"single tax\" on land values. During the New York mayoral election of 1886, Powderly was able to successfully push the organization towards the favor of Henry George. In 1886, the Knights became of the part of the short lived United Labor Party, an alliance of labor organizations formed in support of George's campaign in the 1886 New York City mayoral election.\nThe Knights of Labor helped to bring together many different types of people from all walks of life; for example, Catholic and Protestant Irish-born workers. The KOL appealed to them because they worked very closely with the Irish Land League. The Knights had a mixed record on inclusiveness and exclusiveness. They accepted women and African Americans (after 1878) and their employers as members and advocated the admission of blacks into local assemblies. However, the organization tolerated the segregation of assemblies in the South. Bankers, doctors, lawyers, stockholders, and liquor manufacturers were excluded because they were considered unproductive members of society. Asians were also excluded, and in November 1885, a branch of the Knights in Tacoma, Washington violently expelled the city's Chinese workers, who amounted to nearly a tenth of the overall city population at the time. Black membership stood at 60,000 in 1886, and there were 400 all-black locals, primarily in the south.\nThe Union Pacific Railroad came into conflict with the Knights. When the Knights in Wyoming refused to work more hours in 1885, the railroad hired Chinese workers as strikebreakers and to stir up racial animosity. The result was the Rock Springs massacre, that killed scores of Chinese workers, and drove the rest out of Wyoming. About 50 African-American sugar-cane laborers organized by the Knights went on strike and were murdered by strikebreakers in the 1887 Thibodaux massacre in Louisiana. The Knights strongly supported passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Contract Labor Law of 1885, as did many other labor groups, demonstrating the limits of their commitment to solidarity. While they claimed to not be \"against immigration\", their anti-Asian racism demonstrated the limits and inconsistency of their anti-racist platform.\nGeography.\nNearly 12,000 Knights Assemblies (11,957) have been identified and mapped by historian Jonathan Garland. They were located in more than 5,600 cities and towns across every state and territory of the United States, with others in Canada, Great Britain, and Australia. In the peak year, 1886, the Knights reported 729,677 members in 5,892 Local Assemblies. But Garland explains that \"this was actually an undercount. The organization had trouble keeping track of local assemblies and membership in the midst of this growth period.\" The actual membership approached one million.\nIn the first decade, 1869\u20131879, the organization was concentrated in coal mining towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Illinois. But in the early 1880s, craft assemblies and mixed assemblies appeared in big cities and small towns across the Midwest, then after 1885 the movement surged into the South and through the mining and railroad towns of the West.\nDemands.\nThe Knights aimed to educate and uplift workers and negotiate salaries and contracts with employers. The Knights had a few primary demands that they wanted to see established. For one, they wanted the workers to see a proper share of the wealth that they created; in other words, they tried to diminish or at least decrease the wage gap. They wanted to educate workers, create cooperative institutions, and enact labor laws such as child labor laws. The Knights also wanted to make sure that workers were protected and that their workplace was improved. The 8-hour workday was something that became very important to the Knights.\nMovements in Arkansas.\nIn 1882 the Knight of Labor made their way into Arkansas, and by 1887 they gained over 5000 members. There were two main strikes that took place in Arkansas, the Great Southwest Railroad Strike, which took place across the whole country, and a strike that took place on a Plantation in Pulaski County, near Little Rock. The strike began from forty farmhands demanding higher wages, and living conditions. Ultimately the strike was not successful, but it sparked a tradition of protests across the state. After the failed strike the Knights of Labor worked closely with agricultural organizations to try and push for political change.\nDecline.\nThe Knights of Labor's meteoric rise in membership was quickly followed by a sharp decline. While there are various reasons for this decline, there are three main things it can be attributed too. First, the Knights of Labor was too broad and altruistic. Many of the new members joined the Knights expecting their own interests to be addressed. The organization's declaration that \"an injury to one is the concern of all\" was too widespread for a majority of members, especially those who joined for more concrete reasons. Second, the Knights of Labor did not have enough funds to sustain movement. Initiation fees and membership dues for the organization were very low. This practice led to insufficient funds for strikes and member benefits. Third, the leadership of the Knights often ignored, and sometimes worked against, the interests of their members. Much of this disconnect stemmed from Grand Master Workman of the Order Terence V. Powderly. He ordered 20,000 meat packers stop their strike even though they were nearing victory and also stated that he had \"more friends outside the labor organizations than in them.\" Furthermore, any smaller Knights of Labor chapter or labor paper that dared to criticize the Order's leadership would face the might of the Order. They expelled thousands of members from the Knights and called for boycotts of critical papers. All together these factors led to members losing faith in and subsequently leaving the organization. In addition to these, there were smaller events and tensions that weakened the Knights, namely: the Great Southwest railroad strike of 1886, tensions between skilled and unskilled workers, and disapproval of the Catholic Church.\nSouthwest railroad strike of 1886.\nThe Great Southwest railroad strike of 1886 was a Knights strike involving more than 200,000 workers. Beginning on March 1, 1886, railroad workers in five states struck against the Union Pacific and Missouri Pacific railroads, owned by Jay Gould. At least ten people were killed. The unravelling of the strike within two months led directly to the collapse of the Knights of Labor and the formation of the American Federation of Labor.\nIn 1886, following their peak, they started to lose more members to the American Federation of Labor. The Knights of Labor's fall is believed to have been due to their lack of adaptability and beliefs in old-style industrial capitalism. Another large reason for their decline was the tension between skilled craftsmen and unskilled workers. \u00a0\nUnskilled vs. Skilled Workers.\nScholars pit the skilled and unskilled workers as another reason for the Knights of Labor's downfall. The Union worked for both groups, but since the results of the union efforts often benefited one or the other and not both, the tension persisted. Unskilled workers often benefited from equal opportunities. Skilled workers would become upset when someone took their jobs with less skill. Skilled workers benefit from better pay, but many unskilled workers do not receive those benefits. This tension discouraged new members and lead existing ones to leave the Knights of Labor and ultimately caused many members to leave.\nCatholic Church.\nThe Knights of Labor attracted many Catholics, who were a large part of the membership, perhaps a majority. Powderly was also a Catholic. However, the Knights' use of secrecy, similar to the Masons, during its early years concerned many bishops of the Church. The Knights used secrecy and deception to help prevent employers from firing members.\nAfter the Archbishop of Quebec condemned the Knights in 1884, twelve American archbishops voted 10 to 2 against doing likewise in the United States. Furthermore, Cardinal James Gibbons and Bishop John Ireland defended the Knights. Gibbons went to the Vatican to talk to the hierarchy.\u00a0\nLegacy.\nLabor Protest Songs.\nThough often overlooked, the Knights of Labor contributed to the tradition of labor protest songs in America. The Knights frequently included music in their regular meetings, and encouraged local members to write and perform their work. In Chicago, James and Emily Talmadge, printers and supporters of the Knights of Labor, published the songbook \"Labor Songs Dedicated to the Knights of Labor\" (1885). The song \"Hold the Fort\" [also \"Storm the Fort\"], a Knights of Labor pro-labor revision of the hymn by the same name, became the most popular labor song prior to Ralph Chaplin's IWW (Industrial Workers of the World) anthem \"Solidarity Forever\". Pete Seeger often performed this song and it appears on a number of his recordings. Songwriter and labor singer Bucky Halker includes the Talmadge version, entitled \"Our Battle Song,\" on his CD \"Don't Want Your Millions\" (Revolting Records 2000). Halker also draws heavily on the Knights songs and poems in his book on labor song and poetry, \"For Democracy, Workers and God: Labor Song-Poems and Labor Protest, 1865-1895\" (University of Illinois Press, 1991).\nRacism and wages.\nThe Knights of Labor supported the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, claiming industrialists were using Chinese workers as a wedge to keep wages low. In addition to supporting legislation including the Exclusion Act and the 1885 Alien Contract Labor Law, the Knights of Labor continued their agenda through racially motivated attacks on Chinese workers and their property.\nChinese workers were one of the only groups excluded from the Knights of Labor, even if immigrants from non-Western Europe were considered to be second-class citizens at this time. Alexander Saxton wrote \u201conly at accepting Chinese did the Knights generally draw the line.\u201d The Knights of Labor consistently made efforts towards many problems in the workforce but often left out any advances that would benefit the Chinese communities. \nAnti-Chinese rhetoric and violence were more prevalent among the western chapters of the Knights. In 1880, San Francisco Knights wrote, \"They bear the semblance of men, but live like beasts...who eat rice and the offal of the slaughterhouse.\" The article also calls Chinese \"natural thieves\" and states that all Chinese women are prostitutes. In March 1882, Knights joined the San Francisco rally to demand expulsion of the Chinese. Several years later, mobs led by the Knights of Labor rounded up Seattle's Chinese-born workers and campaigned to prevent further immigration.\nHistorian Catharine Collomp notes that \"Chinese exclusion was the only issue about which the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor constantly lobbied the federal government.\"\nHaymarket Square Riots.\nThe American labor movement, including those in the Knights of Labor, rallied for an eight-hour workday, protesting with the slogan: \"Eight Hours for Work, Eight Hours for Rest, Eight Hours for What We Will.\" Through Eight Hour rallies and legislative lobbying, labor leaders came into direct conflict with employers, who neither accepted unions nor believed that governments should intervene on workers' behalf. During an Eight Hour campaign in Chicago in 1886, a conflict between organized laborers and employers turned violent. By the mid-1880s, Chicago was the center of immigrant and working-class organizing, with a wide array of labor organizations. Demands for the eight-hour workday were at the heart of a strike against one of Chicago's most powerful employers, the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, which refused to bargain with the union.\nWhile workingmen had gathered to strike against the plant, some had drawn fire from authorities. City police and private guards had injured and killed some of the strikers, prompting reaction from the larger crowd, including anarchists Albert Parsons, Michael Schwab, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, and labor organizer Oscar Neebe. On May 4, they organized a protest in Chicago's Haymarket Square. After the main speakers, Parson and Spies, left the platform, someone from the crowd threw a bomb into a group of police standing in the square, which left seven police dead, and sixty protesters from the crowd injured. Afterwards, the eight anarchists were arrested and seven of them were sentenced to death in a trial that focused on political beliefs, not the actions of the anarchists. Two of the condemned had their sentences commuted; but after Louis Lingg committed suicide in prison, the remaining four were executed.\nThe Haymarket trial led to a nationwide campaign to round up anarchists and a steep decline in the Knights of Labor's membership. Terence Powderly, the Knights' president, disavowed the Haymarket eight, even as local trade unions and Knights assemblies around the country protested the arrests. Rapid growth of the Knights of Labor in the late nineteenth weakened the bonds that held it together. New Knights members had joined the organization in the wake of its victories over southwestern railroads, but without fully understanding or accepting the Knights' movement culture. While it would be over a decade before the Knights disbanded, these organizational weaknesses, and the strength of the new trade federation union, led to the Knights' decline.\n1878: Uriah Smith Stephens\n1879: Terence V.

In its best-known form, it is a green, crystalline material originating from Superman's home world of Krypton that emits a unique, poisonous radiation that can weaken and even kill Kryptonians. Kryptonite radiation can be transmitted through any element except lead. There are other varieties, such as red kryptonite and gold kryptonite, which have different but still generally negative effects.\nAdversaries of Superman and other characters are frequently depicted using kryptonite against Superman, with Lex Luthor incorporating it into weapons, Metallo being powered by it, and Titano able to project its radiation from his eyes. Kryptonite has become a byword for an extraordinary exploitable weakness, synonymous with \"Achilles' heel\".\nHistory.\nAn unpublished 1940 story titled \"The K-Metal from Krypton\", written by Superman creator Jerry Siegel, featured a prototype of kryptonite. It is a mineral from the planet Krypton that drains Superman of his strength and gives superhuman powers to humans. This story was rejected because Superman reveals his identity to Lois Lane.\nThe mineral kryptonite, not to be confused with the real element krypton, was officially introduced in the radio serial \"The Adventures of Superman\", in the story \"The Meteor from Krypton\", broadcast in June 1943. An apocryphal story claims that kryptonite was introduced to give Superman's voice actor Bud Collyer time off. This tale was recounted by Julius Schwartz in his memoir. However, historian Michael J. Hayde disputes this. In \"The Meteor from Krypton\", Superman is never exposed to kryptonite. If kryptonite allowed Collyer to take vacations, that was a fringe benefit discovered later. More likely, kryptonite was introduced as a plot device for Superman to discover his origin. On the other hand, Hayde might have mistaken 1943's \"The Meteor from Krypton\" for 1945's \"The Meteor of Kryptonite\", as Superman was exposed in the latter but not in the former.\nIn the radio serial, Krypton is located in the same solar system as Earth, in the same orbit, but on the opposite side of the Sun. This provided an easy explanation for how kryptonite found its way to Earth. In the comics' Silver Age, which places Krypton in a distant solar system, much of the kryptonite that came to Earth was transported by the same \"space warp\" that baby Kal-El's rocket traversed.\nKryptonite was incorporated into the comic mythos with \"Superman\" #61 (November 1949). In a 1993 interview with \"Florida Today\", editor Dorothy Woolfolk stated that she felt Superman's invulnerability was \"boring\".\nOriginally depicted as an element in the Golden, Silver, and Bronze Age comics, Kryptonite is depicted as a compound in post-\"Crisis\" continuity.\nVarieties.\nVarious forms of the fictional material have been created over the years in \"Superman\" publications and programs. This table includes forms that have not persisted in canon. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17391", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17391", "title": "Kosovo", "text": "Country in Southeast Europe\nKosovo, officially the Republic of Kosovo, is a landlocked country in Southeast Europe with partial diplomatic recognition. It is bordered by Albania to the southwest, Montenegro to the west, Serbia to the north and east, and North Macedonia to the southeast. It covers an area of and has a population of nearly 1.6 million, of whom the vast majority (approximately 92 per cent) are ethnic Albanians. Kosovo has a varied terrain, with high plains along with rolling hills and mountains, some of which have an altitude over . Its climate is mainly continental with some Mediterranean and Alpine influences. Kosovo's capital and most populous city is Pristina; other major cities and urban areas include Prizren, Ferizaj, Gjilan, and Peja.\nKosovo formed the core territory of the Dardani, an Illyrian people, attested in classical sources from the 4th century BCE. The Dardani established the Kingdom of Dardania, with its political and cultural center likely located near present-day Lipjan (ancient Ulpiana). The kingdom was incorporated into the Roman Empire in the 1st century BCE; later, in the 3rd century CE, it was transformed into a separate Roman province. During the Byzantine period, the region was eventually organised as part of the Theme of Dardania and remained under imperial control, facing Slavic migrations in the 6th and 7th centuries CE. Control shifted between the Byzantines and the First Bulgarian Empire. In the 13th century, Kosovo became integral to the Serbian medieval state and the establishment of the Serbian Patriarchate. Ottoman expansion in the Balkans in the late 14th and 15th centuries led to the decline and fall of the Serbian Empire; the Battle of Kosovo of 1389, in which a Serbian-led coalition of various ethnicities fought against the Ottoman Empire, is considered one of the defining moments.\nVarious dynasties, mainly the Brankovi\u0107, governed Kosovo for much of the period after the battle. The Ottoman Empire fully conquered Kosovo after the Second Battle of Kosovo, ruling for nearly five centuries until 1912. Kosovo was the centre of the Albanian Renaissance and experienced the Albanian revolts of 1910 and 1912. After the Balkan Wars (1912\u20131913), it was ceded to the Kingdom of Serbia, and after World War II, it became an Autonomous Province within Yugoslavia. Tensions between Kosovo's Albanian and Serb communities simmered during the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, culminating in the Kosovo War of 1998 and 1999, which resulted in the Yugoslav army's withdrawal and the establishment of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.\nKosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 and has since gained diplomatic recognition by at least 109 member states of the United Nations. Serbia does not officially recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state and continues to claim it as its constituent Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija; however, it accepts the governing authority of the Kosovo institutions as part of the 2013 Brussels Agreement.\nKosovo is a developing country with an upper-middle-income economy. It has experienced solid economic growth over the last decade, as measured by international financial institutions, since the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. Kosovo is a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Venice Commission, and the International Olympic Committee, and has applied for membership in the Council of Europe, UNESCO, and Interpol, as well as observer status in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. In December 2022, Kosovo filed a formal application to become a member of the European Union.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Kosovo\" is of South Slavic origin. () is the Serbian neuter possessive adjective of (), 'blackbird', an ellipsis for , 'Blackbird Field', the name of a karst field situated in the eastern half of today's Kosovo and the site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Field. In the Middle Ages, territory to the west of Kosovo was known as 'Metohija' because large portions of land were owned by Serbian Orthodox monasteries and the Mount Athos. The name of the karst field was applied to a wider area for the first time when the Ottoman Vilayet of Kosovo was created in 1877.\nThe entire territory that corresponds to today's country is commonly referred to in English simply as \"Kosovo\" and in Albanian as (definite form) or (indefinite form, ). In Serbia, a formal distinction is made between the eastern and western parts of the country; the term () is used for the eastern part of Kosovo centred on the historical Kosovo Field, while the western part of the territory of Kosovo is called \"Metohija\" (). Thus, in Serbian, the entire area of Kosovo is referred to as \"Kosovo and Metohija\".\nAn alternative name for Western Kosovo is Dukagjini or Dukagjini plateau (), having been in use since the 15th\u201316th century as part of the Sanjak of Dukakin with its capital Peja, and is named after the medieval Albanian Dukagjini family.\nModern usage.\nSome Albanians also prefer to refer to Kosovo as \"Dardania\", the name of an ancient kingdom and later Roman province which covered the territory of modern-day Kosovo. The name is derived from the ancient tribe of the \"Dardani\", which is considered to be related to the Proto-Albanian term \"dard\u0101\", which means \"pear\" (Modern Albanian: ). The former Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova was an enthusiastic backer of a \"Dardanian\" identity, and the Kosovar presidential flag and seal refer to this national identity. However, the name \"Kosova\" remains more widely used among the Albanian population. The flag of Dardania remains in use as the official Presidential seal and standard and is heavily featured in the institution of the presidency of the country.\nThe official conventional long name, as defined by the constitution, is \"Republic of Kosovo\". Additionally, as a result of an arrangement agreed between Pristina and Belgrade in talks mediated by the European Union, Kosovo has participated in some international forums and organisations under the title \"Kosovo*\" with a footnote stating, \"This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.\" This arrangement, which has been dubbed the \"asterisk agreement\", was agreed in an 11-point arrangement on 24 February 2012.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nThe strategic position including the abundant natural resources were favourable for the development of human settlements in Kosovo, as is highlighted by the hundreds of archaeological sites identified throughout its territory.\nSince 2000, the increase in archaeological expeditions has revealed many previously unknown sites. The earliest documented traces in Kosovo are associated to the Stone Age; namely, indications that cave dwellings might have existed, such as Radivojce Cave near the source of the Drin River, Grn\u010dar Cave in Viti municipality and the Dema and Karamakaz Caves in the municipality of Peja.\nThe earliest archaeological evidence of organised settlement in Kosovo belongs to the Neolithic Star\u010devo and Vin\u010da cultures. Vlashnj\u00eb and Runik are important sites of the Neolithic era with the rock art paintings at Mrrizi i Kobaj\u00ebs near Vlashnj\u00eb being the first find of prehistoric art in Kosovo. Amongst the finds of excavations in Neolithic Runik is a baked-clay ocarina, which is the first musical instrument recorded in Kosovo.\nThe first archaeological expedition in Kosovo was organised by the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I in the Illyrian tumuli burial grounds of Nep\u00ebrbishti within the district of Prizren.\nThe beginning of the Bronze Age coincides with the presence of tumuli burial grounds in western Kosovo, like the site of Romaj\u00eb.\nThe Dardani were the most important Paleo-Balkan tribe in the region of Kosovo. A wide area which consists of Kosovo, parts of Northern Macedonia and eastern Serbia was named Dardania after them in classical antiquity, reaching to the Thraco-Illyrian contact zone in the east. In archaeological research, Illyrian names are predominant in western Dardania, while Thracian names are mostly found in eastern Dardania.\nThracian names are absent in western Dardania, while some Illyrian names appear in the eastern parts. Thus, their identification as either an Illyrian or Thracian tribe has been a subject of debate, the ethnolinguistic relationship between the two groups being largely uncertain and debated itself as well. The correspondence of Illyrian names, including those of the ruling elite, in Dardania with those of the southern Illyrians suggests a thracianisation of parts of Dardania. The Dardani retained an individuality and continued to maintain social independence after Roman conquest, playing an important role in the formation of new groupings in the Roman era.\nRoman period.\nDuring Roman rule, Kosovo was part of two provinces, with its western region in Praevalitana and the vast majority of its modern territory belonging to Dardania. Praevalitana and the rest of Illyria was conquered by the Roman Republic in 168 BC. On the other hand, Dardania maintained its independence until the year 28 BC, when the Romans, under Augustus, annexed it into their Republic. Dardania eventually became a part of the Moesia province. During the reign of Diocletian, Dardania became a full Roman province and the entirety of Kosovo's modern territory became a part of the Diocese of Moesia, and then during the second half of the 4th century, it became part of the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.\nDuring Roman rule, a series of settlements developed in the area, mainly close to mines and to the major roads. The most important of the settlements was Ulpiana, which is located near modern-day Gra\u010danica. It was established in the 1st century AD, possibly developing from a concentrated Dardanian oppidum, and then was upgraded to the status of a Roman municipium at the beginning of the 2nd century during the rule of Trajan. Ulpiana became especially important during the rule of Justinian I, after the Emperor rebuilt the city after it had been destroyed by an earthquake and renamed it to \"Iustinianna Secunda\".\nOther important towns that developed in the area during Roman rule were Vendenis, located in modern-day Podujev\u00eb; Viciana, possibly near Vushtrri; and Municipium Dardanorum, an important mining town in Leposavi\u0107. Other archeological sites include \u00c7ifllak in Western Kosovo, Dresnik in Klina, Pestova in Vushtrri, V\u00ebrban in Viti, Poslishte between V\u00ebrmica and Prizren, Paldenica near Hani i Elezit, as well as Nerodim\u00eb e Poshtme and Nikadin near Ferizaj. The one thing all the settlements have in common is that they are located either near roads, such as Via Lissus-Naissus, or near the mines of North Kosovo and eastern Kosovo. Most of the settlements are archaeological sites that have been discovered recently and are being excavated.\nIt is also known that the region was Christianised during Roman rule, though little is known regarding Christianity in the Balkans in the three first centuries AD. The first clear mention of Christians in literature is the case of Bishop Dacus of Macedonia, from Dardania, who was present at the First Council of Nicaea (325). It is also known that Dardania had a Diocese in the 4th century, and its seat was placed in Ulpiana, which remained the episcopal centre of Dardania until the establishment of Justiniana Prima in 535 AD. The first known bishop of Ulpiana is Machedonius, who was a member of the council of Serdika. Other known bishops were Paulus (synod of Constantinople in 553 AD), and Gregentius, who was sent by Justin I to Ethiopia and Yemen to ease problems among different Christian groups there.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn the next centuries, Kosovo was a frontier province of the Roman, and later Byzantine Empire, and as a result it changed hands frequently. The region was exposed to an increasing number of raids from the 4th century CE onward, culminating with the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries. Toponymic evidence suggests that Albanian was probably spoken in Kosovo prior to the Slavic settlement of the region. The overwhelming presence of towns and municipalities in Kosovo with Slavic in their toponymy suggests that the Slavic migrations either assimilated or drove out population groups already living in Kosovo.\nToponyms suggest that the Slav presence in Kosovo and southernmost part of the Morava Valley may have been quite weak in the first one or two centuries of Slav settlement as, unlike some other areas of the Balkans, such as Bosnia, Northern Serbia and the Dalmatian hinterlands where old toponyms were completely swept aside, the names of some important old towns and toponyms of mountains survived in the region, including Nish, Shkup, Sharr, Lipjan and Shtip. A pre-Slavic population in this territory served as a border zone between the early Serbs and Bulgarians which created a division between the Serbo-Croat language and the Bulgarian-Macedonian one. A transitional dialect, the Torlak dialect, is considered to have developed later when the Serbo-Croat speakers expanded into the region in the late medieval period and came in contact with Bulgarian speakers. The Torlak dialect is also considered to have Albanian and Romanian influence. Expansion of Slavs into the region is thought to have led to the spread of the Vlachs (Romanian and Aromanian) into other areas of the Balkans. Only in the ninth century can the expansion of a strong Slav (or quasi-Slav) power into this region be observed. The Bulgarians that pushed westwards across modern Macedonia and eastern Serbia, until by the 850's had taken over Kosovo and were pressing on the border of Serbian Principality. At the same time, southern and central Albania became settled by Bulgarian speakers too and Serb tribes were expanding into Northern Albania.\nThe First Bulgarian Empire acquired Kosovo by the mid-9th century, but Byzantine control was restored by the late 10th century. In 1072, the leaders of the Bulgarian Uprising of Georgi Voiteh traveled from their centre in Skopje to Prizren and held a meeting in which they invited Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107 of Duklja to send them assistance. Mihailo sent his son, Constantine Bodin with 300 of his soldiers. After they met, the Bulgarian magnates proclaimed him \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\". Demetrios Chomatenos is the last Byzantine archbishop of Ohrid to include Prizren in his jurisdiction until 1219. Stefan Nemanja had seized the area along the White Drin in 1185 to 1195 and the ecclesiastical split of Prizren from the Patriarchate in 1219 was the final act of establishing Nemanji\u0107 rule. Konstantin Jire\u010dek concluded, from the correspondence of archbishop Demetrios of Ohrid from 1216 to 1236, that Dardania was increasingly populated by Albanians and the expansion started from Gjakova and Prizren area, prior to the Slavic expansion.\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, Kosovo was a political, cultural and religious centre of the Serbian Kingdom. In the late 13th century, the seat of the Serbian Archbishopric was moved to Peja, and rulers centred themselves between Prizren and Skopje, during which time thousands of Christian monasteries and feudal-style forts and castles were erected, with Stefan Du\u0161an using Prizren Fortress as one of his temporary courts for a time. When the Serbian Empire fragmented into a conglomeration of principalities in 1371, Kosovo became the hereditary land of the House of Brankovi\u0107. During the late 14th and early 15th centuries, parts of Kosovo, the easternmost area located near Pristina, were part of the Principality of Dukagjini, which was later incorporated into an anti-Ottoman federation of all Albanian principalities, the League of Lezh\u00eb.\nIn 1330, Serbian king Stefan De\u010danski explicitly mentioned the presence of Albanians and the Albanian names of villages in Kosovo, in particular in the districts of Prizren and that of Skopje. A chrysobull of the Serbian Tsar Stefan Du\u0161an that was given to the Monastery of Saint Mihail and Gavril in Prizren between the years of 1348-1353 states the presence of Albanians in the vicinity of Prizren, the Dukagjin Plain and in the villages of Drenica. Within this chrysobull, nine Albanian stock-breeding villages within the vicinity of Prizren are mentioned explicitly; entire Albanian villages were gifted by Serbian kings, particularly Stefan Du\u0161an as presents to Serb monasteries within Prizren, De\u00e7an and Tetova. In one of Nemanjas charter, 170 Vlachs are mentioned in the area of Prizren. When De\u010danski founded his monastery of De\u010dani in 1330, he referred to \u2018villages and katuns of Vlachs and Albanians\u2019 in the area of the white Drin. Vlachs and Albanians had to carry salt and provide serf labour for the monastery.\nMedieval Monuments in Kosovo is a combined UNESCO World Heritage Site consisting of four Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries in De\u00e7an, Peja, Prizren and Gra\u010danica. The constructions were founded by members of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, a prominent dynasty of mediaeval Serbia.\nOttoman rule.\nIn 1389, as the Ottoman Empire expanded northwards through the Balkans, Ottoman forces under Sultan Murad I met with a Christian coalition led by Moravian Serbia under Prince Lazar in the Battle of Kosovo. Both sides suffered heavy losses and the battle was a stalemate and it was even reported as a Christian victory at first, but Serbian manpower was depleted and \"de facto\" Serbian rulers could not raise another equal force to the Ottoman army.\nDifferent parts of Kosovo were ruled directly or indirectly by the Ottomans in this early period. The medieval town of Novo Brdo was under Lazar's son, Stefan who became a loyal Ottoman vassal and instigated the downfall of Vuk Brankovi\u0107 who eventually joined the Hungarian anti-Ottoman coalition and was defeated in 1395\u201396. A small part of Vuk's land with the villages of Pristina and Vushtrri was given to his sons to hold as Ottoman vassals for a brief period.\nDuring this period, Islam was introduced to the region. The Ottomans appeared to have a more deliberate approach to converting the Roman Catholic population who were mostly Albanians (and were most of the converts to Islam) in comparison with the mostly Serbian adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy, as they viewed the former less favourably due to its allegiance to Rome, a competing regional power. Travelling Kosovo in the 1660s, Ottoman traveller Evliya Celebi included Western and Central Kosovo and the Llapi area in north-east Kosovo as part of Albania.\nIn 1690, Kosovo Albanian Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani led a revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Kosovo. Sources from 1690 refer to 20,000 Albanians in Kosovo having turned their weapons against the Turks. Following the Great Turkish War, a number of Serbs migrated northwards to Habsburg territories near the Danube and Sava rivers led by Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojevi\u0107. There were also some Christian and Muslim Albanians who departed. Afterwards, the Ottomans encouraged the migration of Albanians into Kosovo. The larger, eastern part of Kosovo remained overwhelmingly Serb Orthodox, with a Catholic Albanian, and later Muslim Albanian, presence growing from the west by the 16th century.\nRise of nationalism.\nIn the 19th century, there was an awakening of ethnic nationalism throughout the Balkans. The underlying ethnic tensions became part of a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians. The ethnic Albanian nationalism movement was centred in Kosovo. In 1878 the League of Prizren () was formed, a political organisation that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights, although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire. The League was dis-established in 1881 but enabled the awakening of a national identity among Albanians, whose ambitions competed with those of the Serbs, the Kingdom of Serbia wishing to incorporate this land that had formerly been within its empire.\nThe modern Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the expulsion of the Albanians in 1877\u20131878 from areas that became incorporated into the Principality of Serbia. During and after the Serbian\u2013Ottoman War of 1876\u201378, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the Serb army from the Sanjak of Ni\u0161 and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet. According to Austrian data, by the 1890s Kosovo was 70% Muslim (nearly entirely of Albanian descent) and less than 30% non-Muslim (primarily Serbs). In May 1901, Albanians pillaged and partially burned the cities of Novi Pazar, Sjenica and Pristina, and killed many Serbs near Pristina and in Kola\u0161in (now North Kosovo).\nIn the spring of 1912, Albanians under the lead of Hasan Prishtina revolted against the Ottoman Empire. The rebels were joined by a wave of Albanians in the Ottoman army ranks, who deserted the army, refusing to fight their own kin. The rebels defeated the Ottomans and the latter were forced to accept all fourteen demands of the rebels, which foresaw an effective autonomy for the Albanians living in the Empire. However, this autonomy never materialised, and the revolt created serious weaknesses in the Ottoman ranks, luring Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece into declaring war on the Ottoman Empire and starting the First Balkan War.\nAfter the Ottomans' defeat in the First Balkan War, the 1913 Treaty of London was signed with Metohija ceded to the Kingdom of Montenegro and eastern Kosovo ceded to the Kingdom of Serbia. During the Balkan Wars, over 100,000 Albanians left Kosovo and about 50,000 were killed in the massacres that accompanied the war. Soon, there were concerted Serbian colonisation efforts in Kosovo during various periods between Serbia's 1912 takeover of the province and World War\u00a0II, causing the population of Serbs in Kosovo to grow by about 58,000 in this period.\nSerbian authorities promoted creating new Serb settlements in Kosovo as well as the assimilation of Albanians into Serbian society, causing a mass exodus of Albanians from Kosovo. The figures of Albanians forcefully expelled from Kosovo range between 60,000 and 239,807, while Malcolm mentions 100,000\u2013120,000. In combination with the politics of extermination and expulsion, there was also a process of assimilation through religious conversion of Albanian Muslims and Albanian Catholics into the Serbian Orthodox religion which took place as early as 1912. These politics seem to have been inspired by the nationalist ideologies of Ilija Gara\u0161anin and Jovan Cviji\u0107.\nIn the winter of 1915\u201316, during World War I, Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary. In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the Central Powers out of Kosovo.\nA new administration system on 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts (oblast) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Ra\u0161ka and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the Banate of Zeta, the Banate of Morava and the Banate of Vardar. In order to change the ethnic composition of Kosovo, between 1912 and 1941 a large-scale Serbian colonisation of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia. Other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations and non-Slav nations deemed as minorities.\nAlbanians and other Muslims were forced to emigrate, mainly with the land reform which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures. In 1935 and 1938, two agreements between the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Turkey were signed on the expatriation of 240,000 Albanians to Turkey, but the expatriation did not occur due to the outbreak of World War II.\nAfter the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, and the rest was controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations. Albanian collaborators persecuted Serb and Montenegrin settlers. Estimates differ, but most authors estimate that between 3,000 and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins died in Kosovo during the Second World War. Another 30,000 to 40,000, or as high as 100,000, Serbs and Montenegrins, mainly settlers, were deported to Serbia in order to Albanianise Kosovo. A decree from Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, followed by a new law in August 1945 disallowed the return of colonists who had taken land from Albanian peasants. During the war years, some Serbs and Montenegrins were sent to concentration camps in Pristina and Mitrovica. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years. Two Serb historians also estimate that 12,000 Albanians died. An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of them Serb or Montenegrin and 2,177 Albanian. Some sources note that up to 72,000 individuals were encouraged to settle or resettle into Kosovo from Albania by the short-lived Italian administration. As the regime collapsed, this was never materialised with historians and contemporary references emphasising that a large-scale migration of Albanians from Albania to Kosovo is not recorded in Axis documents.\nCommunist Yugoslavia.\nThe existing province took shape in 1945 as the \"Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija\", with a final demarcation in 1959. Until 1945, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo in the late modern period had been the Vilayet of Kosovo, a political unit created by the Ottoman Empire in 1877. However, those borders were different.\nTensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government were significant, not only due to ethnic tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania. Harsh repressive measures were imposed on Kosovo Albanians due to suspicions that there were sympathisers of the Stalinist regime of Enver Hoxha of Albania. In 1956, a show trial in Pristina was held in which multiple Albanian Communists of Kosovo were convicted of being infiltrators from Albania and given long prison sentences. High-ranking Serbian communist official Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107 sought to secure the position of the Serbs in Kosovo and gave them dominance in Kosovo's nomenklatura.\nIslam in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and Muslim Slavs were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey. At the same time Serbs and Montenegrins dominated the government, security forces, and industrial employment in Kosovo. Albanians resented these conditions and protested against them in the late 1960s, calling the actions taken by authorities in Kosovo colonialist, and demanding that Kosovo be made a republic, or declaring support for Albania.\nAfter the ouster of Rankovi\u0107 in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a Muslim Yugoslav nationality. As a result of these reforms, there was a massive overhaul of Kosovo's nomenklatura and police, that shifted from being Serb-dominated to ethnic Albanian-dominated through firing Serbs in large scale. Further concessions were made to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo in response to unrest, including the creation of the University of Pristina as an Albanian language institution. These changes created widespread fear among Serbs that they were being made second-class citizens in Yugoslavia. By the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, Kosovo was granted major autonomy, allowing it to have its own administration, assembly, and judiciary; as well as having a membership in the collective presidency and the Yugoslav parliament, in which it held veto power.\nIn the aftermath of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the League of Prizren. Albanians felt that their status as a \"minority\" in Yugoslavia had made them second-class citizens in comparison with the \"nations\" of Yugoslavia and demanded that Kosovo be a constituent republic, alongside the other republics of Yugoslavia. Protests by Albanians in 1981 over the status of Kosovo resulted in Yugoslav territorial defence units being brought into Kosovo and a state of emergency being declared resulting in violence and the protests being crushed. In the aftermath of the 1981 protests, purges took place in the Communist Party, and rights that had been recently granted to Albanians were rescinded\u00a0\u2013 including ending the provision of Albanian professors and Albanian language textbooks in the education system.\nWhile Albanians in the region had the highest birth rates in Europe, other areas of Yugoslavia including Serbia had low birth rates. Increased urbanisation and economic development led to higher settlements of Albanian workers into Serb-majority areas, as Serbs departed in response to the economic climate for more favourable real estate conditions in Serbia. While there was tension, charges of \"genocide\" and planned harassment have been discredited as a pretext to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example, in 1986 the Serbian Orthodox Church published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'genocide'. Though these charges were disproved by police statistics, they received wide attention in the Serbian press which led to further ethnic tensions and eventual removal of Kosovo's status. \nBeginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking to make Kosovo a republic within Yugoslavia and demanding their human rights. The protests were brutally suppressed by the police and army, with many protesters arrested. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Yugoslav state authorities, resulting in a further increase in emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups. The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.\nKosovo War.\nInter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In 1989, Serbian President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population. Kosovar Albanians responded with a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience and creation of parallel structures in education, medical care, and taxation, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.\nIn July 1990, Kosovo Albanians proclaimed the existence of the Republic of Kosova, and declared it a sovereign and independent state in September 1992. In May 1992, Ibrahim Rugova was elected its president. During its lifetime, the Republic of Kosova was only officially recognised by Albania. By the mid-1990s, the Kosovo Albanian population was growing restless, as the status of Kosovo was not resolved as part of the Dayton Agreement of November 1995, which ended the Bosnian War. By 1996, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an ethnic Albanian guerrilla paramilitary group that sought the separation of Kosovo and the eventual creation of a Greater Albania, had prevailed over the Rugova's non-violent resistance movement and launched attacks against the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police in Kosovo, resulting in the Kosovo War.\nBy 1998, international pressure compelled Yugoslavia to sign a ceasefire and partially withdraw its security forces. Events were to be monitored by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observers according to an agreement negotiated by Richard Holbrooke. The ceasefire did not hold and fighting resumed in December 1998, culminating in the Ra\u010dak massacre, which attracted further international attention to the conflict. Within weeks, a multilateral international conference was convened and by March had prepared a draft agreement known as the Rambouillet Accords, calling for the restoration of autonomy for Kosovo and the deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces. The Yugoslav delegation found the terms unacceptable and refused to sign the draft. Between 24 March and 10 June 1999, NATO intervened by bombing Yugoslavia, aiming to force Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, though NATO could not appeal to any particular motion of the Security Council of the United Nations to help legitimise its intervention. Combined with continued skirmishes between Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslav forces the conflict resulted in a further massive displacement of population in Kosovo.\nDuring the conflict, between 848,000 and 863,000 ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo and an additional 590,000 were internally displaced. Some sources claim that this ethnic cleansing of Albanians was part of a plan known as Operation Horseshoe, described as \"Milosevic's final solution to the Kosovo problem\". However, the existence and implementation of this plan has not been proven.\nDuring the war, over 90,000 Serbian and other non-Albanian refugees fled the province. In September 1998, Serbian police collected 34 bodies of people believed to have been seized and murdered by the KLA, among them some ethnic Albanians, at Lake Radonji\u0107 near Glo\u0111ane (Gllogjan) in what became known as the Lake Radonji\u0107 massacre, the most serious atrocity by the KLA during the conflict. By June, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 agreed to a foreign military presence in Kosovo and the withdrawal of his troops. In the days after the Yugoslav Army withdrew, over 80,000 Serb and other non-Albanian civilians (almost half of 200,000 estimated to live in Kosovo) were expelled from Kosovo, and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse. After the Kosovo and other Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to the highest number of refugees and IDPs (including Kosovo Serbs) in Europe.\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prosecuted crimes committed during the Kosovo War. Nine senior Yugoslav officials, including Milo\u0161evi\u0107, were indicted for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed between January and June 1999. Six of the defendants were convicted, one was acquitted, one died before his trial could commence, and one (Milo\u0161evi\u0107) died before his trial could conclude. Six KLA members were charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes by the ICTY following the war, and one was convicted.\nIn total around 10,317 civilians were killed during the war, of whom 8,676 were Albanians, 1,196 Serbs and 445 Roma and others in addition to 3,218 killed members of armed formations.\nUnited Nations administration.\nOn 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorised Kosovo Force (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.\nEstimates of the number of Serbs who left when Serbian forces left Kosovo vary from 65,000 to 250,000. Within post-conflict Kosovo Albanian society, calls for retaliation for previous violence done by Serb forces during the war circulated through public culture. Widespread attacks against Serbian cultural sites commenced following the conflict and the return of hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees to their homes. In 2004, prolonged negotiations over Kosovo's future status, sociopolitical problems and nationalist sentiments resulted in the Kosovo unrest. 11 Albanians and 16 Serbs were killed, 900 people (including peacekeepers) were injured, and several houses, public buildings and churches were damaged or destroyed.\nInternational negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244. The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.\nIn February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposed 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the United States, the United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council, was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.\nRussia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians. Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.\nAfter many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a \"Troika\" consisting of negotiators from the European Union (Wolfgang Ischinger), the United States (Frank G. Wisner) and Russia (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. Despite Russian disapproval, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France appeared likely to recognise Kosovar independence. A declaration of independence by Kosovar Albanian leaders was postponed until the end of the Serbian presidential elections (4 February 2008). A significant portion of politicians in both the EU and the US had feared that a premature declaration could boost support in Serbia for the nationalist candidate, Tomislav Nikoli\u0107.\nIn November 2001, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe supervised the first elections for the Assembly of Kosovo. After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected Ibrahim Rugova as president and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as prime minister. After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in Ramush Haradinaj (AAK) becoming prime minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of president. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused that government of corruption.\nParliamentary elections were held on 17 November 2007. After early results, Hashim Tha\u00e7i who was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the Democratic Party of Kosovo, and stated his intention to declare independence. Tha\u00e7i formed a coalition with president Fatmir Sejdiu's Democratic League which was in second place with 22 per cent of the vote. The turnout at the election was particularly low. Most members of the Serb minority refused to vote.\nDeclaration of independence.\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008. As of 29 October 2025, \u00a0UN states recognised its independence, including all of its immediate neighbours, with the exception of Serbia; 10 states have subsequently withdrawn that recognition. Of the UN Security Council members, while the US, UK and France do recognise Kosovo's independence, Russia and China do not. Since declaring independence, it has become a member of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, though not of the United Nations.\nThe Serb minority of Kosovo, which largely opposed the declaration of independence, formed the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo's President Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious issue because it will not have an operative role.\nOn 8 October 2008, the UN General Assembly resolved, on a proposal by Serbia, to ask the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The advisory opinion, which is not binding over decisions by states to recognise or not recognise Kosovo, was rendered on 22 July 2010, holding that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not in violation either of general principles of international law, which do not prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, nor of specific international law \u2013 in particular UNSCR 1244\u00a0\u2013 which did not define the final status process nor reserve the outcome to a decision of the Security Council.\nSome rapprochement between the two governments took place on 19 April 2013 as both parties reached the Brussels Agreement, an agreement brokered by the EU that allowed the Serb minority in Kosovo to have its own police force and court of appeals. The agreement is yet to be ratified by either parliament. Presidents of Serbia and Kosovo organised two meetings, in Brussels on 27 February 2023 and Ohrid on 18 March 2023, to create and agree upon an 11-point agreement on implementing a European Union-backed deal to normalise ties between the two countries, which includes recognising \"each other's documents such as passports and license plates\".\nA number of protests and demonstrations took place in Kosovo between 2021 and 2023, some of which involved weapons and resulted in deaths on both sides. Amongst the injured were 30 NATO peacekeepers. The main reason behind the 2022\u201323 demonstrations ended on 1 January 2024 when each country recognised each other's vehicle registration plates.\nGeography.\nDefined in a total area of , Kosovo is landlocked and located in the centre of Southeast Europe. It lies between latitudes 42\u00b0 and 43\u00b0 N, and longitudes 20\u00b0 and 22\u00b0 E. The northernmost point is Bellob\u00ebrda at 43\u00b0 14' 06\" northern latitude; the southernmost is Restelic\u00eb at 41\u00b0 56' 40\" northern latitude; the westernmost point is Bog\u00eb at 20\u00b0 3' 23\" eastern longitude; and the easternmost point is Desivojca at 21\u00b0 44' 21\" eastern longitude. The highest point of Kosovo is Velika Rudoka at , and the lowest is where the White Drin leaves Kosovo flowing into Albania at .\nMost of the borders of Kosovo are dominated by mountainous and high terrain. The most noticeable topographical features are the Accursed Mountains and the \u0160ar Mountains. The Accursed Mountains are a geological continuation of the Dinaric Alps. The mountains run laterally through the west along the border with Albania and Montenegro. The southeast is predominantly the \u0160ar Mountains, which constitute the border with North Macedonia. Besides the mountain ranges, Kosovo's territory consists mostly of two major plains, the Kosovo Plain in the east and the Metohija Plain in the west.\nAdditionally, Kosovo consists of multiple geographic and ethnographic regions, such as Anamorava, Drenica, Dushkaja, Gollak, Has, the Highlands of Gjakova, Llap, Llapusha, Reka e Keqe, Rugova and the Baran Valley.\nKosovo's hydrological resources are relatively small; there are few lakes in Kosovo, the largest of which are Batllava, Badovc, Gazivoda, and Radoniq. In addition to these, Kosovo also does have karst springs, thermal and mineral water springs. The longest river of Kosovo is the White Drin that flows for in Kosovo but other significant rivers are Sitnica, Lepenc, Ibar, and Llapi. Sitnica, a tributary of Ibar, is the largest river lying completely within Kosovo's territory. The Nerodime River represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into the Black Sea and Aegean Sea.\nClimate.\nMost of Kosovo experiences predominantly a Continental climate with Mediterranean and Alpine influences, strongly influenced by Kosovo's proximity to the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Aegean Sea in the south as well as the European continental landmass in the north.\nThe coldest areas are in the mountainous region to the west and southeast, where an Alpine climate is prevalent. The warmest areas are mostly in the extreme southern areas close to the border with Albania, where a Mediterranean climate is the norm. Mean monthly temperature ranges between (in January) and (in July). Mean annual precipitation ranges from per year, and is well distributed year-round.\nTo the northeast, the Kosovo Plain and Ibar Valley are drier with total precipitation of about per year and more influenced by continental air masses, with colder winters and very hot summers. In the southwest, climatic area of Metohija receives more Mediterranean influences with warmer summers, somewhat higher precipitation () and heavy snowfalls in the winter. The mountainous areas of the Accursed Mountains in the west, \u0160ar Mountains on the south and Kopaonik in the north experiences alpine climate, with high precipitation ( per year), short and fresh summers, and cold winters. The average annual temperature of Kosovo is . The warmest month is July with average temperature of , and the coldest is January with . Except Prizren and Istog, all other meteorological stations in January recorded average temperatures under .\nBiodiversity.\nLocated in Southeast Europe, Kosovo has floral and faunal species from Europe and Eurasia. Forests are widespread in Kosovo and cover at least 39% of the region. Phytogeographically, it straddles the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. In addition, it falls within three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Pindus Mountains mixed forests. Kosovo's biodiversity is conserved in two national parks, eleven nature reserves and one hundred three other protected areas. The Bjeshk\u00ebt e Nemuna National Park and Sharr Mountains National Park are the most important regions of vegetation and biodiversity in Kosovo. Kosovo had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.19/10, ranking it 107th globally out of 172 countries.\nAs of 2010, there were 1,800 recorded vascular plant species, with an expected actual number of 2,500 species. The diversity is the result of the complex interaction of geology and hydrology creating a wide variety of habitat conditions for flora growth. Although, Kosovo represents only 2.3% of the entire surface area of the Balkans, in terms of vegetation it has 25% of the Balkan flora and about 18% of the European flora. The fauna is composed of a wide range of species. The mountainous west and southeast provide a great habitat for several rare or endangered species, including brown bears, lynxes, wild cats, wolves, foxes, wild goats, roebucks, and deers. A total of 255 species of birds have been recorded, with raptors such as the golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle, and lesser kestrel living principally in the mountains of Kosovo.\nEnvironmental issues.\nEnvironmental issues in Kosovo include a wide range of challenges pertaining to air and water pollution, climate change, waste management, biodiversity loss, and nature conservation. The vulnerability of the country to climate change is influenced by various factors, such as increased temperatures, geological and hydrological hazards, including droughts, flooding, fires and rains. Kosovo is not a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement. Consequently, the country is not mandated to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that are voluntary commitments outlining a nation's actions and strategies for mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts. However, since 2021, Kosovo is actively engaged in the process of formulating a voluntary NDC, with assistance provided from Japan. In 2023, the country has established a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 16.3% as part of its broader objective to achieve carbon neutrality by the year 2050.\nGovernment and politics.\nKosovo is a multi-party parliamentary representative democratic republic. It is governed by legislative, executive and judicial institutions, which derive from the constitution, although, until the Brussels Agreement, North Kosovo was in practice largely controlled by institutions of Serbia or parallel institutions funded by Serbia. Legislative functions are vested in both the Parliament and the ministers within their competencies. The Government exercises the executive power and is composed of the Prime Minister as the head of government, the Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of the various ministries.\nThe judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts, a Constitutional Court, and independent prosecutorial institutions. There also exist multiple independent institutions defined by the constitution and law, as well as local governments. All citizens are equal before the law and gender equality is ensured by the constitution. The Constitutional Framework guarantees a minimum of ten seats in the 120-member Assembly for Serbs, and ten for other minorities, and also guarantees Serbs and other minorities places in the Government.\nThe president serves as the head of state and represents the unity of the people of Kosovo, and is elected every five years by the Assembly in a secret ballot by a two-thirds majority of all deputies. The head of state is invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. The president has the power to return draft legislation to the parliament for reconsideration and has a role in foreign affairs and certain official appointments. The prime minister serves as the head of government elected by the parliament. Ministers are nominated by the prime minister, and then confirmed by the parliament. The head of government exercises executive power of the territory.\nCorruption is a major problem and an obstacle to the development of democracy in the country. Those in the judiciary appointed by the government to fight corruption are often government associates. Moreover, prominent politicians and party operatives who commit offences are not prosecuted due to the lack of laws and political will. Organised crime also poses a threat to the economy due to the practices of bribery, extortion and racketeering.\nForeign relations.\nThe foreign relations of Kosovo are conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Pristina. As of 2023[ [update]], 104 out of 193 United Nations member states recognise the Republic of Kosovo. Within the European Union, it is recognised by 22 of 27 members and is a potential candidate for the future enlargement of the European Union. On 15 December 2022 Kosovo filed a formal application to become a member of the European Union.\nKosovo is a member of several international organisations including the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, International Road and Transport Union, Regional Cooperation Council, Council of Europe Development Bank, Venice Commission, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In 2015, Kosovo's bid to become a member of UNESCO fell three votes short of the two-thirds majority required to join. 23 countries maintain embassies in Kosovo. Kosovo maintains 24 diplomatic missions and 28 consular missions abroad.\nForeign relations with Albania are unique in that both countries share the same language and culture. The Albanian language is one of the official languages of Kosovo. Albania has an embassy in the capital Pristina and Kosovo an embassy in Tirana. In 1992, Albania was the only country whose parliament voted to recognise the Republic of Kosova. Albania was also one of the first countries to officially announce its recognition of the Republic of Kosovo in February 2008.\nAs of 1 January 2024, Kosovo nationals are exempt from visa requirements for stays of up to 90 days within any 180-day period in the Schengen Area.\nMilitary.\nThe Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is the national security force of Kosovo commissioned with the task of preserving and safeguarding the country's territorial integrity, national sovereignty and the security interests of its population. Functioning under the president of Kosovo as the commander-in-chief, the security force adheres to the principle of non-discrimination, guaranteeing equal protection for its personnel regardless of gender or ethnicity. Kosovo's notable challenges are identified in the realms of persistent conflicts and societal safety and security, both of which are intertwined with the country's diplomatic ties to neighbouring countries and its domestic social and political stability.\nThe Kosovo Force (KFOR) is a NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Its operations are gradually reducing until Kosovo's Security Force, established in 2009, becomes self-sufficient. KFOR entered Kosovo on 12 June 1999, one day after the United Nations Security Council adopted the UNSC Resolution 1244. Camp Bondsteel is the operation headquarters of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo. It is located near Ferizaj in southeastern Kosovo. It is the Regional Command-East headed by the United States Army (U.S. Army) and it is supported by troops from Greece, Italy, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Turkey.\nIn 2008, under the leadership of NATO, the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) undertook preparations for the formation of the Kosovo Security Force. A significant milestone occurred in 2014 when the government officially announced its decision to establish a Ministry of Defence by 2019, with the aim of transforming the existing Kosovo Security Force into the Kosovo Armed Forces. This transformation would entail aligning the armed forces with the high standards expected of NATO members, reflecting Kosovo's aspiration to join the alliance in the future. Subsequently, in December 2018, the government enacted legislation to redefine the mandate of the Kosovo Security Force, effecting its transformation into an army. Concurrently, the establishment of a Ministry of Defence was set in motion, further solidifying these developments and ensuring the necessary infrastructure and oversight for the newly formed armed forces.\nIn 2023, the Kosovo Security Force had over 5,000 active members, using vehicles and weapons acquired from a number of NATO countries. KFOR continues to operate in Kosovo under its UN mandate.\nLaw.\nThe judicial system of Kosovo follows a civil law framework and comprises regular civil and criminal courts, alongside administrative courts. Administered by the judicial council in Pristina, the system includes the supreme court as the highest judicial authority, a constitutional court and an independent prosecutorial institution. Following the independence of Kosovo in 2008, the Kosovo Police assumed the primary law enforcement responsibilities within the country.\nCovering a broad range of issues related to the status of Kosovo, the Ahtisaari Plan introduced two forms of international supervision for Kosovo following its independence, including the International Civilian Office (ICO) and the European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo (EULEX). The ICO monitored plan implementation and possessed veto powers, while EULEX focused on developing judicial systems and had arrest and prosecution authority. These bodies were granted powers under Kosovo's declaration of independence and constitution.\nThe legal status of the ICO depended upon the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation, with oversight provided by the International Steering Group (ISG) comprising states that recognised Kosovo. Serbia and non-recognising states did not acknowledge the ICO. Despite initial opposition, EULEX gained acceptance from Serbia and the UN Security Council in 2008. It operated under the UNMIK mandate with operational independence. The ICO concluded operations in 2012 after fulfilling obligations, while EULEX continues to operate within Kosovo and international law. Its role has been extended, primarily focusing on monitoring with reduced responsibilities.\nThe Global Safety Report by Gallup, which assesses personal security worldwide through the Law and Order Index Scores for 2023, includes Kosovo among the top ten countries globally in terms of perceived safety and law enforcement effectiveness.\nAdministrative divisions.\nBased on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Kosovo is divided into seven districts (; ) or administrative regions. The districts are further subdivided into 38 municipalities (; ). The largest and most populous district of Kosovo is the District of Pristina with the capital in Pristina, having a surface area of and a population of 511,307.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the most recent census in 2024 by the Kosovo Agency of Statistics, Kosovo's population is 1,585,566. In 2023, the overall life expectancy at birth is 79.68 years; 77.38 years for males and 81.87 years for females. The estimated total fertility rate in 2023 is 1.88 children born per woman. The country is the 11th most populous country in the Southeastern Europe (Balkans) and ranks as the 152nd most populous country in the world. The country's population rose steadily over the 20th century and peaked at an estimated 2.2 million in 1998. The Kosovo War and subsequent migration have decreased the population of Kosovo over time.\nRelations between Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century. During Communism in Yugoslavia, the ethnic Albanians and Serbs were strongly irreconcilable, with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that ethnic Albanians and Serbs rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held inter-ethnic marriages. Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between ethnic Albanians and Serbs have remained common for decades. The level of intolerance and separation between both communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia, which also had tensions but held some closer relations between each other.\nDespite their planned integration into Kosovar society and their recognition in the Kosovar constitution, the Romani, Ashkali, and Egyptian communities continue to face many difficulties, such as segregation and discrimination in housing, education, health, employment and social welfare. Many camps around Kosovo continue to house thousands of internally displaced people, all of whom are from minority groups and communities. Because many of the Roma are believed to have sided with the Serbs during the conflict, taking part in the widespread looting and destruction of Albanian property, Minority Rights Group International report that Romani people encounter hostility by Albanians outside their local areas. A 2020 research report funded by the EU shows that there is a limited scale of trust and overall contact between the major ethnic groups in Kosovo.\nAccording to the World Happiness Report 2024, which evaluates the happiness levels of citizens in various countries, Kosovo is currently ranked 29th among a total of 143 nations assessed, compared with neighbours Serbia ranked 37th, Montenegro 76th, North Macedonia 84th and Albania 87th.\nEthnicity.\nKosovo is a fairly ethnically homogeneous country. In 2024, Albanians constituted around 92% of the population of Kosovo, followed by ethnic Serbs (2.3%), Bosniaks (1.7%), Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians (1.7%), Turks (1.2%), Romani (&lt;1%), and the Gorani (&lt;1%). Ethnic Serbs are concentrated in the north of the country, as well as in other municipalities in the east of the country, such as Gra\u010danica and \u0160trpce. Turks form a local majority in the municipality of Mamusha, just north of Prizren, while the Bosniaks are mainly located within Prizren itself. The Gorani are concentrated in the southernmost tip of the country, in Dragash. The Romani are spread across the entire country.\nLanguages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn Kosovo, Albanian and Serbian are the official languages at the national level, but Albanian is the predominant language in Kosovo, spoken by over 92% of the population. Its standard written form is a blend of the two main dialects, Gheg and Tosk, although the spoken form predominantly is the Gheg dialect. Turkish holds official language status in the Municipality of Prizren, regardless of the size of the Turkish-speaking population. At the municipal level, Turkish, Bosnian, and Romani may also be granted official status when a linguistic community constitutes at least 5% of the local population. This multilingual policy aims to protect the rights of minority language speakers and also promote inclusion of the communities.\nReligion.\nKosovo is a secular state with no state religion; freedom of belief, conscience and religion is explicitly guaranteed in the Constitution of Kosovo. Kosovo's society is strongly secularised and is ranked first in Southern Europe and ninth in the world as free and equal for tolerance towards religion and atheism.\nIn the 2024 census, 93.5% of the population of Kosovo were Sunni Muslims, 2.3% were Eastern Orthodox and 1.8% Roman Catholics. Additionally, 0.5% of population reported affiliation with other religions, 0.5% stated they have no religious belief, and 1.5% chose not to disclose their religious affiliation. Protestants, although recognised as a religious group in Kosovo by the government, were not represented in the census.\nIslam is the most widely practiced religion in Kosovo and was introduced in the Middle Ages by the Ottomans. Today, Kosovo has the second-highest number of Muslims as a percentage of its population in Europe after Turkey. The majority of the Muslim population of Kosovo are ethnic Albanians, Turks, and Slavs such as Gorani and Bosniaks.\nMembers of the Roman Catholic Church are predominantly Albanians while ethnic Serbs mainly belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2008, Protestant pastor Artur Krasniqi, primate of the Kosovo Protestant Evangelical Church, claimed that \"as many as 15,000\" Kosovar Albanians had converted to Protestantism since 1985.\nIn general, Kosovo Albanians define their ethnicity by language and not by religion, while religion reflects a distinguishing identity feature among Kosovo Serbs.\nEducation.\nEducation for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is predominantly public and supported by the state, run by the Ministry of Education. Education takes place in two main stages: primary and secondary education, and higher education.\nThe primary and secondary education is subdivided into four stages: preschool education, primary and low secondary education, high secondary education and special education. Preschool education is for children from the ages of one to five. Primary and secondary education is obligatory for everyone. It is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools and also available in languages of recognised minorities in Kosovo, where classes are held in Albanian, Serbian, Bosnian, Turkish and Croatian. The first phase (primary education) includes grades one to five, and the second phase (low secondary education) grades six to nine. The third phase (high secondary education) consists of general education but also professional education, which is focused on different fields. It lasts four years. However, pupils are offered possibilities of applying for higher or university studies. According to the Ministry of Education, children who are not able to get a general education are able to get a special education (fifth phase).\nHigher education can be received in universities and other higher-education institutes. These educational institutions offer studies for Bachelor, Master and PhD degrees. The students may choose full-time or part-time studies.\nStudents from Kosovo performed very poorly on several PISA tests, and this result has sparked debates about the education system.\nHealth.\nIn the past, Kosovo's capabilities to develop a modern health care system were limited. Low GDP during 1990 worsened the situation even more. However, the establishment of Faculty of Medicine in the University of Pristina marked a significant development in health care. This was also followed by launching different health clinics which enabled better conditions for professional development.\nThe health care system in Kosovo is now more developed, and is organised into three sectors: primary, secondary and tertiary health care. Primary health care in Pristina is organised into thirteen family medicine centres and fifteen ambulatory care units. Secondary health care is decentralised in seven regional hospitals. Pristina does not have any regional hospital and instead uses University Clinical Centre of Kosovo for health care services. University Clinical Centre of Kosovo provides its health care services in twelve clinics, where 642 doctors are employed. At a lower level, home services are provided for several vulnerable groups which are not able to reach health care premises. Kosovo health care services are now focused on patient safety, quality control and assisted health. \nEconomy.\nThe economy of Kosovo is a transitional economy. It suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and the following Yugoslav Wars. Despite declining foreign assistance, the GDP has mostly grown since its declaration of independence. This was despite the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent European debt crisis. Additionally, the inflation rate has been low. Most economic development has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the diaspora, foreign direct investment, and other capital inflows.&lt;ref name=\"IMF Country Report No 12/100\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the International Monetary Fund reported that approximately one-sixth of the population lived below the poverty line and one-third of the working age population was unemployed, the highest rate in Europe.\nKosovo's largest trading partners are Albania, Italy, Switzerland, China, Germany and Turkey. The euro is its official currency. The Government of Kosovo has signed free-trade agreements with Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. Kosovo is a member of CEFTA, agreed with UNMIK, and enjoys free trade with most nearby non-European Union countries.\nKosovo is dominated by the services sector, accounting for 54% of GDP and employing approximately 56.6% of the population. The industry accounted for 37.3% of GDP and employs roughly 24.8% of the labour force. There are several reasons for the stagnation, ranging from consecutive occupations, political turmoil and the War in Kosovo in 1999. While agriculture accounts for only 6.6% of GDP, albeit an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2019, it forms 18.7% of Kosovo's workforce, the highest proportion of agricultural employment in the region after Albania.\nKosovo has large reserves of lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron and bauxite. The nation has the fifth-largest lignite reserves in the world and the third in Europe. The Directorate for Mines and Minerals and the World Bank estimated that Kosovo had \u20ac13.5\u00a0billion worth of minerals in 2005. The primary sector is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. 53% of the nation's area is agricultural land, 41% forest and forestry land, and 6% for others.\nWine has historically been produced in Kosovo. The main heartland of Kosovo's wine industry is in Rahovec. The main cultivars include Pinot noir, Merlot, and Chardonnay. Kosovo exports wines to Germany and the United States. The four state-owned wine production facilities were not as much \"wineries\" as they were \"wine factories\". Only the Rahovec facility that held approximately 36% of the total vineyard area had the capacity of around 50 million litres annually. The major share of the wine production was intended for exports. At its peak in 1989, the exports from the Rahovec facility amounted to 40 million litres and were mainly distributed to the German market.\nEnergy.\nThe electricity sector in Kosovo is considered one of the sectors with the greatest potential of development. Kosovo's electricity sector is highly dependent on coal-fired power plants, which use the abundant lignite, so efforts are being made to diversify electricity generation with more renewables sources, such as wind farms in Bajgora and Kitka.\nIn December 2019, Kosovo and Albania's energy transmission operators signed an agreement to establish a joint energy bloc between the two countries. This would allow Albania and Kosovo to exchange energy reserves, which was expected to result in \u20ac4 million in savings per year for Kosovo.\nTourism.\nThe natural values of Kosovo represent quality tourism resources. The description of Kosovo's potential in tourism is closely related to its geographical location, in the centre of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe. It represents a crossroads which historically dates back to antiquity. Kosovo serves as a link in the connection between Central and Southern Europe and the Adriatic Sea and Black Sea. Kosovo is generally rich in various topographical features, including high mountains, lakes, canyons, steep rock formations and rivers. The mountainous west and southeast of Kosovo has great potential for winter tourism. Skiing takes place at the Brezovica ski resort within the \u0160ar Mountains, with the close proximity to the Pristina Airport (60\u00a0km) and Skopje International Airport (70\u00a0km) which is a popular destination for international tourists.\nKosovo also has lakes like Batllava that serves as a popular destination for watersports, camping, and swimming. Other lakes include Ujmani, Liqenati, Zemra.\nOther major attractions include the capital, Pristina, the historical cities of Prizren, Peja and Gjakova but also Ferizaj and Gjilan.\n\"The New York Times\" included Kosovo on the list of 41 places to visit in 2011.\nTransport.\nRoad transportation of passengers and freight is the most common form of transportation in Kosovo. There are two main motorways in Kosovo: the R7 connecting Kosovo with Albania and the R6 connecting Pristina to the North Macedonian border at Hani i Elezit. The construction of the R7.1 Motorway began in 2017.\nThe R7 Motorway (part of Albania-Kosovo Highway) links Kosovo to Albania's Adriatic coast in Durr\u00ebs. Once the remaining European route (E80) from Pristina to Merdare section project will be completed, the motorway will link Kosovo through the present European route (E80) highway with the Pan-European corridor X (E75) near Ni\u0161 in Serbia. The R6 Motorway, forming part of the E65, is the second motorway constructed in the region. It links the capital Pristina with the border with North Macedonia at Hani i Elezit, which is about from Skopje. Construction of the motorway started in 2014 and finished in 2019.\nTrainkos operates daily passenger trains on two routes: Pristina \u2013 Fush\u00eb Kosov\u00eb \u2013 Pej\u00eb, as well as Pristina \u2013 Fush\u00eb Kosov\u00eb \u2013 Ferizaj \u2013 Skopje, North Macedonia (the latter in cooperation with Macedonian Railways). Freight trains also run throughout the country.\nThe nation hosts two airports, Pristina International Airport and Gjakova Airport. Pristina International Airport is located southwest of Pristina. It is Kosovo's only international airport and the only port of entry for air travelers to Kosovo. In 2024, the Pristina International Airport handled a total of 4,082,481 passengers. Gjakova Airport was built by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) following the Kosovo War, next to an existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and humanitarian flights. The local and national government plans to offer Gjakova Airport for operation under a public-private partnership with the aim of turning it into a civilian and commercial airport.\nMedia.\nKosovo ranks 99th out of 180 countries in the 2025 World Press Freedom Index report compiled by the Reporters Without Borders, with a score of 52.73 indicating difficult conditions. Media in Kosovo consists of radio, television, newspapers, and internet web sites, with most surviving from advertising and subscriptions. As according to IREX there are 92 radio stations and 22 television stations.\nCulture.\nArts.\nThe architecture of Kosovo dates back to the Neolithic, Bronze and Middle Ages. It has been influenced by the presence of different civilisations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day.\nKosovo is home to many monasteries and churches from the 13th and 14th centuries that represent the Serbian Orthodox legacy. Architectural heritage from the Ottoman Period includes mosques and hamams from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Other historical architectural structures of interest include kullas from the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as a number of bridges, urban centres and fortresses. While some vernacular buildings are not considered important in their own right, taken together they are of considerable interest. During the 1999 conflict in Kosovo, many buildings that represent this heritage were destroyed or damaged. In the Dukagjini region, at least 500 kullas were attacked, and most of them destroyed or otherwise damaged.\nIn 2004, UNESCO recognised the Visoki De\u010dani monastery as World Heritage Site for its outstanding universal value. Two years later, the site of patrimony was extended as a serial nomination, to include three other religious monuments: Patriarchate of Peja, Our Lady of Ljevi\u0161 and Gra\u010danica monastery under the name of Medieval Monuments in Kosovo. It consists of four Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries, which represent the fusion of the eastern Orthodox Byzantine and the western Romanesque ecclesiastical architecture to form the Palaiologan Renaissance style. The monuments have come under attack, especially during the 2004 ethnic violence. In 2006, the property was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to difficulties in its management and conservation stemming from the region's political instability.\nInternational exposure of Kosovan art was limited in the 1990s due to Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's regime and the difficult circumstances during the struggle for independence.\nIn February 1979, the Kosova National Art Gallery, now known as the National Gallergy of Kosovo, was founded. It became the highest institution of visual arts in Kosovo. It was named after one of the most prominent artists of Kosovo Muslim Mulliqi. Engj\u00ebll Berisha, Masar Caka, Tahir Emra, Abdullah G\u00ebrguri, Hysni Krasniqi, Nimon Lokaj, Aziz Nimani, Ramadan Ramadani, Esat Valla and Lendita Zeqiraj are some of few Albanian painters born in Kosovo.\nMusic.\nAlthough the music in Kosovo is diverse, authentic Albanian and Serbian music still exist. Albanian music is characterised by the use of the \u00c7ifteli. Classical music is well known in Kosovo and has been taught at several music schools and universities. In 2014, Kosovo submitted their first film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, with \"Three Windows and a Hanging\" directed by Isa Qosja.\nA baked-clay ocarina found in the village of Runik is considered to be the oldest musical instrument found in Kosovo and one of the oldest ocarinas ever found in Europe. The Runik ocarina is thought to be at least 8,000 years old.\nAlbanian epic poetry, found in Kosovo and Northern Albania, is sung while accompanied by a lahut\u00eb or \u00e7ifteli. Kosovar music is influenced by Turkish music due to the almost 500-year span of Ottoman rule in Kosovo though Kosovar folklore has preserved its originality and exemplary. Archaeological research tells how old this tradition is and how it was developed in parallel with other traditional music in the Balkans. Roots dating to the 5th century BC have been found in paintings on stones of singers with instruments. (There is a famous portrait of \"Pani\" holding an instrument similar to a flute).\nThe contemporary music artists Rita Ora, Dua Lipa and Era Istrefi are all of Albanian origin and have achieved international recognition for their music. One widely recognised musician from Prizren is guitarist Petrit \u00c7eku, winner of several international prizes.\nSerbian music from Kosovo presents a mixture of traditional music, which is part of the wider Balkan tradition, with its own distinctive sound, and various Western and Turkish influences. Serb songs from Kosovo were an inspiration for 12th song wreath by composer Stevan Mokranjac. Most of Serbian music from Kosovo was dominated by church music, with its own share of sung epic poetry. Serbian national instrument Gusle is also used in Kosovo.\nViktorija is the only artist from Kosovo who represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest as part of Aska in 1982. Singer Rona Nishliu finished 5th in the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, while Lindita represented Albania in 2017. Several Serbian singers from Kosovo have also participated in the Serbian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. Nevena Bo\u017eovi\u0107 represented Serbia in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest and twice in the Eurovision Song Contest, firstly as a member of Moje 3 in 2013 and as a solo act in 2019.\nCinema.\nThe film industry of Kosovo dates from the 1970s. In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established Kosovafilm, a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after Yugoslav withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.\nDokufest, an international documentary and short film festival, is the largest film event in Kosovo. The festival is held each August in Prizren, and attracts numerous international and regional artists. Films are screened twice a day in three open-air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas. In addition to its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which altogether turn the city into a charming place to be. In 2010, Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.\nInternational actors of Albanian origin from Kosovo include Arta Dobroshi, James Biberi, Faruk Begolli and Bekim Fehmiu. The Prishtina International Film Festival is the largest film festival, held annually in Pristina, in Kosovo that screens prominent international cinema productions in the Balkan region and beyond, and draws attention to the Kosovar film industry.\nThe movie \"Shok\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016. The movie was written and directed by Oscar nominated director Jamie Donoughue, based on true events during the Kosovo War. \"Shok\"'s distributor is Ouat Media, and the social media campaign is led by Team Albanians.\nCuisine.\nKosovar cuisine is distinguished by multifaceted culinary influences derived from Balkan, Mediterranean, and Ottoman traditions. \nSports.\nSince its declaration of independence in 2008, Kosovo has made substantial advancements in international sports. The nation's inaugural participation in the Olympic Games occurred at the 2016 games, where it achieved a milestone by securing its first medals. Kosovo's involvement in the European Games began in 2015, during which the nation amassed four medals. Additionally, Kosovo commenced participation in the Mediterranean Games in 2018, obtaining ten medals. Forthcoming, Kosovo is scheduled to host the 2030 games. Athletes such as Laura Fazliu, Akil Gjakova, Nora Gjakova, Majlinda Kelmendi, Loriana Kuka, and Distria Krasniqi have played significant roles in Kosovo's sporting achievements, with Majlinda Kelmendi winning the nation's first Olympic gold medal. Judo has become an important part of Kosovo's success in international competitions, accounting for the majority of the nation's medals. Prior to Kosovo's independence, other athletes such as Aziz Salihu, Vladimir Durkovi\u0107, Fahrudin Jusufi, and Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107 represented Yugoslavia.\nKosovo achieved full membership status in both the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 2016, facilitating the nation's participation in international football competitions. As a result, the national football team of Kosovo became eligible to compete in qualification rounds for major tournaments such as the UEFA Nations League, the European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. The team's paramount achievement occurred during the 2018\u201319 edition of the UEFA Nations League, wherein they concluded the tournament atop their League D group, maintaining an unbeaten record of four victories and two draws, thus securing promotion to a higher competitive tier. Several Kosovo-Albanian players have opted to represent various European nations, highlighting figures examples, including Lorik Cana for Albania and Adnan Januzaj for Belgium. Furthermore, key contributions have come from players such as Valon Behrami, Xherdan Shaqiri, and Granit Xhaka.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

It forms a core part of the KDE Software Compilation. Developed by volunteers, Konqueror can run on most Unix-like operating systems. The KDE community licenses and distributes Konqueror under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later.\nThe name \"Konqueror\" references the two primary competitors at the time of the browser's first release: \"first comes the Navigator, then Explorer, and then the Konqueror\".\nIt also follows the KDE naming convention: the names of most KDE programs begin with the letter K.\nKonqueror first appeared with version 2 of KDE on October 23, 2000. It replaced its predecessor, KFM (KDE file manager). With the release of KDE 4 in 2008, the functionalities of web browser and file manager were separated: Dolphin replaced Konqueror as the default KDE file manager, while the KDE community continues to maintain Konqueror as the default KDE web browser.\nMajor supported protocols.\nKonqueror can utilize all KIOslaves installed on the user's system. Some examples include: \nA complete list is available in the KDE Info Center's Protocols section.\nUser interface.\nKonqueror supports tabbed document interface and Split views, wherein a window can contain multiple documents in tabs. Multiple document interfaces are not supported, however it is possible to recursively divide a window to view multiple documents simultaneously, or simply open another window.\nKonqueror's user interface is somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, though it is more customizable. It works extensively with \"panels\", which can be rearranged or added. For example, one could have an Internet bookmarks panel on the left side of the browser window, and by clicking a bookmark, the respective web page would be viewed in the larger panel to the right. Alternatively, one could display a hierarchical list of folders in one panel and the content of the selected folder in another. Panels are quite flexible and can even include, among other KParts (components), a console window, a text editor, and a media player. Panel configurations can be saved, and there are some default configurations. (For example, \"Midnight Commander\" displays a screen split into two panels, where each one contains a folder, Web site, or file view.)\nNavigation functions (back, forward, history, etc.) are available during all operations. Most keyboard shortcuts can be remapped using a graphical configuration, and navigation can be conducted through an assignment of letters to nodes on the active file by pressing the control key. The address bar has extensive autocompletion support for local directories, past URLs, and past search terms.\nWeb browser.\nKonqueror has been developed as an autonomous web browser project. It uses KHTML as its browser engine, which is compliant with HTML and supports JavaScript, CSS, SSL, and other relevant open standards. An alternative layout engine, \"kwebkitpart\", is available from the Extragear.\nWhile KHTML is the default web-rendering engine, Konqueror is a modular application and other rendering engines are available. In particular, the WebKitPart component using the KHTML-derived WebKit engine has seen a lot of support in the KDE 4 series. However, the KHTML rendering backend contains unique features, such as the ability to save a full archive of any given webpage into a single file with the \".war\" extension.\nKonqueror integrates several customizable search services which can be accessed by entering the service's abbreviation code (for example, codice_1 for Google, or codice_2 for Wikipedia) followed by the search terms. One can add their own search service; for instance, to retrieve English Wikipedia articles, a shortcut may be added with the URL codice_3.\nKHTML's rendering speed is on par with that of competing browsers, but sites with customized JavaScript are often problematic due to KHTML's much smaller mind- and market-share, resulting in fewer JavaScript features built into the JS engine.\nKJS is Konqueror's JavaScript engine that was originally developed by Harri Porten in 2000. On June 13, 2002, Maciej Stachowiak announced on a mailing list that Apple was releasing JavaScriptCore, a framework for Mac OS X that was based on KJS.\nKubuntu's 10.10 Maverick Meerkat release switched the default browser from Konqueror to rekonq, as well as a Firefox installer being added. Kubuntu subsequently switched from rekonq to Firefox, with the release of 14.04 Trusty Tahr.\nFile manager.\nKonqueror also allows browsing the local directory hierarchy\u2014either by entering locations in the address bar, or by selecting items in the file browser window. It allows browsing in different views, which differ in their usage of icons and layout. Files can also be executed, viewed, copied, moved, and deleted.\nThe user can also open an embedded version of Konsole, via KDE's KParts technology, in which they can directly execute shell commands. In addition to the Konsole KPart, Konqueror can also use a Filelight KPart, to view a radial diagram of the user's filesystem.\nAlthough this functionality has not been removed from Konqueror, as of KDE 4, Dolphin has replaced Konqueror as the default file manager. Dolphin can \u2013 like Konqueror \u2013 divide each window or tab into multiple panes. Konqueror makes more powerful use of this feature, allowing as many vertically and horizontally divided panes as desired. Each can link to different content or even remote locations, so that Konqueror becomes a powerful graphical tool to manage content on multiple servers all in one window, \"dragging and dropping\" files between locations.\nFile viewer.\nUsing the KParts object model, Konqueror executes components that are capable of viewing (and sometimes editing) specific filetypes and embeds their client area directly into the Konqueror panel in which the respective files have been opened. This makes it possible to, for example, view an OpenDocument (via Calligra) or PDF document directly within Konqueror. Any application that implements the KParts model correctly can be embedded in this fashion.\nKParts can also be used to embed certain types of multimedia content into HTML pages; for example, the KMPlayer KPart enables Konqueror to show embedded video on web pages.\nKIO.\nIn addition to browsing files and websites, Konqueror utilizes KIO plugins to extend its capabilities well beyond those of other browsers and file managers. It uses components of KIO, the KDE I/O plugin system, to access different protocols such as HTTP and FTP (support for these is built-in), WebDAV, SMB (Windows shares), SFTP and FISH (a handy replacement to the latter when the SFTP subsystem is disabled on the remote host).\nSimilarly, Konqueror can use KIO plugins (called IOslaves) to access ZIP files and other archives, to process ed2k links (edonkey/emule), or even to browse audio CDs, (\"audiocd:/\") and rip them via drag-and-drop. Likewise, the \"man:\" and \"info:\" IOslaves can be used to fetch man and info formatted documentation.\nKonqueror Embedded.\nAn embedded systems version, Konqueror Embedded was previously https://. Unlike the full version of Konqueror, Embedded Konqueror is purely a web browser. It does not require KDE or even the X window system. A single static library, it is designed to be as small as possible, while providing all necessary functions of a web browser, such as support for HTML 4, CSS, JavaScript, cookies, and SSL.\nAs of June 2019, this project's page on the KDE website has been taken down.\nDownload manager.\nKGet is a free download manager for KDE and is the default download manager for Konqueror. It is part of the KDE Network package. By default, it is the download manager used for Konqueror, but can also be used with Mozilla Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers as well as rekonq. KGet was featured by \"Tux Magazine\" and \"Free Software Magazine\".\nHistory.\nOn KDE 3, KGet 0.8.x, 1 supported HTTP/FTP download.\nOn KDE Software Compilation 4, KGet 2 was released; it supported bandwidth throttling segmentation, multi-threading, and the BitTorrent protocol.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The initial key signature in a piece is placed immediately after the clef at the beginning of the first line. If the piece contains a section in a different key, the new key signature is placed at the beginning of that section.\nIn a key signature, a sharp or flat symbol on a line or space of the staff indicates that the note represented by that line or space is to be played a semitone higher (sharp) or lower (flat) than it would otherwise be played. This applies through the rest of the piece or until another key signature appears. Each symbol applies to comparable notes in all octaves\u2014for example, a flat on the fourth space of the treble staff (as in the diagram) indicates that all notes notated as Es are played as E-flats, including those on the bottom line of the staff.\nMost of this article addresses key signatures that represent the diatonic keys of Western music. These contain either flats or sharps, but not both, and the different key signatures add flats or sharps according to the order shown in the circle of fifths.\nEach major and minor key has an associated key signature, showing up to seven flats or seven sharps, that indicates the notes used in its scale. Music was sometimes notated with a key signature that did not match its key in this way\u2014this can be seen in some Baroque pieces, or transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.\nOverview.\n&lt;score&gt;{\n\\omit Score.TimeSignature \\relative c' {\n \\time 2/1 b cis dis e fis gis ais b} }&lt;/score&gt; B major scale using accidentals instead of a key signature\n&lt;score&gt;{\n\\omit Score.TimeSignature \\relative c' {\n \\key b \\major \\time 2/1 b cis dis e fis gis ais b} }&lt;/score&gt; B major scale with the usual key signature\nWith any note as a starting point, a certain series of intervals produces a major scale: whole step, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.\nStarting on C, this yields C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (a C-major scale). There are no sharps or flats in this scale, so the key signature for C has no sharps or flats in it. Starting on any other note requires that at least one of these notes be changed (raised or lowered) to preserve the major scale pattern. These raised or lowered notes form the key signature. Starting the pattern on D, for example, yields D-E-F\u266f-G-A-B-C\u266f-D, so the key signature for D major has two sharps\u2014F\u266f and C\u266f.\nKey signatures indicate that this applies to the section of music that follows, showing the reader which key the music is in, and making it unnecessary to apply accidentals to individual notes.\nIn standard music notation, the order in which sharps or flats appear in key signatures is uniform, following the circle of fifths: F\u266f, C\u266f, G\u266f, D\u266f, A\u266f, E\u266f, B\u266f, and B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d, C\u266d, F\u266d. Musicians can identify the key by the number of sharps or flats shown, since they always appear in the same order. A key signature with one sharp must show F-sharp, which indicates G major or E minor.\nThere can be exceptions to this, especially in 20th-century music, if a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale and an invented key signature to reflect that. This may consist of sharps or flats that are not in the usual order, or of sharps combined with flats (e.g., F\u266f and B\u266d). Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, for example.\nIn a score, transposing instruments will show a different key signature to reflect their transposition but their music is in the same concert key as the other instruments. Percussion instruments with indeterminate pitch will not show a key signature, and timpani parts are sometimes written without a key signature (early timpani parts were sometimes notated with the high drum as \"C\" and the low drum a fourth lower as \"G\", with actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the music, e.g., \"timpani in D\u2013A\"). In polytonal music, where different parts are actually in different keys sounding together, instruments may be notated in different keys.\nConventions.\nThe order in which sharps or flats appear in key signatures is illustrated in the diagram of the circle of fifths. Starting the major scale pattern (whole step, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half) on C requires no sharps or flats. Proceeding clockwise in the diagram starts the scale a fifth higher, on G. Starting on G requires one sharp, F\u266f, to form a major scale. Starting another fifth higher, on D, requires F\u266f and C\u266f. This pattern continues, raising the seventh scale degree of each successive key. As the scales become notated in flats, this is shown by eliminating one of the flats. This is strictly a function of notation\u2014the seventh scale degree is still being raised by a semitone compared to the previous key in the sequence. Going counter-clockwise from C results in lowering the fourth scale degree with each successive key (starting on F requires a B\u266d to form a major scale). Each major key has a relative minor key that shares the same key signature. The relative minor is always a minor third lower than its relative major.\nThe key signatures with seven flats and seven sharps are usually notated in their enharmonic equivalents. C\u266f major (seven sharps) is usually written as D\u266d major (five flats) and C\u266d major is usually written as B major.\n&lt;score&gt; {\n\\omit Score.TimeSignature\n\\new Staff \\relative c' {\n \\key ais \\minor &lt;ais cis eis ais&gt;1 \\bar \" Natural key signature: a key signature with seven naturals (\u266e) used to cancel the seven sharps (\u266f) of the previous signature.\nThe key signature may be changed at any time in a piece by providing a new signature. If the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is used to cancel the preceding signature. If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.\nVariations.\nWhen a key signature changes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature can be cancelled with a matching set of naturals before the new key signature is shown. This was a frequent convention in older notation styles but newer music and newer editions of old music sometimes simply show the new signature without the canceling naturals. These naturals are necessary, however, if the new key signature has no sharps or flats (C major, A minor, or an open key signature).\nSimilarly, when a flat key changes to fewer flats, or a sharp key changes to fewer sharps, the older convention was to use naturals to cancel the flats or sharps being eliminated before the new signature is written. Modern usage often simply shows the new signature without these naturals. The use of natural signs is still required if the new key signature has no sharps or flats.\nWhen a flat key changes to more flats or a sharp key changes to more sharps, the new signature is simply written in without using naturals to cancel the old signature. This convention applies in both traditional and newer styles.\nAt one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a double barline even if it was not otherwise required, but it has become increasingly common to simply use a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline and the line at the very end of the staff is omitted.\nIf both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also modern variations about where a barline will be placed. In some scores by Debussy the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been usual to place all the symbols after the barline.\nThe A\u266f which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of Ottorino Respighi's \"Pines of Rome\", in the third section, \"Pines of the Janiculum\" (which is in B major), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.\nIn the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F\u266d may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear on the space below the staff. An example of this can be seen in Isaac Alb\u00e9niz's \"Iberia\": first movement, \"Evocaci\u00f3n\", which is in A\u266d minor.\nDouble flats and sharps.\nKey signatures can extend into double flats or double sharps, but this is extremely rare. For example, the key of G\u266f major would have eight sharps, requiring an F double-sharp (F) and six single sharps. The key of A\u266d major, with four flats, is enharmonically equivalent and would generally be used instead. Although the notation of key signatures could theoretically extend beyond single flats or sharps, a key signature with more than one or two double flats or sharps would be exceedingly hard to read and would be replaced by the enharmonically equivalent key signature.\nA piece in a major key might modulate up a fifth to the dominant (a common occurrence in Western music), resulting in a new key signature with an additional sharp. If the original key was C-sharp, such a modulation would lead to the key of G-sharp major (with eight sharps) requiring an F in place of the F\u266f. This section could be written using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A-flat major instead. Claude Debussy's \"Suite bergamasque\" does this: in the third movement \"Clair de lune\" the key shifts from D-flat major to D-flat minor (eight flats) for a few measures but the passage is notated in C-sharp minor (four sharps); the same happens in the final movement, \"Passepied\", in which a G-sharp major section is written as A-flat major.\nSuch passages may instead be notated with the use of double-sharp or double-flat accidentals, as in this example from Johann Sebastian Bach's \"Well-Tempered Clavier\", which has this passage in G-sharp major in measures 10-12.\nWhile these keys are sometimes notated with accidentals as in this example, the use of a key signature containing double flats or sharps is very rare. The final pages of John Foulds' \"A World Requiem\" are written in G\u266f major (with F in the key signature), No. 18 of Anton Reicha's \"Practische Beispiele\" is written in B\u266f major, and the third movement of Victor Ewald's Brass Quintet Op. 8 is written in F\u266d major (with B in the key signature).\nExamples of such key signatures are pictured below:\n&lt;score&gt;\n\\relative c' { \\omit Staff.TimeSignature \\omit Staff.KeyCancellation\n \\key gis \\major &lt;gis' bis dis&gt;&lt;eis gis bis&gt;_\\markup \\halign #0.2 \\center-column { \"G\u266f maj\" \"E\u266f min\" } \\bar \"||\"\n \\key dis \\major &lt;dis fisis ais&gt;&lt;bis dis fisis&gt;_\\markup \\halign #0.2 \\center-column { \"D\u266f maj\" \"B\u266f min\" } \\bar \"||\"\n \\key fes \\major &lt;fes' as ces&gt;&lt;des fes as&gt;_\\markup \\halign #0.2 \\center-column { \"F\u266d maj\" \"D\u266d min\" } \\bar \"||\"\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThere does not appear to be a standard on how to notate these key signatures:\nIn tuning systems where the number of notes per octave is not a multiple of 12, notes such as G\u266f and A\u266d are not enharmonically equivalent, nor are the corresponding key signatures. These tunings can produce keys with no analogue in 12-tone equal temperament, which can require double sharps, double flats, or microtonal alterations in key signatures. For example, the key of G\u266f major, with eight sharps, is equivalent to A\u266d major in 12-tone equal temperament, but in 19-tone equal temperament, it is equivalent to A major instead, with 11 flats.\nMajor scale structure.\nScales with sharp key signatures.\nThere can be up to seven sharps in a key signature, appearing in this order: . The key note or tonic of a piece in a major key is a semitone above the last sharp in the signature. For example, the key of D major has a key signature of F\u266f and C\u266f, and the tonic (D) is a semitone above C\u266f. Each scale starting on the fifth scale degree of the previous scale has one new sharp, added in the order shown.\nScales with flat key signatures.\nThere can be up to seven flats in a key signature, applied as: The major scale with one flat is F major. In all major scales with flat key signatures, the tonic in a major key is a perfect fourth below the last flat. When there is more than one flat, the tonic is the note of the second-to-last flat in the signature. In the major key with four flats (B\u266d E\u266d A\u266d D\u266d), for example, the second to last flat is A\u266d, indicating a key of A\u266d major. Each new scale starts a fifth \"below\" (or a fourth above) the previous one.\nRelationship between key and signature.\nThe sharps or flats needed to produce a diatonic scale in diatonic or tonal music can be shown as a key signature at the beginning of a section of music instead of showing accidentals on individual notes. While the key of a piece generally corresponds to the notated key signature, it may not in some cases, such as in pre-Baroque music, which was composed before the modern concept of keys had fully emerged.\nSome pieces feature modulations, or changes in key, between contrasting sections. Modulations may or may not be reflected by a corresponding change in key signature. Modulated passages may instead make use of accidentals.\nThe Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538 by Bach has a key signature with no sharps or flats, indicating that it may be in D, in Dorian mode, but the B\u266ds indicated with accidentals make the music in D minor.\nAdditional terminology.\nKeys which are associated with the same key signature are called relative keys.\nWhen musical modes, such as Lydian or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called \"transposed modes\".\nUse in other traditions.\n&lt;score&gt;{\n\\relative c' {\nKey signatures are also used in music that does not come from the Western common practice period. This includes folk music, non-Western music, and Western music from before or after the common practice period.\nKlezmer music uses scales other than diatonic major or minor, such as Phrygian dominant scale. Because of the limitations of the Great Highland Bagpipe scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, F\u266f and C\u266f. (The pipes are incapable of playing F\u266e and C\u266e so the sharps are not notated.) 20th century composers such as Bart\u00f3k and Rzewski (see below) experimented with non-diatonic key signatures.\nHistorical notation.\nIn music from the Baroque period, it is common to see key signatures in which the notes are annotated in a different order from the modern practice, or with the same note-letter annotated for each octave.\nUnusual signatures.\nThe 15 key signatures that form diatonic scales are sometimes called \"standard key signatures\". Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidentals as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E\u266d (right hand), and F\u266f and G\u266f (left hand) used for the \u0421 diminished (\u0421 octatonic) scale in Bart\u00f3k's \"Crossed Hands\" (no. 99, vol. 4, \"Mikrokosmos\"); the B\u266d, E\u266d and F\u266f used for the D Phrygian dominant scale in Frederic Rzewski's \"God to a Hungry Child\"; and the E\u266d and D\u266d (right hand) and the B\u266d, A\u266d, G\u266d (left hand) in Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's \"Galamb Borong\" (no. 7 from the second book of the \"\u00c9tudes pour piano\"), and B\u266d, E\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d (both hands) in \"Pour Irina\" (no. 16 from the same work's third book).\nThere are also examples of conflicting standard signatures, as in:\nNo sharps or flats in a key signature can indicate that the music is in the key of C major\u00a0/ A minor, or that the piece is modal or atonal (does not have a key signature). An example is Bart\u00f3k's Piano Sonata, which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.\nHistory.\nThe use of a one-flat signature developed in the Medieval period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.\nWhen signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a partial signature or conflicting signature. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century. The 16th-century motet \"Absolon fili mi\" by Pierre de La Rue (formerly attributed to Josquin des Prez) features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.\nBaroque music written in minor keys often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A\u266d would frequently have to be sharpened to A\u266e in the ascending melodic minor scale, as would the B\u266d).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is consumed by both Eastern Orthodox Christians and Catholics, though whether it is served on Christmas\u2013Feast of Jordan holiday season or as part of a funeral feast can vary between regions. The word with a descriptor is also used to describe the eves of Christmas, New Year, and Feast of Jordan days.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"kutia\" is a borrowing from the Greek language ('bean') or ('grain'). The dish has a similar name across the countries where it is traditionally consumed, such as , , , and .\nIn Ukraine.\nIn Ukraine kut\u0456a is one of the two essential ritual dishes at the Ukrainian Christmas Eve supper (also known as \"Svyata vecherya\"). The ritual significance of kutia, as well as uzvar, is quite ancient. Ukrainian ethnographer Fedir Vovk traces the origins of these dishes to the Neolithic era. Before dinner, the kutia is placed in the icon corner (\"kut\") , the most honorable place in the house where religious icons or images are placed. The pot with the kutia was to stand there in a designated spot from Rizdvo (Christmas on December 25) to January 1, New Year's Day (formerly January 6 to the Old New Year in January 14). There is also a custom of sending children with kutia to relatives, usually grandparents and godparents. After dinner, the kutia is left on the table for the whole night with spoons for the dead ancestors, \"so that our relatives would have dinner and not be angry with us.\" The religious nature of the dish is emphasized by an ancient custom, when the head of the family approached the window or went out into the yard with a spoonful of kutia and, addressing the frost, invited him three times to take part in dinner with the family. When the frost does not appear, he is advised not to appear, not to do harm to crops, etc.: \"Frost, frost, come to us to eat kutia, and if you don't come, don't come for the rye, wheat and other crops.\"\nKutia is the first out of twelve dishes served for Svyata vecherya to be tasted. The head of the family takes the first spoon of the kutia, raises it up and calls out to the souls of departed family members to join them on this night. He then tastes the kutia, and throws the rest of the spoonful up to the ceiling. In rural towns, as many kernels of grain as stick to the ceiling, there should be swarms of bees and newborn cattle in the coming year. In the same vein, if there are many poppy seeds that remain on the ceiling, there would be a chance for more hen should lay as many eggs in the coming year than usual. In cities the same would imply a prosperous new year for the family and also a show of remembrance for their rural roots. Everyone present eats a spoonful of kutia, after which the other dishes are brought out and eaten.\nThe main ingredients used to make traditional kutia are wheatberries, poppy seeds and honey. At times, walnuts, dried fruit and raisins are added as well. Kutia is a Lenten dish and no milk or egg products can be used in this \u2013 since December 24 is a paramony \u2013 strict fasting and abstinence \u2013 day in the Eastern Orthodox Church and in Byzantine Rite Catholics. There are known kutia recipes that use pearl barley or millet instead of wheatberries.\nKolyvo is a Ukrainian ritual dish similar to kutia, but includes no poppy seeds. Kolyvo is served at remembrance services.\nIn Poland.\nKutya is known in Poland as and , and it can be served as part of the Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper, though its origins predate Christianity in Poland and can be traced back to customs of the Slavic Native Faith. However, it is eaten primarily (though not exclusively) in the eastern regions of Podlasie, the Lublin area, and Subcarpathia, near the borders with Belarus and Ukraine. It can also be commonly found among Bug River Poles and other generations with ancestry in the Eastern Borderlands, who are scattered across all of Poland. Besides Wigilia, kutia is also served on New Year's Eve and other special occasions, such as wakes.\nTraditional old Polish kutia is made using wheat, poppy seeds (ground in a special pot called \"makutra\"), honey, raisins, walnuts or hazelnuts, almonds, and vanilla; some recipes also include milk or \"\u015bmietana\". Kutia is sometimes prepared using rice or kasha instead of wheat.\nA number of customs and rituals in Polish tradition, such as fortune telling, are associated with kutia. This is particularly true for older generations and rural areas of eastern Poland, as well as their descendants who can be found across all regions of Poland. Kutia is also eaten among the Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities living in Poland.\nOther countries.\nA dish of boiled grains (usually wheat berries) mixed with honey, nuts, spices, and a few other ingredients is traditional in other countries as well:\nSomewhat similar, but with a different origin, and somewhat different ingredients, is the Islamic, especially Turkish, sweet dish of Ashure.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After establishing himself in the Detroit hip-hop scene, he broke through into mainstream success with a rap rock sound before shifting his performance style to country rock. A self-taught musician, he can play every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.\nKid Rock started his music career as a rapper, releasing his debut album \"Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast\" (1990), on Jive Records. His subsequent independent releases \"The Polyfuze Method\" (1993) and \"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp\" (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album \"Devil Without a Cause\" (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, \"Cocky\" (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip-hop, country, and rock.\nHis most successful single from that time period, \"Cowboy\" (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the country rap genre. His best-selling singles overall are \"Picture\" (2002) and \"All Summer Long\" (2008). Starting with his 2007 album \"Rock n Roll Jesus\", his musical output has tended to be in the country rock style. Politically, Ritchie is a vocal supporter of the U.S. Republican Party and holds libertarian views.\nEarly life.\nRobert James Ritchie was born in Romeo, Michigan, on January 17, 1971, the son of Susan (n\u00e9e Brabbs) and William \"Bill\" Ritchie (1941\u20132024), who owned multiple car dealerships. He was raised in his father's large home on extensive property, which included an apple orchard and barnyard for their horses. He attended Romeo High School. His younger sister, Jill Ritchie, is an actress. In the 1980s, Ritchie became interested in hip-hop, began to breakdance, and taught himself how to rap and DJ while performing in talent shows in and around Detroit.\nCareer.\nEarly career, signing with Jive Records, and \"Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast\" (1988\u20131991).\nKid Rock began his professional music career as a member of a hip-hop group called the Beast Crew in the late 1980s. During this time, he met D-Nice. That relationship would eventually lead to him becoming the opening act at local shows for Boogie Down Productions.\nDuring this time, Kid Rock began a professional association with producer Mike E. Clark, who, after some initial skepticism with the idea of a white rapper, found himself impressed with Kid Rock's energetic and well-received performance where the artist, using his own turntables and equipment, actually prepared his own beats to demonstrate his skills for Clark.\nIn 1988, Clark produced a series of demos with Kid Rock. These demos eventually led to offers from six major record labels, including Atlantic and CBS Records.\nIn 1989, Kid Rock became a shareholder in an independent record label that was formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, called \"Top Dog\" Records. Later, that investment would become a 25% ownership stake.\nWith the help of D-Nice, Kid Rock signed with Jive Records at the age of 17, releasing his debut studio album, \"Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast\" in 1990. According to Kid Rock, the contract with Jive resulted in animosity from fellow rapper Vanilla Ice, who felt that he should have been signed with Jive instead of Kid Rock.\nThe album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local independent rapper Esham. To promote the album, Kid Rock toured nationally with Ice Cube, D-Nice, Yo-Yo and Too Short; Detroit artist James \"Blackman\" Harris served as Kid Rock's DJ on this tour. During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper Eminem, who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles.\nUltimately, unfavorable comparisons to Vanilla Ice led to Jive dropping Kid Rock, according to Mike E. Clark.\nSigning with Continuum Records and \"The Polyfuze Method\" (1992\u20131995).\nIn 1992, Kid Rock signed with local independent record label Continuum. Around this time, Kid Rock met local hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse through Mike E. Clark, who was producing the duo. While ICP member Violent J disliked Kid Rock's music, he wanted the rapper to appear on ICP's debut album, \"Carnival of Carnage\", believing the appearance would gain ICP notice, since Kid Rock was a nationally successful artist. Noting that local rapper Esham was paid $500 to appear on ICP's album, Violent J claims that Kid Rock demanded $600 () to record his guest appearance, alleging that Esham and Kid Rock had a feud over who was the bigger rapper. Kid Rock showed up to record the song \"Is That You?\" intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.\nIn 1993, Kid Rock recorded his second studio album, \"The Polyfuze Method\", with producer Mike E. Clark, who worked with Kid Rock to help give the album more of a rock-oriented sound than his debut.\nKid Rock also began releasing his \"Bootleg\" cassette series to keep local interest in his music.\nLater in the year, Kid Rock recorded the EP \"Fire It Up\" at White Room Studios in downtown Detroit, run by brothers Michael and Andrew Nehra, who were forming the rock-soul band Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise. The EP featured the heavy rock song \"I Am the Bullgod\" and a cover of Hank Williams Jr.'s country song \"A Country Boy Can Survive\".\nBy 1994, Kid Rock's live performances had mostly been backed by DJs Blackman and Uncle Kracker, but Kid Rock soon began to utilize more and more live instrumentation into his performances, and formed the rock band Twisted Brown Trucker.\nAfter breaking up with his girlfriend, Kid Rock moved engineer Bob Ebeling into his apartment. During a recording session with Mike E. Clark, the producer discovered that Kid Rock could sing when he recorded a reworked cover of Billy Joel's \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", entitled \"It's Still East Detroit to Me\", which Clark claims led him to encourage Kid Rock to sing more.\nDuring this time, Kid Rock developed animosity towards other Detroit artists, including Insane Clown Posse.\nThrough extensive promoting, including distributing tapes on consignment to local stores and giving away free samplers of his music, Kid Rock developed a following among an audience which DJ Uncle Kracker described as \"white kids who dropped acid and liked listening to gangsta rap\"; this following included local rapper Joe C., who had been attending Kid Rock concerts as a fan, but upon meeting him personally, was invited to perform on stage as his hype man.\n\"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp\" and local breakthrough (1996).\nKid Rock's stage presence became honed with the addition of a light show, pyrotechnics, dancers and a light-up backdrop bearing the name \"Kid Rock\", and 1996 saw the release of his most rock-oriented album to date, \"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp\"; the album's title came from Bob Eberling, who told a sleepless, alcoholic, drug-using Kid Rock, \"Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp.\" According to Kid Rock, who distributed the album himself, \"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp\" sold 14,000 copies.\nKid Rock developed his stage persona, performing dressed in 1970s pimp clothing with a real, possibly loaded, gun down the front of his pants.\nAlthough Kid Rock was known for his frequent partying and drug and alcohol use, he primarily focused on increasing his success and fame, prioritizing his role as a businessman. This drive led to increased local success.\nSigning with Atlantic Records, \"Devil Without a Cause\", and national success (1997\u20132000).\nKid Rock's attorney, Tommy Valentino, increased his stature by helping him get articles written about Kid Rock and Twisted Brown Trucker in major publications, including Beastie Boys' \"Grand Royal\" magazine. However, though his management tried to interest local record labels in his music, they told his management team that they were not interested in signing a white rapper, to which Valentino told them, \"He's not a white rapper. He's a rock star and everything in between.\"\nIn 1997, Jason Flom, head of Lava Records, attended one of Kid Rock's performances and met with Kid Rock, who later gave him a demo containing the songs \"Somebody's Gotta Feel This\" and \"I Got One for Ya\", which led to Kid Rock signing with Atlantic Records. As part of his recording deal, Kid Rock received $150,000 from the label.\nBy this time Kid Rock had fully developed his stage persona, and musical style and wanted to make a \"redneck, shit-kicking rock 'n' roll rap\" album, resulting in his fourth studio album, \"Devil Without a Cause\", recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles.\nCarried by singles such as \"Bawitdaba\" and \"Cowboy\", the album was a commercial success as it would be certified Gold and Platinum several months after its release, and eventually sold over 14 million copies.

The Past, Present, and Future of America's Most Wanted Music\", author Mickey Hess identified Kid Rock as connecting hip-hop to rap rock, due to having started out as a hip-hop artist, before shifting his style from sample-based hip-hop to guitar-driven alternative rock that fused hip-hop beats, boasting and fashion with hard rock guitar and Southern rock attitude, influenced by classic rock and country music. He is a self-taught musician and has said that he can play every instrument used in his band. According to \"The Village Voice\", \"[Kid Rock's] own love and incorporation of his musical references isn't rooted in a nostalgia or a 'tribute,' but rather in his actively engaging the elements he finds compelling into a wholly new hodgepodge of his own invention.\" Because of this unique musical approach, Kid Rock has been described as a postmodern artist. \"American Songwriter\" says that Kid Rock's style ranges from hard rap to hard rock. \"CBS\" says that Kid Rock's style is a mix of \"urban rap, rock and roll [and] country and western.\" The musician jokingly described his own style as being \"creatively confused\". Reviewing his compilation album \"The History of Rock\", David Browne wrote that \"Unlike most of his rap-metal peers, Kid Rock doesn't merely have personality to burn (and a surprisingly likable one) but a sense of history as well. He may be the first rock star who views Americana as not simply blues, country, and boogie rock but classic hard rock and rap as well.\" A 2015 piece by the \"Detroit Free Press\" said that Kid Rock reinvented \"his persona from scrappy hip hop street kid to swaggering rock-rap showman.\" Covering him in a 1998 piece, \"MTV\" described his sound as having \"heavy-metal licks and rap riffs\". \"AllMusic\" described him as a \"country rap-rocker\" and his music as \"rap-meets-rock-meets-country\". \"MTV\" said that Kid Rock's album \"Devil Without a Cause\" helped to \"ignite the rap-rock genre\" and that the musician broke through into mainstream success \"during the peak of rap-rock and n\u00fc-metal\". In a 2015 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Kid Rock disavowed nu metal, saying that the genre was \"not melodic and doesn't stand the test of time.\" In a review of his album \"Sweet Southern Sugar\", \"Cryptic Rock\" said that after \"Devil Without a Cause\" established him as a rap rock artist, \"albums that were saturated in old school hip hop slowly but surely began to transform into the Southern country rock landscape that has built Kid Rock's persona.\" In a review of his album \"Born Free\", Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the musician \"has slowly abandoned rap for country as he crept closer to middle age\", and while reviewing the subsequent album \"Rebel Soul\", Erlewine said that Kid Rock \"[planted] his flag on that old-time rock &amp; roll\". \"Billboard\" said that Kid Rock \"fits comfortably into a modern country-rock landscape that seems practically tailor-made for him: a God-fearing good old boy with a hard-rock heart and an outlaw-country spirit.\" Kid Rock's influences include Bob Seger and Beastie Boys. Regarding his influences, Kid Rock said, \"I don't think there isn't anything that hasn't influenced me musically.\"\nSummarizing his lyrical themes in a review of his album \"Cocky\", \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote of Kid Rock, \"Anyone willing to chug Buds, smoke pot, and salute the flag can find a place in Rock's unexpectedly optimistic dreamworld, where the sleaze nation commingles in a warped fantasy of pan-trash peace and harmony.\" The magazine categorized his lyrics as describing the \"ideal of a world where rappers can sip whiskey with rednecks\". According to Kid Rock, a fundamental theme in the lyrics of his songs is that \"there's still a lot of good left in people, no matter what they do\", reflected in his lyrics for \"Bawitdaba\", which he dedicated to, among others, \"topless dancers\" and drug users. He explained in a 2000 \"Rolling Stone\" interview, \"I've got a lot of faith in people. Whether it's some kid with a trust fund that people tease because he's got a trust fund, you know. I think there's some good ones out there, just like I think there's some good crackheads out there. It works both ways.\" Kid Rock developed a \"redneck pimp\" alter ego to complement his humorous lyrics. According to Kid Rock, \"I use straightforward words, you know. I'm not politically correct.\"\nHis song \"Cowboy\" is considered a pioneering song in the country rap genre. \"Cowboys &amp; Indians\" claims that \"Cowboy\" had a major impact on the country music scene; the magazine wrote that artists Jason Aldean and Big &amp; Rich, among others, were influenced by the song's country rap style. Kid Rock also had an impact on hip-hop, serving as an influence on rappers like Yelawolf.\nPersonal life.\nIn eighth grade, Ritchie began an on-and-off relationship with classmate Kelley South Russell that lasted for the next decade.

Also in 2008, Ritchie recorded and made a music video for the song \"Warrior\" for a National Guard advertising campaign.\nIn 2011, Ritchie was honored by the NAACP, which sparked protests stemming from his past display of the Confederate flag in his concerts.

After receiving major pushback for his comments, Ritchie decided to close the Detroit branch of his restaurant in December 2019, located at the Little Caesar's Arena. When asked for comment about the closure, he stated that \"it's wise to go where you're celebrated, not tolerated\". In a June 2022 interview with Tucker Carlson on \"Tucker Carlson Originals: Life of a Rockstar\", Ritchie said he had nothing to apologize for regarding the incident.\nIn June 2021, Kid Rock attracted further controversy for using the word \"faggot\" onstage during a tirade against fans who were filming his performance. He later defended his remarks while \"reaffirming his love for his homosexual friends\". In July 2022 he faced additional accusations of homophobia after, on June 30, 2022, he posted a meme on Truth Social and on Twitter stating, \"If you're anti-gun, you don't get to celebrate the 4th of July, You would have never fought back. Enjoy your pride month. Pussy.\"\nOn April 3, 2023, Kid Rock posted a video on Twitter in which he is shown shooting cases of Bud Light beer cans with a submachine gun, which was seen as being in response to an advertising campaign by Anheuser-Busch that features transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. After the shooting, he exclaims, \"Fuck Bud Light.

He also launched a website at kidrockforsenate.com, which sold merchandise bearing that inscription. Several weeks later, he wrote a post on his blog stating that he was still \"exploring my candidacy\", and that, whether or not he ran, he wanted to register people to vote, because \"although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even registered to vote or do anything about it.\" He added that he wanted \"to help working class people in Michigan and America all while still calling out these jackass lawyers who call themselves politicians.\" His statements sparked media speculation that he would try to run on the Republican ticket against sitting Michigan senator Debbie Stabenow, as well as enthusiasm from some prominent Republicans, including former New York Governor George Pataki, who wrote on Twitter, \"Kid Rock is exactly the kind of candidate the GOP needs right now.\" In an October 2017 interview with Howard Stern, Ritchie put an end to the speculation, saying that he had never intended to run for Senate, adding rhetorically, \"Who couldn't figure that out?\". He later clarified that the campaign was a joke that he had started after a Michigan state legislator encouraged him to run for Senate. He expressed surprise at the interest his potential candidacy had received, but also disappointment that some opposed to his candidacy had brought up his previous use of the Confederate flag to label him a racist. He donated the $122,000 he had raised by selling \"Kid Rock for U.S. Senate\" merchandise to CRNC Action, a College Republican group.\nOn July 18, 2024, Ritchie performed his song \"American Bad Ass\" for the 2024 Republican National Convention with modified lyrics to show his support for Trump.

There is documentary evidence dating from 1130 referring to works carried out at the castle by Henry I. In the 1170s Hugh de Moreville and his followers took refuge there after assassinating Thomas Becket.\nWilliam de Stuteville was appointed as Governor of Knaresborough castle in Easter 1173. After de Stuteville's death in 1203, King John gave Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, custody of all of William de Stuteville's lands and castles and the wardship of his son and heir Robert de Stuteville. However, Robert died in 1205 and William's brother Nicholas de Stuteville became William's heir. A charter dated at Lambeth 5 August 1205 confirmed that Nicholas had paid a fine of 10,000 marks for his inheritance, with the exception of the castles of Knaresborough and Boroughbridge, which were retained by the King.\nThe King regarded Knaresborough as an important northern fortress and spent \u00a31,290 on improvements to the castle. In August 1304, Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I, travelled from Linlithgow Palace to Knaresborough Castle. She gave birth to her son, Humphrey, in September, assisted by a holy relic of the girdle of the Virgin, brought especially from Westminster Abbey.\nThe castle was rebuilt at a cost of \u00a32,174 between 1307 and 1312 by Edward I and completed by Edward II, including the great keep. Edward II gave the castle to Piers Gaveston and stayed there himself when the unpopular nobleman was besieged at Scarborough Castle.\nPhilippa of Hainault took possession of the castle in 1331, at which point it became a royal residence. The queen often spent summers there with her family. Her son, John of Gaunt acquired the castle in 1372, adding it to the vast holdings of the Duchy of Lancaster. Katherine Swynford, Gaunt's third wife, obtained the castle upon his death.\nA detailed survey of the state of the castle buildings was made in 1561. The building was used by estate auditors and law courts were held in the hall.\nThe castle was taken by Parliamentarian troops in 1644 during the Civil War and largely destroyed in 1648, not as the result of warfare but because of an order from Parliament to dismantle all Royalist castles. Indeed many town-centre buildings are built of 'castle stone'.\nPresent day.\nThe remains of the castle are open to the public and there is a charge for entry to the interior remains. The grounds are used as a public leisure space, with a bowling green and putting green open during the summer. It is also used as a performing space. It plays host to frequent events, such as the annual FEVA (Festival of Visual Arts and Entertainment). The property is owned by the monarch as part of the Duchy of Lancaster holdings, but is administered by North Yorkshire Council.\nDescription.\nThe castle, now much ruined, comprised two walled baileys set one behind the other, with the outer bailey on the town side and the inner bailey on the cliff side. The enclosure wall was punctuated by solid towers along its length, and a pair, visible today, formed the main gate. At the junction between the inner and outer baileys, on the north side of the castle stood a tall five-sided keep, the eastern parts of which have been pulled down. The keep had a vaulted basement, at least three upper storeys, and served as a residence for the lord of the castle throughout the castle's history. The castle baileys contained residential buildings, and some foundations have survived. In 1789, historian Ely Hargrove wrote that the castle contained \"only three rooms on a floor, and measures, in front, only fifty-four feet.\"\nCourthouse.\nThe former court house in the grounds was built in the 14th century probably as House of Records, and is now a museum. It was extended in the 16th and 18th centuries, and was restored in 1830 and again in the 20th century. The museum includes furniture from the original Tudor Court, as well as exhibits about the castle and the town. It is built of magnesian limestone and brick. The roof is in stone slate, with stone coping and a kneeler on the left, and hipped on the right. There are two storeys and five bays, and a single-storey two-bay extension at the rear. In the ground floor is a round-headed doorway with a hood mould, other doorways, and two horizontally-sliding sash windows. An external staircase leads up to a doorway in the upper floor with a chamfered surround and a basket arch. There are also five windows with chamfered surrounds, recessed mullions and stepped hood moulds. Inside, there is a 14th-century fireplace, 17th-century cupboards and doors, and benches and panelling from the 16th-century courtroom. The building is grade II listed.\nPrison.\nAttached to the courthouse is a former prison, built in 1786. The prison, later used for other purposes, is in gritstone, with stone corbels carrying the gutters, and a hipped stone slate roof. There is a single storey with cells below, and one bay. On the front is a three-light segmental-headed window with a transom, and in the left return are two large round-headed windows. The prison is also grade II listed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Three applications, Kexi, Krita and KPlato and the user interfaces for mobile devices have been completely moved out of KOffice and are only available within Calligra. A new application called Braindump has been added to Calligra after the split and KWord was replaced by the new word processor Calligra Words.\nKOffice 2.3, released 31 December 2010, along with subsequent bugfix releases (2.3.1\u20132.3.3) was still a collaborative effort of both the KOffice and Calligra development teams. According to its developers, this version is stable enough for real use, and Karbon14, Krita and KSpread are recommended for production work.\nOn 18 May 2011, the Calligra team began releasing monthly snapshots while preparing for the release of Calligra 2.4.\nThe first version of the Calligra Suite for Windows was released on 21 December 2011. The package is labeled as \u201chighly experimental\u201d and \u201cnot yet suitable for daily use\u201d.\nThe Calligra team was originally scheduled to release the final 2.4 version in January 2012 but problems in the undo/redo feature of Words and Stage required a partial rewrite and caused a delay. Calligra 2.4 was released on 11 April 2012.\nCalligra 2.4 launched with two mobile-oriented user interfaces: Calligra Mobile and Calligra Active. Calligra Mobile's development was initiated in summer 2009 and was first shown during Akademy / Desktop Summit 2009 by KO GmbH as a simple port of KOffice to Maemo. Later Nokia hired KO to assist them with a full-fledged mobile version, including a touchscreen-friendly user interface which was presented by Nokia during Maemo Conference in October 2009. The first alpha version was made available in January 2010. Along with the launch of the Nokia N9 smartphone, Nokia released its own Poppler and Calligra-based office document viewer under GPL.\n\"Calligra Active\" was launched in 2011 after the Plasma Active initiative to provide a document viewer similar to \"Calligra Mobile\" but for tablet computers.\nIn December 2012, KDE, KO GmbH, and Intel released Krita Sketch, a variant of Calligra's Krita painting application, for Windows 7 and 8.\nOn 24 March 2013, KDE developer Sebastian Sauer released \"Coffice\", a Calligra-based document viewer, for Android.\nJolla continued Nokia's efforts on a smartphone version. In 2013 Jolla launched Sailfish Office. Sailfish Office reuses the Qt Quick components from Calligra Active.\nIn September 2013 a merger of Krita and Krita Sketch, named Krita Gemini, was launched on Windows 8.1. Development was funded by Intel to promote \"2in1\" convertible notebooks. On 5 March 2014 Krita Sketch and Gemini were also released as part of Calligra 2.8 for non-Windows platforms.\nIn April 2014, Intel and KO GmbH extended the promotion deal to Gemini versions of Stage and Words. On 28 August 2014, the first snapshot of Calligra Gemini was released by KO GmbH for Windows. On 21 November 2014, KDE announced that Calligra Gemini would officially be released as part of Calligra 2.9. As with Krita, this Gemini release adds a touchscreen interface to Words and Stage and users can switch between desktop and touch mode at runtime. Calligra Gemini is a continuation of Calligra Active and Sailfish Office developments but with added editing capabilities. On 19 October 2014, a Linux version was presented.\nThe koffice.org website was replaced by a placeholder in early September 2012. As of 2014[ [update]] KOffice was declared unmaintained by KDE. The koffice.org domain now redirects to Calligra.org.\nIn Autumn 2015, Krita was split off into a project independent from Calligra, with the then current 2.9 versions though still developed as part of Calligra 2.9.\nReception.\nInitial reception shortly after the 2.4 release was positive. Linux Pro Magazine Online's Bruce Byfield wrote \"Calligra needed an impressive first release. Perhaps surprisingly, and to the development team's credit, it has managed one in 2.4\", but also noted that \"Words in particular is still lacking features\". He concluded that Calligra is \"worth keeping an eye on\".\nThe German sister publication LinuxUser 10/2012 reviewed Calligra 2.5 on 12 September 2012. Its reception was mostly positive. Negative criticism centered on Words' stability: \"During our review no Calligra module was completely free of crashes, however Words' crashes reached an amount that we cannot recommend it for general use.\" The reviewer Thomas Drilling on the other hand praised Calligra's usability, writing: \"The consistent work flow, often stunningly intuitive workflows, and clear menu structure are well received.\" He then concluded: \"The individual modules' quality varies: While Words shows weakness, image editor Krita, spreadsheet application Sheets, and presentation program Stage completely won us over. Flowcharting application Flow allures with its wide range of stencils which makes drawing flow charts come easy.\"\nLinuxUser reviewed Calligra 2.6 in issue 3/2013. Reviewer Vincze-Aron Szabo reiterated positive criticism about Calligra's user interface and noted increased stability of Words compared to Calligra 2.5. Szabo's major point for negative criticism was Author's and Word's handling of long documents, resulting in decreased performance and crashes. The other reviewed components \u2013 Plan, Stage, Sheets, and Krita \u2013 were praised in terms of stability and intuitiveness.\nCalligra 2.7 was reviewed by LinuxUser in its October 2013 issue. Thomas Drilling, the reviewer, drew a positive conclusion overall. Among the positive aspects he pointed out were better \".docx\" file import than LibreOffice and the amount of new features gained by the new version of the suite. Source for negative criticism was once again Words' stability, although Drilling noted improvements in this regard.\nNetwork World editor Bryan Lunduke wrote about Calligra 2.8 in March 2014: \u201cKarbon is an astoundingly nice vector design tool, and Flow, a diagramming tool, is incredibly handy from the design point of view as well. [\u2026] And Words is a great word processor.\u201d In August 2014 he wrote: \u201cCalligra Suite has become a staple of my workflow even on non-KDE desktops.\u201d Linux Insider also reviewed Calligra 2.8, concluding \u201cCalligra Suite is a solid offering that has grown considerably since branching out from its traditional KOffice roots. It has something for everyone. Its tools fills the needs of writers, artists, content designers and office workers.\u201d\nIn 2017, sempreupdate.com.br wrote: \u201c\"[If you do not] depend on proprietary formats [...] especially .xls, .xlsx and .doc [...] and you use KDE it's worth trying. Yes, regarding LibreOffice Calligra is still two steps behind [but] it also brings small differentials that would be welcomed in LibreOffice.\"\u201c\nTechnical details.\nCalligra is written with dependencies on KDE Frameworks 6 and Qt 6. Older versions depend on KDE Frameworks 5/Qt5, KDE Platform 4 and Qt 4, and even older versions of KOffice depend on KDElibs and Qt 3. Despite that Calligra Suite is released independently of the KDE Software Compilation or of the KDE Applications.\nAll components of the Calligra Suite are released under free software licenses and use OpenDocument as their native file format when applicable.\nThe developers of Calligra plan to share as much infrastructure as possible between applications to reduce bugs and improve the user experience. This is done by common technologies like Flake and Pigment. Flake provides a way to handle shapes, which can contain text, images, formulas (via KFormula), charts (via KChart) or other objects, in a consistent way across all applications. The Calligra team also wants to create an OpenDocument library for use in other KDE applications that will allow developers to easily add support for reading and outputting OpenDocument files to their applications. Automating tasks and extending the suite with custom functionality can be done with D-Bus. Previously it was possible to also use scripting languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript through the Kross scripting framework.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17401", "revid": "44522647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17401", "title": "Fumimaro Konoe", "text": "Prime Minister of Japan (1937\u20131939; 1940\u20131941)\n was a Japanese politician who served as Prime Minister of Japan from 1937 to 1939 and from 1940 to 1941. He presided over the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and breakdown in relations with the United States, which shortly after his tenure culminated in Japan's entry into World War II. Konoe played a central role in transforming Japan into a totalitarian state by pushing through the State General Mobilization Law and establishing the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.\nBorn in Tokyo to a prominent aristocratic family, Konoe graduated from Kyoto University and took up his father's seat in the House of Peers in 1916. He was a member of the Japanese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference following World War I, and served as president of the House of Peers from 1933 to 1937. In June 1937, Konoe became prime minister of Japan on the recommendation of his mentor Saionji Kinmochi. When the Marco Polo Bridge Incident took place a month later, he oversaw an escalation of tensions with the Republic of China which ultimately culminated in the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the early years of the conflict, Konoe's government presided over numerous victories against Chinese forces as well as the widespread perpetration of war crimes (including the Nanjing Massacre). In 1938, he enacted the State General Mobilization Law which massively expanded the government's control over Japanese civilians in order to place the country on a war footing. In January 1939, Konoe resigned as the Japanese military proved unable to achieve a decisive victory in China. \nAfter resigning as Japan's head of government, Konoe served as chairman of the Privy Council until being once again appointed prime minister in July 1940. Later that year, he founded the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and oversaw the signing of the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. During his second premiership, Konoe also presided over the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, the formal recognition of Wang Jingwei's puppet government in Nanjing and the conclusion of the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact. Despite attempting to resolve growing tensions with the United States, a rigid timetable imposed by the military on the negotiations and Konoe's own inflexibility set the two countries on the path to war. Politically isolated, Konoe resigned as premier in October 1941 and was replaced by Hideki Tojo. Six weeks later, the Pacific War broke out after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nKonoe remained a close advisor to Emperor Hirohito until the end of World War II and played a key role in the fall of the T\u014dj\u014d Cabinet in 1944. At the start of the Allied occupation of Japan in August 1945, he briefly served as a minister in the cabinet of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, but came under suspicion of war crimes. On 16 December 1945, Konoe committed suicide by ingesting cyanide before he could be arrested by the authorities.\nEarly life.\nFumimaro Konoe (often \"Konoye\"), was born in Tokyo on 12 October 1891 to the prominent Konoe family, one of the main branches of the ancient Fujiwara clan. This made the Konoe \"head of the most prestigious, and highest ranking noble house in the realm.\" They had first become independent of the Fujiwara in the 12th century, when Minamoto no Yoritomo divided the Fujiwara into the Five Regent Houses (\"go-sekke\"). Japanese historian Eri Hotta described the Konoe as \"First among the go-sekke\"; Fumimaro would be its 29th leader. While the average height of Japanese people at that time was around 160\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 3 in), Konoe was over 180\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 11 in) tall.\nKonoe's father, Atsumaro, had been politically active, having organized the Anti-Russia Society in 1903. Fumimaro's mother died shortly after his birth; his father then married her younger sister. Fumimaro was misled into thinking she was his real mother, and found out the truth when he was 12 years old after his father's death.\nUpon his father's death in 1912, Fumimaro not only inherited his father's aristocratic title of \"k\u014dshaku\" (duke or prince) but also his debt. Thanks to the financial support of the zaibatsu Sumitomo, which he received throughout his career, and the auction of Fujiwara heirlooms, the family was able to become solvent. Fumimaro's younger brother, Hidemaro Konoye, later became a symphony conductor and founded NHK Symphony Orchestra.\nAfter graduating from Taimei Elementary School, he went on to study at Gakushuin, which was an institution to educate the children of the children of Japan's nobility. He was inspired by Inazo Nitobe, the dean of the First Higher School. Uncharacteristically for someone from a high-ranking aristocratic background, he chose to study at the First Higher School for university preparatory education, instead of staying at Gakushuin. Upon graduating in 1912, he proceeded to study philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, where he again studied together with his former peers from Gakushuin. Konoe subsequently transferred to the law department of Kyoto Imperial University. One of his professors was the Marxist economist Hajime Kawakami. Under Kawakami's influence, Konoe became interested in socialism as a student and wrote a Japanese translation Oscar Wilde's \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism.\"\nWhile in Kyoto, Konoe met the genr\u014d Saionji Kinmochi and became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. After graduation, Fumimaro turned to Saionji for advice about starting a political career, and worked briefly in the home ministry before accompanying his mentor to Versailles as part of the Japanese peace delegation.\nIn December 1918, Konoe also published an essay entitled . In this article, he argued that western democracies were supporting democracy, peace, and self-determination only hypocritically, while actually undermining those ideals through racially discriminatory imperialism. He attacked the League of Nations as an effort to institutionalize the status quo: colonial hegemony by the western powers. Following a translation by American journalist Thomas Franklin Fairfax Millard, Saionji wrote a rebuttal in his journal, \"Millard's Review of the Far East\". Saionji considered Konoe's writing reckless, but, after it became internationally read, Konoe was invited to dinner by Sun Yat-sen. Sun admired Japan's quick modernization; at the dinner, they discussed pan-Asian nationalism.\nDuring the Paris Peace Conference, Konoe was one of the Japanese diplomats who proposed the Racial Equality Proposal for the Covenant of the League of Nations. When the Racial Equality Clause came up before the committee, it received the support of Japan, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, and China. However, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson overturned the vote, declaring that the clause needed unanimous support. Konoe regarded the rejection of the Racial Equality Clause as a significant setback and a reflection of discriminatory attitudes toward Japan.\nUpon his return to Japan he published a booklet where he described his travels to France, Britain and the U.S. Konoe noted how he was angered by rising anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States and how the US government discriminated against Japanese immigrants. He also described China as a rival to Japan in international relations.\nHouse of Peers.\nIn 1916, while at university, Fumimaro took his father's seat in the House of Peers, upper house of the Imperial Diet. After his return from Europe he was aggressively recruited by the most powerful political faction of Japan's budding Taish\u014d democracy of the 1920s: the \"kenkyukai\", a conservative, militaristic faction, led by Yamagata Aritomo and generally opposed to democratic reform. In September 1922, he joined them.\nThe opposing faction was the \"seiyukai\", led by Hara Takashi, which drew its strength from the lower house. Eventually the \"seiyukai\" was able to gain the Aritomo's support, and Hara Takashi became prime minister in 1918. Konoe believed the House of Peers should stay neutral in factional party politics, lest a partisan-seeming peerage have their privileges restricted. He therefore supported Takashi's \"seiyukai\" government, as did most of the \"kenkyukai\".\nHowever, by 1923, the \"seiyukai\" had split into two factions and could no longer control the government. During the premiership of Kato Komei and his party, the \"kenseikai\", Konoe supported universal male suffrage to forestall serious curtailment of the noble privileges. Konoe believed universal male suffrage was the best way to channel popular discontent and thereby reduce the chance of violent revolution. As the house of peers became allied with different political factions in the lower house, Konoe left the \"kenkyukai\" in November 1927.\nLike his position in regard to the nobility, he believed that the emperor should not take political positions. In his eyes, a political emperor would diminish the imperial prestige, undermine the unifying power of the throne, expose the emperor to criticism, and potentially undermine domestic tranquillity. His greatest fear in this period of rapid industrialization would become the threat of left-wing revolution, facilitated by the petty factionalism of Taish\u014d democracy's political factions. He saw the peerage as a bulwark of stability committed to tranquillity, harmony, and the maintenance of the status quo. Its function was to restrain the excesses of the elected government, but its power had to be used sparingly.\nAlliance with Home Ministry.\nThe Japanese home ministry was extremely powerful, in charge of the police, elections, public works, Shinto shrines, and land development. The home ministry was also abused to influence elections in favour of the ruling party. Despite having once believed it to be beneath the dignity of a nobleman, Konoe entered into an alliance with important home ministry officials. The most important among these officials was Yoshiharu Tazawa, whom he met after he became the managing director of the Japan Youth Hall (\"Nippon Seinenkan\") in 1921. Konoe and his allies saw the influence of local \"meiboka\" political bosses as a threat to Japan's political stability. Universal suffrage had opened the vote to the undereducated peasantry, but local bosses, using pork-barrel politics, manipulated their influence on the government. These officials also shared Konoe's concern about party influence within the home ministry, which had seen great turnover mirroring the political upheaval occurring in the Diet. Konoe's association with the youth hall began two months after the publication of an article in July 1921, where he stressed education of the electorate's political wisdom and morality, and lamented that education only taught youth to accept ideas passively from their superiors. The Youth Corps (\"Seinendan\") was thereafter created to foster a moral sense of civic duty among the people, with the overall purpose of destroying the \"meiboka\" system.\nIn 1925, Konoe and these officials formed the Alliance for a New Japan (\"Shin Nippon Domei\"), which endorsed the concept of representative government but rejected the value of party and local village bosses, instead advocating that new candidates from outside the parties should run for office. The Association for Election Purification (\"Senkyo Shukusei D\u014dmeikai\") was also created, an organization whose purpose was to circumvent and weaken pork-barrel local politics by supporting candidates that were not beholden to \"meiboka\" bosses. The alliance formed a political party (\"meiseikai\") but was unable to secure popular support and dissolved within two years of formation (in 1928).\nRoad to first premiership.\nIn the 1920s Japanese foreign policy was largely in line with Anglo-American policy, the Treaty of Versailles, and the Washington Naval Conference treaty, and there was agreement between the great powers over the establishment of an independent Chinese state. A flourishing party system controlled the cabinet in alliance with industry. The Great Depression of the 1930s, the rise of Soviet military power in the east, further insistence on limitations to Japanese naval power, and increased Chinese resistance to Japanese aggression in Asia marked the abandonment of Japanese cooperation with the Anglo-American powers. The Japanese government began to seek autonomy in foreign policy, and \u2013 as the sense of crisis deepened \u2013 unity and mobilization became overarching imperatives.\nKonoe assumed the vice presidency of the House of Peers in 1931. In 1932, political parties lost control of the cabinet. Thenceforth, cabinets were formed by alliances of political elites and military factions. As Japan mobilized its resources for war, the government increased suppression of political parties and what remained of the left wing. Konoe ascended to the presidency of the House of Peers in 1933 and spent the next few years mediating between elite political factions, elite policy consensus, and national unity.\nMeanwhile, Fumimaro sent his eldest son Fumitaka to study in the U.S., at Princeton, wishing to prepare him for politics and make him an able proponent of Japan in America. Unlike most of his elite contemporaries, Fumimaro had not been educated abroad due to his father's poor finances. Fumimaro visited Fumitaka in 1934 and he was shocked by rising anti-Japanese sentiment. This experience deepened his resentment of the U.S., which he perceived as selfish and racist, and which he blamed for its failure to avert economic disaster. In a speech in 1935, Konoe said that the \"monopolization\" of resources by the Anglo-American alliance must end and be replaced by an \"international new deal\" to help countries like Japan take care of their growing populations.\nKonoe's views were thus a recapitulation of those he had expressed at Versailles almost 20 years earlier. He still believed that Japan was the equal and the rival of the western powers, that Japan had a right to expansion in China, that such expansion was \"survival\", and that the \"Anglo-American powers were hypocrites seeking to enforce their economic dominance of the world\".\nPrime Minister and war with China.\nDespite his tutelage under the liberal-leaning Saionji Kinmochi, his study of socialism at university, and his support of universal suffrage, he seemed to have had a contradictory attraction to fascism, which angered and alarmed the ageing . At a costume party before Saionji's daughter was married in 1937, he dressed as Adolf Hitler. Despite these misgivings, Saionji nominated Konoe to the Emperor Hirohito, and in June 1937 Konoe became Prime Minister.\nUpon assuming office, First Konoe Cabinet spent the short time between then and war with China attempting to secure pardons for the ultranationalist leaders of the 26 February incident, who had attempted to assassinate his mentor Saionji. Konoe retained the military and legal ministers from the previous cabinet upon assumption of the premiership, and refused to take ministers from the political parties, as he was not interested in resurrecting party government. One month later, Japanese troops clashed with Chinese troops near Beijing in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Nevertheless, a consensus emerged among Japanese military leadership that the nation was not ready for war with China, and a truce was made on 11 July. The ceasefire was broken by 20 July after Konoe's government sent more divisions to China, causing full-scale war to erupt.\nIn November 1937, Konoe instituted a new system of joint conference between the civil government and the military called liaison conferences. In attendance at these liaison meetings were the prime minister, the foreign minister, the ministers of the army and navy, and their chiefs of general staff. This arrangement resulted in an imbalance in favor of the military, since each member in attendance had an equal say in policymaking.\nPrior to the capture of Nanjing, Chang Kai-shek, through the German ambassador in China, attempted to negotiate, but Konoe rejected the overture.\nAfter taking Nanjing, the Imperial Japanese Army was doubtful about its ability to advance up the Yangtze river valley, and favoured taking up a German offer of mediation to end the war with China. Konoe opposed immediate peace negotiations, and instead chose to escalate the war by suggesting deliberately humiliating terms that he knew Chiang Kai-shek would never accept in order to win a \"total victory\" over China.\nIn January 1938, Konoe issued a statement declaring that Kuomintang aggression had not ceased despite its defeat, that it was \"subjecting its people to great misery\", and that Japan would no longer deal with Chiang. Six days later, he gave a speech where he blamed China for the continued conflict. When later asked for clarifications, Konoe said he meant more than just non-recognition of Chiang's regime but \"rejected it\" and would \"eradicate it\". The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote about Konoe's escalation of the war: \"The one time in the decade between 1931 and 1941 that the civilian authorities in Tokyo mustered the energy, courage and ingenuity to overrule the military on a major peace issue they did so with fatal results \u2013 fatal for Japan, fatal for China, and for Konoe himself.\"\nDue to a trade imbalance, Japan had lost a large amount of its gold reserves by late 1937. Konoe believed that a new economic system geared toward exploitation of northern China's resources was the only way to stop this economic deterioration. In response to continued U.S. support for the so-called Open Door Policy, Konoe rejected it \"as he had since Versailles, but left open possible western interests in southern China\". In a declaration on 3 November 1938, Konoe said Japan sought a new order in east Asia, that Chiang no longer spoke for China, that Japan would reconstruct China without help from foreign powers, and that a \"tripartite relationship of\u00a0... Japan, Manchukuo, and China\" would \"create a new culture, and realize close economic cohesion throughout east Asia\".\nIn April 1938, Konoe and the military pushed a State General Mobilization Law through the Diet, which declared a state of emergency, allowed the central government to control all manpower and material, and rationed the flow of raw materials into the Japanese market. Japanese victories continued at Xuzhou, Hankow, Canton, Wuchang, and Hanyang, but Chinese resistance nonetheless continued. Konoe resigned in January 1939, leaving the war that he had a large part in making to be finished by someone else, and was appointed chairman of the Privy Council. The Japanese public, which had been told that the war was an endless series of victories, was bewildered.\nKiichir\u014d Hiranuma succeeded him as prime minister. Konoe was awarded the 1st class of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1939.\nKonoe's second premiership, the Matsuoka foreign policy.\nDue to dissatisfaction with the policies of Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai later that year, the Japanese Army demanded Konoe's return. Yonai had refused to align Japan with the Nazis; in response, the army minister Shunroku Hata resigned and the army refused to nominate a replacement. Konoe was recalled after Saionji \u2013 for the last time before his death later that year \u2013 again endorsed him.\nOn 23 June, Konoe resigned his position as Chairman of the Privy Council, and on 16 July 1940, the Yonai Cabinet resigned and Konoe was appointed prime minister again. Konoe did set out to end the war in with China. But Konoe also deemed political parties as too liberal and divisive, thereby aiding the pro-war factions in the military. \nThe Imperial Rule Assistance Association (IRAA) was created in 1940 under Second Konoe Cabinet as a wartime mobilization organization, ironically in alliance with local , since their cooperation was required to mobilize the rural population. Konoe's government pressured political parties to dissolve into the IRAA, though he resisted calls to form a political party akin to the Nazi party, believing it would revive the political strife of the 1920s. Additionally, he worried that becoming the head of a political party would be beneath the dignity of a nobleman. Instead, he worked to promote the IRAA as the sole political order.\nEven before Konoe had been recalled, the army had already planned an invasion of French Indochina. The invasion would secure needed resources to wage war with China, cut off western supply of Kuomintang armies, put the Japanese military in a strategic location to threaten more territory, and hopefully intimidate the Dutch East Indies into supplying Japan with oil. The U.S. responded with the Export Control Act and increased aid to Chiang. Despite this response, foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka signed the Tripartite Pact on 27 September 1940, over the objection of some of Konoe's advisors, including former Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Kikujiro Ishii. In a press conference on 4 October, Konoe said the U.S. should not misunderstand the intentions of the tripartite powers and should help them to build a new world order. Additionally he said that if the U.S. did not end its provocative actions and deliberately chose to misunderstand the actions of the tripartite powers, there would be no option left but war. \nIn November 1940, Japan signed the Sino-Japanese treaty with Wang Jingwei, who had been a disciple of Sun Yat-sen and headed a rival Kuomintang government in Nanjing. But Konoe's Government did not relinquish all held territory to Jinwei's government, undercutting its authority, and Wang's government was largely seen as an illegitimate puppet. In December 1940, the British reopened the Burma Road and lent \u00a310 million to Chiang's Kuomintang. Konoe recommenced negotiations with the Dutch in January 1941 in an attempt to secure an alternate source of oil.\nIn February 1941 Konoe chose Admiral Kichisabur\u014d Nomura as Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Matsuoka and Stalin signed the Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact in Moscow on 13 April 1941, which made it clear that the Soviets would not help the Allies in the event of war with Japan. On 18 April 1941, word arrived from Nomura of a diplomatic breakthrough, a draft of understanding between the US and Japan. The basis of this agreement had been drafted by two American Maryknoll priests James Edward Walsh and James M. Drought, who had met Roosevelt through Postmaster General Frank C. Walker. The outline of the proposal, which had been drafted in consultation with banker Tadao Ikawa, Colonel Hideo Iwakura, and Nomura, included American recognition of Manchukuo, the merging of Chiang's government with the Japanese-backed Reorganized National Government of China, normalization of trade relations, withdrawal of Japanese troops from China, mutual respect for Chinese independence, and an agreement that Japanese immigration to the United States would proceed on the basis of equality with other nationals free from discrimination.\nWhen Matsuoka returned to Tokyo, a liaison conference was held, during which he voiced his opposition to the draft of understanding, believing it would betray their Nazi allies. After arguing that Japan should let Germany see this draft, he left the meeting, citing exhaustion, Konoe also retreated to his villa, also claiming a fever, instead of forcing the issue. Matsuoka pushed for an immediate attack on British Singapore and began to openly criticise Konoe and his cabinet, leading to suspicions that he wanted to replace Konoe as prime minister. Matsuoka changed the U.S. draft into a counteroffer that essentially gutted most of the Japanese concessions in regard to China and expansion in the Pacific and had Nomura deliver it to Washington.\nOn Sunday, 22 June 1941, Hitler broke the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact by invading the Soviet Union. Coincident with the invasion, Cordell Hull delivered another amendment of the draft on understanding to the Japanese, but this time there was no recognition of the Japanese right to control of Manchukuo. The new draft also completely rejected the Japanese right of military expansion in the Pacific. Hull included a statement that in summary said that as long as Japan was allied to Hitler an agreement would be next to impossible to achieve. He did not specifically mention Matsuoka, but it was implied that he would have to be removed, as the foreign minister was now advocating an immediate attack on the Soviet Union, and did so directly to the emperor. Konoe was forced to apologize to the emperor and assure him that Japan was not about to go to war with the Soviet Union. Masanobu Tsuji had planned to assassinate Konoe if peace had occurred with the United States in order for Japan to attack the Soviet Union, which was at war with Japan's ally Germany.\nMatsuoka was convinced that Operation Barbarossa would be a quick German victory, and he was now opposed to attacking Singapore because he believed it would provoke war with the western allies. After a series of liaison conferences where Matsuoka argued forcefully in favour of an attack against the Soviet Union and against further expansion southward, the decision was made to invade and occupy the southern half of French Indochina, which was formalized in an imperial conference on 2 July. Included in this imperial conference resolution was a statement that Japan would not flinch from war with the U.S. and Britain if necessary. Beginning on 10 July, Konoe held a series of liaison conferences to discuss the Japanese response to Hull's latest amendment to the draft of understanding. It was decided that a reply would not be given until the Japanese takeover of southern Indochina was complete, hoping that if it went peacefully, perhaps the U.S. could be convinced to tolerate the occupation without intervention. On 14 July, Matsuoka drafted a response \u2013 through illness \u2013 which said Japan would not abandon the tripartite pact. He attacked Hull's statement, which had been aimed largely at him, and the next day he sent the response to Germany for approval. Sending the draft to the Germans without the cabinet's permission was the final straw. Konoe and his cabinet resigned en masse and reformed the government without Matsuoka on 16 July, when Matsuoka did not attend due to illness.\nThird government and attempt to avoid war with the United States.\nThe Third Konoe Cabinet was formally created on 18 July 1941, with admiral Teijir\u014d Toyoda as foreign minister. The Franklin D. Roosevelt administration hoped that Matsuoka's dismissal would mean Japan was standing down from continued aggressive action; these hopes were dashed when the French government, after being threatened with military action, allowed the Japanese army to occupy all of French Indochina on 22 July. Two days later, the U.S. cut off negotiations and froze Japanese assets, the British, Dutch, and Canadian governments following suit shortly thereafter. The same day Roosevelt met with Nomura, where he told the ambassador that if Japan would agree to pull out of Indochina and agree to its being granted a status of neutrality, Japanese assets could be unfrozen. Roosevelt implied that Japanese expansion in China would be tolerated, but Indochina was a red line. He expressed how disturbed he was that Japan could not see that Hitler was bent on world domination. Konoe did not take aggressive action in implementing Roosevelt's offer, and could not restrain militarists, led by Hideki Tojo. As minister of war, Tojo regarded the seizure as irreversible due to its approval by the emperor.\nOn 28 July, the Japanese began to formally occupy southern Indochina. In response, on 1 August, the U.S. embargoed oil exports to Japan, surprising Konoe's cabinet. Finding a replacement source of petroleum was paramount, as the U.S. supplied 93% of Japan's oil in 1940. Navy chief of staff Osami Nagano informed Emperor Hirohito that Japan's oil stockpiles would be completely depleted in two years. The same day, Hachir\u014d Arita wrote Konoe a letter telling him that he should not have let the military occupy southern Indochina while negotiations with the U.S. were still ongoing. Konoe responded that the ships were already dispatched and could not turn back in time, and that all he could do was pray for \"divine intervention\".\nOn 6 August, Konoe's government announced that it would only pull out of Indochina when the war in China was concluded, rejected Roosevelt's neutralization proposal, but promised not to expand further and asked for US mediation in ending the war in China. On 8 August, Konoe requested, through Nomura, a meeting with Roosevelt. The suggestion came from Kinkazu Saionji, the grandson of his deceased mentor Saionji Kinmochi. Kinkazu advised Konoe through a monthly informal breakfast club, where Konoe consulted with civilian elites about policy. Hotsumi Ozaki, who was a friend and advisor to Konoe, was a member of this same breakfast club; he was also a member of Richard Sorge's Soviet spy ring.\nNomura met with Roosevelt and told him about Konoe's summit proposal. After condemning Japanese aggression in Indochina, Roosevelt said he was open to the meeting, and suggested they could meet in Juneau, Alaska. On 3 September, a liaison conference was held where it was decided that Konoe would continue to seek peace with Roosevelt, but, at the same time, Japan would commit to war if a peace agreement did not materialize by mid-October. Moreover, Japan would not abandon the tripartite pact. Konoe, Saionji, and his supporters had drafted a proposal that emphasized a willingness to withdraw troops from China, but Konoe did not introduce this proposal and instead acceded to a proposal from the foreign ministry. The difference in the proposals was that the foreign ministry's was conditioned on an agreement being reached between China and Japan before troops would be withdrawn.\nOn 5 September, Konoe met the emperor with chiefs of staff General Hajime Sugiyama and Admiral Osami Nagano to inform him of the cabinet's decision to commit to war in the absence of a diplomatic breakthrough. Alarmed, the emperor asked what had happened to the negotiations with Roosevelt. He asked Konoe to change the emphasis from war to negotiation; Konoe replied that would be politically impossible, and the emperor then asked why he had been kept in the dark about these military preparations. The emperor then questioned Sugiyama about the chances of success of an open war with the West. After Sugiyama answered positively, Hirohito scolded him, remembering that the Army had predicted that the invasion of China would be completed in only three months.\nOn 6 September, the Emperor approved the cabinet's decision at an imperial conference after being given assurance by the two chiefs of staff that diplomacy was the primary emphasis, with war only as a fall-back option in the event of diplomatic failure. That same evening, Konoe arranged a dinner in secrecy with U.S. ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew. (This was somewhat perilous: on 15 August, Hiranuma Kiichiro, a member of Konoe's cabinet and former prime minister, had been shot six times by an ultra-nationalist because he was seen as too close to Grew.) Konoe told Grew that he was prepared to travel to meet Roosevelt on a moment's notice. Grew then urged his superiors to advise Roosevelt to accept the summit proposal.\nThe day after the imperial conference, Konoe arranged a meeting between Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni and army minister Tojo, which was an attempt to bring the war hawk in line with Konoe. Higashikuni told Tojo that since the Emperor and Konoe favoured negotiation over war, the army minister should too, and that he should quit if he could not follow a policy of non-confrontation. Tojo replied that if the western encirclement of Japan were to be accepted, Japan would cease to exist. Tojo believed that even if there was only a small chance of winning a war with the U.S., Japan must prepare for it and wage it rather than be encircled and destroyed.\nOn 10 September, Nomura met with Hull, who told him that the latest Japanese offer was a non-starter and that Japan would have to make concessions in regard to China before the summit meeting could take place. On 20 September, a liaison meeting passed a revised proposal that actually \"hardened\" conditions for a withdrawal from China. At the liaison conference of 25 September, sensing that summit negotiations were stalling, Tojo and the militarists pressed the cabinet to commit to an actual deadline for war of 15 October. After this meeting, Konoe told lord keeper of the privy seal K\u014dichi Kido that he was going to resign, but Kido talked him out of it. Konoe then secluded himself in a villa at Kamakura until 2 October, leaving foreign minister Toyoda to take charge of negotiations in his absence. Toyoda asked ambassador Grew to tell Roosevelt that Konoe would only be able to grant concessions at the summit but could not commit beforehand due to the influence of the militarists and the risk that any conciliation beforehand would be leaked to the Germans in an effort to bring down the Konoe cabinet. Grew argued in favour of the summit to Roosevelt in a communication on 29 September.\nOn 1 October, Konoe summoned navy minister Koshir\u014d Oikawa to Kamakura, where he secured his commitment of cooperation in acceptance American demands, the navy being acutely aware of the long odds of victory in the event of war with the U.S. Oikawa returned to Tokyo and seemed to secure the cooperation of navy chief of staff Nagano, including Toyoda as foreign minister they formed a potential majority in the next liaison conference. On 2 October, Hull delivered to Nomura a statement constituting the preconditions for a summit meeting. Hull made it clear that the Japanese army would have to demonstrate that they were going to pull troops out of French Indochina and China.\nAt the 4 October liaison conference, Hull's response was still being processed and could not be fully discussed; Nagano changed his position and now agreed with the army and advocated a deadline for war. Konoe and Oikawa were largely silent and did not try to bring him back to the side of negotiation, further postponing a final decision. The army and the navy were in opposition to each other and held separate high-level meetings, each respectively confirming their resolve to either go to war or pull back from the brink. But Nagano continued to oppose open confrontation of the army, while Oikawa did not want to take the lead as the only member of the liaison conference to oppose war.\nKonoe met privately with Tojo twice in a failed attempt to convince him to a troop withdrawal and to take the war option off the table on 5 and 7 October. In the 7 October meeting, Konoe told Tojo that \"military men take wars too lightly\". Tojo's response was, \"occasionally one must gather up enough courage, close one's eyes and jump off the platform of the Kiyomizu.\" Konoe responded that, while such a policy was okay for the individual, \"if I think of the national polity that has lasted twenty six hundred years and of the hundred million Japanese belonging to this nation, I, as a person in the position of great responsibility, cannot do such a thing.\" The next day Tojo met with Oikawa and showed some doubt when he told him that it would be a betrayal of those who had already died in the war for the army to pull troops out of China, but that he was also worried about the many more who would die in an eventual war with the U.S., and that he was considering a troop withdrawal.\nKonoe held a meeting on 12 October with military ministers Tojo and Oikawa and foreign minister Toyoda, which became known as the Tekigaiso conference. Konoe began by saying that he had no confidence in the war they were about to wage and would not lead it, but neither Oikawa or Konoe was willing to take the lead in demanding that the army agree to taking the war option off the table. Toyoda was the only member willing to declare that the imperial conference of 6 September was a mistake, implying that the war option should be taken off the table, while Tojo forcefully argued that an imperial resolution could not be violated.\nOn 14 October, one day before the deadline, Konoe and Tojo met one last time, where Konoe attempted to impress upon Tojo the need to stand down from war and accede to U.S. demands for a military withdrawal from China and Indochina. Tojo ruled a troop withdrawal as out of the question. In the cabinet meeting that followed, Tojo declared that the decision of the imperial conference had been thoroughly deliberated, that hundreds of thousands of troops were being moved south as they spoke, that if diplomacy were to continue they must be sure that it would result in success, and that the imperial edict had specifically declared that negotiations must bear fruit by early October (which meant the deadline had already been passed). After this conference Tojo went to see lord keeper of the privy seal Kido, to push for Konoe's resignation.\nThat same evening Tojo sent Teiichi Suzuki (at that time the head of the cabinet planning board) to Konoe with a message urging him to resign, stating that if he resigned Tojo would endorse prince Higashikuni as the next prime minister. Suzuki told Konoe that Tojo realized now that the navy was unwilling to admit that it could not fight the U.S. He also told Konoe that Tojo believed the current cabinet must resign and bear the responsibility of wrongfully calling for the imperial edict, and only someone of Higashikuni's imperial background could reverse it. The next day, on 15 October, Konoe's friend and advisor Hotsumi Ozaki was exposed and arrested as a Soviet spy.\nKonoe resigned on 16 October 1941, one day after having recommended Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni to the Emperor as his successor. Two days later, Hirohito appointed war minister, General Hideki Tojo as the next prime minister by following Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal K\u014dichi Kido's advice. In 1946, Hirohito explained this decision: \"I actually thought Prince Higashikuni suitable as chief of staff of the Army; but I think the appointment of a member of the imperial house to a political office must be considered very carefully. Above all, in time of peace this is fine, but when there is a fear that there may even be a war, then more importantly, considering the welfare of the imperial house, I wonder about the wisdom of a member of the imperial family serving [as prime minister].\" Six weeks later, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.\nKonoe justified his demission to his secretary Kenji Tomita. \"Of course His Imperial Majesty is a pacifist and he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday but you do not have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands.\"\nPost-premiership, final years of the war and suicide.\nOn 29 November 1941, at a luncheon with the Emperor with all living former prime ministers in attendance, Konoe voiced his objection to war. Upon hearing of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Konoe said regarding Japan's military success, \"What on earth? I really feel a miserable defeat coming; this will only last 2 or 3 months.\"\nKonoe played a role in the fall of the T\u014dj\u014d Cabinet in 1944 following the defeat in the Battle of Saipan. In February 1945, during the first private audience he had been allowed in three years, he advised the Emperor to begin negotiations to end World War II. According to Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, the Emperor, still looking for a (a great victory), firmly rejected Konoe's recommendation.\nOn 14 February 1945, Konoe wrote a report to Hirohito titled \"The Konoe Memorial\" which called for Hirohito to surrender to the Allies to prevent a \"communist revolution\" in Japan. He cited the threat of \"communist agitators\" such as Okano (alias of Japanese Communist Party leader Sanz\u014d Nosaka), Soviet expansionism, and Pro-Soviet elements within the government.\nAfter the beginning of the Allied occupation according to the surrender of Japan, Konoe served in the cabinet of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, the first post-war government. He came under suspicion of war crimes after he refused to collaborate with U.S. Army officer Bonner Fellers in \"Operation Blacklist\", which aimed to exonerate Emperor Hirohito and the imperial family of criminal responsibility for the war. \nKonoe preferred death to the humiliation of a war crimes trial. The night before he was to leave to Sugamo prison on 15 December 1945, his son Michitaka searched his room for weapons and poison. Konoe and his son talked at length that night about the invasion of China, negotiations with the US, and the heavy responsibility he felt toward the emperor and the Japanese people. Fumimaro recorded his feelings about these issues in pencil at the urging of his son. According to Michitaka, he apologized to his father for his failure to be a filial son, sensing that these may be their last moments together. His father rebuffed him, replying \"What does 'to be filial' mean?\", then turned away. They sat in silence until Michitaka told his father to go to sleep and asked him if he was going to leave tomorrow. Fumimaro didn't reply but Michitaka gazed at him. Fumimaro gazed back and Michitaka had never seen such a strange and distasteful expression on his father's face. For the first time he perceived the older man's intention to die. Just before dawn, Michitaka was awakened by his mother's excited voice, when he entered his father's room Fumimaro was stretched out, looking calm and serene, as if asleep. A brownish bottle, empty, lay beside his pillow. He had died by suicide by taking potassium cyanide. His grave is at the Konoe clan cemetery at the temple of Daitoku-ji in Kyoto.\nHis grandson, Morihiro Hosokawa, became prime minister fifty years later, on 9 August 1993.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Sinospheric culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the Emperor of China, as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship.\nTerminology.\nThe word kowtow is derived from the Cantonese pronunciation of / (). An alternative Chinese term is / (); however, the meaning is somewhat altered: has the general meaning of \"knock\", whereas has the general meaning of \"touch upon (a surface)\", / meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime during the Spring and Autumn period or the Warring States period of China's history (771\u2013221 BC), because it was a custom by the time of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC).\nTraditional usage.\nIn Imperial Chinese protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the situation's solemnity, different kowtow grades would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example, at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the \"three kneelings and nine kowtows\", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. Immanuel Hsu describes the \"full kowtow\" as \"three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground\".\nAs government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate must kneel and kowtow. A commoner was required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who had earned a degree in the Imperial examinations was permitted a seat.\nSince one is required by Confucian philosophy to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.\nConfucius believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind. Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.\nModern Chinese usage.\nThe kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the May Fourth Movement. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing bow has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.\nThe kowtow is still used as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, Chinese martial arts schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Traditional performing arts often require the kowtow.\nReligion.\nProstration is a general practice in Buddhism, and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either \"worship with the crown (of the head)\" (\u9802\u79ae ding li) or \"casting the five limbs to the earth\" (\u4e94\u9ad4\u6295\u5730 wuti tou di)\u2014referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows\u2014stand up and kneel down again between each set\u2014as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term \"three kneelings and nine head knockings\" (\u4e09\u8dea\u4e5d\u53e9\u4e4b\u79ae). Some Buddhist pilgrims would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the Triple Gem of Buddhism, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. \nDiplomacy.\nThe word \"kowtow\" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from the physical act and the East Asian context.\nDutch ambassador Isaac Titsingh did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794\u20131795 mission to the imperial court of the Qianlong Emperor. The members of the Titsingh mission, including Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest and Chr\u00e9tien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes, made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex Imperial court etiquette.\nThe Qing courts gave bitter feedback to the Afghan emir Ahmad Shah when its Afghan envoy, presenting four splendid horses to Qianlong in 1763, refused to perform the kowtow. This was likely a result of the Islamic prohibition on performing Sujud before any except God. Coming amid tense relations between the Qing and Durrani empires, Chinese officials forbade the Afghans from sending envoys to Beijing in the future.\nOn two occasions, the kowtow was performed by Chinese envoys to a foreign ruler \u2013 specifically the Russian Tsar. T'o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina Anna, as per instructions by the Yongzheng Emperor, as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg. Hsu notes that the Kangxi Emperor, Yongzheng's predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China.\nThe kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor, Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896, when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War.\nThe King of the Ryukyu Kingdom also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground (), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.\nSee also.\nInternational:\nGeneral:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ko\u0142obrzeg is located on the Pars\u0119ta River on the south coast of the Baltic Sea (in the middle of the section divided by the Oder and Vistula Rivers). It is the capital of Ko\u0142obrzeg County.\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, the Pomeranian tribes established a settlement at the site of modern-day Budzistowo. In 1000, when the city was part of Poland, it became the seat of the Diocese of Ko\u0142obrzeg, one of five oldest Polish dioceses. During the High Middle Ages, the town was expanded with an additional settlement inhabited by German settlers a few kilometers north of the stronghold and chartered with L\u00fcbeck law, which settlement eventually superseded the original Pomeranian settlement. The city later joined the Hanseatic League. Within the Duchy of Pomerania the town was the urban center of the secular reign of the prince-bishops of Kamie\u0144 and their residence throughout the High and Late Middle Ages. In the modern age, it passed to Brandenburg and Prussia, and withstood a Polish-French siege in 1807. In the late 19th century it became a popular spa town at the Baltic Sea. In 1945, Polish and Soviet troops captured the town. Ko\u0142obrzeg, now part of post-war Poland and devastated in the preceding battle, was rebuilt, but lost its status as the regional center to the nearby city of Koszalin.\nEtymology.\n\"Ko\u0142obrzeg\" (and its Kashubian equivalent \"K\u00f2\u0142obrzeg\") translates as 'by the shore'; \"ko\u0142o\" means 'by', and \"brzeg\" means 'shore'. Its original name, Cholberg, was taken by Polish and Kashubian linguists in the 19th and 20th centuries to reconstruct the name. After German settlement, \"Cholberg\" evolved into \"Kolberg\".\nHistory.\nPomeranian stronghold at modern Budzistowo.\nAccording to Piskorski (1999) and Kempke (2001), Slavic and Lechitic immigration reached Farther Pomerania in the 7th century. First Slavic settlements in the vicinity of Ko\u0142obrzeg were centered around nearby deposits of salt and date to 6th and 7th century.\nIn the late 9th century, the Pomeranian tribes erected a fortified settlement at the site of modern part of Ko\u0142obrzeg county called Budzistowo near modern Ko\u0142obrzeg, replacing nearby Bardy-\u015awielubie, a multi-ethnic emporium, as the center of the region. The Parseta valley, where both the emporium and the stronghold were located, was one of the Pomeranians' core settlement areas. The stronghold consisted of a fortified burgh with a suburbium.\nThe Pomeranians mined salt in salt pans located in two downstream hills. They also engaged in fishing, and used the salt to conserve foodstuffs, primarily herring, for trade. Other important occupations were metallurgy and smithery, based on local iron ore reserves, other crafts like the production of combs from horn, and in the surrounding areas, agriculture. Important sites in the settlement were a place for periodical markets and a tavern, mentioned as \"forum et taberna\" in 1140.\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Budzistowo stronghold was the largest of several smaller ones in the Persante area, and as such is thought to have functioned as the center of the local Pomeranian subtribe. By the turn from the 10th to the 11th century, the smaller burghs in the Parseta area were given up. With the area coming under the control of the Polish Duke Mieszko I, only two strongholds remained and underwent an enlargement, the one at Budzistowo and a predecessor of later Bia\u0142ogard. These developments were most likely associated with the establishment of Polish power over this part of the Baltic coast. In the 10th century, the trade of salt and fish led to the development of the settlement into a town.\nPiast Poland and conversion.\nDuring Polish rule of the area in the late 10th century, the chronicle of Thietmar of Merseburg (975\u20131018) mentions \"salsa Cholbergiensis\" as the see of the Bishopric of Ko\u0142obrzeg, set up during the Congress of Gniezno in 1000 and placed under the Archdiocese of Gniezno. The congress was organized by Polish duke Boles\u0142aw Chrobry and Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, and also led to the establishment of bishoprics in Krak\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw, connecting the territories of the Polish state. It was an important event not only in religious, but also political dimension in the history of the early Polish state, as it unified and organized medieval Polish territories.\nThe missionary efforts of bishop Reinbern were not successful, the Pomeranians revolted in 1005 and regained political and spiritual independence. In 1013 Boles\u0142aw Chrobry removed his troops from Pomerania in face of war with Holy Roman Emperor Henry III. The Polish\u2013German war ended with Polish victory, which was confirmed by the 1018 Peace of Bautzen.\nDuring his campaigns in the early 12th century, Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth reacquired Pomerania for Poland, and made the local Griffin dynasty his vassals. The stronghold was captured by the Polish army in the winter of 1107/08, when the inhabitants (\"cives et oppidani\") including a duke (\"dux Pomeranorum\") surrendered without resistance. A previous Polish siege of the burgh had been unsuccessful; although the duke had fled the burgh, the Polish army was unable to break through the fortifications and the two gates. The army had however looted and burned the suburbium, which was not or only lightly fortified. The descriptions given by the contemporary chroniclers make it possible that a second, purely militarily used castle existed near the settlement, yet neither is this certain nor have archaeological efforts been able to locate traces thereof. In the 12th-century Polish chronicle \"Gesta principum Polonorum\" Ko\u0142obrzeg was named a significant and \"famous city\".\nDuring the subsequent Christianization of the area by Otto of Bamberg at the behest of Boles\u0142aw, a St. Mary's church was built. This marked the first beginnings of German influence in the area. After Boles\u0142aw's death, as a result of the fragmentation of Poland, the Duchy of Pomerania became independent, before the dukes became vassals of Denmark in 1185 and the Holy Roman Empire in 1227.\nBesides St. Mary's, a St. John's church and a St. Petri's chapel were built.\nA painting of the town of Ko\u0142obrzeg from the 13th century is located in the Museum of Polish Arms in the city.\nFrom the late Middle Ages to the Thirty Years' War.\nDuring the Ostsiedlung, a settlement was founded by German settlers some kilometres off the site of the Slavic/Lechitic one. It was located within the boundaries of today's downtown of Ko\u0142obrzeg and some of the inhabitants of the Polish town moved to the new settlement. On 23 May 1255 it was chartered under L\u00fcbeck law by Duke Wartislaw III of Pomerania, and more settlers arrived, attracted by the duke. Hermann von Gleichen, German bishop of Kammin also supported the German colonisation of the region. The settlers received several privileges such as exemption from certain taxes and several benefits, making it difficult for the indigenous Pomeranian population to compete with Germans.\nHenceforth, the nearby former stronghold was turned into a village and renamed \"Old Town\" (, , ), first documented in 1277 and used until 1945 when it was renamed \"Budzistowo\". A new St. Mary's church was built within the new town before the 1260s, while St. Mary's in the former Pomeranian stronghold was turned into a nuns' abbey. In 1277 St. Benedict's monastery for nuns was founded, which in the framework of the Pomeranian Reformation in 1545 was then changed into an educational institution for noble Protestant ladies.\nAlready in 1248, the Kammin bishops and the Pomeranian dukes had interchanged the \"terrae\" Stargard and Kolberg, leaving the bishops in charge of the latter. When in 1276 they became the souvereign of the town also, they moved their residence there, while the administration of the diocese was done from nearby K\u00f6slin (Koszalin). In 1345, the bishops became Imperial immediate dukes in their secular reign.\nIn 1361, the city joined the Hanseatic League. In 1446 it fought a battle against the nearby rival city of Koszalin.\nWhen the property of the Bishopric of Kammin was secularized during the Protestant Reformation in 1534, their secular reign including the Kolberg area became intermediately ruled by a Lutheran titular bishop, before it was turned into a \"Sekundogenitur\" of the House of Pomerania.\nIn the 15th century the city traded with Scotland, Amsterdam and Scandinavia. Beer, salt, honey, wool and flour were exported, while merchants imported textiles from England, southern fruits, and cod liver oil. In the 16th century, the city reached 5,000 inhabitants. The indigenous Slavs in the city were discriminated, and their rights in trade and crafts were limited, with bans on performing certain types of professions and taking certain positions in the city, for instance in 1564 it was forbidden to admit native Slavs to the blacksmiths' guild.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, Kolberg was occupied by imperial forces from 1627 to 1630, and thereafter by Swedish forces.\nModern era: In Prussia.\nKolberg, with most of Farther Pomerania, was granted to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648 by the Treaty of Westphalia and, after the signing of the Treaty of Stettin (1653), and in accordance with the Treaty of Grimnitz, was part of the Province of Pomerania. In the 1690s, French Huguenot immigrants and merchants from the Netherlands settled in the city, however, due to the bankruptcy of the merchants, the hired French preacher left for Warsaw in 1700, and several merchants went back to the Netherlands. It became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In the 18th century, trade with Poland declined, while the production of textiles was developed. In 1761, during the Seven Years' War, the town was captured after three subsequent sieges by the Russian commander Peter Rumyantsev. At the end of the war, however, Kolberg was returned to Prussia.\nIn the Napoleonic Wars, during Napoleon's invasion of Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition, the town was besieged from mid-March to 2 July 1807 by the Grande Arm\u00e9e and by insurgents from Poland against Prussian rule (a street named after General Antoni Pawe\u0142 Su\u0142kowski, who led Polish troops, is located within the present-day city). As a result of forced conscription, some Poles were also among Prussian soldiers during the battle. The city's defense, led by then Lieutenant-Colonel August von Gneisenau, held out until the war was ended by the Treaty of Tilsit. Kolberg was returned to the Prussian province of Pomerania in 1815, after the final defeat of Napoleon; until 1872, it was administered within the F\u00fcrstenthum District (\"Principality District\", recalling the area's former special status), then it was within Landkreis Kolberg-K\u00f6rlin.\nMarcin Dunin, Archbishop of Pozna\u0144 and Gniezno and Roman Catholic primate of Poland, was imprisoned for sedition by the Prussian authorities for ten months in 1839\u20131840 in the city and after his release, he tried to organise a chaplaincy for the many Polish soldiers stationed in Kolberg.\nIn the 19th century the city had a small but active Polish population that increased during the century to account for 1.5% of the population by 1905. The Polish community funded a Catholic school and the Church of Saint Marcin where masses were held in Polish (initially throughout the season, after about 1890 all year). Dating back to 1261 Kolberg's Jewish population amounted to 528 people in 1887, rising to 580 two years later, and although many moved to Berlin after that date they numbered around 500 by the end of the Nineteenth century\nBetween 1924 and 1935, the American-German painter Lyonel Feininger, a tutor at the Staatliches Bauhaus, visited Kolberg repeatedly and painted the cathedral and environs of the town.\nIn the May elections of 1933, the Nazi Party received by far the most votes, 9,842 out of 19,607 cast votes.\nWhen the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933, the Jewish community in Kolberg comprised 200 people, and the antisemitic repression by Germany's ruling party led several of them to flee the country. A Nazi newspaper, the \"Kolberger Beobachter\", listed Jewish shops and business that were to be boycotted. Nazis also engaged in hate propaganda against Jewish lawyers, doctors, and craftsmen. At the end of 1935, Jews were banned from working in the city's health spas. During Kristallnacht, the Jewish synagogue and homes were destroyed, and in 1938 the local Jewish cemetery was vandalised, while a cemetery shrine was turned to stable by German soldiers. In 1938, all Jews in Kolberg, as all over Germany, were renamed in official German documents as \"Israel\" (for males) or \"Sarah\" (for females). In the beginning of 1939, Jews were banned from attending German schools and the entire adult population had its driving licenses revoked. After years of discrimination and harassment, local Jews were deported by the German authorities to concentration camps in 1940.\nSecond World War.\nDuring World War II the German state brought in numerous forced laborers to the city, among them many Poles. The city's economy was changed to military production-especially after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The forced laborers were threatened with everyday harassment and repression; they were forbidden from using phones, holding cultural events and sports events, they could not visit restaurants or swimming pools, or have contact with the local German population. Poles were only allowed to attend a church mass once a month \u2013 and only in the German language. They also had smaller food rations than Germans, and had to wear a sign with the letter P on their clothes indicating their ethnic background. Additionally, medical help for Polish workers was limited by the authorities. Arrests and imprisonment for various offences, such as \"slow pace of work\" or leaving the workspace, were everyday occurrences. A labour subcamp of the Stalag II-D prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs was also operated in the city by Germany.\nIn 1944, the city was selected as a fortress \u2014 \"Festung Kolberg\". The 1807 siege was used for the last Nazi propaganda film, \"Kolberg\" shortly before the end of the war by Joseph Goebbels. It was meant to inspire the Germans with its depiction of the heroic Prussian defence during the Napoleonic Wars. Tremendous resources were devoted to filming this epic, even diverting tens of thousands of troops from the front lines to have them serve as extras in battle scenes. Ironically, the film was released in the final few weeks of Nazi Germany's existence, when most of the country's cinemas were already destroyed.\nOn 10 February 1945, the German torpedo-boat T-196 brought about 300 survivors of the , which had been sunk by Soviet submarine S-13 to Kolberg. As the Red Army advanced on Kolberg, most of the inhabitants and tens of thousands of refugees from surrounding areas (about 70,000 were trapped in the Kolberg Pocket), as well as 40,000 German soldiers, were evacuated from the besieged city by German naval forces in Operation Hannibal. Only about two thousand soldiers were left on 17 March to cover the last sea transports.\nBetween 4 and 18 March 1945, there were major battles between the Soviet and Polish forces and the German army. Because of a lack of anti-tank weapons, German destroyers used their guns to support the defenders of Kolberg until nearly all of the soldiers and civilians had been evacuated. During the fights, Polish soldiers' losses were 1,013 dead, 142 MIA and 2,652 wounded. On 18 March, the Polish Army re-enacted \"Poland's Wedding to the Sea\" ceremony, which had been celebrated for the first time in 1920 by General J\u00f3zef Haller.\nAfter the battle the city for several weeks was under Soviet administration, the Germans that had not yet fled were expelled and the city was plundered by the Soviet troops. Freed Polish forced laborers remained and were joined by Polish railwaymen from Warsaw destroyed by the Germans.\nPost-war Poland.\nAfter World War II the region became again part of Poland, under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union and the Soviet-installed Polish Communist regime at the Potsdam Conference. Most Germans that had not yet fled were expelled from their homes in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town was resettled by Polish citizens, many of whom were themselves Polish refugees from regions east of former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, from where they had been displaced by Soviet authorities.\nIn 2000 the city business council of Ko\u0142obrzeg commissioned a monument called the Millennium Memorial as a commemoration of \"1000 years of Christianity in Pomerania\", and as a tribute to Polish-German Reconciliation, celebrating the meeting of King Boles\u0142aw I of Poland and King Otto III of Germany, at the Congress of Gniezno, in the year 1000. It was designed and built by the artist Wiktor Szostalo in welded stainless steel. The two figures sit at the base of a 5-meter cross, cleft in two and being held together by a dove holding an olive branch. It is installed outside the Basilica Cathedral in the city center.\nClimate.\nKo\u0142obrzeg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfb\").\nDemographics.\nBefore the end of World War II the town was predominantly German Protestant with Polish and Jewish minorities. Almost all of the pre-war German population fled or was expelled so that since 1945, Polish Catholics make up the majority of the population. Around the turn from the 18th to the 19th century an increase of the number of Catholics was observed, because military personnel had been moved from West Prussia to the town.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTourist destination.\nKo\u0142obrzeg today is a popular tourist destination for Poles, Germans and due to the ferry connection to Bornholm also Danish people. It provides a unique combination of a seaside resort, health resort, an old town full of historic monuments and tourist entertainment options (e.g. numerous \"beer gardens\").\nBike path to Podczele.\nThe town is part of the European Route of Brick Gothic network. A bike path \"to Podczele\", located along the seaside was commissioned on 14 July 2004. The path extends from Ko\u0142obrzeg to Podczele. The path has been financed by the European Union, and is intended to be part of a unique biking path that will ultimately circle the entire Baltic Sea. The path was breached on 24 March 2010 due to the encroachment of the sea associated with the draining of the adjacent unique Eco-Park marsh area. The government of Poland has allocated PLN 90,000 to repair the breach, and the path re-opened within a year. It was also extended in 2011 to connected with Ustronie Morskie to the east.\nOldest oak.\nSouth of Bagicz, some from Ko\u0142obrzeg, there is an 806-year-old oak (2008). Dated in the year 2000 as the oldest oak in Poland, it was named Boles\u0142aw to commemorate the king Boleslaus the Brave.\nCultural center.\nKo\u0142obrzeg is also a regional cultural center. In the summer take place \u2013 a number of concerts of popular singers, musicians, and cabarets. Municipal Cultural Center, is located in the \"Park teatralny\". Keep under attachment artistic arts, theater and dance. Patron of youth teams and the vocal choir. Interfolk organizes the annual festival, the International Meeting of the folklore and other cultural events. Cinema is a place for meetings Piast Discussion Film Club.\nIn Ko\u0142obrzeg there are many permanent and temporary exhibitions of artistic and historical interest. In the town hall of Ko\u0142obrzeg is located Gallery of Modern Art, where exhibitions are exposed artists from Ko\u0142obrzeg, as well as outside the local artistic circles. Gallery also conducts educational activities, including organized by the gallery of art lessons for children and young people from schools.\nPier.\nThe Ko\u0142obrzeg Pier is currently the second longest pier in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, after the pier in Mi\u0119dzyzdroje. A jetty positioned on the end of the pier enables small ships to sail for sightseeing excursions.\nMuseums.\nIn town, there is a museum of Polish weapons (Muzeum Or\u0119\u017ca Polskiego), which are presented in the collections of militaria from the early Middle Ages to the present. The palace of Braunschweig include part of museum dedicated to the history of the city. In their collections branch presents a collection of rare and common measurement tools, as well as specific measures of the workshop. The local museum is also moored at the port of ORP Fala patrol ship, built in 1964, after leaving the service transformed into a museum.\nTransport.\nTrain connections.\nKo\u0142obrzeg has connections among others to Szczecin, \"Solidarity\" Szczecin\u2013Goleni\u00f3w Airport, Gda\u0144sk, Pozna\u0144, Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and Lublin.\nFerry.\nA seasonal ferry service to Nex\u00f8 on the Danish island of Bornholm is offered by the catamaran \"Jantar\".

{"id": "17411", "revid": "1319358360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17411", "title": "Konix Multisystem", "text": "Cancelled video game system\nThe Konix Multisystem was a cancelled video game system under development by Konix, a British manufacturer of computer peripherals.\nInitial concept.\nThe Multisystem began life in 1988 as an advanced Konix peripheral design intended to build on the success of the company's range of joysticks. The design, codenamed Slipstream, resembled a dashboard-style games controller, and could be configured with a steering wheel, a flight yoke, and motorbike handles. It promised advanced features such as force feedback, hitherto unheard of in home gaming.\nHowever, it soon became apparent that the Slipstream project had the potential to be much more than a peripheral. Konix turned to their sister company Creative Devices Ltd, a computer hardware developer, to design a gaming computer to be put inside the controller to make it a stand-alone console in its own right.\nFlare Technology.\nIt was shortly after this development began that Konix founder and chairman Wyn Holloway came across a magazine article that described the work of a British group of computer hardware designers whose latest design was looking for a home.\nThe article in question, published in issue 10 of \"ACE\" magazine in July 1988, featured Flare Technology, a group of computer hardware designers who, having split from Sinclair Research (creators of the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers), had built on their work on Sinclair's aborted Loki project to create a system known as Flare One.\nFlare's prototype system was Z80 based but featured four custom chips to give it the power to compete with peers such as the Amiga and Atari ST. The 1MB machine (128k of ROM, 128k of video RAM, 768k of system RAM) promised graphics with 256 colours on-screen simultaneously, could handle 3 million pixels per second, output 8 channel stereo sound and had a blitter chip that allowed vertical and horizontal hardware scrolling.\nFlare were specifically aiming their machine at the gaming market, eschewing such features as 80 column text display (considered the requisite for business applications such as word processing) in favour of faster graphics handling. This meant that in spite of its modest 8-bit CPU the system compared well against the 16-bit machines in the market at the time. It could move sprites and block graphics faster than an Atari ST, and in 256 colours under conditions when the ST would only show 16 colours. It could also draw lines 3 times faster than an Amiga and even handle the maths of 3D models faster than the 32-bit Acorn Archimedes.\nIn spite of these specifications and bearing in mind their target gaming market, Flare aimed to retail their machine for around ), half of what the Amiga and ST were selling for. Ultimately, Flare's resources to put it into mass production were limited.\nDevelopment.\nHolloway approached Flare and proposed a merger of their respective technologies to create an innovative new kind of gaming console with the computer hardware built into the main controller and in July 1988 a partnership was formed. Development work was carried out by Flare, with assistance from British games programmer Jeff Minter.\nKonix wanted the machine to use a 16-bit processor, so the Z80 was removed and replaced with an 8086 processor. They also demanded that the colour palette be expanded to 4096 colours, the same as that of the Amiga. To reduce manufacturing costs, the Flare One's four custom chips were integrated into one large chip. In order to keep the cost of software down, it was decided that the software media would be 3.5\u201d floppy discs rather than ROM cartridges used universally by consoles up to that time.\nThe embryonic console was revealed to the computing press at a toy fair held at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in February 1989. It boasted market leading performance, MIDI support and revolutionary peripherals including a light gun with recoil action and the Power Chair, a motorised seat designed to reproduce in the home what \"sit-in\" arcade games such as \"After Burner\" and \"Out Run\" delivered in the arcades. Another innovative feature was the ability to link two MultiSystems together to allow for head-to-head two player gaming. Release was slated for August that year.\nSeveral games in development had a version produced for the Konix Multisystem, including Vivid Image's \"Hammerfist\".\nA redesigned system oriented around a 32-bit processor clocked at 30 MHz with support for CDs exclusively was announced in 1993 in collaboration with TXC.\nReception and games.\nDespite the impressive specification on paper, the design did suffer from some limitations. Nick Speakman of software developer Binary Designs pointed out that \"the custom chips are very powerful, but they require a lot of programming talent to get anything out of them. The screen handling [also] isn't as fast as we anticipated it to be.\"\nBrian Pollock of software publisher Logotron highlighted the limitations caused by the shortage of RAM (kept low to keep prices down), \u201cMy only concern is memory, or lack of it. For instance, in the game that I'm writing I am using six-channel FM synthesized sound. Now that takes up a hell of a lot of memory. I couldn't usefully fit any more samples, and that's sad.\u201d\nThe memory issue was also flagged by \"Crash\" magazine, which pointed out that the floppy disk format meant that games had to be loaded into the machine's RAM (originally intended to be 128k) in turn requiring the system to be constantly accessing the disk drive. Konix intended to remedy the problem with RAM upgrade cartridges, provided that the price of RAM fell in the future.\nOverall though, programmers received the system positively. Jeff Minter described the controller itself as \"superb,\" while Chris Walsh of Argonaut Games stated that \"Polygon based games like \"Starglider 2\" are going to be easy to program. The machine is geared up to rotating masses of vertices at incredible rates.\" However, of the original Flare One's vertex computation performance, \"Zarch\" author David Braben had noted that whilst similar levels of performance might be difficult to achieve on an Archimedes computer, the performance bottlenecks in solid 3D games were actually \"scanning databases of shapes and putting polygons on screen\".\nNumerous game developers were recruited to produce games for the system, including Jeff Minter's Llamasoft, Electronic Arts, Psygnosis, Ocean, Palace and U.S. Gold, with Konix promising 40 games to be available by Christmas. Lucasfilm was mooted as a developer with the possibility of releasing their own branded version of the machine in the US, but nothing was ever confirmed.\nGames known to be in development for the system during 1988 included Llamasoft's \"Attack of the Mutant Camels\" (as \"Attack of the Mutant Camels '89\"), System 3's \"Last Ninja 2\", Vivid Image's \"Hammerfist\", and Logotron's \"Star Ray\". A game called Bikers was to be developed by Argonaut Software to be included as a free game with the system.\nDemise.\nSigns of trouble in the progress to the release of the console did not take long to arrive. By May the release date had slipped from August to October. By October, a first quarter 1990 release was envisaged. The December edition of \"The Games Machine\" magazine revealed the scale of the problem. According to company sources, Konix had been on the brink of calling in receivers. Cheques had bounced, employees hadn't been paid and software development had been brought to a halt in mid-October as developers had reached the stage where they could continue no further without a finished machine.\nIn March 1990 it was revealed that Konix had sold the rights to sell their joystick range in the UK to Spectravision who also manufactured the rival QuickShot joystick range. They had effectively sold off the family silver in order to keep the MultiSystem project alive. Autumn 1990 was to be the new release time.\nEventually, beset by delays and in spite of all of the media coverage and apparent demand for the machine, the project ultimately went under when Konix ran out of cash without a completed system ever being released.\nLegacy.\nAfter the project was abandoned, Flare Technology began work on a new project, \"Flare Two\", which was eventually bought by Atari and, after further development, formed the basis for the Atari Jaguar game console.\nThe original Flare One technology was purchased by arcade gambling machine manufacturer Bellfruit for use in their quiz machines. Drivers for these games are also included in the multi emulator MAME.\nThe Konix Multisystem's design was later released independently by a Chinese company called MSC (MultiSystem China) as the MSC Super MS-200E Multi-System, although this was simply an inexpensive PC games controller, without any special internal hardware.\nVideo taped footage showing several games being worked on for the system survives. Excerpts from the footage were later issued on the cover disc of issue 8 of \"Retro Gamer\" magazine.\nA playable version of the unreleased \"Attack of the Mutant Camels '89\" was included in Digital Eclipse's video game compilation \"\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17412", "revid": "50667595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17412", "title": "Klein bottle", "text": "Non-orientable mathematical surface\nIn mathematics, the Klein bottle () is an example of a surface with no distinct inside or outside. In other words, it is a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down. More formally, it is an example of a non-orientable surface, a two-dimensional manifold on which one cannot define a consistent direction perpendicular to the surface (normal vector) that varies continuously over the whole shape. \nThe Klein bottle is related to other non-orientable surfaces like the M\u00f6bius strip, which also has only one side but does have a boundary. In contrast, the Klein bottle is boundaryless, like a sphere or torus, though it cannot be embedded in ordinary three-dimensional space without intersecting itself.\nThe Klein bottle was first described in 1882 by the mathematician Felix Klein.\nConstruction.\nThe following square is a fundamental polygon of the Klein bottle. The idea is to 'glue' together the corresponding red and blue edges with the arrows matching, as in the diagrams below. Note that this is an \"abstract\" gluing, in the sense that trying to realize this in three dimensions results in a self-intersecting Klein bottle.\nTo construct the Klein bottle, glue the red arrows of the square together (left and right sides), resulting in a cylinder. To glue the ends of the cylinder together so that the arrows on the circles match, one would pass one end through the side of the cylinder. This creates a curve of self-intersection; this is thus an immersion of the Klein bottle in the three-dimensional space.\nThis immersion is useful for visualizing many properties of the Klein bottle. For example, the Klein bottle has no \"boundary\", where the surface stops abruptly, and it is non-orientable, as reflected in the one-sidedness of the immersion.\nThe common physical model of a Klein bottle is a similar construction. The Science Museum in London has a collection of hand-blown glass Klein bottles on display, exhibiting many variations on this topological theme. The bottles were made for the museum by Alan Bennett in 1995.\nThe Klein bottle, proper, does not self-intersect. Nonetheless, there is a way to visualize the Klein bottle as being contained in four dimensions. By adding a fourth dimension to the three-dimensional space, the self-intersection can be eliminated. Gently push a piece of the tube containing the intersection along the fourth dimension, out of the original three-dimensional space. A useful analogy is to consider a self-intersecting curve on the plane; self-intersections can be eliminated by lifting one strand off the plane.\nSuppose for clarification that we adopt time as that fourth dimension. Consider how the figure could be constructed in \"xyzt\"-space. The accompanying illustration (\"Time evolution...\") shows one useful evolution of the figure. At \"t\" = 0 the wall sprouts from a bud somewhere near the \"intersection\" point. After the figure has grown for a while, the earliest section of the wall begins to recede, disappearing like the Cheshire Cat but leaving its ever-expanding smile behind. By the time the growth front gets to where the bud had been, there is nothing there to intersect and the growth completes without piercing existing structure. The 4-figure as defined cannot exist in 3-space but is easily understood in 4-space.\nMore formally, the Klein bottle is the quotient space described as the square [0,1] \u00d7 [0,1] with sides identified by the relations (0, \"y\") ~ (1, \"y\") for 0 \u2264 \"y\" \u2264 1 and (\"x\", 0) ~ (1 \u2212 \"x\", 1) for 0 \u2264 \"x\" \u2264 1.\nProperties.\nLike the M\u00f6bius strip, the Klein bottle is a two-dimensional manifold which is not orientable. Unlike the M\u00f6bius strip, it is a \"closed\" manifold, meaning it is a compact manifold without boundary. While the M\u00f6bius strip can be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, the Klein bottle cannot. It can be embedded in R4, however.\nContinuing this sequence, for example creating a 3-manifold which cannot be embedded in R4 but can be in R5, is possible; in this case, connecting two ends of a spherinder to each other in the same manner as the two ends of a cylinder for a Klein bottle, creates a figure, referred to as a \"spherinder Klein bottle\", that cannot fully be embedded in R4.\nThe Klein bottle can be seen as a fiber bundle over the circle \"S\"1, with fibre \"S\"1, as follows: one takes the square (modulo the edge identifying equivalence relation) from above to be \"E\", the total space, while the base space \"B\" is given by the unit interval in \"y\", modulo \"1~0\". The projection \u03c0:\"E\"\u2192\"B\" is then given by \u03c0([\"x\", \"y\"]) \n [\"y\"].\nThe Klein bottle can be constructed (in a four dimensional space, because in three dimensional space it cannot be done without allowing the surface to intersect itself) by joining the edges of two M\u00f6bius strips, as described in the following limerick by Leo Moser:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe initial construction of the Klein bottle by identifying opposite edges of a square shows that the Klein bottle can be given a CW complex structure with one 0-cell \"P\", two 1-cells \"C\"1, \"C\"2 and one 2-cell \"D\". Its Euler characteristic is therefore 1 \u2212 2 + 1 \n 0. The boundary homomorphism is given by \u2202\"D\" \n 2\"C\"1 and \u2202\"C\"1 \n \u2202\"C\"2 \n 0, yielding the homology groups of the Klein bottle \"K\" to be H0(\"K\", Z) \n Z, H1(\"K\", Z) \n Z\u00d7(Z/2Z) and H\"n\"(\"K\", Z) \n 0 for \"n\" &gt; 1.\nThere is a 2-1 covering map from the torus to the Klein bottle, because two copies of the fundamental region of the Klein bottle, one being placed next to the mirror image of the other, yield a fundamental region of the torus. The universal cover of both the torus and the Klein bottle is the plane R2.\nThe fundamental group of the Klein bottle can be determined as the group of deck transformations of the universal cover and has the presentation . It follows that it is isomorphic to formula_1, the only nontrivial semidirect product of the additive group of integers formula_2 with itself.\nSix colors suffice to color any map on the surface of a Klein bottle; this is the only exception to the Heawood conjecture, a generalization of the four color theorem, which would require seven.\nA Klein bottle is homeomorphic to the connected sum of two projective planes. It is also homeomorphic to a sphere plus two cross-caps.\nWhen embedded in Euclidean space, the Klein bottle is one-sided. However, there are other topological 3-spaces, and in some of the non-orientable examples a Klein bottle can be embedded such that it is two-sided, though due to the nature of the space it remains non-orientable.\nDissection.\nDissecting a Klein bottle into halves along its plane of symmetry results in two mirror image M\u00f6bius strips, i.e. one with a left-handed half-twist and the other with a right-handed half-twist (one of these is pictured on the right). Remember that the intersection pictured is not really there.\nSimple-closed curves.\nOne description of the types of simple-closed curves that may appear on the surface of the Klein bottle is given by the use of the first homology group of the Klein bottle calculated with integer coefficients. This group is isomorphic to Z\u00d7Z2. Up to reversal of orientation, the only homology classes which contain simple-closed curves are as follows: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,1). Up to reversal of the orientation of a simple closed curve, if it lies within one of the two cross-caps that make up the Klein bottle, then it is in homology class (1,0) or (1,1); if it cuts the Klein bottle into two M\u00f6bius strips, then it is in homology class (2,0); if it cuts the Klein bottle into an annulus, then it is in homology class (0,1); and if bounds a disk, then it is in homology class (0,0).\nParametrization.\nThe figure 8 immersion.\nTo make the \"figure 8\" or \"bagel\" immersion of the Klein bottle, one can start with a M\u00f6bius strip and curl it to bring the edge to the midline; since there is only one edge, it will meet itself there, passing through the midline. It has a particularly simple parametrization as a \"figure-8\" torus with a half-twist:\nformula_3\nfor 0 \u2264 \"\u03b8\" &lt; 2\u03c0, 0 \u2264 \"v\" &lt; 2\u03c0 and \"r\" &gt; 2.\nIn this immersion, the self-intersection circle (where sin(\"v\") is zero) is a geometric circle in the \"xy\" plane. The positive constant \"r\" is the radius of this circle. The parameter \"\u03b8\" gives the angle in the \"xy\" plane as well as the rotation of the figure 8, and \"v\" specifies the position around the 8-shaped cross section. With the above parametrization the cross section is a 2:1 Lissajous curve.\n4-D non-intersecting.\nA non-intersecting 4-D parametrization can be modeled after that of the flat torus:\nformula_4\nwhere \"R\" and \"P\" are constants that determine aspect ratio, \"\u03b8\" and \"v\" are similar to as defined above. \"v\" determines the position around the figure-8 as well as the position in the x-y plane. \"\u03b8\" determines the rotational angle of the figure-8 as well and the position around the z-w plane. \"\u03b5\" is any small constant and \"\u03b5\" sin\"v\" is a small \"v\" dependent bump in \"z-w\" space to avoid self intersection. The \"v\" bump causes the self intersecting 2-D/planar figure-8 to spread out into a 3-D stylized \"potato chip\" or saddle shape in the x-y-w and x-y-z space viewed edge on. When \"\u03b5=0\" the self intersection is a circle in the z-w plane &lt;0, 0, cos\"\u03b8\", sin\"\u03b8\"&gt;.\n3D pinched torus / 4D M\u00f6bius tube.\nThe pinched torus is perhaps the simplest parametrization of the Klein bottle in both three and four dimensions. It can be viewed as a variant of a torus that, in three dimensions, flattens and passes through itself on one side. Unfortunately, in three dimensions this parametrization has two pinch points, which makes it undesirable for some applications. In four dimensions the \"z\" amplitude rotates into the \"w\" amplitude and there are no self intersections or pinch points.\nformula_5\nOne can view this as a tube or cylinder that wraps around, as in a torus, but its circular cross section flips over in four dimensions, presenting its \"backside\" as it reconnects, just as a M\u00f6bius strip cross section rotates before it reconnects. The 3D orthogonal projection of this is the pinched torus shown above. Just as a M\u00f6bius strip is a subset of a solid torus, the M\u00f6bius tube is a subset of a toroidally closed spherinder (solid spheritorus).\nBottle shape.\nThe following parametrization of the usual 3-dimensional immersion of the bottle itself is much more complicated. \nformula_6\nfor 0 \u2264 \"u\" &lt; \u03c0 and 0 \u2264 \"v\" &lt; 2\u03c0.\nHomotopy classes.\nRegular 3D immersions of the Klein bottle fall into three regular homotopy classes. \nThe three are represented by:\nThe traditional Klein bottle immersion is achiral. The figure-8 immersion is chiral. (The pinched torus immersion above is not regular, as it has pinch points, so it is not relevant to this section.)\nIf the traditional Klein bottle is cut in its plane of symmetry it breaks into two M\u00f6bius strips of opposite chirality. A figure-8 Klein bottle can be cut into two M\u00f6bius strips of the \"same\" chirality, and cannot be regularly deformed into its mirror image.\nGeneralizations.\nThe generalization of the Klein bottle to higher genus is given in the article on the fundamental polygon.\nIn another order of ideas, constructing 3-manifolds, it is known that a solid Klein bottle is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of a M\u00f6bius strip and a closed interval. The \"solid Klein bottle\" is the non-orientable version of the solid torus, equivalent to formula_7\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Effectively kidnapped aboard a mutinous Martian spaceship, she provides assistance to the revolutionaries in their quest for interstellar travel, but ultimately chooses not to travel with them but to return to the doomed revolution on Mars.\nThe second narrative is told from the perspective of an archaeologist three centuries later. He is involved in a project investigating the failed revolution, and during this finds the engineer's diary buried near the remains of a ruined city. At the same time, a mysterious monument is found at the north pole of Pluto, tying up with a passing mention in the engineer's diary.\nIn the final narrative, the great-grandson of the archaeologist visits the monument on Pluto, a ring of standing slabs of ice. He is investigating the possibility that both the diary and the monument were planted by a reclusive and wealthy businesswoman who lives in the orbit of Saturn.\nDevelopment history.\nThe first part of \"Icehenge\" was originally published as the novella \"To Leave a Mark\" in \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\" (November 1982). The third part of the novel was originally published as the novella \"On the North Pole of Pluto\" in the anthology \"Orbit\" 18 (1980), edited by Damon Knight. While Robinson was enrolled in author Ursula K. Le Guin's writing workshop at University of California, San Diego in the spring of 1977, he gave her the novella in rough form to read and edit. In the novel's third section, views of Saturn from the space station visited by the narrator were inspired by images of Saturn taken during Voyager probe flybys in 1980\u20131981.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They demonstrate their power by shouting \"Ni!\" (pronounced ), terrifying the party, whom they refuse to allow passage through their forest unless appeased through the gift of a shrubbery.\nDescription.\nThe knights appear silhouetted in a misty wood, wearing robes and horned helmets; their full number is never apparent, but there are at least six. The leader of the knights, played by Michael Palin, is the only one who speaks to the party. He is nearly double Arthur's height, and wears a great helm decorated with long antlers. The other knights are large, but of human proportions, and wear visored sallet helmets decorated with cow horns. The knight explains that they are the \"keepers of the sacred words 'Ni', 'Peng', and 'Neee-Wom'\". Arthur confides to Sir Bedivere, \"those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!\"\nTasks.\nThe knights demand a sacrifice, and when Arthur states that he merely wishes to pass through the woods, the knights begin shouting \"Ni!\", forcing the party to shrink back in fear. After this demonstration of their power, the head knight threatens to say \"Ni!\" again unless the travellers appease them with a shrubbery; otherwise they shall never pass through the wood alive. When Arthur questions the demand, the knights again shout \"Ni!\" until the travellers agree to bring them a shrubbery, which the head knight specifies must be \"one that looks nice. And not too expensive.\"\nIn order to fulfill their promise to the Knights of Ni, the party visits a small village, where Arthur and Bedivere ask an old crone where they can obtain a shrubbery. The woman questions them, and Arthur admits that it is for the Knights who say \"Ni!\", whereupon she refuses to cooperate. Arthur then threatens to say \"Ni!\" to the old woman unless she helps them, and when she still refuses, begins shouting \"Ni!\". Bedivere has trouble saying the sacred word, which he pronounces \"Nu!\" until Arthur demonstrates the correct technique. As the crone shrinks back from their combined assault, they are interrupted by Roger the Shrubber, who laments the lack of law and order that allows ruffians to say \"Ni!\" to an old woman. Arthur obtains a shrubbery from Roger, and brings it to the Knights of Ni.\nThe head knight acknowledges that \"it is a good shrubbery\", but asserts that the knights cannot allow Arthur and his followers to pass through the wood because they are no longer the Knights who say \"Ni!\", now being the Knights who say \"Ekke Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing!\", and must therefore give Arthur a test. Unable to pronounce the new name, Arthur addresses them as \"Knights who until recently said 'Ni!'\", inquiring as to the nature of the test.\nThe head knight demands another shrubbery, to be placed next to but slightly higher than the first; and then Arthur \"must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest\u2014with a herring!\" The knight presents a herring to be used. Arthur objects, asserting that \"it can't be done!\" upon which the knights recoil as though in fear and pain. It soon emerges that the knights are unable to withstand the word \"it\", which Arthur's party is unable to avoid saying. The knights are soon incapacitated by the word, which even the head knight cannot stop repeating, allowing Arthur and his followers to make their escape.\nFilm notes.\nIn the original screenplay, it was suggested that the head knight be played by \"Mike standing on John's shoulders\". In the DVD commentary for the film, Michael Palin states that their use of the word \"Ni!\" was derived from \"The Goon Show\". Later, Palin gave another inspiration \u2013 his history teacher at Shrewsbury School, Laurence Le Quesne, who had the habit of saying \"Ni\" while searching for books. Upon Arthur's return, the knights were to have said, \"Neeeow...wum...ping!\"\nContemporary scholarship.\nThe Knights who say \"Ni!\" have been cited as an example of intentional disregard for historical accuracy in neo-medievalism, which may be contrasted with the casual disregard for historical accuracy inherent in more traditional works of the fantasy genre. However, in \"Medievalisms: Making the Past in the Present\", the authors suggest that the original characters of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" actually represent medievalism, rather than neomedievalism, as many of the film's details are in fact based on authentic medieval texts and ideas. With respect to the Knights who say \"Ni!\", the authors suggest that Sir Bedivere's difficulty pronouncing \"Ni!\", despite its levity, \"carries a very learned joke about the difficulties of pronouncing Middle English\", alluding to the Great Vowel Shift, which occurred in English during the late medieval period.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was created by activist Maulana Karenga based on African harvest festival traditions from various parts of West, East, as well as Southeast Africa. Kwanzaa was first celebrated in 1966. Twenty-first-century estimates place the number of Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa between 500,000 and 2,000,000.\nHistory and etymology.\nAmerican black separatist Maulana Karenga created Kwanzaa in 1966 during the aftermath of the Watts riots as a non-Christian, specifically African-American holiday. Karenga said his goal was to \"give black people an alternative to the existing holiday of Christmas and give black people an opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society.\" For Karenga, a figure in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of such holidays also underscored the essential premise that \"you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution. The cultural revolution gives identity, purpose, and direction.\"\nAccording to Karenga, the name Kwanzaa derives from the Swahili phrase \"matunda ya kwanza\", meaning \"first fruits\". First fruits festivals exist in Southern Africa and are celebrated in December/January with the southern solstice. Karenga was partly inspired by an account he read of the Zulu festival Umkhosi Wokweshwama. It was decided to spell the holiday's name with an additional \"a\" so that it would have a symbolic seven letters.\nDuring the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas. He believed Jesus was psychotic and Christianity was a \"White\" religion that Black people should shun. As Kwanzaa gained mainstream adherents, Karenga altered his position so practicing Christians would not be alienated, stating in the 1997 book \"Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture\" that \"Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.\" Many African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.\nAfter its creation in California, Kwanzaa spread outside the United States but does not appear to be directly observed in any African countries.\nNguzo Saba (The Seven Principles).\nKwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or Nguzo Saba (originally Nguzu Saba\u00a0\u2013 the seven principles of African Heritage). They were developed in 1965, a year before Kwanzaa itself. These seven principles are all Swahili words, and together comprise the \"Kawaida\" or \"common\" philosophy, a synthesis of nationalist, pan-Africanist, and socialist values. \nEach of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the principles, as follows:\nSymbols.\nKwanzaa celebratory symbols include a mat (\"Mkeka\") on which other symbols are placed: \nSupplemental representations include a Nguzo Saba poster, the black, red, and green \"bendera\" (flag), and African books and artworks\u2014all to represent values and concepts reflective of African culture and contribution to community building and reinforcement.\nObservances.\nFamilies celebrating Kwanzaa decorate their households with objects of art, colorful African cloth such as \"kente\", especially the wearing of kaftans by women, and fresh fruits representing African idealism. It is customary to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (\"Kikombe cha Umoja\") passed around to all celebrants. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. \"Joyous Kwanzaa\" may be used as a greeting during the holiday.\nA Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the \"African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness,\" contemplation on the Pan-African colors, discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter of African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performances, and, finally, a feast of faith known as \"Karamu Ya Imani\". The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is \"Habari Gani?\", which is Swahili for \"How are you?\"\nAt first, observers of Kwanzaa avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of \"kujichagulia\" (self-determination) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, some African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and the New Year.\nCultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance, African dance, song, and poetry.\nKaramu.\nA \"Karamu Ya Imani\" (Feast of Faith) is a feast typically on December 31, the sixth day of the Kwanzaa period. The Karamu feast was developed in Chicago during a 1971 citywide movement of Pan-African organizations. Hannibal Afrik of Shule ya Watoto proposed it as a community-wide promotional and educational campaign. The initial \"Karamu Ya Imani\" occurred on January 1, 1973, at a 200-person gathering at the Ridgeland club.\nIn 1992, the National Black United Front (NBUF) of Chicago held one of the country's largest \"Karamu Ya Imani\" celebrations. It included dancing, a youth ensemble and a keynote speech by NBUF and prominent Black nationalist leader Conrad Worrill.\nThe celebration includes the following practices:\nAdherence.\nThe popularity of celebration of Kwanzaa has declined with the waning of the popularity of the black separatist movement. Kwanzaa observation has declined in both community and commercial contexts. University of Minnesota Professor Keith Mayes did not report exact figures, noting that it is also difficult to determine these for the three other main African-American holidays, which he names as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Malcolm X Day, and Juneteenth. Mayes added that white institutions now also celebrate it. Certain communities of the Nation of Islam, an African American Islamic group, celebrate Kwanzaa.\nIn a 2019 National Retail Federation poll, 2.6 percent of people who planned to celebrate a winter holiday said they would celebrate Kwanzaa. Roughly 14% of the United States population is African American.\nStarting in the 1990s, the holiday became increasingly commercialized, with the first Hallmark card being sold in 1992. Some have expressed concern about this potentially damaging the holiday's values.\nRecognition.\nThe first Kwanzaa stamp, designed by Synthia Saint James, was issued by the United States Post Office in 1997, and in the same year Bill Clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday. Subsequent presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden also issued greetings to celebrate Kwanzaa.\nMaya Angelou narrated a 2008 documentary film about Kwanzaa, \"The Black Candle\", written and directed by M. K. Asante and featuring Chuck D.\nIn the special episode of the animated series \"Arthur\", \"Arthur's Perfect Christmas\", (2000) Brain's family celebrated Kwanzaa as a family, and added a Kwanzaa Ice Cream Special (red, black, and green ice cream) to their ice cream shop menu.\nPractice outside the United States.\nOther countries where Kwanzaa is celebrated include Jamaica, France, Canada, and Brazil.\nIn Canada it is celebrated in provinces including Saskatchewan and Ontario. Kwanzaa week was first declared in Toronto in 2018. There are local chapters that emerged in the 2010s in provinces like British Columbia, where there are much smaller groups of the diaspora, founding members may be immigrants from countries like Uganda.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Centered in the highlands to the west of the Dead Sea, the kingdom's capital was Jerusalem. It was ruled by the Davidic line for four centuries. Jews are named after Judah, and primarily descend from people who lived in the region.\nThe Hebrew Bible depicts the Kingdom of Judah as one of the two successor states of the United Kingdom of Israel, a term denoting the united monarchy under biblical kings Saul, David, and Solomon and covering the territory of Judah and Israel. However, during the 1980s, some biblical scholars began to argue that the archaeological evidence for an extensive kingdom before the late 8th century\u00a0BCE is too weak, and that the methodology used to obtain the evidence is flawed. In the 10th and early 9th centuries\u00a0BCE, the territory of Judah might have been limitedly populated, comprising some fortified sites and many unfortified rural settlements. The Tel Dan Stele, discovered in 1993, shows that the kingdom existed in some form by the middle of the 9th century\u00a0BCE, but it does not indicate the extent of its power. Recent excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, however, support the existence of a centrally organized and urbanized kingdom by the 10th century BCE, according to the excavators.\nIn the 7th century\u00a0BCE, the kingdom's population increased greatly, prospering under Neo-Assyrian vassalage despite Hezekiah's revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib. Josiah took advantage of the political vacuum that resulted from Assyria's decline and the emergence of Saite Egyptian rule over the area to enact his religious reforms. The Deuteronomistic history, which recounts the history of the people of Israel from Joshua to Josiah and expresses a worldview based on the legal principles found in the Book of Deuteronomy, is assumed to have been written during this same time period and emphasizes the significance of upholding them.\nWith the final fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 605 BCE, competition emerged between Saite Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire over control of the Levant, ultimately resulting in Judah's rapid decline. The early 6th century\u00a0BCE saw a wave of Egyptian-backed Judahite rebellions against Babylonian rule being crushed. In 587\u00a0BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II engaged in a siege of Jerusalem, ultimately destroying the city and ending the kingdom. A large number of Judeans were exiled to Babylonia, and the fallen kingdom was then annexed as a Babylonian province.\nAfter the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire, the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great permitted the Jewish exiles to return to their homeland and re-establish their communal and religious institutions under Persian overlordship. Although the restored community enjoyed a degree of autonomy, full Jewish political independence was not achieved again until nearly four centuries later, in the aftermath of the Maccabean Revolt, with the emergence of the Hasmonean kingdom of Judea.\nGeography.\nThe Kingdom of Judah was located in the Judean Mountains, stretching from Jerusalem to Hebron and into the Negev Desert. The central ridge, ranging from forested and shrubland-covered mountains gently sloping towards the hills of the Shephelah in the west, to the dry and arid landscapes of the Judaean Desert descending into the Jordan Valley to the east, formed the kingdom's core.\nThe northern border of Judah extended east\u2013west from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, passing near Jericho to the area of Gezer. To the west, the border ran from Gezer across the Shephelah to Beersheba in the northern Negev. In the east, Judah's boundaries followed the Arabah to the western shore of the Dead Sea. In prosperous periods, Judah's influence expanded, stretching southward to Beersheba and beyond, including Kadesh Barnea and likely Kuntillet Ajrud. Its influence possibly extended to the Gulf of Eilat in the south, as well as the Coastal Plain in the west in Mesad Hashavyahu fortress.\nArchaeological record.\nThe formation of the Kingdom of Judah is a subject of heavy debate among scholars, with a dispute emerging between biblical minimalists and biblical maximalists on this particular topic. Due to geopolitical factors like security issues, isolation, and political changes, the core area of the Kingdom of Judah on the south-central highlands has seen limited archaeological exploration compared to regions west of the Jordan River. Few excavations and surveys have been conducted there, creating a notable knowledge gap compared to the extensively-studied Shephelah to the west, which has undergone systematic surveys and numerous scientific excavations.\nWhile it is generally agreed that the narratives of David and Solomon in the 10th century BCE tell little about the origins of Judah, currently, there is no consensus as to whether Judah developed as a split from a unified kingdom Israel (as the Bible claims) or independently. Some scholars suggested that Jerusalem, the kingdom's capital, did not emerge as a significant administrative center until the end of the 8th century BCE. Before then, the archaeological evidence suggests its population was too small to sustain a viable kingdom. Other scholars argue that recent discoveries and radiocarbon tests in the City of David seem to indicate that Jerusalem was already a significant city by the 10th century BCE.\nA view held by Finkelstein, Koch &amp; Lipschits (2011) that the City of David is to be placed on the Temple Mount has largely been rejected by scholars of historical geography.\nMuch of the debate revolves around whether the archaeological discoveries conventionally dated to the 10th century should instead be dated to the 9th century, as proposed by Israel Finkelstein. Recent archaeological discoveries by Eilat Mazar in Jerusalem and Yosef Garfinkel in Khirbet Qeiyafa have been interpreted as supporting the existence of the United Monarchy, but the datings and identifications are not universally accepted.\nThe Tel Dan stele shows a historical \"House of David\" ruled a kingdom south of the lands of Samaria in the 9th century BCE, and attestations of several Judean kings from the 8th century BCE have been discovered, but they do little to indicate how developed the state actually was. The Nimrud Tablet K.3751, dated c. 733 BCE, is the earliest known record of the name \"Judah\" (written in Assyrian cuneiform as Ya'uda or KUR.ia-\u00fa-da-a-a), while an earlier reference to a Judahite envoy seems to appear in a wine list from Nimrud dated to the 780s BCE.\nJerusalem.\nThe status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate. The oldest part of Jerusalem and its original urban core are the City of David, which does show evidence of significant Israelite residential activity around the 10th century. Some unique administrative structures such as the Stepped Stone Structure and the Large Stone Structure, which originally formed one structure, contain material culture dated to Iron I. On account of an alleged lack of settlement activity in the 10th century BCE, Israel Finkelstein argues that Jerusalem was then a small country village in the Judean hills, not a national capital, and Ussishkin argues that the city was entirely uninhabited. Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I / Iron II A dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct, which he believes to be the case, \"Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity.\" William G. Dever argues that Jerusalem was a small and fortified city, probably inhabited only by the royal court, priests and clerks. Avraham Faust and Zev Farber argue that Jerusalem was significantly large when compared with most highland sites in ancient Israel, and contained fortifications and public buildings.\nLiteracy.\nA collection of military orders found in the ruins of a military fortress in the Negev dating to the period of the Kingdom of Judah indicates widespread literacy, based on the inscriptions, the ability to read and write extended throughout the chain of command from commanders to petty officers. According to Professor Eliezer Piasetsky, who participated in analyzing the texts, \"Literacy existed at all levels of the administrative, military and priestly systems of Judah. Reading and writing were not limited to a tiny elite.\" That indicates the presence of a substantial educational infrastructure in Judah at the time.\nArchaeological research near the Gihon Spring in the City of David has revealed many anepigraphical bullae (that is, bullae bearing only iconography, no inscriptions) dated to the 11th/10th\u20139th centuries BCE which feature \"papyrus lines\" on their backs. It has been argued that these seals provide evidence that papyrus texts were written and used in Jerusalem already from the 10th (perhaps 11th) century BCE onwards.\nIn October 2025, the discovery of a fragment measuring approximately 2.5 cm containing 20 visible characters, dated between the 7th and 8th centuries BC and made of ceramic material from the Tigris basin, was presented to the press. The small fragment bears an expiry date and the words \u201che who holds the reins\u201d, a title known in the Assyrian administration as exclusive to a royal messenger. According to scholars, it is a reminder for the collection of a tribute. This attests to the tense relations between the Kingdom of Judah and the Assyrians described in 2 Kings 18\u201319, 2 Chronicles 32, Isaiah 36\u201337, with reference to Hezekiah's rebellion.\nLMLK seals.\nLMLK seals are archaic Hebrew stamp seals on the handles of large storage jars dating from the reign of King Hezekiah (circa 700 BCE) discovered mostly in and around Jerusalem. Several complete jars were found \"in situ\" buried under a destruction layer caused by Sennacherib at Tel Lachish. None of the original seals has been found, but some 2,000 impressions made by at least 21 seal types have been published.\nLMLK stands for the Hebrew letters \"lamedh mem lamedh kaph\" (), which can be translated as:\nEveryday life.\nAccording to a 2022 study, traces of vanilla found in wine jars in Jerusalem might indicate that the local elite enjoyed wine flavored with vanilla during the 7\u20136th centuries BCE. Until very recently, vanilla was not at all known to be available to the Old World. Archeologists suggested that this discovery might be related to an international trade route that crossed the Negev during that period, probably under Assyrian and later, Third Intermediate Period Egyptian rule.\nCities.\nAccording to Yosef Garfinkel, the fortified cities of the Kingdom of Judah during the 10th century BCE were located at Khirbet Qeiyafa, Tell en-Nasbeh, Khirbet el-Dawwara (by Halhul), Tel Beit Shemesh, and Tell Lachish. Likewise, the site of Tel Rumeida (ancient Hebron) was also a fortified Judahite city throughout the 10th-6th centuries BCE.\nThe sites of Tel Motza and Tel Eton were also urban centers of the Kingdom of Judah in the 10th and 9th centuries BCE.\nTel Be'er Sheva, believed to be the site of the ancient biblical town of Be'er-sheba, was the main Judahite center in the Negev in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE.\nForts.\nThe Judaean Mountains and Shephelah have seen the discovery of several Judahite fortresses and towers. The fortifications had a large central courtyard surrounded by casemate walls with chambers on the outside wall, and they were square or rectangular in shape. Khirbet Abu et-Twein, which is situated on the Judaean Mountains between modern day Bat Ayin and Jab'a, is one of the most noteworthy fortresses from the period. Great views of the Shepehla, including the Judahite towns of Azekah, Socho, Goded, Lachish, and Maresha, could be seen from this fort.\nIn the northern Negev, Tel Arad served as a key administrative and military stronghold. It protected the route from the Judaean Mountains to the Arabah and on to Moab and Edom. It underwent numerous renovations and extensions. There are several other Judahite forts in the Negev, including Hurvat Uza, Tel Ira, Aroer, Tel Masos, and Tel Malhata. The main Judahite fortification in the Judaean Desert was found at Vered Yeriho; it protected the road from Jericho to the Dead Sea. A few freestanding, elevated, isolated guard towers of the period were found around Jerusalem; towers of this type were discovered in the French Hill and south to Giloh.\nIt is clear from the position of Judaean strongholds that one of their primary purposes was to facilitate communications via fire signals across the Kingdom, a method well-documented in the Book of Jeremiah and the Lachish letters.\nBiblical narrative.\nJeroboam's revolt and the partition of the United Monarchy.\nAccording to the biblical account, the United Kingdom of Israel was founded by Saul during the late-11th century BCE, and reached its peak during the rule of David and Solomon. After the death of Solomon circa 930 BCE, the Israelites gathered in Shechem for the coronation of Solomon's son and successor, Rehoboam. Before the coronation took place, the northern tribes, led by Jeroboam, asked the new king to reduce the heavy taxes and labor requirements that his father Solomon had imposed. Rehoboam rejected their petition: \"I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, I will chastise you with scorpions\" (). As a result, ten of the tribes rebelled against Rehoboam and proclaimed Jeroboam their king, forming the northern Kingdom of Israel. At first, only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the House of David, but the tribe of Benjamin soon joined Judah. Both kingdoms, Judah in the south and Israel in the north, co-existed uneasily after the split until the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by Assyria in 722/721.\nRelations with the Kingdom of Israel.\nFor the first 60 years, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over Israel, and there was perpetual war between them. Israel and Judah warred throughout Rehoboam's 17-year reign. Rehoboam built elaborate defenses and strongholds, along with fortified cities. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, who is identified as the pharaoh Shoshenq I of the 22nd Dynasty of Egypt, brought a vast army and took many cities. In the sack of Jerusalem (10th century BCE), Rehoboam gave them all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute and Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.\nRehoboam's son and successor, Abijah of Judah, continued his father's efforts to bring Israel under his control. He fought the Battle of Mount Zemaraim against Jeroboam of Israel and was victorious with a heavy loss of life on the Israel side. According to the Books of Chronicles, Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain, and Jeroboam posed little threat to Judah for the rest of his reign. The border of the tribe of Benjamin was restored to the original tribal border.\nAbijah's son and successor, Asa of Judah, maintained peace for the first 35 years of his reign, and he revamped and reinforced the fortresses initially built by his grandfather, Rehoboam. II Chronicles states that at the Battle of Zephath, the Egyptian-backed chieftain Zerah the Ethiopian and his million men and 300 chariots were defeated by Asa's 580,000 men in the Valley of Zephath near Maresha. The Bible does not state whether Zerah was a pharaoh or a general of the army. The Ethiopians were pursued to Gerar, in the coastal plain, where they stopped out of sheer exhaustion. The resulting peace kept Judah free from Egyptian incursions until the time of Josiah, some centuries later.\nIn his 36th year, Asa was confronted by Baasha of Israel, who built a fortress at Ramah on the border, less than ten miles from Jerusalem. The capital came under pressure, and the military situation was precarious. Asa took gold and silver from the Temple and sent them to Ben-Hadad I, the king of Aram-Damascus, in exchange for the Damascene king cancelling his peace treaty with Baasha. Ben-Hadad attacked Ijon, Dan and many important cities of the tribe of Naphtali, and Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah. Asa tore down the unfinished fortress and used its raw materials to fortify Geba and Mizpah in Benjamin on his side of the border.\nAsa's successor, Jehoshaphat, changed the policy towards Israel and instead pursued alliances and cooperation with it. The alliance with Ahab was based on marriage. The alliance led to disaster for the kingdom with the Battle of Ramoth-Gilead according to 1 Kings 22. He then allied with Ahaziah of Israel to carry on maritime commerce with Ophir. However, the fleet equipped at Ezion-Geber was immediately wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the cooperation of the king of Israel. Although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted. He joined Jehoram of Israel in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful, and the Moabites were subdued. However, on seeing Mesha's act of offering his son in a human sacrifice on the walls of Kir of Moab (now al-Karak) filled Jehoshaphat with horror, he withdrew and returned to his land.\nJehoshaphat's successor, Jehoram of Judah, formed an alliance with Israel by marrying Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab. Despite the alliance with the stronger northern kingdom, Jehoram's rule of Judah was shaky. Edom revolted, and he was forced to acknowledge its independence. A raid by Philistines and Arabs or perhaps South Arabians looted the king's house and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son, Ahaziah of Judah.\nClash of empires.\nAfter Hezekiah became the sole ruler in c. 715 BCE, he formed alliances with Ashkelon and Egypt and made a stand against Assyria by refusing to pay tribute. In response, Sennacherib of Assyria attacked the fortified cities of Judah. Hezekiah paid three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold to Assyria, which required him to empty the temple and royal treasury of silver and strip the gold from the doorposts of Solomon's Temple. However, Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem in 701 BCE though the city was never taken.\nDuring the long reign of Manasseh (c. 687/686 \u2013 643/642 BCE), Judah was a vassal of Assyrian rulers: Sennacherib and his successors, Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal after 669 BCE. Manasseh is listed as being required to provide materials for Esarhaddon's building projects and as one of a number of vassals who assisted Ashurbanipal's campaign against Egypt.\nWhen Josiah became king of Judah in c. 641/640 BCE, the international situation was in flux. To the east, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate, the Neo-Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it and Egypt to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule. In the power vacuum, Judah could govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention. However, in the spring of 609 BCE, Pharaoh Necho II personally led a sizable army up to the Euphrates to aid the Assyrians. Taking the coastal route into Syria at the head of a large army, Necho passed the low tracts of Philistia and Sharon. However, the passage over the ridge of hills, which shuts in on the south the great Jezreel Valley, was blocked by the Judean army, led by Josiah, who may have considered that the Assyrians and the Egyptians were weakened by the death of Pharaoh Psamtik I only a year earlier (610 BCE). Presumably in an attempt to help the Babylonians, Josiah attempted to block the advance at Megiddo, where a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was killed. Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian Ashur-uballit II, and they crossed the Euphrates and lay siege to Harran. The combined forces failed to hold the city after capturing it temporarily, and Necho retreated back to northern Syria. The event also marked the disintegration of the Assyrian Empire.\nOn his return march to Egypt in 608 BCE, Necho found that Jehoahaz had been selected to succeed his father, Josiah. Necho deposed Jehoahaz, who had been king for only three months, and replaced him with his older brother, Jehoiakim. Necho imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver (about 3&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 tons or about 3.4 metric tons) and a talent of gold (about ). Necho then took Jehoahaz back to Egypt as his prisoner, never to return.\nJehoiakim ruled originally as a vassal of the Egyptians by paying a heavy tribute. However, when the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at Carchemish in 605 BCE, Jehoiakim changed allegiances to pay tribute to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. In 601 BCE, in the fourth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar attempted to invade Egypt but was repulsed with heavy losses. The failure led to numerous rebellions among the states of the Levant that owed allegiance to Babylon. Jehoiakim also stopped paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar and took a pro-Egyptian position. Nebuchadnezzar soon dealt with the rebellions. According to the Babylonian Chronicles, after invading \"the land of Hatti (Syria/Palestine)\" in 599 BCE, he laid siege to Jerusalem. Jehoiakim died in 598 BCE during the siege and was succeeded by his son Jeconiah at an age of either eight or eighteen. The city fell about three months later, on 2 Adar (March 16) 597 BCE. Nebuchadnezzar pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple and carted all of his spoils to Babylon. Jeconiah and his court and other prominent citizens and craftsmen, along with a sizable portion of the Jewish population of Judah, numbering about 10,000 were deported from the land and dispersed throughout the Babylonian Empire. Among them was Ezekiel. Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah, Jehoiakim's brother, the king of the reduced kingdom, who was made a tributary of Babylon.\nDestruction and dispersion.\nDespite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, Zedekiah revolted against Nebuchadnezzar by ceasing to pay tribute to him and entered an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra. In 589 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II returned to Judah and again besieged Jerusalem. Many Jews fled to surrounding Moab, Ammon, Edom and other countries to seek refuge. The city fell after a siege, which lasted either eighteen or thirty months, and Nebuchadnezzar again pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple and then destroyed both. After killing all of Zedekiah's sons, Nebuchadnezzar took Zedekiah to Babylon and so put an end to the independent Kingdom of Judah. According to the Book of Jeremiah, in addition to those killed during the siege, some 4,600 people were deported after the fall of Judah. By 586 BCE, much of Judah had been devastated, and the former kingdom had suffered a steep decline of both its economy and its population.\nAftermath.\nBabylonian Yehud.\nJerusalem apparently remained uninhabited for much of the 6th century BCE, and the centre of gravity shifted to Benjamin, the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom, where the town of Mizpah became the capital of the new Babylonian province of Yehud for the remnant of the Jewish population in a part of the former kingdom. That was standard Babylonian practice. When the Philistine city of Ashkelon was conquered in 604 BCE, the political, religious and economic elite (but not the bulk of the population) was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location.\nGedaliah was appointed governor of the Yehud province, supported by a Babylonian guard. The administrative centre of the province was Mizpah in Benjamin, not Jerusalem. On hearing of the appointment, many of the Judeans who had taken refuge in surrounding countries were persuaded to return to Judah. However, Gedaliah was soon assassinated by a member of the royal house, and the Chaldean soldiers killed. The population that was left in the land and those who had returned fled to Egypt for fear a Babylonian reprisal, under the leadership of Yohanan ben Kareah. They ignored the urging of the prophet Jeremiah against the move. In Egypt, the refugees settled in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph and Pathros, and possibly Elephantine, and Jeremiah went with them as a moral guardian.\nExile to Babylon.\nThe numbers that were deported to Babylon and that made their way to Egypt and the remnant that remained in the land and in surrounding countries are subject to academic debate. The Book of Jeremiah reports that 4,600 were exiled to Babylonia. The two Books of Kings suggest that it was 10,000 and later 8,000.\nPersian Yehud and Hellenistic period..\nIn 539 BCE, the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylonia and allowed the exiles to return to Yehud Medinata and to rebuild the Temple, which was completed in the sixth year of Darius (515 BCE) under Zerubbabel, the grandson of the second to last king of Judah, Jeconiah. Yehud Medinata was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until its fall in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Judean independence was reestablished after the Maccabean revolt, and the establishment of the Hasmonean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE.\nJews are named after Judah, and primarily descend from people who lived in the former Kingdom.\nReligion.\nThe major theme of the Hebrew Bible's narrative is the loyalty of Judah, especially its kings, to Yahweh, which it states is the God of Israel. Accordingly, all of the kings of Israel (except to some extent Jehu) and many of the kings of Judah were \"bad\" in terms of the biblical narrative by failing to enforce monotheism. Of the \"good\" kings, Hezekiah (727\u2013698 BCE) is noted for his efforts at stamping out idolatry (in his case, the worship of Baal and Asherah, among other traditional Near Eastern divinities), but his successors, Manasseh of Judah (698\u2013642 BCE) and Amon (642\u2013640 BCE), revived idolatry, which drew down on the kingdom the anger of Yahweh. King Josiah (640\u2013609 BCE) returned to the worship of Yahweh alone, but his efforts were too late, and Israel's unfaithfulness caused God to permit the kingdom's destruction by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the Siege of Jerusalem (587/586 BCE).\nIt is now widely agreed among academic scholars that the Books of Kings are not an accurate portrayal of religious attitudes in Judah or Israel of the time. Nevertheless, epigraphic evidence attests to Yahweh's prominence within Judahite religion.\nEvidence of cannabis residues has been found on two altars in Tel Arad dating to the 8th century BC. Researchers believe that cannabis may have been used for ritualistic psychoactive purposes in Judah.\nEconomy.\nJudah's traditional economy was a traditional mediterranean subsistence. The kingdom's economy transformed under Assyrian influence, shifting from subsistence farming to a system where each region focused on specific agricultural products.\nThe highlands west and north of Jerusalem, and likely to the south as well, were known for viticulture. The Late Iron Age saw a surge in rural activity across the Soreq and Rephaim Valleys, with 65 sites identified and excavated. These sites formed a four-tiered hierarchy, including large administrative centers like Tel Moza, smaller villages, isolated buildings and farms, and agro-production spots like wine presses. The Nahal Shmuel area, in particular, became a key center for wine production, with 57 documented wine presses, while further north in Gibeon, the largest concentration of wine storage cellars, 63 in total, was found, used for aging wine.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17424", "revid": "8629330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17424", "title": "Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)", "text": "Israelite kingdom in the Southern Levant\nThe Kingdom of Israel (), also called the Kingdom of Samaria or the Northern Kingdom, was an Israelite kingdom that existed in the Southern Levant during the Iron Age. Its beginnings date back to the first half of the 10th century BCE. It controlled the areas of Samaria, Galilee and parts of Transjordan; the former two regions underwent a period in which a large number of new settlements were established shortly after the kingdom came into existence. It had four capital cities in succession: Shiloh, Shechem, Tirzah, and the city of Samaria. In the 9th century BCE, the House of Omri ruled it, whose political centre was the city of Samaria.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the territory of the Twelve Tribes of Israel was once amalgamated under a Kingdom of Israel and Judah, which was ruled by the House of Saul and then by the House of David. However, upon the death of Solomon, who was the son and successor of David, there was discontent over his son and successor Rehoboam, whose reign was only accepted by the Tribe of Judah and the Tribe of Benjamin. The unpopularity of Rehoboam's reign among the rest of the Israelites, who sought Jeroboam as their monarch, resulted in Jeroboam's Revolt, which led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel in the north (Samaria), whereas the loyalists of Judah and Benjamin kept Rehoboam as their monarch and established the Kingdom of Judah in the south (Judea), ending Israelite political unity. While the existence of Israel and Judah as two independent kingdoms is not disputed, some historians and archaeologists reject the historicity of a United Monarchy of Israel and Judah.\nAround 720 BCE, Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The records of Assyrian king Sargon II indicate that he deported 27,290 Israelites to Mesopotamia. This deportation resulted in the loss of one-fifth of the kingdom's population and is known as the Assyrian captivity, which gave rise to the notion of the Ten Lost Tribes. Some of these Israelites, however, managed to migrate to safety in neighbouring Judah, though the Judahites themselves would be conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire nearly two centuries later. Those who stayed behind in Samaria following the Assyrian conquest mainly concentrated themselves around Mount Gerizim and eventually came to be known as the Samaritans. The Assyrians, as part of their historic deportation policy, also settled other conquered foreign populations in the territory of Israel.\nHistory.\nAccording to Israel Finkelstein, Shoshenq I's campaign in the second half of the 10th century BCE caused the collapse of the early polity of Gibeon in the central highlands, and made possible the beginning of the Northern Kingdom, with its capital at Shechem, around 931 BCE. Israel was consolidated as a kingdom in the first half of 9th century BCE, with its capital at Tirzah first, and next at the city of Samaria from 880 BCE. The existence of this Israelite state in the north is documented in 9th century BCE inscriptions. The earliest mention is from the Kurkh stela of c. 853 BCE, when Shalmaneser III mentions \"Ahab the Israelite\", plus the denominative for \"land\", and his ten thousand troops. This kingdom would have included parts of the lowlands (the Shephelah), the Jezreel plain, lower Galilee and parts of the Transjordan.\nAhab's forces were part of an anti-Assyrian coalition, implying that an urban elite ruled the kingdom, possessed a royal and state cult with large urban temples, and had scribes, mercenaries, and an administrative apparatus. In all this, it was similar to other recently founded kingdoms of the time, such as Ammon and Moab. Samaria is one of the most universally accepted archaeological sites from the biblical period. In around 840 BCE, the Mesha Stele records the victory of Moab (in today's Jordan), under King Mesha, over Israel, King Omri and his son Ahab.\nArchaeological finds, ancient Near Eastern texts, and the biblical record testify that in the time of the Omrides, Israel ruled in the mountainous Galilee, at Hazor in the upper Jordan Valley, in large parts of Transjordan between the Wadi Mujib and the Yarmuk, and in the coastal Sharon plain.\nIn Assyrian inscriptions, the Kingdom of Israel is referred to as the \"House of \u02bbOmri\". The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III mentions Jehu, son of \u02bbOmri. The Neo-Assyrian emperor Adad-nirari III made an expedition into the Levant around 803 BCE mentioned in the Nimrud slab, which lists the places he went to, sometimes using the apellative for \"land\", \"mat\": the Hatti and Amurru lands, Tyre, Sidon, the \"mat\" of \"Hu-um-ri\" (\"mat\"\"Hu-um-ri\", \"land of \u02bbOmri\"), Edom, Philistia, and Aram (not Judah). The Tell al-Rimah stela of the same king introduces a third way of talking about the kingdom, as Samaria, in the phrase \"Joash of Samaria\". The use of Omri's name to refer to the kingdom still survived, and was used by Sargon II in the phrase \"the whole house of Omri\" in describing his conquest of the city of Samaria in 722 BCE. It is significant that the Assyrians never mention the Kingdom of Judah until the end of the 8th century, when it was an Assyrian vassal state: possibly they never had contact with it, or possibly they regarded it as a vassal of Israel/Samaria or Aram, or possibly the southern kingdom did not exist during this period.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nOne traditional source for the history of the Kingdom of Israel has been the Hebrew Bible, especially the Books of Kings and Chronicles. These books were written by authors in Jerusalem, the capital of the Kingdom of Judah. Being written in a rival kingdom, they were inspired by ideological and theological viewpoints that influence the narrative. Anachronisms, legends and literary forms also affect the story. Some of the recorded events are believed to have occurred long after the destruction of the kingdom of Israel. Biblical archaeology has both confirmed and challenged parts of the biblical account. According to the Hebrew Bible, there existed a United Kingdom of Israel (the United Monarchy), ruled from Jerusalem by David and his son Solomon, after whose death Israel and Judah separated into two kingdoms.\nThe first mention of the name \"Israel\" is from an Egyptian inscription, the Merneptah Stele, dating from the Late Bronze Age (c. 1208 BCE); this gives little solid information, but indicates that the name of the later kingdom was borrowed rather than originating with the kingdom itself.\nRelationship with the Kingdom of Judah.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, for the first sixty years after the split, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over the northern kingdom, and there was perpetual war between them. For the following eighty years, there was no open war between them, as, for the most part, Judah had engaged in a military alliance with Aram-Damascus, opening a northern front against Israel. The conflict between Israel and Judah was temporarily settled when Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, allied himself with the reigning house of Israel, Ahab, through marriage. Later, Jehosophat's son and successor, Jehoram of Judah, married Ahab's daughter Athaliah, cementing the alliance. However, the sons of Ahab were slaughtered by Jehu following his coup d'\u00e9tat around 840 BCE.\nFrom Hazael to Jeroboam II.\nAfter being defeated by Hazael, Israel began a period of progressive recovery following the campaigns against Aram-Damascus of the Assyrian Adad-nirari III. This ultimately led to a period of major territorial expansion under Jeroboam II, who extended the kingdom's possessions throughout the Northern Transjordan. Following Jeroboam II's death, the Kingdom experienced a period of decline as a result of sectional rivalries and struggles for the throne.\nConquest by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (732\u2013720 BCE).\nIn c. 732 BCE, King Pekah of Israel, while allied with Rezin, king of Aram, threatened Jerusalem. Ahaz, King of Judah, appealed to Tiglath-Pileser III, the King of Assyria, for help. After Ahaz paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser, Tiglath-Pileser sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aram and the territories of the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh in Gilead, including the desert outposts of Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the Khabur River system, in Halah, Habor, Hara and Gozan (). Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of Naphtali and the city of Janoah in Ephraim, and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to and , the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\nThe remainder of the northern kingdom of Israel continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom until around 720 BCE, when it was again invaded by Assyria and more of the population was deported. Not all of Israel's populace was deported by the Assyrians. During the three-year siege of Samaria in the territory of Ephraim by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser V died and was succeeded by Sargon II, who himself records the capture of that city thus: \"Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away\" into Assyria. Thus, around 720 BCE, after two centuries, the northern kingdom came to an end. Some of the Israelite captives were resettled in the Khabur region, and the rest in the land of the Medes, thus establishing Hebrew communities in Ecbatana and Rages. The Book of Tobit additionally records that Sargon had taken other captives from the northern kingdom to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, in particular Tobit from the town of Thisbe in Naphtali.\nThe Hebrew Bible relates that the population of the Kingdom of Israel was exiled, becoming known as the Ten Lost Tribes. To the south, the Tribe of Judah, the Tribe of Simeon (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the Tribe of Benjamin and the people of the Tribe of Levi, who lived among them of the original Israelite nation, remained in the southern Kingdom of Judah. The Kingdom of Judah continued to exist as an independent state until 586 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.\nSamaritan tradition.\nThe tradition of the Samaritan people states that much of the population of the Kingdom of Israel remained in place after the Assyrian captivity, including the Tribes of Naphtali, Manasseh, Benjamin and Levi \u2013 being the progenitors of the modern Samaritans. Many members of these northern tribes also fled south to the Kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem seems to have expanded in size five-fold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water Siloam to be provided by King Hezekiah.\nRecorded accounts.\nIn their book \"The Bible Unearthed\", Israeli authors Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman estimate that only a fifth (about 40,000) of the population of the northern Kingdom of Israel were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II. No known non-Biblical record exists of the Assyrians having exiled people from four of the tribes of Israel: Dan, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun. Descriptions of the deportation of people from Reuben, Gad, Manasseh, Ephraim and Naphtali indicate that only a portion of these tribes were deported, and the places to which they were deported are known locations given in the accounts. The deported communities are mentioned as still existing at the time of the composition of the Books of Kings and Chronicles and did not disappear by assimilation. 2 Chronicles 30:1\u201318 explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians, in particular people of Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, Issachar and Zebulun, and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of Hezekiah.\nReligion.\nThe religion of the Kingdom of Israel appears to have followed two major trends. The first was the worship of Yahweh; the religion of ancient Israel is sometimes referred to by modern scholars as Yahwism. The Hebrew Bible, however, states that some of the northern Israelites also adored Baal, a title for Hadad, a weather god whose worship was centered at Jebel Aqra (Hebrew \"\u1e62afon\"; see 1 Kings 16:31 and the Baal Cycle discovered at Ugarit). The reference in Hosea 10 to Israel's \"divided heart\" may refer to these two cultic observances, although alternatively it may refer to hesitation between looking to Assyria and Egypt for support.\nThe Jewish Bible also states that Ahab allowed the cult worship of Baal to become acceptable within the kingdom. His wife Jezebel was the daughter of the Phoenician king of Tyre and a devotee to Baal worship ().\nDynasties.\nAccording to the Bible, the Northern Kingdom had 19 kings across 9 different dynasties throughout its 208 years of existence.\nMentions of Israel/Samaria in Assyrian literature and inscriptions.\nThe table below lists all the historical references to the Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) in Assyrian records. King Omri's name takes the Assyrian shape of \"Humri\", his kingdom or dynasty that of Bit Humri or alike\u2014the \"House of Humri/Omri\".\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Perhaps surprisingly, and to the development team\u2019s credit, it has managed one in 2.4.,\u201d he also noted that \u201cwords in particular is still lacking features\u201d. He concluded that Calligra is \u201cworth keeping an eye on\u201d.\nOn the other hand, Calligra Words became the default word processor in Kubuntu 12.04 \u2013 replacing LibreOffice Writer.\nFormula editor.\nFormulas in Calligra Words are provided by the Formula plugin.

He was the originator of the theory of tagmemics, the coiner of the terms \"emic\" and \"etic\" and the developer of the constructed language Kalaba-X for use in teaching the theory and practice of translation.\nIn addition, he was the First President of the Bible-translating organization Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), with which he was associated from 1935 until his death.\nLife.\nPike was born in Woodstock, Connecticut, and studied theology at Gordon College, a private Christian college in Wenham, Massachusetts, graduating with a B.A. in 1933. He initially wanted to do missionary work in China. When this was denied him, he studied linguistics with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). He went to Mexico with SIL, learning Mixtec from native speakers there in 1935.\nIn 1937 Pike went to the University of Michigan, where he worked for his doctorate in linguistics under Charles C. Fries. His research involved living among the Mixtecs and developing a written system for the Mixtec language with his wife, Evelyn. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1942, Pike became the First President of the Summer Institute in Linguistics. Its main function was to produce translations of the Bible in unwritten languages, and in 1951 Pike published the \"Mixtec New Testament\". He was the President of SIL International from 1942 to 1979.\nAs well as and in parallel with his role at SIL, Pike spent thirty years at the University of Michigan, during which time he served as chairman of its linguistics department, professor of linguistics, and director of its English Language Institute (he did pioneering work in the field of English language learning and teaching)\nand was later Professor Emeritus of the university.\nWork.\nPike is best known for his distinction between the \"emic\" and the \"etic\". \"Emic\" (as in \"phonemics\") refers to the role of cultural and linguistic categories as understood from within the cultural or linguistic system that they are a part of, while \"etic\" (as in \"phonetics\") refers to the analytical study of those sounds grounded outside of the system itself. Pike argued that only native speakers are competent judges of emic descriptions, and are thus crucial in providing data for linguistic research, while investigators from outside the linguistic group apply scientific methods in the analysis of language, producing etic descriptions which are verifiable and reproducible. Pike himself carried out studies of indigenous languages in Australia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Ghana, Java, Mexico, Nepal, New Guinea, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Peru.\nPike developed his theory of \"tagmemics\" to help with the analysis of languages from Central and South America, by identifying (using both semantic and syntactic elements) strings of linguistic elements capable of playing a number of different roles.\nPike's approach to the study of language put him outside the circle of the \"generative\" movement begun by Noam Chomsky, a dominant linguist in the 20th century, since Pike believed that the structure of language should be studied in context, not just as single sentences, as seen in the title of his magnum opus, \"Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behavior\" (1967).\nHe became well known for his \"monolingual demonstrations.\" He would stand before an audience, with a large number of chalkboards. A speaker of a language unknown to him would be brought in to work with Pike. Using gestures and objects, not asking questions in a language that the person might know, Pike would begin to analyze the language before the audience.\nHonors.\nPike was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America (LSA), the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States (LACUS), and the American Anthropological Association. He served as president of LSA and LACUS and later was nominated for the Templeton Prize three years in a row.\nWhen he was named to the Charles Carpenter Fries Professorship of Linguistics at the University of Michigan in 1974, the Dean's citation noted that \"his lifelong originality and energetic activity verge on the legendary.\" Pike was awarded honorary degrees by a number of institutions, including Huntington College, University of Chicago, Georgetown University, L'Universit\u00e9 R\u00e9n\u00e9 Descartes (Sorbonne), and Albert-Ludwig Universit\u00e4t (University of Freiburg). Though the Nobel Prize committee did not publicize nominations, in 1983 US Senator Alan J. Dixon and US Congressman Paul Simon announced that they had nominated Pike for the Nobel Peace Prize. Academic sponsors for his nomination included Charles F. Hockett, Sydney Lamb (Rice University), Gordon J. van Wylen (Hope College), Frank H. T. Rhodes (Cornell University), Andr\u00e9 Martinet (Sorbonne), David C.C. Li (National Taiwan Normal University), and Ming Liu (Chinese University of Hong Kong).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17439", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17439", "title": "K-Meleon", "text": "Lightweight web browser for Microsoft Windows\nK-Meleon is a free and open-source, lightweight web browser for Microsoft Windows. It uses the native Windows API to create its user interface. Early versions of K-Meleon rendered web pages with Gecko, Mozilla's browser layout engine, which Mozilla's browser Firefox and its email client Thunderbird also use. K-Meleon became a popular Windows browser and was available as an optional default browser in Europe via BrowserChoice.eu. K-Meleon continued to use Gecko for several years after Mozilla deprecated embedding it. Current versions of K-Meleon use the Goanna layout engine, a fork of Gecko created for the browser Pale Moon.\nK-Meleon began with the goal of being faster and lighter than Mozilla's original Internet suite. Until 2011, K-Meleon embedded Gecko in a stripped-down interface. Throughout its lifespan, K-Meleon has required small amounts of random-access memory (RAM). K-Meleon 76 supports discontinued versions of Windows such as Windows XP and Windows Vista. Mozilla no longer supports these platforms after their Firefox Quantum rewrite.\nCustomization is another primary design goal. Users can change the toolbars, menus, and keyboard shortcuts from text-based configuration files. K-Meleon supports macros, which are small browser extensions that users can examine, write, or edit in a text editor. K-Meleon's custom configuration files can trigger macros. Reviews describe the customization features as versatile but intimidating to the average user. Due to its adaptability, K-Meleon was recommended for Internet caf\u00e9s and libraries in the early 2000s.\nHistory.\nChristophe Thibault started the K-Meleon project in the 2000s, when many new browsers were launched. To open-source their once-dominant Netscape Communicator Internet suite, Netscape founded the Mozilla project. K-Meleon was one of several browsers to use Mozilla's browser engine Gecko. Thibault designed K-Meleon to combine Gecko with native Windows interface elements, an approach that was less resource-intensive and allowed the browser to blend into its environment.\nEmbedding Gecko.\nChristophe Thibault released K-Meleon 0.1 on August 21, 2000. While working at Nullsoft, Thibault said he created the first simple release to attract attention, during a day off. For the 0.2 release, he implemented features like context menus and moved development to SourceForge to welcome contributions from open-source developers.\nThibault handed the project over to new developers, including Brian Harris, Sebastian Spaeth, Jeff Doozan, and Ulf Erikson, who began implementing browser functions through modular Kplugins. The K-Meleon team released new versions with pop-up blocking and cookie management. These releases introduced text-based configuration files called configs that allowed users to customize the browser or hide interface elements, and a macro language to extend the browser. Early reviews described K-Meleon as small, fast, limited, and visually similar to Internet Explorer.\nK-Meleon was built with open-source code from Mozilla but its narrower focus offered advantages over the Mozilla Application Suite, which bundled the browser with applications for email, news, chat, and webpage editing. To create a stand-alone browser, the Galeon project embedded Mozilla's rendering engine. Galeon was released for Linux using GNOME's widget toolkit GTK. K-Meleon brought a similar approach to Windows using the operating system's native application programming interface (API) to create a lightweight user interface (UI). The K-Meleon developers released a stand-alone web browser for Windows two years before the Firefox alpha release. Mozilla created user interfaces via their cross-platform XML User Interface Language (XUL) layer. This technology used Gecko to lay out application interfaces. XUL allowed Mozilla to build one application for multiple operating systems but generated graphical controls that did not match the rest of the system. K-Meleon was smaller and more closely integrated into the Windows desktop than Mozilla's browser, and could use the native bookmarking system to access Internet Explorer's favorites.\nK-Meleon 0.7 was released with the Mozilla 1.0 engine in October 2002. Despite AOL disbanding upstream parent company Netscape in 2003, the development of K-Meleon continued. Mozilla continued work on Gecko, and K-Meleon was updated with service packs and version 0.8. In 2005, Ulf Erikson announced version 0.9 would be the final version of K-Meleon he would build. He was the project's developer but stated he was no longer using K-Meleon as his primary browser after moving to Linux. In January 2006, Dorian Boissonnade became the lead developer and began working towards a 1.0 release.\nK-Meleon 1.0 was released in July 2006 and made the browser fully translatable. It stored localizations in separate library-and-config files within existing K-Meleon installations. Parts of the browser could be translated in a text editor. K-Meleon 1.0 maintained support for its existing system of text-based configuration files and introduced a new graphical interface to change preferences from within the browser.\nVersion 1.1 expanded the macro system. Earlier versions placed all of the macros into a single config file. Initial releases came with fewer than 50 lines of macro code and instructions for end users to create their own macros. Later versions came with over 1,000 lines of macro code, and the macros users wrote and shared online. In response, K-Meleon developers separated macros into modules. Version 1.5 introduced a true tabbed interface.\nIn Europe, version 1.5 was an optional default Windows browser through Microsoft's browser ballot. Due to accusations of abusing its market position to promote Internet Explorer, Microsoft introduced a browser ballot in the European Economic Area (EEA). By 2010, it offered Windows users a choice of the 12 most popular web browsers, including K-Meleon.\n7x releases.\nIn 2011, Mozilla ended support for embedding the Gecko layout engine; because K-Meleon had previously relied on this API, the browser's future became uncertain. In 2013, after years without an official, stable release, the K-Meleon group began developing version 74. While Mozilla had ended support for embedding of Gecko, it maintained a technology called XULRunner. XULRunner was a stand-alone implementation of the Gecko engine designed to launch applications. K-Meleon 74 used XULRunner instead of Mozilla's deprecated embedding software. Outside the new engine, version 74 brought small improvements, including better CPU use and minor bug fixes.\nK-Meleon 75 included a spelling checker, form auto-completion, and a new skin system. Boissonnade began work on version 76 but suffered a hard disk drive failure during beta testing.\nGoanna branch.\nActive development on K-Meleon takes place using Goanna, a fork of Gecko created for the browser Pale Moon. With Firefox Quantum, Mozilla rewrote large parts of its browser engine. In 2017, Roy Tam forked K-Meleon 76 to run on Goanna. The project's former lead developer Boissonnade wrote; \"Thanks for taking care of that little lizard [after I] left it\". K-Meleon on Goanna remains compatible with deprecated versions of Windows and can run with smaller amounts of RAM than those required by mainstream web browsers. K-Meleon has lower memory requirements than other low-resource browsers.\nK-Meleon is updated on a rolling release schedule. By default, the browser is a multi-lingual portable application that can directly run from the host computer or removable media. It is also included in the PortableApps.com repository. By 2023, K-Meleon was not compatible with major web apps and social media sites. As of October 2024, the final planned release is version 76.5.5.\nCustomization.\nCustomization of K-Meleon's interface is possible using text-format configuration files called configs. The menus, keyboard shortcuts, and more can all be customized via K-Meleon's configuration files. These configs can call upon macros, a type of extension that can be opened in a text editor.\nA simple \"Hello, World!\" program could be written in K-Meleon's macro language that would pop up a small window with the message \"Hello world!\".\nHelloWorld{\n alert(\"Hello world!\");\nTo trigger the macro, a keyboard accelerator could be created by adding the code below to the accelerator config, causing the macro to launch if the Ctrl, Alt, and H keys are pressed at the same time.\nCTRL ALT H = macros(HelloWorld)\nCustom toolbars offer more options, but the syntax is similar. The example below would create a new toolbar with a button to trigger a macro.\nNewToolbar{\n !NewButton{\n macros(HelloWorld)\nThis combination of configs and macro modules provides control over much of the browser. It also creates a learning curve for customization that is not present in most browsers. A CNET review criticized K-Meleon because it \"requires some knowledge of computer code to get the most out of it\". Popular browsers use systems like WebExtensions, where there is a separation between users and extension developers.\nBecause of its flexibility, K-Meleon was useful for environments in which the browser needed to be customized for public use, such as libraries and Internet caf\u00e9s. It allowed administrators to hide some features from patrons. For example, a library could hide interface elements like the address bar or limit the computer's access to an online resource like the library catalog.\nLegacy Windows versions.\nK-Meleon supports a range of legacy software and hardware. Version 76 supports Windows XP (2001) and Windows Vista (2006). Windows XP and its Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 variant have been unsupported since 2019. The latest major browser releases to support these operating systems are Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 (2014), Google Chrome 49.0.2623.112 (2016), and Mozilla Firefox 52.9.0 (2018).\nWeb browsers cannot access secure websites if they do not support Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. As of 2018, most major web sites use TLS encryption via HTTPS. Early versions of K-Meleon for Windows 2000 and Windows 9X receive occasional updates for TLS certificates. K-Meleon 74 can access secure websites on Windows 2000 using an old version of the Goanna engine combined with up-to-date ciphers. K-Meleon 1.5 can run on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me. Occasional TLS updates allow version 1.5 to access secure websites.\nRelease history.\nK-Meleon, which was first released in 2000, has been under development for over 20 years and is still maintained. The most-recent version K-Meleon 76 is updated on a rolling release schedule. All versions of K-Meleon are written for Microsoft Windows operating systems.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is also a professor at the Max Reinhardt Seminar.\nBrandauer is known internationally for his roles in \"Mephisto\" (1981), \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983), \"Hanussen\" (1988), \"Burning Secret\" (1988), \"The Russia House\" (1990), and \"White Fang\" (1991). \nFor his supporting role as Bror von Blixen-Finecke in \"Out of Africa\" (1985), he was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award.\nBrandauer has a working knowledge of and has acted in at least five languages including German, Italian, Hungarian, English and French.\nPersonal life.\nBrandauer was born as Klaus Georg Steng in Bad Aussee, Austria (then part of the German Reich). He is the son of Maria Brandauer and Georg Steng (or Stenj), a civil servant. He subsequently took his mother's name as part of his professional name, Klaus Maria Brandauer.\nHis first wife was Karin Katharina M\u00fcller (14 October 1945 \u2013 13 November 1992), an Austrian film and television director and screenwriter, from 1963 until her death in 1992, aged 47, from cancer. Both were teenagers when they married, in 1963. They had one son, Christian. Brandauer married Natalie Krenn in 2007.\nCareer.\nBrandauer began acting on stage in 1962. After working in national theatre and television, he made his film debut in English in 1972, in \"The Salzburg Connection\". In 1975 he played in \"Derrick\" \u2013 in Season 2, Episode 8 called \"Pfandhaus\". His starring and award-winning role in Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3's \"Mephisto\" (1981) playing a self-absorbed actor, launched his international career. (He would later act in Szab\u00f3's 1985 \"Oberst Redl\".)\nFollowing his role in \"Mephisto\", Brandauer appeared as Maximillian Largo in \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983), a remake of the 1965 James Bond film \"Thunderball\". Roger Ebert said of his performance: \"For one thing, there's more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo. Brandauer is a wonderful actor, and he chooses not to play the villain as a clich\u00e9. Instead, he brings a certain poignancy and charm to Largo, and since Connery always has been a particularly human James Bond, the emotional stakes are more convincing this time.\"\nHe starred in \"Out of Africa\" (1985), opposite Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. Brandauer was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for the performance. In 1987, he was the Head of the Jury at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1988 he appeared in \"Hanussen\" opposite Erland Josephson and Ildik\u00f3 B\u00e1ns\u00e1gi.\nBrandauer was originally cast as Marko Ramius in \"The Hunt for Red October\". That role eventually went to Sean Connery, who played James Bond to Brandauer's Largo in \"Never Say Never Again\". He co-starred with Connery again in \"The Russia House\" (1990).\nHis other film roles have been in \"The Lightship\" (1986), \"Streets of Gold\" (1986), \"Burning Secret\" (1988), \"White Fang\" (1991), \"Becoming Colette\" (1991), \"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge\" (1999, as director Otto Preminger), and \"Everyman's Feast\" (2002). In 1989, he participated in TF1's two-part historical film \"La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise\", playing the role of Georges Danton. He has also appeared as King Nebuchadnezzar II in 1998, in Time Life's Jeremiah, from The Bible Collection: The Old Testament.\nBrandauer has directed two films: \"Seven Minutes\" (1989), in which he starred as attempted Hitler assassin Georg Elser; and \"Mario and the Magician\" (1994), based on the 1929 novella by Thomas Mann, in which he starred as Cipolla, a magician with hypnotic powers.\nIn August 2006, Brandauer's much-awaited production of \"The Threepenny Opera\" gained a mixed reception. Brandauer had resisted questions about how his production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's classic musical comedy about the criminal MacHeath would differ from earlier versions, and his production featured Mack the Knife in a three-piece suit and white gloves, stuck to Brecht's text, and avoided any references to contemporary politics or issues.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17441", "revid": "46781902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17441", "title": "Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker", "text": "US military aerial refueling and transport aircraft\nThe Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker is an American military aerial refueling tanker aircraft that was developed from the Boeing 367-80 prototype, alongside the Boeing 707 airliner. It has a narrower fuselage and is shorter than the 707. Boeing gave the aircraft the internal designation of Model 717 (number later assigned to a different Boeing aircraft). The KC-135 was the United States Air Force (USAF)'s first jet-powered refueling tanker and replaced the KC-97 Stratofreighter. The KC-135 was initially tasked with refueling strategic bombers, but it was used extensively in the Vietnam War and later conflicts such as Operation Desert Storm to extend the range and endurance of US tactical fighters and bombers.\nThe KC-135 entered service with the USAF in 1957; it is one of nine military fixed-wing aircraft (six American, three Russian) with over 60 years of continuous service with its original operator. The KC-135 was supplemented by the larger McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender. Studies have concluded that many of the aircraft could be flown until 2030, although maintenance costs have greatly increased. The KC-135 is to be partially replaced by the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus.\nDevelopment.\nBackground.\nStarting in 1950, the USAF operated the world's first production aerial tanker, the Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, a gasoline fueled piston-engined Boeing Stratocruiser (USAF designation C-97 Stratofreighter) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber after World War II. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. The 230\u00a0mph (370\u00a0km/h) cruise speed of the slower, piston-engined KC-97 was also a serious issue, as using it as an aerial tanker forced the newer jet-powered military aircraft to slow down to mate with the tanker's boom.\nLike its sibling, the commercial Boeing 707 jet airliner, the KC-135 was derived from the Boeing 367-80 jet transport \"proof of concept\" demonstrator, which was commonly called the \"Dash-80\". The KC-135 is similar in appearance to the 707, but has a narrower fuselage and is shorter than the 707. The KC-135 predates the 707, and is structurally quite different from the civilian airliner. Boeing gave the future KC-135 tanker the initial designation Model 717.\nIn 1954, USAF's Strategic Air Command (SAC) held a competition for a jet-powered aerial refueling tanker. Lockheed Corporation's tanker version of the proposed Lockheed L-193 airliner with rear fuselage-mounted engines was declared the winner in 1955. Since Boeing's proposal was already flying, the KC-135 could be delivered two years earlier and Air Force Secretary Harold E. Talbott ordered 250 KC-135 tankers until Lockheed's design could be manufactured. In the end, orders for the Lockheed tanker were dropped rather than supporting two tanker designs. Lockheed never produced its jet airliner, while Boeing would eventually dominate the market with a family of airliners based on the 707.\nIn 1954, the USAF placed an initial order for 29 KC-135As, the first of an eventual 820 of all variants of the basic C-135 family. The first aircraft flew in August 1956 and the initial production Stratotanker was delivered to Castle Air Force Base, California, in June 1957. The last KC-135 was delivered to the USAF in 1965.\nDeveloped in the early 1950s, the basic airframe is characterized by 35-degree aft swept wings and tail, four underwing-mounted engine pods, a horizontal stabilizer mounted on the fuselage near the bottom of the vertical stabilizer with positive dihedral on the two horizontal planes and a hi-frequency radio antenna which protrudes forward from the top of the vertical fin or stabilizer. These basic features make it strongly resemble the commercial Boeing 707 and 720 aircraft, although it is a different aircraft.\nReconnaissance and command post variants of the aircraft, including the RC-135 Rivet Joint and EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft were operated by SAC from 1963 through 1992, when they were reassigned to the Air Combat Command (ACC). The USAF EC-135 Looking Glass was subsequently replaced in its role by the U.S. Navy E-6 Mercury aircraft, a new build airframe based on the Boeing 707-320B.\nEngine retrofits.\nAll KC-135s were originally equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-P-59W turbojet engines, which produced of thrust dry, and approximately of thrust wet. Wet thrust is achieved through the use of water injection on takeoff, as opposed to \"wet thrust\" when used to describe an afterburning engine. of water are injected into the engines over the course of three minutes. The water is injected into the inlet and the diffuser case in front of the combustion case. The water cools the air in the engine to increase its density; it also reduces the turbine gas temperature, which is a primary limitation on many jet engines. This allows the use of more fuel for proper combustion and creates more thrust for short periods of time, similar in concept to \"War Emergency Power\" in a piston-engined aircraft.\nIn the 1980s, the first modification program retrofitted 157 Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and Air National Guard (ANG) tankers with the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33-PW-102 turbofan engines from 707 airliners retired in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The modified tanker, designated the KC-135E, was 14% more fuel-efficient than the KC-135A and could offload 20% more fuel on long-duration flights. Only the KC-135E aircraft were equipped with thrust reversers for aborted takeoffs and shorter landing roll-outs. The KC-135E fleet has since either been retrofitted as the R-model configuration or placed into long-term storage (\"XJ\"), as Congress has prevented the USAF from formally retiring them. The final KC-135E, tail number \"56-3630\", was delivered by the 101st Air Refueling Wing to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base in September 2009.\nThe second modification program retrofitted 500 aircraft with new CFM International CFM56 (military designation: F108) high-bypass turbofan engines produced by General Electric and Safran. The CFM56 engine produces approximately of thrust, nearly a 100% increase compared to the original J57 engine. The modified tanker, designated KC-135R (modified KC-135A or E) or KC-135T (modified KC-135Q), can offload up to 50% more fuel (on a long-duration sortie), is 25% more fuel-efficient, and costs 25% less to operate than with the previous engines. It is also significantly quieter than the KC-135A, with noise levels at takeoff reduced from 126 to 99 decibels. This 27 decibel noise reduction results in a sound pressure level of about 5% of the original level.\nThe KC-135R's operational range is 60% greater than the KC-135E for comparable fuel offloads, providing a wider range of basing options.\nUpgrading the remaining KC-135Es into KC-135Rs is no longer in consideration; this would have cost approximately US$3 billion, $24 million per aircraft. According to USAF data, the KC-135 fleet had a total operation and support cost in fiscal year 2001 of about $2.2\u00a0billion (~$ in 2024). The older E model aircraft averaged total costs of about $4.6\u00a0million per aircraft, while the R models averaged about $3.7\u00a0million per aircraft. Those costs include personnel, fuel, maintenance, modifications, and spare parts.\nAvionics upgrades.\nIn order to expand the KC-135's capabilities and improve its reliability, the aircraft has undergone a number of avionics upgrades. Among these was the Pacer-CRAG program (compass, radar and GPS) which ran from 1999 to 2002 and modified all the aircraft in the inventory to eliminate the Navigator position from the flight crew. The fuel management system was also replaced. The program development was done by Rockwell Collins in Iowa and installation was performed by BAE Systems at the Mojave Airport in California. Block 40.6 allows the KC-135 to comply with global air-traffic management. The latest block upgrade to the KC-135, the Block 45 program, is online with the first 45 upgraded aircraft delivered by January 2017. Block 45 adds a new glass cockpit digital display, radio altimeter, digital autopilot, digital flight director and computer updates. The original, no longer procurable, analog instruments, including all engine gauges, were replaced. Rockwell Collins again supplied the major avionic modules, with modification done at Tinker AFB.\nFurther upgrades and derivatives.\nThe KC-135Q variant was modified to carry JP-7 fuel necessary for the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird by separating the JP-7 from the KC-135's own fuel supply (the body tanks carrying JP-7, and the wing tanks carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks. When the KC-135Q model received the CFM56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body tanks from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T is the presence of a clear window on the underside of the empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body tanks and wing tanks separately.\nEight KC-135R aircraft are receiver-capable tankers, commonly referred to as KC-135R(RT). All eight aircraft were with the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell AFB, Kansas, in 1994. They are primarily used for force extension and Special Operations missions, and are crewed by highly qualified receiver capable crews. If not used for the receiver mission, these aircraft can be flown just like any other KC-135R.\nThe Multi-point Refueling Systems (MPRS) modification adds refueling pods to the KC-135's wings. The pods allow refueling of U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and most NATO tactical jet aircraft while keeping the tail-mounted refueling boom. The pods themselves are Flight Refueling Limited MK.32B model pods, and refuel via the probe and drogue method common to Navy/Marine Corps tactical jets, rather than the primary \"flying boom\" method used by Air Force fixed-wing aircraft. This allows the tanker to refuel two receivers at the same time, which increases throughput compared to the boom drogue adapter.\nA number of KC-135A and KC-135B aircraft have been modified to EC-135, RC-135 and OC-135 configurations for use in several different roles (although these could also be considered variants of the C-135 Stratolifter family).\nDesign.\nThe KC-135R has four turbofan engines, mounted under 35-degree swept wings, which power it to takeoffs at gross weights up to . Nearly all internal fuel can be pumped through the tanker's flying boom, the KC-135's primary fuel transfer method. A boom operator stationed in the rear of the aircraft controls the boom while lying prone, viewing through a window at the bottom of the tail. Both the flying boom and operator's station are similar to those of the previous KC-97. A special shuttlecock-shaped drogue, attached to and trailing behind the flying boom, may be used to refuel aircraft fitted with probes. This apparatus is significantly more unforgiving of pilot error in the receiving aircraft than conventional trailing hose arrangements; an aircraft so fitted is also incapable of refueling by the normal flying boom method until the attachment is removed. A cargo deck above the refueling system can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo. Depending on fuel storage configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to of cargo.\nOperational history.\nIntroduction into service.\nThe KC-135 was initially purchased to support SAC bombers, but by the late 1960s, in the Southeast Asia theater, the KC-135 Stratotanker's ability as a force multiplier came to the fore. Midair refueling of F-105 and F-4 fighter-bombers as well as B-52 bombers brought far-flung bombing targets within reach, and allowed fighter missions to spend hours at the front, rather than a few minutes, which was usual due to their limited fuel reserves and high fuel consumption. KC-135 crews refueled both USAF and Navy/ Marine Corps aircraft; though they would have to change to probe and drogue adapters depending upon the mission, the Navy and Marine Corps not having fitted their aircraft with flying boom receptacles since the USAF boom system was impractical for aircraft carrier operations. Crews also helped to bring in damaged aircraft which could sometimes fly while being fed by fuel to a landing site or to ditch over the water (specifically those with punctured fuel tanks). KC-135s continued their tactical support role in later conflicts such as Operation Desert Storm and current aerial strategy.\nSAC had the KC-135 Stratotanker in service with Regular Air Force SAC units from 1957 through 1992 and with SAC-gained ANG and AFRES units from 1975 through 1992. Following a major USAF reorganization that resulted in the inactivation of SAC in 1992, most KC-135s were reassigned to the newly created AMC. While AMC gained the preponderance of the aerial refueling mission, a small number of KC-135s were also assigned directly to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). All AFRC KC-135s and most of the ANG KC-135 fleet became operationally-gained by AMC, while Alaska Air National Guard and Hawaii Air National Guard KC-135s became operationally-gained by PACAF.\nAMC managed 396 Stratotankers, of which the AFRC and ANG flew 243 in support of AMC's mission as of May 2018. The KC-135 is one of a few military aircraft types with over 50 years of continuous service with its original operator as of 2009.\nIsrael was offered KC-135s again in 2013, after turning down the aging aircraft twice due to expense of keeping them flying. The IAF again rejected the offered KC-135Es, but said that it would consider up to a dozen of the newer KC-135Rs.\nAs of 2025, the oldest active aircraft in the U.S military is KC-135 57-1419, in service with the 161st Air Refueling Wing, based out of Goldwater Air National Guard Base, Arizona. The aircraft was built in 1957, and as of 2013 had 22,300 flight hours.\nResearch usage.\nBesides its primary role as an inflight aircraft refueler, the KC-135, designated NKC-135, has assisted in several research projects at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. One such project occurred between 1979 and 1980 when special wingtip \"winglets\", developed by Richard Whitcomb of the Langley Research Center, were tested at Armstrong, using an NKC-135A tanker loaned to NASA by the Air Force. Winglets are small, nearly vertical fins installed on an aircraft's wing tips. The results of the research showed that drag was reduced and range could be increased by as much as 7 percent at cruise speeds. Winglets are now being incorporated into most new commercial and military transport/passenger jets, as well as business aviation jets.\nNASA also has operated several KC-135 aircraft (without the tanker equipment installed) as their famed Vomit Comet zero-gravity simulator aircraft. The longest-serving (1973 to 1995) version was KC-135A, AF Ser. No. \"59-1481\", named \"Weightless Wonder IV\" and registered as N930NA.\nReplacements.\nBetween 1993 and 2003, the amount of KC-135 depot maintenance work doubled, and the overhaul cost per aircraft tripled. In 1996, it cost $8,400 per flight hour for the KC-135, and in 2002 this had grown to $11,000. The Air Force's 15-year estimates project further significant cost growth through fiscal year 2017. KC-135 fleet operations and support costs were estimated to grow from about $2.2\u00a0billion in fiscal year 2003 to $5.1\u00a0billion (2003 dollars) in fiscal year 2017, an increase of over 130 percent, which represented an annual operating cost growth rate of about 6.2 percent.\nThe USAF projected that E and R models have lifetime flying hour limits of 36,000 and 39,000 hours, respectively. According to the Air Force, only a few KC-135s would reach these limits by 2040, when some aircraft would be about 80 years old. A later 2005 Air Force study estimated that KC-135Es upgraded to the R standard could remain in use until 2030.\nIn 2006, the KC-135E fleet was flying an annual average of 350 hours per aircraft and the KC-135R fleet was flying an annual average of 710 hours per aircraft. The KC-135 fleet is currently flying double its planned yearly flying hour program to meet airborne refueling requirements, and has resulted in higher than forecast usage and sustainment costs. In March 2009, the Air Force indicated that KC-135s would require additional skin replacement to allow their continued use beyond 2018.\nThe USAF decided to replace the KC-135 fleet. However, the fleet is large and will need to be replaced gradually. Initially the first batch of replacement planes was to be an air tanker version of the Boeing 767, leased from Boeing. In 2003, this was changed to contract where the Air Force would purchase 80 KC-767 aircraft and lease 20 more. In December 2003, the Pentagon froze the contract and in January 2006, the KC-767 contract was canceled. This move followed public revelations of corruption in how the contract was awarded, as well as controversy regarding the original leasing rather than outright purchase agreement. The then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld stated that that move would in no way impair the Air Force's ability to deliver the mission of the KC-767, which would be accomplished by implementing continuing upgrades to the KC-135 and KC-10 Extender fleet.\nIn January 2007, the U.S. Air Force launched the KC-X program with a request for proposal (RFP). KC-X was the first phase of three acquisition programs meant to replace the KC-135 fleet. On 29 February 2008, the US Defense Department announced that it had selected the EADS/Northrop Grumman \"KC-30\" (to be designated the KC-45A) over the Boeing KC-767. Boeing protested the award on 11 March 2008, citing irregularities in the competition and bid evaluation. On 18 June 2008, the US Government Accountability Office sustained Boeing's protest of the selection of the Northrop Grumman/EADS's tanker. In February 2010, the US Air Force restarted the KC-X competition with the release of a revised request for proposal (RFP). After evaluating bids, the USAF selected Boeing's 767-based tanker design, with the military designation KC-46, as a replacement in February 2011. The first KC-46A Pegasus was delivered to the U.S. Air Force on 10 January 2019.\nTwo export users of the KC-135, the French Air and Space Force and the Republic of Singapore Air Force took deliveries of Airbus A330 MRTTs as replacements for their Stratotankers.\nVariants.\nKC-135A.\nOriginal production version powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney J57s, 732 built. Initial production batch of 29 aircraft was given the company designation Model 717-100A, while the later batches of 68 and 635 aircraft were respectively designated 717-146 and 717-148.\nNKC-135A.\nTest-configured KC-135A.\nKC-135B.\nAirborne command post version equipped with turbofan engines, 17 built.

The four aircraft (serial numbers \"63-8058, 63-8059, 63-8060\" and \"63-8061\") were given a unique designation KC-135D as they differed from the KC-135A in that they were built with a flight engineer's position on the flight deck. The flight engineer's position was removed when the aircraft were modified to KC-135 standards but they retained their electrically powered wing flap secondary (emergency) drive mechanism and second air conditioning pack which had been used to cool the RC-135As on-board photo-mapping systems. Later re-engined with Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33 engines and a cockpit update to KC-135E standards in 1990 and were retired to the 309th AMARG at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ in 2007.\nKC-135E.\nAir National Guard and Air Force Reserve KC-135As re-engined with Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33-PW-102 engines from retired 707 airliners (161 modified). All E model aircraft were retired to the 309th AMARG at Davis-Monthan AFB by September 2009 and replaced with R models.\nNKC-135E.\nTest-configured KC-135E. 55-3132 NKC-135E \"Big Crow I\" &amp; 63-8050 NKC-135B \"Big Crow II\" used as airborne targets for the Boeing YAL-1 Airborne Laser carrier.\nKC-135Q.\nKC-135As modified to carry JP-7 fuel necessary for the SR-71 Blackbird, 56 modified, survivors to KC-135T.\nKC-135R (1960s).\n4 JC/KC-135As converted to \"Rivet Stand\" (Later \"Rivet Quick\") configuration for reconnaissance and evaluation of above ground nuclear test (55-3121, 59\u20131465, 59\u20131514, 58\u20130126; 58-0126 replaced 59-1465 after it crashed in 1967).

{"id": "17442", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17442", "title": "Katsuhiro Otomo", "text": "Japanese manga artist and filmmaker (born 1954)\n is a Japanese manga artist, screenwriter, animator, and film director. He first rose to prominence as a pioneer founder of the New Wave in the 1970s. He is best known as the creator of \"Akira\", both the original 1982 manga series and the 1988 animated film adaptation. In 2005, Otomo was decorated a \"Chevalier\" of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, promoted to \"Officier\" of the order in 2014, and became the fourth manga artist ever inducted into the American Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2012. Celebrated in Japan, he was also awarded the Purple Medal of Honor from the national government in 2013.\nIn addition, Otomo later received the Winsor McCay Award at the 41st Annie Awards in 2014 and the 2015 Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoul\u00eame, the first manga artist to receive the award.\nEarly life.\nKatsuhiro Otomo was born in Tome, Miyagi Prefecture and grew up in Tome District. He said that living in the very rural T\u014dhoku region left him with nothing to do as a child, so he read a lot of manga. As the only boy in a family with older and younger sisters, he enjoyed reading and drawing manga on his own and thought about becoming a manga artist. Limited by his parents to buying one manga book a month, Otomo typically chose Kobunsha's \"Sh\u014dnen\" magazine, which included \"Astro Boy\" by Osamu Tezuka and \"Tetsujin 28-go\" by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, series which he would copy drawing in elementary school. However, he said it was after reading Shotaro Ishinomori's \"How to Draw Manga\" that he understood how to draw manga properly and started doing so more seriously.\nIn high school, Otomo developed an interest in movies, that led to his ambition to become an illustrator or film director. At this time, one of his friends introduced him to an editor at Futabasha, who, after seeing Otomo's manga, told the high school student to contact him if he moved to Tokyo after graduating. Otomo did exactly that, and began his career in Tokyo as a 19-year old professional manga artist.\nCareer.\nManga.\nOn October 4, 1973, Otomo published his first work, a manga adaptation of Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's short story \"Mateo Falcone\", titled \"A Gun Report\".\nIn 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine \"Weekly Manga Action\", Otomo created his first science-fiction work, titled \"Fireball\". Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Otomo's career as it contained many of the same themes he would explore in his later, more successful manga such as \"\". \"D\u014dmu\" began serialization in January 1980 and ran until July 1981. It was not published in book form until 1983, when it won the Nihon SF Taisho Award. It also won the 1984 Seiun Award for Best Comic.\nIn a collaboration with writer Toshihiko Yahagi, Otomo illustrated \"Kibun wa m\u014d Sens\u014d\" about a fictional war that erupts in the border between China and the Soviet Union. It was published in \"Weekly Manga Action\" from 1980 to 1981 and collected into one volume in 1982. It won the 1982 Seiun Award for Best Comic. 38 years later, the two created the one-shot sequel \"Kibun wa m\u014d Sens\u014d 3 (Datta Kamo Shirenai)\" for the April 16, 2019 issue of the magazine.\nAlso in 1981, Otomo drew \"A Farewell to Weapons\" for the November 16 issue of Kodansha's \"Young Magazine\". It was later included in the 1990 short story collection \"Kanojo no Omoide...\"\nIn 1982, Otomo began what would become his most acclaimed and famous work: \"Akira\". Kodansha had been asking him to write a series for their new \"Young Magazine\" for some time, but he had been busy with other work. From the first meeting with the publisher, \"Akira\" was to be only about ten chapters \"or something like that,\" so Otomo said he was really not expecting it to be a success. It was serialized for eight years and 2000 pages of artwork.\nIn 1990, Otomo did a brief interview with MTV for a general segment on the Japanese manga scene at the time. Otomo created the one-shot \"Hi no Y\u014djin\" about people who put out fires in Japan's Edo period for the debut issue of \"Comic Cue\" in January 1995.\nOtomo wrote the 2002 picture book \"\", which was illustrated by Shinji Kimura.\nOtomo created the full-color work \"DJ Teck no Morning Attack\" for the April 2012 issue of \"Geijutsu Shincho\".\nFollowing the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, Otomo, a native of the T\u014dhoku region, designed a relief that features a boy riding a robot goldfish in rough seas, while flanked by F\u016bjin and Raijin. Intended to capture the region's will to overcome the natural disaster, it has been located on the first floor of the terminal building at Sendai Airport since March 2015.\nOtomo was initially reported in 2012 to be working on his first long-form manga since \"Akira\". Planning to draw the work that is set during Japan's Meiji period without assistants, he was initially targeting a younger audience, but said the story had developed more towards an older one. Although planned to begin in fall 2012, Otomo revealed in November of that year that the series had been delayed. By 2018, Otomo said he was doing a full-length work, but the contents were still secrets. In 2022, Kodansha released Otomo's entire body of manga since 1971 as part of \"The Complete Works Project,\" which featured six separate releases of two books each. It was noted that some of his manga were edited when initially compiled into book format, and this new project, personally overseen by Otomo, restored them to how they appeared in their original serialization.\nFilm.\nAt the age of 25, Otomo spent about 5 million yen to make a 16 mm live-action film about an hour long. He said that making this private film showed him roughly how to make and direct movies. In 1982, Otomo made his anime debut, working as character designer for the animated film \"Harmagedon: Genma Wars\". It was while working on this film that Otomo began to think he could do it by himself.\nIn 1987, Otomo directed an animated work for the first time: a segment, which he also wrote the screenplay and drew animation for, in the anthology feature \"Neo Tokyo\". He followed this up with two segments in another anthology released that year, \"Robot Carnival\". In 1988, he directed the animated film adaptation of his manga \"Akira\".\nOtomo was executive producer of 1995's \"Memories\", an anthology film based on three of his stories. Additionally, he wrote the script for \"Stink Bomb\" and \"Cannon Fodder\", the latter of which he also directed.\nOtomo has worked extensively with the studio Sunrise. In 1998, he directed the CG short \"Gundam: Mission to the Rise\" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their \"Gundam\" franchise. The studio has animated and produced his 2004 feature film \"Steamboy\", 2006's \"Freedom Project\", and 2007's \"SOS! Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next\". The last, is based on Otomo's 1980 manga \"SOS! Tokyo Metro Explorer\" and follows the son of its main characters.\nThe 2001 animated film \"Metropolis\" features a script written by Otomo that adapts Tezuka's manga of the same name.\nOtomo directed the 2006 live-action film \"Mushishi\", based on Yuki Urushibara's manga of the same name.\nIn 2013, Otomo took part in \"Short Peace\", an anthology consisting on 4 short films; he directed \"Combustible\", a tragic love story set in the Edo period based on his 1995 manga \"Hi no Y\u014djin\", while Hajime Katoki directed \"A Farewell to Weapons\", depicting a battle in a ruined Tokyo based on Otomo's 1981 manga of the same name. \"Combustible\" won the Grand Prize in the Animation category of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2012, and was even shortlisted for the 2013 Best Animated Short at the 85th Academy Awards.\nOtomo directed the music video for Aya Nakano's 2016 song \"Juku-Hatachi\". He is a fan of the singer and previously drew the cover to her 2014 album \"Warui Kuse\".\nReports have suggested that Otomo will be the executive producer of the live-action film adaptation of \"Akira\". In 2019, he announced that he is writing and directing an animated film adaptation of his 2001 manga \"Orbital Era\" with Sunrise and released a trailer that same year.\nStyle.\nOtomo said that when he started his professional career in the late 1970s, \"almost all manga was gekiga like \"Golgo 13\". So it was all gekiga or sports manga, nothing to do with science fiction.\" Remembering how much he loved science fiction as a child, Otomo wanted to recreate that kind of excitement; \"That was in part how something like \"Domu\" came about. [...] There was no hard science fiction manga [...] so I wanted to change that and do something more realistic and believable.\"\nDescribing his characterization style, Otomo said he first tried to draw and imitate \"very traditional manga-like art,\" such as \"Astro Boy\". But by the time he was in high school, illustration work by people like Tadanori Yokoo and Yoshitaro Isaka was popular, so he wanted to create manga characters with this illustrative art style. When asked about how Japanese critics praise him as the first manga artist to draw realistic Japanese faces, Otomo said he always tries to balance fantasy and realism; \"Depicting things too realistically actually damages the social realism of the piece, and if you go too far into the realm of fantasy, that hurts its imaginative ability.\" However, he said the realism of his early works probably came from having used friends as character models. French cartoonist Moebius, who is known for realistic character designs, is often cited as one of Otomo's biggest influences. Otomo is considered to be one of the artists of the New Wave in manga in the late 1970s and 1980s especially due to his visual innovation.\nOtomo includes homages to his favorite childhood manga in his work, and there were three manga authors that he really respected at that time; Osamu Tezuka, Shotaro Ishinomori and Mitsuteru Yokoyama. He named the main computer in \"Fireball\" ATOM after Tezuka's character of the same name, the character nicknamed Ecchan in \"Domu\" is a reference to Ishinomori's \"Sarutobi Ecchan\", and the title character of \"Akira\" is also known as No. 28 in homage to Yokoyama's \"Tetsujin 28-go\" in addition to the two series having the \"same overall plot.\" Ever since depicting the apartment complex in \"Domu\", Otomo has had a large interest in architecture, proclaiming, \"I don't think there was anyone before me who put this much effort into their depictions of buildings.\" He believes this habit of drawing detailed backgrounds was influenced by Shigeru Mizuki's manga, which showed him how important backdrops are to a story. Otomo strongly praised the framing done by Tetsuya Chiba, whose work he studied a lot out of admiration at a store in Kichijoji, for making it easy to grasp how tangible the backgrounds and characters are. It was taken from Chiba's \"Notari Matsutaro, \" a seinen sports manga that mainly inspired Otomo to develop his \"grammar\" for making manga, including \" Domu.\"\nWhen asked about his influences in designing the mecha in \"Farewell to Weapons\", Otomo pointed out that Studio Nue's work was popular at the time, specifically mentioning the powered suit designs by Kazutaka Miyatake and Naoyuki Kato. He also stated that he is a fan of mecha by Takashi Watabe and Makoto Kobayashi and is fond of those seen in \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", but explained that all his influences are jumbled and mixed together; \"In short, I digest many different things and ideas tend to pop out from that.\"\nLegacy.\nIt was around the 1979 publication of his \"Short Peace\" short story collection that Otomo's work became influential in Japan. Artists influenced by him and his work include Hisashi Eguchi, Naoki Urasawa, Naoki Yamamoto, Makoto Aida and Hiroya Oku. When talking in 1997 about the future of manga, Urasawa opined that [Osamu] Tezuka created the form that exists today, then caricatures appeared next, and comics changed again when Katsuhiro Otomo came on the scene. I don't think there's any room left for further changes. \nMasashi Kishimoto cited Otomo as one of his two biggest influences, but liked Otomo's art style the best and imitated it while trying to develop his own. The Dragon Ball manga creator Akira Toriyama was interviewed on who was his favorite manga artist, and said that he found his peer Otomo to be \u201cincredible.\u201d\nOtomo's manga work also notably influenced a number of Japanese video game designers by the mid-1980s, including Enix's Yuji Horii (\"The Portopia Serial Murder Case\" and \"Dragon Quest\"), Capcom's Noritaka Funamizu (\"Gun.Smoke\" and \"Hyper Dyne Side Arms\"), UPL's Tsutomu Fujisawa (\"Ninja-Kid\"), Thinking Rabbit's Hiroyuki Imabayashi (\"Sokoban\"), dB-SOFT's Naoto Shinada (\"Volguard\"), Hot-B's Jun Kuriyama (\"Psychic City\"), and Microcabin's Masashi Katou (\"Eiyuu Densetsu Saga\").\nDirector Satoshi Kon, who worked as an assistant to Otomo in both manga and film, cited \"Akira\" and especially \"Domu\" as influences. American film director Rian Johnson is a big fan of Otomo and pointed out similarities between how telekinesis is depicted in \"Domu\" and its depiction in his film \"Looper\".\nIn 2017, the book \"Otomo: A Global Tribute to the Mind Behind Akira\" was published in Japan, France and the United States, featuring writing and artwork from 80 artists such as Masakazu Katsura, Taiyo Matsumoto, Masamune Shirow, Asaf and Tomer Hanuka, and Stan Sakai.

She is noted for her eclectic musical style and unconventional lyrics, as well as her innovative dance performances. Her sound and choreography have influenced a range of artists, raising her to prominence and impacting popular culture.\nBush began writing songs when she was 11. She was signed to EMI Records after David Gilmour of Pink Floyd helped finance a demo tape. In 1978, at the age of 19, she topped the UK singles chart for four weeks with her debut single \"Wuthering Heights\", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a fully self-written song. Her debut studio album, \"The Kick Inside\" (1978), reached number three on the UK Albums Chart. Bush was the first British solo female artist to top the UK Albums Chart and the first female artist to enter it at number one. All nine of her studio albums have reached the UK top 10, including the number-one albums \"Never for Ever\" (1980), \"Hounds of Love\" (1985), and the greatest-hits compilation \"The Whole Story\" (1986). Since \"The Dreaming\" (1982), she has produced all of her studio albums. She took a hiatus between her seventh and eighth albums, \"The Red Shoes\" (1993) and \"Aerial\" (2005). Her latest albums, \"Director's Cut\" and \"50 Words for Snow\", were both released in 2011. \nBush has released 25 UK top 40 singles, including the top-10 hits \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\" (1978), \"Babooshka\" (1980), \"Running Up That Hill\" (1985), \"Don't Give Up\" (a 1986 duet with Peter Gabriel), and \"King of the Mountain\" (2005). She experienced renewed attention in 2014 with her concert residency Before the Dawn\u2014her first shows since the Tour of Life in 1979\u2014and in 2022 after \"Running Up That Hill\" appeared in the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\". The song became Bush's second UK number one single and her highest entry on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number three, in addition to topping several international charts. \"Hounds of Love\" also had a commercial resurgence, topping two \"Billboard\" charts and reaching number twelve on the \"Billboard\" 200. \nBush has received numerous accolades and honours, including 14 Brit Awards nominations and a win for British Female Solo Artist in 1987, as well as seven nominations for Grammy Awards. In 2002, she received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music. She became a Fellow of the Ivors Academy in the UK in 2020, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.\nLife and career.\n1958\u20131972: Early life.\nBush was born on 30 July 1958 at a maternity hospital in Bexleyheath, Kent, to an English doctor, general practitioner Robert Bush (1920\u20132008), and Hannah Patricia (n\u00e9e Daly) (1918\u20131992), an Irish staff nurse, daughter of a farmer in County Waterford. She grew up with her elder brothers, John and Paddy, in an over 350-year-old former farmhouse at East Wickham near Welling, which neighbours Bexleyheath. Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was an amateur traditional Irish dancer, her father was an amateur pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker, and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local folk music scene. She was raised as a Roman Catholic.\nBush trained at Goldsmiths College karate club, where her brother John was a karate instructor. There, she became known as \"Ee-ee\" because of her squeaky \"kiai\".\nHer family's musical influence inspired Bush to teach herself the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents' house and studied the violin. She soon began composing songs, eventually adding her own lyrics.\n1973\u20131977: Career beginnings.\nBush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school in nearby Abbey Wood. During this time, her family produced a demonstration tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. (The 1973 song \"Passing Through Air\" was recorded as a demo at Gilmour\u2018s studio a few weeks after her 15th birthday, and later was the earliest Kate Bush recording to be released officially.) Impressed, Gilmour financed the 16-year-old Bush's recording of a more professional demo tape. The tape consisted of three tracks, produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell and the sound engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with the Beatles. Powell later produced Bush's first two albums. The tape was sent to the EMI executive Terry Slater, who signed Bush.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"Every female you see at a piano is either Lynsey de Paul or Carole King. And most male music\u2013not all of it but the good stuff\u2013really lays it on you. It really puts you against the wall and that's what I like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. Not many females succeed with that.\"\n Bush, speaking to \"Melody Maker\" magazine in 1977.\nThe British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts. Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI's group-repertoire division. Mercer believed that Bush's material was good enough to release, but he also believed that should the album fail, it would be demoralising, and if it were successful, Bush was too young to handle this. In a 1987 interview, Gilmour disputed this version of events, blaming EMI for initially using the \"wrong\" producers.\nEMI gave Bush a large advance, which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie, and mime training with Adam Darius. For the first two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on schoolwork than recording. She left school after doing her mock A-Levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications.\nBush wrote and recorded demos of almost 200 songs, some of which circulated as bootlegs. From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses in London. The band included Del Palmer (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977.\n1978\u20131979: \"The Kick Inside\" and \"Lionheart\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPerhaps its keen ear for adolescent angst is part of what makes \"Wuthering Heights\" so special. She appeared on \"Top of the Pops\" with it five times in 1978, cementing her public image as an ethereal spirit, embodying the essence of Cathy through a combination of wide eyes, floaty fabrics and wild choreography, still fondly mimicked and parodied today. \"Wuthering Heights\" turned Bush into a pop star, the rules of which she continues to bend to her own will: her individuality was set in stone from the very beginning.\n\u2014Rebecca Nicholson in \"The Guardian\".\nFor her debut album, \"The Kick Inside\" (1978), Bush was persuaded to use established session musicians instead of the KT Bush Band. She retained some of these even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and became her main drummer on subsequent albums. \"The Kick Inside\" was released when Bush was 19, with some songs written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track \"James and the Cold Gun\" to be her debut single, but Bush, who already had a reputation for asserting herself in decisions about her work, insisted that it should be \"Wuthering Heights\". Two music videos with similar choreography were created by Bush to accompany the song. The studio version sees her perform in a dark room with mist while wearing a white dress, suggesting her character is a ghost (as is the case with Cathy in the novel that inspired the song). The outside version sees Bush dancing in a grassy area on Salisbury Plain (inspired by the novel's moors) while wearing a red dress.\nIn the United Kingdom alone, \"The Kick Inside\" sold over a million copies. \"Wuthering Heights\" topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit. Bush became the first British woman to reach number one on the UK charts with a self-written song. \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\" made it onto the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 where it reached number 85 in early 1979, and went on to win her an Ivor Novello Award in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric. According to \"Guinness World Records\", Bush was the first female artist in pop history to have written every track on a million-selling debut album.\nBob Mercer blamed Bush's lesser success in the United States on American radio formats, saying there were no outlets for Bush's visual presentation. EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top which emphasised her breasts. In an interview with \"NME\" in 1982, Bush criticised the choice: \"People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body.\" In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, \"Lionheart\", to take advantage of the success of \"The Kick Inside\". The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. Although it gained a high number of sales and spawned the hit single \"Wow\", it did not achieve the success of \"The Kick Inside\", reaching number six in the UK album charts. She went on to express dissatisfaction with \"Lionheart\", feeling that it had needed more time.\nBush set up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain control of her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the board of directors. Following the release of \"Lionheart\", she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The Tour of Life began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. It was described by \"The Guardian\" as \"an extraordinary, hydra-headed beast, combining music, dance, poetry, mime, burlesque, magic and theatre\". The show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Bush was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design, costume design and hiring. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her need to dance as she sang, sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion a headset microphone; it was the first use by a rock performer since the Spotnicks used a rudimentary version in the early 1960s. Bush's first experience as a producer was on her live \"On Stage\" EP, released in August 1979.\n1980\u20131984: \"Never for Ever\" and \"The Dreaming\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Artists shouldn't be made famous. They have this huge aura of almost god-like quality about them, just because their craft makes a lot of money. And at the same time it is a forced importance... It is man-made so the press can feed off it.\"\n\u2014Kate Bush in a 1980 interview\nReleased in September 1980, \"Never for Ever\" was Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on \"Never for Ever\" is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \"Violin\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \"Army Dreamers\".\n\"Never for Ever\" was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI. She was introduced to the technology while providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at No. 1. The top-selling single from the album was \"Babooshka\", which reached No. 5 in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \"December Will Be Magic Again\", which reached No. 29 in the UK charts.\nSeptember 1982 saw the release of \"The Dreaming\", the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. \"The Dreaming\" received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \"less accessible\". In a 1993 interview with \"Q\" magazine, Bush stated: \"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\" The album entered the UK album chart at No. 3, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering \"only\" a silver disc. The album became her first to enter the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, albeit only reaching No. 157. \n\"Sat in Your Lap\" was the first single from the album to be released. It preceded the album by over a year and peaked at No. 11 in the UK. The title track, featuring Rolf Harris and Percy Edwards, stalled at No. 48, while the third single, \"There Goes a Tenner\", stalled at No. 93, despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track \"Suspended in Gaffa\" was released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK.\nContinuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for \"There Goes a Tenner\", a documentary about the Vietnam War for \"Pull Out the Pin\", and the plight of Indigenous Australians for \"The Dreaming\". \"Houdini\" is about the magician's death, and \"Get Out of My House\" was inspired by Stephen King's novel \"The Shining\".\n1985\u20131988: \"Hounds of Love\" and \"The Whole Story\".\n\"Hounds of Love\" was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace. \"Hounds of Love\" topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" from the number-one position.\nThe album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides. The first side, \"Hounds of Love\", contains five \"accessible\" pop songs, including the four singles \"Running Up That Hill\", \"Cloudbusting\", \"Hounds of Love\", and \"The Big Sky\". \"Running Up That Hill\" reached No. 3 in the UK charts and re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to No. 30 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in November 1985. Bush has stated that she initially wanted to name the song \"A Deal With God\", but the record company was reluctant because some people might think it was \"a sensitive title\", but that \"... for me, this is still called A Deal With God\". The second side of the album, \"The Ninth Wave\", takes its name from Tennyson's poem, \"Idylls of the King\", about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music.\nThe album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 Brit Awards. In the same year, Bush and Peter Gabriel had a UK Top 10 hit with the duet \"Don't Give Up\" (Dolly Parton, Gabriel's original choice to sing the female vocal, turned his offer down), and EMI released her \"greatest hits\" album, \"The Whole Story\". Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on \"Wuthering Heights\", and recorded a new single, \"Experiment IV\", for inclusion on the compilation. Dawn French and Hugh Laurie were among those featured in the video for Experiment IV. At the 1987 Brit Awards, Bush won the award for Best British Female Solo Artist.\n1989\u20131993: \"The Sensual World\" and \"The Red Shoes\".\nReleased in 1989, \"The Sensual World\" was described by Bush herself as \"her most honest, personal album\". One of the tracks, \"Heads We're Dancing\", inspired by her own black humour, is about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler. The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\". \"The Sensual World\" went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000\u00a0copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number-two position. Another single from the album, \"This Woman's Work\", was featured in the John Hughes film \"She's Having a Baby\", and a slightly remixed and reworked version appeared on Bush's album \"The Sensual World\". The song reached number-eight in 2005 on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I don't think of myself as a musician. As a writer, I suppose. I only ever play the piano to accompany myself singing. I could never sit and read a piece of music. At best, I'm an accompanist. I suppose the worst thing is frustration at your own ability. Not being able to do what you want to do.\"\n \u2014Kate Bush, \"Q\", 1993\nIn 1990, the boxed set \"\" was released; it included all of her albums with their original cover art, as well as two discs featuring the majority of her singles' B-sides recorded from 1978 to 1990. In 1991, Bush released a cover of Elton John's \"Rocket Man\", which reached number 12 on the UK singles chart, and reached number two in Australia. In 2007, it was voted the greatest cover ever by readers of \"The Observer\" newspaper. Another John cover, \"Candle in the Wind\", was the B-side. In the same year, she starred in the black comedy film \"Les Dogs\", produced by \"The Comic Strip\" for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain.\nBush's seventh studio album, \"The Red Shoes\", was released in November 1993. The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US, reaching number 28, although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was \"Rubberband Girl\", which peaked at number 88 in January 1994. In the UK, the album reached number-two, and the singles \"Rubberband Girl\", \"The Red Shoes\", \"Moments of Pleasure\", and \"And So Is Love\" (featuring Eric Clapton on guitar) all reached the top 30. Bush directed and starred in the short film \"The Line, the Cross and the Curve\", which featured music from her album \"The Red Shoes\", itself inspired by the 1948 film of that name. It was released on VHS in the UK in 1994 and also received a small number of cinema screenings around the world.\nThe initial plan had been to tour with \"The Red Shoes\" release, but did not reach fruition. Thus, Bush deliberately produced her tracks live, with less studio production that had typified her last three albums and which would have been too difficult to re-create on stage. The result polarised her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, with other fans claiming they had found new complexities in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.\nDuring this period of time, Bush suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of guitarist Alan Murphy, who had started working with her on The Tour of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom she was exceptionally close. The people she lost were honoured in the ballad \"Moments of Pleasure\", although Bush's mother was still alive when \"Moments of Pleasure\" was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying, \"Every old sock meets an old shoe\", was hilarious and \"couldn't stop laughing.\"\n1994\u20132006: Motherhood, hiatus, and \"Aerial\".\nAfter the release of \"The Red Shoes\", Bush dropped out of the public eye. She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release. Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens's \"Great Expectations\". In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as \"Bertie\", fathered by guitarist Dan McIntosh, whom she met in 1992. In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter. In 2002, she was awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed \"Comfortably Numb\" at David Gilmour's concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London.\nBush's eighth studio album, \"Aerial\", was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005. The album single \"King of the Mountain\", had received its premiere on BBC Radio 2 on 1 September 2005. The single entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six, and would become Bush's third-highest-charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. \"Aerial\" entered the UK albums chart at number three, and the US chart at number 48.\n\"Aerial,\" like \"Hounds of Love\" (1985), is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood. The first disc, subtitled \"A Sea of Honey\", features a set of unrelated themed songs, including \"King of the Mountain\"; \"Bertie\", a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and \"Joanni\", based on the story of Joan of Arc. In the song \"\u03c0\", Bush sings 117 digits of the number pi. The second disc, subtitled \"A Sky of Honey\", features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of 24 hours passing by. \"Aerial\" earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 Brit Awards, for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Album.\n2007\u20132013: Fish People, \"Director's Cut\" and \"50 Words for Snow\".\nIn 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for \"The Golden Compass\" soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua. The song, \"Lyra\", was played over the closing credits of the film. The single reached No 187 in the UK singles chart and was nominated for the International Press Academy's Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture. According to Del Palmer, Bush was asked to compose the song at short notice; the project was completed in 10\u00a0days.\nIn May 2011, Bush released \"Director's Cut,\" comprising 11 reworked tracks from \"The Sensual World\" and \"The Red Shoes\", recorded using analogue rather than digital equipment. All the tracks have new lead vocals, drums, and instrumentation. Some were transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including \"This Woman's Work\", have been completely rerecorded, often with lyrics changed in places. Bush described the album as a new project rather than a collection of remixes. It was the first album on her new label, \"Fish People\", a division of EMI Records. In addition to \"Director's Cut\" in its single CD form, the album was released with a box-set that contains the albums \"The Sensual World\" and the analogue re-mastered \"The Red Shoes\". It debuted at No 2 on the United Kingdom chart.\nBush's tenth studio album, \"50 Words for Snow\", was released on 21 November 2011. It features the high-profile appearance of Elton John on the duet \"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\". The album contains seven new songs \"set against a backdrop of falling snow\", with a total running time of 65 minutes. The album's songs are built around Bush's quietly jazzy piano and Steve Gadd's drums, and use both sung and spoken word vocals in what \"Classic Rock\" critic Stephen Dalton calls \"a\u00a0... supple and experimental affair, with a contemporary chamber pop sound grounded in crisp piano, minimal percussion and light-touch electronics\u00a0... billowing jazz-rock soundscapes, interwoven with fragmentary narratives delivered in a range of voices from shrill to Laurie Anderson-style cooing\". Bassist Danny Thompson appears on the album, while the sixth track on the album, \"50 Words for Snow\", features the voice of Stephen Fry reciting a list of words to describe snow.\n\"50 Words for Snow\" received general acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 26 reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\". At the 2012 Brit Awards she was nominated in the Best Female Artist category, and the album won the 2012 Best Album at the South Bank Arts Awards, and was also nominated for Best Album at the Ivor Novello Awards.\nBush turned down an invitation to perform at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London. Instead, a new vocal remix of her 1985 single \"Running Up That Hill\" was played. In 2013, Bush became the only female artist to have top five albums in the UK charts in five successive decades.\n2014\u20132021: \"Before the Dawn\" and remastered catalogue.\nIn March 2014, Bush announced her first live concerts in decades: Before the Dawn, a 22-night residency in London running from 26 August to 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo. Tickets sold out in 15 minutes. The concerts received universal acclaim. An album of recordings from the concerts, \"Before the Dawn\", was released on 25 November 2016. Bolstered by publicity around \"Before the Dawn\", Bush became the first female performer to have eight albums in the UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously, putting her at number three for simultaneous UK Top 40 albums. The only artists ahead of Bush were Elvis Presley, who had 12 entries in the top 40 after his death in 1977 and the Beatles who had 11 in 2009. She had 11 albums in the top 50.\nIn a statement, Bush said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was an extraordinary experience putting the show together. It was a huge amount of work, a lot of fun and an enormous privilege to work with such an incredibly talented team. This is the audio document. I hope that this can stand alone as a piece of music in its own right and that it can be enjoyed by people who knew nothing about the shows as well as those who were there. I never expected the overwhelming response of the audiences, every night filling the show with life and excitement. They are there in every beat of the recorded music. Even when you can't hear them, you can feel them.\nOn 6 December 2018, Bush published her first book, \"How to Be Invisible,\" a compilation of lyrics. In November 2018, Bush released two box sets of remasters of her studio albums. Vocals from Rolf Harris, who was convicted of multiple sexual assault charges in 2014, were replaced by versions by Bush's son Bertie. A compilation of rare tracks, cover versions and remixes from the boxsets, \"The Other Sides\", was released on 8 March 2019. It includes the previously unreleased track \"Humming,\" recorded in 1975. In September 2019, Bush released \" / \" on vinyl, in France, as a limited-edition promotional single.\nIn September 2020, Bush became a Fellow of The Ivors Academy, the UK's independent professional association for songwriters, composers and music authors. Following Bush's award, another Fellow, Annie Lennox, commented, \"She is visionary and iconic and has made her own magical stamp upon the zeitgeist of the British cultural landscape.\"\n2022\u2013present: Resurgence and continued honours.\nBush's 1985 single \"Running Up That Hill\" gained newfound popularity in May 2022 after it was incorporated into the plot of the fourth season of the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" It became the most streamed song on Spotify in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and globally. Winona Ryder, who plays the character Joyce Byers on \"Stranger Things,\" said she had pushed for the song to be on the show: \"I've been obsessed with her since I was a little girl. I've also for the last seven years been dropping hints on set wearing my Kate Bush T-shirts.\" According to \"The Guardian\", \"Running Up That Hill\" has become particularly popular with members of Generation Z, who were not born when the song was first released, and it has appeared in numerous videos on the social media platform TikTok. Bush released a statement praising \"Stranger Things\" and saying the resurgence was \"really exciting\".\nOn 10 June 2022, \"Running Up That Hill\" reached number two on the UK singles chart, surpassing its peak of number three in 1985. It was the most popular track of the week in the UK, ahead of \"As It Was\" by Harry Styles, but a pre-existing chart rule penalised older songs that are streamed. The Chart Supervisory Committee responded by giving the record an exemption from the \"accelerated chart ratio\" rule due to its ongoing sales resurgence. \nOn 17 June, the song reached number one in the UK, making it Bush's second UK number one. It broke three UK chart records in the process. With 44 years since her last number one, \"Wuthering Heights\" in 1978, Bush surpassed Tom Jones's 42-year gap between number ones and replaced Cher as the oldest female solo chart-topping artist at 63 years and 11 months. Bush also achieved the record for a single with the longest period taken to reach number one, beating the previous record, held by \"Last Christmas\" by Wham!, by a year.\nOn 11 June 2022, \"Running Up That Hill\" re-entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number eight, surpassing its 1985 peak at No 30 and becoming Bush's first US top-ten hit. The following week, it climbed to No 4 in the US, before reaching No 3 on 25 July. The parent album, \"Hounds of Love\", also reached a new peak in the US, charting at No 12. The song topped the Australian ARIA Charts to become her second No 1 single in the country. In France, \"Running Up That Hill\" beat its original chart peak of 24, placing at No 3. \"Hounds of Love\" also rose in popularity on various album charts, with it reaching No 1 on \"Billboard\"'s Top Alternative Albums chart, making it Bush's first US chart-topping album. On 10 June, \"The Whole Story\" rose from No 76 to No 19 on the UK Albums Chart, peaking a week later at No 17. A limited edition CD single was released by Rhino. in September 2022, published in this format for the first time, the 2022 film \"A Man Called Otto\" featured the song \"This Woman's Work\" from Bush's album, \"The Sensual World.\" In May 2023, it was also featured in the Netflix film \"The Mother\", spiking a sales resurgence for the song.\nOn 1 January 2023, Bush was included at No 60 in the list of \"200 Best Singers of All Time\" by \"Rolling Stone\". On 22 February 2023, Bush announced that her label, Fish People, had moved to the new distribution partner, The state51 Conspiracy. The new company took over distribution of her post-1980 releases (starting from \"The Dreaming\") worldwide, and the entire catalogue in the US only. This move has also generated renewed \"indie\" reissues of her albums. \nBush was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, 2021 and 2022, and was inducted in 2023, but did not attend the ceremony. She was inducted by Big Boi of OutKast, a long-time fan of her music. In his induction speech, Big Boi said, \"What I love about Kate's music is that I never know what sound I'm gonna hear next. She ignores anything that seems like a formula and instead just does whatever she wants to do, like me. She challenges me as a listener and expands my ears and my mind. No matter how many times I look to albums like \"The Dreaming\" or \"50 Words for Snow\", they sound fresh and surprise me every time. They fill my head with ideas and expand my ambitions for what music can achieve.\"\nIn February 2024, it was announced that Bush was an ambassador for that year's Record Store Day on 20 April 2024. Her cancelled 1993-single \"Eat the Music\" will be released as a 10\" vinyl single. In a statement, Bush said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Isn't it great to see how the resurgence in vinyl has taken the music industry by surprise? It had decided to leave vinyl far behind, but it would seem that not everyone agrees! I love that [...] In the same way that some people like to read a book on Kindle but also want to have a book as a physical object, a lot of people like vinyl and streaming. Both have different appeals. An album on vinyl is a beautiful thing, given a strong identity by its large-scale artwork. There's a much more personal connection with the artist and their work. The added bonus of vinyl is that it encourages people to listen to albums. An art form that I've always thought can be treasured in a unique way. This year, I hope you have a fantastic time at this very important event, and that you get to celebrate music that's been specially released for you.\"\nOn 25 October 2024, Bush released a short animated film, entitled \"Little Shrew\", in support of War Child. The film is set to a radio edit of \"Snowflake\", from \"50 Words for Snow\". In an interview with the BBC, to promote \"Little Shrew\", Bush revealed that she was \"very keen to start working on a new album when I've got [the film] finished. I've got lots of ideas and I'm really looking forward to getting back into that creative space, it's been a long time.\" \nIn November 2024, Bush received two nominations at the 67th Grammy Awards for Best Recording Package and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for the re-editions of \"Hounds of Love\"; her first nominations since 1996. Bush was one of more than 1,000 musicians to back an album of silence released on 25 February 2025, \"Is This What We Want?\", protesting the use of unlicensed copyrighted work to train AI. The album debuted at number 38 on the UK Albums Downloads Chart.\nOn 26 June 2025, it was announced that Bush's short animated film, \"Little Shrew\", would be played throughout the UK before World War II German resistance film, \"From Hilde, With Love\". \nOn 22 September 2025, it was announced that the compilation \"Best of the Other Sides\", an edited and re-tweaked version of 2018's \"The Other Sides\" would be released digitally on 26 September 2025, and on CD and vinyl on 31 October 2025; the digital release debuted at number 16 on the UK Albums Downloads Chart.\nArtistry.\nMusical style and voice.\nBush's musical aesthetic is eclectic, and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album. Simon Reynolds of \"The Guardian\" called Bush \"the queen of art-pop\", and she has also been described as art rock, baroque pop, avant-pop, progressive pop, and post-progressive. Ben Myers of \"Prog\" called Bush \"prog's first pop star and pop's first prog star\" whose \"career history and collaborations are inextricably tied in with prog and her ever-evolving output has much more in common with the genre than the pop world in which she first found herself operating.\" She has been grouped with other \"'arty' 1970s and '80s British pop rock artists\" such as Roxy Music and Peter Gabriel. Even in her earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together diverse influences, drawing on classical music, glam rock, and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources. This has continued throughout her career. By the time of \"Never for Ever\", Bush had begun to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette. \nBush has a soprano vocal range. Her vocals contain elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its use of musical instruments from various periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms. Reviewers have used the term \"surreal\" to describe her music. Her songs explore melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation. It has been observed that even her more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy and vice versa.\nSongwriting and influences.\nElements of Bush's lyrics employ historical or literary references. This is embodied in her first single \"Wuthering Heights\", which is based on Emily Bront\u00eb's novel of the same name. She has described herself as a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and has dismissed efforts by others to conceive of her work as autobiographical. Bush's lyrics have been known to touch on obscure or esoteric subject matter, and \"New Musical Express\" noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects in her work. \"The Kick Inside\" is based on a traditional English folk song (\"The Ballad of Lucy Wan\") about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide. \"Kashka from Baghdad\" is a song about a gay couple; She has referenced G. I. Gurdjieff in the song \"Them Heavy People\", while \"Cloudbusting\" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, \"A Book of Dreams\", about his relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich. \"Breathing\" explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of a f\u0153tus.\nOther non-musical sources of inspiration for Bush include horror films, which have influenced the gothic nature of her songs, such as \"Hounds of Love\", which samples the 1957 horror movie \"Night of the Demon\". \"The Infant Kiss\" is a song about a haunted, unstable woman's infatuation with a young boy in her care (inspired by Jack Clayton's film \"The Innocents\" (1961), which had been based on Henry James's novella \"The Turn of the Screw\"). The title of the song \"Hammer Horror\" is from Hammer Film Productions' horror movies, and the song's story was inspired by the film \"Man of a Thousand Faces\" (1957). Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in \"Coffee Homeground\", an alcoholic mother in \"Ran Tan Waltz\" and the upbeat \"The Wedding List\", a song inspired by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich's \"The Bride Wore Black\" about the murder of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer. Bush has also cited comedy as a significant influence. She has cited Woody Allen, Monty Python, \"Fawlty Towers\", and \"The Young Ones\" as particular favourites.\nTechnical innovations.\nBush is regarded as the first artist to have had a headset with a wireless microphone built for use in music. For her Tour of Life in 1979, she had a compact microphone combined with a self-made construction of wire clothes hangers, so that she did not have to use a hand microphone. Having her hands free allowed Bush to dance her rehearsed choreography of expressionist dance on the concert stage and sing with a microphone at the same time. Her idea was later adopted by other artists such as Janet Jackson, Madonna and Peter Gabriel.\nInfluence.\nAccording to Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\", Bush's \"shadow looms so large that whenever a female singer-songwriter emerges who is even remotely out of the ordinary, it's only a matter of time before someone, fairly or otherwise, mentions Bush\".\nMusicians who have acknowledged Bush's influence include Bj\u00f6rk, Alanis Morissette, Nigel Godrich, Florence Welch, Fever Ray, Big Boi, Regina Spektor, Teddy Sinclair, Fiona Apple, Imogen Heap, Sharon Van Etten, Ellie Goulding, Kyros, Aisles, FKA Twigs, Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy, Grimes, Solange Knowles, Julia Holter, Angel Olsen, Halsey, Tupac Shakur, Robyn, Caroline Polachek, and Chappell Roan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSince she made the bold decision after only six weeks on the road in 1979 that she wouldn't play live again, yet continued to be a powerhouse of inventive avant pop for the next 15 years \u2013 and a sporadic, off-the-grid presence ever since \u2013 Bush has set the blueprint for the autonomous artist creating masterworks entirely at their own pace and on their own terms. Kate Bush is the definitive example of a musician allowing work to flow through her life, not cram life into the spaces between her work.\n \u2014Mark Beaumont writing for \"NME\" on Bush being an \"enigma worthy of the name\", July 2018\nIn 2015, Adele stated that the release of her third studio album \"25\" was inspired by Bush's 2014 comeback to the stage. Nerina Pallot was inspired to become a songwriter after seeing Bush play \"This Woman's Work\" on \"Wogan\". Bush was described by \"The Guardian\" as an \"early role model\" for Dido. The Australian singer-songwriter Sia described Bush as one of the \"weird\" artists she \"grew up with\", along with Adam Ant, Boy George and Cyndi Lauper. k.d. lang named Bush as one of the artists she was listening to when she was starting to write songs. Jack Antonoff has described Bush as an artist he listens to when he writes songs. Andy Bell described Bush as \"a major influence on a lot of Erasure's album tracks\". When Little Boots was asked about female producers or songwriters that have inspired her, she highlighted Bush for \"how involved she got with the studio side as well as the performance\". Kate Nash described Bush as \"really amazing and really inspirational\". Bat for Lashes also called her \"a real inspiration\". Tegan and Sara called Bush a \"huge influence\" on them when they were growing up in the 1980s, and Sky Ferreira named her when asked about her \"primary influences\" from that decade. Rosal\u00eda named Bush as one of the female artists who made success possible for artists like her. Beverley Craven acknowledged that when she was beginning to write songs, she was \"trying to sound like Kate Bush\". Tim Bowness of No-Man named Bush as one of his early influences. \nElton John cited Bush's duet with Peter Gabriel, \"Don't Give Up\", for helping him to become sober, particularly Bush's lyric, \"Rest your head. You worry too much. It's going to be all right. When times get rough you can fall back on us. Don't give up.\" He stated, \"she [Bush] played a big part in my rebirth.\" After doing a duet with Bush in 2011, John praised her talents as a musician, stating \"I'm so proud to be on a Kate Bush record; she's always marched to the beat of her own drum. She was groundbreaking \u2013 a bit like a female equivalent of Freddie Mercury. She does come out socially sometimes and she came to my civil partnership occasion with her husband. There were so many stars in the room, but all the musicians there were only interested in saying, 'You've got to introduce me to Kate Bush.' I remember Boy George saying, 'Oh my God, is that Kate Bush?' I said, 'Yeah!'.\"\nBush was one of the singers whom Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991's \"Diamonds and Pearls\". Kirk Hammett of Metallica listed Bush as one of the influences on \"Master of Puppets\". According to an unauthorised biography, Courtney Love of Hole listened to Bush among other artists as a teenager. Tricky of Massive Attack wrote an article about \"The Kick Inside\", saying: \"Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me... I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible\". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be \"beauty beyond belief\". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled \"Bird in Hand\" (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. In 1999, VH1 named Bush the 46th-greatest woman in rock and roll.\nMarianne Faithfull mentioned Bush's four-octave range should be regarded as a \"national treasure\". \"My favourite instrument in the whole world is the human female voice, and Kate Bush is one of the reasons why. It is, by far, a Stradivarius,\" Faithfull says. \"Which is why she rarely deals with the press or isn't in a rush to record. She's one of the few who can be above all that.\" Enya praised Bush in a similar manner: \"When you think of Kate Bush, you think of the music, not the headlines.\" Rufus Wainwright named Bush one of his top ten gay icons. Outside music, Bush has been an inspiration to several fashion designers, including Hussein Chalayan. In 1998 an asteroid was named after Bush.\nIn 2019, French record producer Pone, who is paralysed from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, released \"Kate &amp; Me\", an entire album created from samples of Kate Bush's work. According to \"The Guardian\", it's the \"first album in history to be entirely produced through an eye-tracking device\". Pone declares that Bush is the greatest artist of the past 40 years. Pone reiterated the experience in June 2021 by publishing \"Listen And Donate\". An EP composed of four tracks including two originals by Pone, still based on samples of Kate Bush's work, and two remixes produced by SCH and Para One. JR signs the visual part of the project. The goal is to raise funds for the Trakadom association, created by Pone and two doctors in collaboration with the intensive care unit of the hospital of N\u00eemes.\nIn 2020, \"Grazia\" magazine conducted an interview with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. When asked about the five most influential women in his life, Johnson placed Kate Bush at the fifth spot after deliberating between nominating Queen Elizabeth II, Margaret Thatcher, and Bush.\nIn addition to her music, her dancing has been critically acclaimed and proven influential, as well as enduring in the popular consciousness. Critics have noted her \"pioneering synthesis of music and movement\" and called her work \"modern dance at its most powerful\". Prix Benois de la Danse winner Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui credits her dancing as a formative influence. For the recurring The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever event, thousands of people gather worldwide to recreate her dance routine from the \"Wuthering Heights\" music video\u2014the outside version where Bush is seen dancing \"out in the wily, windy moors\", adorned with flowers and a flowy red dress.\nLive performances.\nBush's only tour, the Tour of Life, ran for six weeks in April and May 1979, covering Britain and mainland Europe. The BBC suggested that she may have quit touring due to a fear of flying, or because of the death of a lighting engineer, Bill Duffield, who was killed in an accident after a warmup concert. Mercer, who signed Bush to EMI, said touring was \"just too hard ... I think [Bush] liked it but the equation didn't work ... I could see at the end of the show that she was completely wiped out.\" Bush described the tour as \"enormously enjoyable\" but \"absolutely exhausting\".\nDuring the same period as the Tour of Life, Bush performed on television programs including \"Top of the Pops\" in the UK, \"Bio's Bahnhof\" in Germany, and \"Saturday Night Live\" in the United States (performing \"The Man with the Child in His Eyes\" with Paul Shaffer on piano, and later in the programme, \"Them Heavy People\"), which remains her only live performance in the country. On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the \"Kate Bush Christmas Special\". In July 1982, Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of The Prince's Trust, singing \"The Wedding List\" with a backing band composed of Pete Townshend, Phil Collins, Midge Ure, Mick Karn, Gary Brooker, Dave Formula, and Peter Hope Evans. The performance was later released on VHS video, Laserdisc and CED disc. She performed live for British charity event Comic Relief in 1986, singing \"Do Bears... ?\", a humorous duet with Rowan Atkinson, and a rendition of \"Breathing\". In March 1987, Bush sang \"Running Up That Hill\" at The Secret Policeman's Third Ball accompanied by David Gilmour. She appeared with Gilmour again in 2002, singing the Pink Floyd song \"Comfortably Numb\" at the Royal Festival Hall in London.\nBush returned to headline performance with a 22-night residency, Before the Dawn, which ran from 26 August to 1 October 2014 at the London Hammersmith Apollo. The set list encompassed most of \"Hounds of Love\" featuring the entire Ninth Wave suite, most of \"Aerial\" featuring the entire An Endless Sky of Honey suite including new song \"Tawny Moon\", two songs from \"The Red Shoes\", and one song from \"50 Words for Snow\".\nCollaborations.\nBush provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel's albums, including the hits \"Games Without Frontiers\" and \"Don't Give Up\", as well as \"No Self-Control\". Gabriel appeared on Bush's 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of Roy Harper's \"Another Day\". She has sung on two Roy Harper tracks, \"You\", on his 1979 album, \"The Unknown Soldier\"; and \"Once\", the title track of his 1990 album. She has also sung on the title song of the 1986 Big Country album \"The Seer;\" the Midge Ure song \"Sister and Brother\" from his 1988 album \"Answers to Nothing\"; Go West's 1987 single \"The King Is Dead\"; and two songs with Prince \u2013 \"Why Should I Love You?\", from her 1993 album \"The Red Shoes\", and \"My Computer\" from Prince's 1996 album \"Emancipation\". In 1987, she sang a verse on the Beatles cover charity single \"Let It Be\" by Ferry Aid.\nIn 1990, Bush produced a song for another artist, Alan Stivell's \"Kimiad\" for his album \"Again\"; this is the only time she has done this to date. Stivell had appeared on \"The Sensual World\". In 1991, Bush was invited to perform a cover of Elton John's 1972 song \"Rocket Man\" for the tribute album \"\". In 2007 Bush's cover won \"The Observer\" readers' award for Greatest Cover of all time. In 2011, Elton John collaborated with Bush once again in \"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\" for her most recent album \"50 Words for Snow\". In 1994, Bush covered George Gershwin's \"The Man I Love\" for the tribute album \"The Glory of Gershwin\". In 1996, Bush contributed a version of \"Mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann\" (Irish for \"Women of Ireland\") for the Anglo-Irish folk-rock compilation project \"Common Ground: The Voices of Modern Irish Music\". Bush had to sing the song in Irish, which she learned to do phonetically.\nArtists who have contributed to Bush's own albums include Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Roy Harper, Nigel Kennedy, Gary Brooker, Danny Thompson, and Prince. Bush provided backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\" by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band. The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, was released on Azulay's album \"Out of the Ashes\". Bush declined a request by Erasure to produce one of their albums because, according to Vince Clarke, \"she didn't feel that that was her area\".\nKate has also worked with the ethnic bulgarian group Trio Bulgarka. They provided the backing vocals on the songs: \"Deeper Understanding\", \"Never Be Mine\", and \"Rocket's Tail\" from Bush's album \"The Sensual World\" in 1989. They also make an appearance in her 1993 album \"The Red Shoes\" in the songs \"You're The One\", The Song of Solomon\", and \"Why Should I Love You\". Bush revealed that she was introduced to the group 3 years prior to the making of \"The Sensual World\" by her brother, Paddy, who is interested in cultural music. She also addressed the language barrier by saying that despite the more difficult process, the connection feels more genuine because it's an emotional bond rather than intellectual one.\nPersonal life.\nBush and guitarist Danny McIntosh have a son, Albert McIntosh, known as Bertie, born in 1998, although whether they are married is unknown. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Bush was in a relationship with bassist and sound engineer Del Palmer.\nBush is a former resident of Eltham in southeast London. In the 1990s she moved to a canalside residence in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, and bought a second home in Devon in 2004. Bush is a vegetarian. Bush was raised a Roman Catholic. In 1999, she said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I would never say I was a strict follower of Roman Catholic belief, but a lot of images are in there; they have to be; they're so strong. Such powerful, beautiful, passionate images! There's a lot of suffering in Roman Catholicism. I think I'm looking for not necessarily religion, but ways of helping myself to become more understanding, more complete, a happier person ... But I really don't think I've found a niche.\nThe length of time between albums has led to rumours concerning Bush's health or appearance. In 2011, she told BBC Radio 4 that the amount of time between albums was stressful: \"It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do\u00a0... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them\". In the same interview, she denied that she was a perfectionist, saying: \"I think it's important that things are flawed\u00a0... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes \u2013 the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise.\" She reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.\nBush's son, Bertie, featured in her 2014 residency Before the Dawn. Her nephew Raven Bush was a violinist in the English indie band Syd Arthur.\nPolitical views.\nSome of Bush's songs contain references to political and social themes, including \"Breathing\", which addresses the fear of nuclear warfare and \"Army Dreamers\", which examines the grief felt by mothers who lose children serving in the military during war. In a 1985 interview with \"The NewMusic,\" Bush stated \"I've never felt I've written from a political point of view, it's always been an emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps be a political situation.\"\nDuring the 1979 United Kingdom general election campaign, Bush, who at the time was on a live concert tour of the UK, posed for a photograph alongside the Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan. When asked about her political beliefs in a 1985 interview with \"Hot Press\", Bush replied that she preferred not to discuss how she voted and added \"I don't feel I am a political thinker at all. I don't really understand politics.\"\nIn \"The Comic Strip Presents...\" episode \"\", she produced and sang on the theme song \"Ken\", a satirical take on how Hollywood glamourises and fictionalises political figures, in this particular case Ken Livingstone, the former leader of the Greater London Council, and the lyrics parodied the theme from \"Shaft\".\nIn 2016, the Canadian news magazine \"Maclean's\" published an interview in which Bush was asked about people being afraid of women holding political power. Bush pointed out that the UK, unlike the US, did have a female leader, Theresa May, who a few months earlier had become Prime Minister. The interview quoted Bush as saying: \"I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time ... It is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time.\" In 2019, Bush published a statement on her website saying that she was not a Conservative Party supporter, that she felt May was an improvement over the previous Prime Minister, and that she had intended only to defend women in power.\nIn April 2021, Bush was one of 156 signatories of an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for a change in the wording of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to make royalty payments for streaming closer to the amounts paid for radio broadcast.\nIn December 2022, in her annual Christmas message, Bush expressed solidarity with nurses undertaking strike action, stating that NHS nurses should be \"appreciated and cherished\".\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The epithets \"black-legged\" and \"red-legged\" are used to distinguish the two species in North America, but in Europe, where \"Rissa brevirostris\" is not found, the black-legged kittiwake is often known simply as kittiwake. The name is derived from its call, a shrill 'kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake'. The genus name \"Rissa\" is from the Icelandic name \"Rita\" for the black-legged kittiwake.\nDescription.\nThe two species are physically very similar. They have a white head and body, grey back, grey wings tipped solid black and a bright yellow bill. Black-legged kittiwake adults are somewhat larger (roughly in length with a wingspan of ) than red-legged kittiwakes ( in length with a wingspan around ). Other differences include a shorter bill, larger eyes, a larger, rounder head and darker grey wings in the red-legged kittiwake. While most black-legged kittiwakes do, indeed, have dark-grey legs, some have pinkish-grey to reddish legs, making colouration a somewhat unreliable identifying marker.\nIn contrast to the dappled chicks of other gull species, kittiwake chicks are downy and white since they are under relatively little threat of predation, as the nests are on extremely steep cliffs. Unlike other gull chicks which wander around as soon as they can walk, kittiwake chicks instinctively sit still in the nest to avoid falling off. Juveniles take three years to reach maturity. When in winter plumage, both birds have a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar. The sexes are visually indistinguishable.\nDistribution and habitat.\nKittiwakes are coastal breeding birds ranging in the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. They form large, dense, noisy colonies during the summer reproductive period, often sharing habitat with murres. They are the only gull species that are exclusively cliff-nesting. A colony of kittiwakes living in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead in the north east of England has made homes on both the Tyne Bridge and Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. This colony is notable because it is the furthest inland colony of kittiwakes in the world.\nSpecies.\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Common name\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25%;\"|Scientific name and subspecies\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Range\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:29%;\"\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:16%; min-width:112px;\"\n!scope=\"row\"|black-legged kittiwake\nAdult\nChick\n!scope=\"row\"|red-legged kittiwake\nAdult\nChick\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The fires were started in January and February 1991, and the first oil well fires were extinguished in early April 1991, with the last well capped on November 6, 1991.\nMotives.\nThe dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over alleged slant-drilling in the Rumaila oil field was one of the reasons for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\nIn addition, Kuwait had been producing oil above treaty limits established by OPEC. By the eve of the Iraqi invasion, Kuwait had set production quotas to almost , which coincided with a sharp worldwide drop in the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti overproduction had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.\nSome analysts have speculated that one of Saddam Hussein's main motivations in invading Kuwait was to punish the ruling al-Sabah family in Kuwait for not stopping its policy of overproduction, as well as his reasoning behind the destruction of said wells.\nIt is also hypothesized that Iraq decided to destroy the oil fields to achieve a military advantage, believing the intense smoke plumes serving as smoke screens created by the burning oil wells would inhibit Coalition offensive airstrikes, foil allied precision guided weapons and spy satellites, and could screen Iraq's military movements. Furthermore, it is thought that Iraq's military leaders may have regarded the heat, smoke, and debris from hundreds of burning oil wells as presenting a formidable area denial obstacle to Coalition forces. The onset of the oil well destruction supports this military dimension to the sabotage of the wells; for example, during the early stage of the Coalition air campaign, the number of oil wells afire was relatively small but the number increased dramatically in late February with the arrival of the ground war.\nThe Iraqi military combat engineers also released oil into low-lying areas for defensive purposes against infantry and mechanized units along Kuwait's southern border, by constructing several \"fire trenches\" roughly long, and meters wide and deep to impede the advance of Coalition ground forces.\nThe military use of the land based fires should also be seen in context with the coinciding, deliberate, sea based Gulf War oil spill, the apparent strategic goal of which was to foil a potential amphibious landing by U.S. Marines.\nExtent.\nAs an international coalition under United States command assembled in anticipation of an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's report to Congress, \"the retreating Iraqi army set fire to or damaged over 700 oil wells, storage tanks, refineries, and facilities in Kuwait.\" Estimates placed the number of oil well fires from 605 to 732. A further thirty-four wells had been destroyed by heavy coalition bombing in January. The Kuwait Petroleum Company's estimate as of September 1991 was that there had been 610 fires, out of a total of 749 facilities damaged or on fire along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as \"oil lakes\" and \"fire trenches\". These fires constituted approximately 50% of the total number of oil well fires in the history of the petroleum industry, and temporarily damaged or destroyed approximately 85% of the wells in every major Kuwaiti oil field.\nConcerted efforts to bring the fires and other damage under control began in April 1991. During the uncontrolled burning phase from February to April, various sources estimated that the ignited wellheads burnt through between four and six million barrels of crude oil, and between seventy and one hundred million cubic meters of natural gas per day. Seven months later, 441 facilities had been brought under control, while 308 remained uncontrolled. The last well was capped on November 6, 1991. The total amount of oil burned is generally estimated at one billion barrels or just below one percent of Kuwait's entire supply of 104 billion barrels. Daily global oil consumption in 2022 is about 99.4 million barrels; the oil lost to combustion would last 10 days at modern usage rates.\nFinancial losses.\nIn March 1991 the accumulated financial losses were estimated to be as much as 10% of 90 billion barrels of Kuwait oil reserves based on a statement made by a Kuwait Oil Company official. With the world prices at the time, the damages would amount to US$billion.\nMilitary effects.\nOn March 21, 1991, a Royal Saudi Air Force C-130H crashed in heavy smoke due to the Kuwaiti oil fires on approach to Ras Mishab Airport, Saudi Arabia. 92 Senegalese soldiers and 6 Saudi crew members were killed, the largest accident among Coalition forces.\nThe smoke screening was also used by Iraqi anti-armor forces to a successful extent in the Battle of Phase Line Bullet, having aided in achieving the element of surprise against advancing Bradley IFVs, along with increasing the general fog of war.\nThe fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews during the war. Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells and military demining was necessary before the fires could be put out. Around of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait. By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately ten months, causing widespread pollution.\nThe fires have been linked with what was later deemed Gulf War syndrome, a chronic disorder afflicting military veterans and civilian workers that include fatigue, muscle pain, and cognitive problems; however, studies have indicated that the firemen who capped the wells did not report any of the symptoms that the soldiers experienced. The cause of Gulf War syndrome has since been ascribed to Sarin nerve agent.\nFrom the perspective of ground forces, apart from the occasional \"oil rain\" experienced by troops very close to spewing wells, one of the more commonly experienced effects of the oil field fires were the ensuing smoke plumes which rose into the atmosphere and then precipitated or fell out of the air via dry deposition and by rain. The pillar-like plumes frequently broadened and joined up with other smoke plumes at higher altitudes, producing a cloudy grey overcast effect, as only about 10% of all the fires corresponding with those that originated from \"oil lakes\" produced pure black soot filled plumes, 25% of the fires emitted white to grey plumes, while the remainder emitted plumes with colors between grey and black. For example, one Gulf War veteran stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was like a cloudy day all day long, in fact, we didn\u2019t realize it was smoke at first. The smoke was about 500 feet above us, so we couldn\u2019t see the sky. However, we could see horizontally for long distances with no problem. We knew it was smoke when the mucous from our nostrils started to look black...\"\nA paper published in 2000 analyzed the degree of exposure by troops to particulate matter, including soot. However, the paper focused more-so on silica sand, which can produce silicosis. The paper included troop medical records, and in its conclusion: \"A literature review indicated negligible to nonexistent health risk from other inhaled particulate material (other than silica) during the Gulf War\".\nExtinguishing efforts.\nThe burning wells needed to be extinguished as, without active efforts, Kuwait would lose billions of dollars in oil revenues. It was predicted by experts that the fires would burn for between two and five years before losing pressure and going out on their own.\nThe companies responsible for extinguishing the fires initially were Bechtel, Red Adair Company (now sold to Global Industries of Louisiana), Boots and Coots, and Wild Well Control. Safety Boss was the fourth company to arrive but ended up extinguishing and capping the most wells of any other company: 180 of the 600. Other companies including Cudd Well/Pressure Control, Neal Adams Firefighters, and Kuwait Wild Well Killers were also contracted.\nAccording to Larry H. Flak, a petroleum engineer for Boots and Coots International Well Control, 90% of all the 1991 fires in Kuwait were put out with nothing but sea water, sprayed from powerful hoses at the base of the fire. The extinguishing water was supplied to the arid desert region by re-purposing the oil pipelines that prior to the arson attack had pumped oil from the wells to the Persian Gulf. The pipeline had been mildly damaged but, once repaired, its flow was reversed to pump Persian gulf seawater to the burning oil wells. The extinguishing rate was approximately 1 every 7\u201310 days at the start of efforts but then with experience gained and the removal of the mine fields that surrounded the burning wells, the rate increased to 2 or more per day.\nFor stubborn oil well fires, the use of a gas turbine to blast a large volume of water at high velocity at the fire proved popular with firefighters in Kuwait and was brought to the region by Hungarians equipped with MiG-21 engines mounted originally on a T-34 tank (later replaced with T-55 tank), called \"Big wind\". It extinguished 9 fires in 43 days.\nIn fighting a fire at a directly vertical spewing wellhead, high explosives, such as dynamite were used to create a blast wave that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.\nThe firefighting teams titled their occupation as \"Operation Desert Hell\" after Operation Desert Storm.\nAtmospheric pollution and aerosol hazards.\nPredicted consequences.\nImmediately following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, predictions were made of an environmental disaster stemming from Iraqi threats to blow up captured Kuwaiti oil wells. Speculation ranging from a nuclear winter type scenario, to heavy acid rain and even short term immediate global warming were presented at the World Climate Conference in Geneva that November.\nOn January 10, 1991, a paper appearing in the journal \"Nature\" stated Paul Crutzen's calculations predicting that the oil well fires would produce a cloud of smoke covering half the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in widespread cooling similar to nuclear winter; temperatures beneath the cloud would be reduced by 5\u201310 degrees Celsius after 100 days. This was followed by articles printed in the \"Wilmington Morning Star\" and the \"Baltimore Sun\" newspapers in mid to late January 1991, with the popular television scientist personality of the time, Carl Sagan, who was also the co-author of the first few nuclear winter papers along with Richard P. Turco, John W. Birks, Alan Robock and Paul Crutzen together collectively stated that they expected catastrophic nuclear winter-like effects with continental sized impacts of \"sub-freezing\" temperatures as a result if the Iraqis went through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells and they burned for a few months.\nLater when Operation Desert Storm had begun, S. Fred Singer and Carl Sagan discussed the possible environmental impacts of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the ABC News program \"Nightline\". Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with smoke lofting into the stratosphere, a region of the atmosphere beginning around above sea level at Kuwait, resulting in global effects and that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the \"Year Without a Summer\". He reported on initial modeling estimates that forecast impacts extending to south Asia, and perhaps to the northern hemisphere as well.\nSinger, on the other hand, said that calculations showed that the smoke would go to an altitude of about and then be rained out after about three to five days and thus the lifetime of the smoke would be limited. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Arabian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general, lofting to about and a few times as high as .\nAlong with Singer's televised critique, Richard D. Small criticized the initial \"Nature\" paper in a reply on March 7, 1991, arguing along similar lines as Singer.\nSagan later conceded in his book \"The Demon-Haunted World\" that his prediction did not turn out to be correct: \"it \"was\" pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4\u20136\u00a0\u00b0C over the Arabian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.\"\nAt the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun's radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of , but were scavenged by cloud condensation nuclei from the atmosphere relatively quickly.\nSagan and his colleagues expected that a \"self-lofting\" of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere where it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this aerosol of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural impacts in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.\nActual consequences.\nIn retrospect, it is now known that smoke from the Kuwait oil fires only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991, with lower atmospheric winds blowing the smoke along the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, and cities such as Dhahran and Riyadh, and countries such as Bahrain experienced days with smoke filled skies and carbon soot rainout/fallout.\nThus the immediate consequence of the arson sabotage was a dramatic regional decrease in air quality, causing respiratory problems for many Kuwaitis and those in neighboring countries.\nAccording to the 1992 study from Peter Hobbs and Lawrence Radke, daily emissions of sulfur dioxide (which can generate acid rain) from the Kuwaiti oil fires were 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States, the emissions of carbon dioxide were 2% of global emissions and emissions of soot reached 3400 metric tons per day.\nIn a paper in the DTIC archive, published in 2000, it states that \"Calculations based on smoke from Kuwaiti oil fires in May and June 1991 indicate that combustion efficiency was about 96% in producing carbon dioxide. While, with respect to the incomplete combustion fraction, Smoke particulate matter accounted for 2% of the fuel burned, of which 0.4% was soot.\" (With the remaining 2% being oil that did not undergo any initial combustion).\nDamage to coastline and soil.\nAlthough scenarios that predicted long-lasting environmental impacts on a global atmospheric level due to the burning oil sources did not transpire, long-lasting ground level oil spill impacts were detrimental to the environment regionally.\nForty-six oil wells are estimated to have gushed, and before efforts to cap them began, they were releasing approximately 300,000\u2013400,000 barrels of oil per day, with the last gusher being capped occurring in the latter days of October 1991.\nThe Kuwaiti Oil Minister estimated between twenty-five and fifty million barrels of unburned oil from damaged facilities pooled to create approximately 300 oil lakes, that contaminated around 40 million tons of sand and earth. The mixture of desert sand, unignited oil spilled and soot generated by the burning oil wells formed layers of hard \"tarcrete\", which covered nearly five percent of Kuwait's land mass.\nCleaning efforts were led by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research and the Arab Oil Co., who tested a number of technologies including the use of petroleum-degrading bacteria on the oil lakes.\nVegetation in most of the contaminated areas adjoining the oil lakes began recovering by 1995, but the dry climate has also partially solidified some of the lakes. Over time the oil has continued to sink into the sand, with potential consequences for Kuwait's small groundwater resources.\nThe land based Kuwaiti oil spill surpassed the Lakeview Gusher, which spilled nine million barrels in 1910, as the largest oil spill in recorded history.\nSix to eight million barrels of oil were directly spilled into the Persian Gulf, which became known as the Gulf War oil spill.\nDocumentaries.\nThe fires were the subject of a 1992 IMAX documentary film, \"Fires of Kuwait\", which was nominated for an Academy Award. The film includes footage of the Hungarian team using their jet turbine extinguisher.\n\"Lessons of Darkness\" is a 1992 film by director Werner Herzog that explores the ravaged oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait.\nBechtel Corporation produced a short documentary titled \"Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun\" that summarizes and focuses upon the fire fighting efforts, which were dubbed the Al-Awda (Arabic for \"The Return\") project.\nPeter V. Hobbs also narrated a short amateur documentary titled \"Kuwait Oil Fires\" that followed the University of Washington's Cloud and Aerosol Research Group as they flew through, around, and above the smoke clouds and took samples, measurements, and videos of them in their Convair C-131 aerial laboratory.\nComparable incidents.\nDuring the 2003 invasion of Iraq, approximately 40 oil wells were set on fire in the Persian Gulf within Iraq by Iraqi forces, ostensibly to hinder the invasion. The \"Kuwait Wild Well Killers\", who successfully extinguished 41 of the Kuwait oil well fires in 1991, used their experience to tackle blazes in the Iraqi Rumaila oilfields in 2003.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She made her acting debut in the anthology film \"New York Stories\" (1989) and has since starred in several film and television productions. She has received several awards including nominations for an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and four Golden Globe Awards.\nDunst first gained recognition for her role as child vampire Claudia in the horror film \"Interview with the Vampire\" (1994), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She also had roles in her youth in \"Little Women\" (1994) and \"Jumanji\" (1995). Dunst transitioned to leading roles in teen films of 1999, the satires \"Dick\" and \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" and the drama \"The Virgin Suicides\", the first of her collaborations with filmmaker Sofia Coppola. After the leading role in the cheerleading film \"Bring It On\" (2000), she gained wider attention for her role as Mary Jane Watson in Sam Raimi's \"Spider-Man\" trilogy (2002\u20132007). Her career progressed with a supporting role in \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), followed by a lead role in Cameron Crowe's tragicomedy \"Elizabethtown\" (2005), and as Marie Antoinette in Coppola's \"Marie Antoinette\" (2006).\nIn 2011, Dunst starred as a depressed newlywed in Lars von Trier's drama \"Melancholia\", which earned her the Cannes Film Festival Award For Best Actress. In 2015, she played Peggy Blumquist in the second season of the FX series \"Fargo\", earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the role. Dunst had a supporting role in the film \"Hidden Figures\" (2016), and leading roles in Coppola's \"The Beguiled\" (2017) and in the dark comedy series \"On Becoming a God in Central Florida\" (2019), for which she received a third Golden Globe nomination. Dunst earned her fourth nomination for a Golden Globe and first nomination for an Academy Award for her performance in the psychological drama \"The Power of the Dog\" (2021). In 2024, she led the dystopian thriller film \"Civil War\".\nEarly life.\nDunst was born on April 30, 1982, at Point Pleasant Hospital in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. Dunst's father, Klaus Dunst, worked for Siemens as a medical services executive, and her mother, Inez (n\u00e9e Rupprecht) worked for Lufthansa as a flight attendant. She was also an artist and one-time gallery owner. Dunst's father is German, originally from Hamburg, and her American mother is of German and Swedish descent; she described herself in a 2001 interview as \"Aryan. Like a Swedish milkmaid.\" Until the age of eleven, Dunst lived in Brick Township, New Jersey, and attended Ranney School in Tinton Falls.\nIn 1993, she moved to Los Angeles with her mother and brother, after her parents separated. In her teens, she found it difficult to cope with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later said that her mother \"always had the best intentions\". When asked if she had any regrets about her childhood, Dunst said, \"Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues.\"\nActing career.\n1988\u20131993: Early work.\nDunst began her career at age three as a child fashion model in television commercials. She was signed with Ford Models and Elite Model Management. In 1988, she appeared in \"Saturday Night Live\" as the granddaughter of George H. W. Bush. Later that year, she made her feature film debut with a minor role in Woody Allen's short film \"Oedipus Wrecks\"; it was released as one-third of the anthology film \"New York Stories\" (1989). Soon after, Dunst performed in the comedy-drama \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" (1990), based on Tom Wolfe's novel of the same name, in which she played the daughter of Tom Hanks' character. In 1993, Dunst made a guest appearance in an episode of the science fiction drama \"\".\n1994\u20132001: Career breakthrough.\nDunst's breakthrough role came in 1994, in the horror drama \"Interview with the Vampire\" opposite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, based on Anne Rice's novel of the same name. She played Claudia, the child vampire who is a surrogate daughter to Cruise's and Pitt's characters. The film included a scene in which Dunst shared her first onscreen kiss with Pitt, who is two decades her senior. She stated that kissing him had made her feel uncomfortable: \"I thought it was gross, that Brad had cooties. I mean, I was 10,\" she recalled. While the film overall received mixed reviews, many critics singled out Dunst's performance for acclaim. Roger Ebert considered her portrayal of Claudia to be one of the \"creepier\" aspects of the film, and took note of how well she had conveyed the impression of great age inside apparent youth. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" stated that Dunst was \"just right\" for the family. For her performance, she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance and the Saturn Award for Best Young Actress, in addition to receiving a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\nLater in 1994, Dunst co-starred in the drama film \"Little Women\" alongside Winona Ryder and Claire Danes. The film was critically acclaimed. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" hailed it as the greatest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel of the same name and wrote of Dunst's performance:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The perfect contrast to take-charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst's scene-stealing Amy, whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11-year-old vixen than they did from grown-up Joan Bennett in 1933. Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of \"Interview With the Vampire\", is a little vamp with a big future.\nIn 1995, Dunst starred in the fantasy adventure film \"Jumanji\", a loose adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 children's book of the same name. The story is about a supernatural and ominous board game in which animals and other jungle hazards appear with each roll of the dice. She was part of an ensemble cast that included Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier. The film was a financial success and grossed $ worldwide. In that year, and again in 2002, Dunst was named one of \"People\" magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People.\nIn 1996\u20131997, Dunst had a recurring role in season three of the NBC medical drama \"ER\". She played Charlie Chemingo, a child prostitute who was being cared for by the ER pediatrician Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney). In 1997, she voiced Young Anastasia in the animated musical film \"Anastasia\". Also in 1997, Dunst appeared in the black comedy film \"Wag the Dog\", opposite Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman. The following year she starred in \"Small Soldiers\" and voiced the title character in the English Disney/GKIDS dub of Studio Ghibli's \"Kiki's Delivery Service\". She also starred in Sarah Kernochan's period comedy \"All I Wanna Do\" (1998), playing a student at an all girls' boarding school in the 1960s, opposite Gaby Hoffmann, Rachael Leigh Cook, and Lynn Redgrave. Writing for \"The New York Times\", A. O. Scott opined that \"the film is surprisingly pleasant, thanks to smart, unstereotyped performances\u2014especially by Hoffmann and Dunst\u2014and the filmmaker's evident respect and affection for her characters\".\nDunst starred in \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\", a 1999 American satirical black comedy mockumentary film about a small town beauty pageant with Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney. She turned down the role of Angela Hayes (played by Mena Suvari) in \"American Beauty\" (1999), because she did not want to appear in the film's sexual scenes or kiss the lead character, played by Kevin Spacey. She later explained: \"When I read it, I was 15 and I don't think I was mature enough to understand the script's material.\" Dunst co-starred in the comedy film \"Dick\", opposite Michelle Williams; it is a parody which retells the events of the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of former United States president Richard Nixon. Her next film was Sofia Coppola's drama \"The Virgin Suicides\" (1999), based on Jeffrey Eugenides' novel of the same name. She played Lux Lisbon, one of the troubled teenage daughters of Ronald Lisbon (James Woods). The film was screened as a special presentation at the 43rd San Francisco International Film Festival in 2000. According to Metacritic, the film received generally favorable reviews. \"San Francisco Chronicle\" critic Peter Stack noted in his review that Dunst \"beautifully balances innocence and wantonness\". Dunst also appeared in Savage Garden's music video \"I Knew I Loved You\", the first single from their second and final album \"Affirmation\" (1999).\nIn 2000, Dunst starred in the comedy \"Bring It On\" as Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad. The film garnered mostly positive reviews, with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her \"a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt\". Charles Taylor of \"Salon\" noted that \"among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist\", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had in either \"Dick\" or in \"The Virgin Suicides.\" Jessica Winter of \"The Village Voice\" praised Dunst, stating that her performance was \"as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in \"Dick\"\" adding that \"[Dunst] provides the only major element of \"Bring It On\" that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness.\" Peter Stack of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness \"to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film\".\nIn 2001, Dunst starred in the comedy film \"Get Over It\". She later explained that she took the role for the opportunity to showcase her singing. Dunst then co-starred with Jay Hernandez in the coming of age teen romance film \"Crazy/Beautiful\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote, \"\"Crazy/Beautiful\" [\u2026] is an unusually observant film about adolescence,\" and \"because of the real conviction that Dunst and Hernandez bring to the roles, we care about them as people, not case studies.\" She also starred in the historical drama \"The Cat's Meow\", directed by Peter Bogdanovich, as actress Marion Davies. Derek Elley of \"Variety\" described the film as \"playful and sporty\", deeming this Dunst's best performance to date: \"Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy\". For her performance, she won the Best Actress Silver Omb\u00fa award at the 2002 Mar del Plata International Film Festival.\n2002\u20132009: Stardom with \"Spider-Man\".\nIn 2002, Dunst starred opposite Tobey Maguire in the superhero film \"Spider-Man\", the most financially successful film of her career up until this date. She played Mary Jane Watson, the love interest of Peter Parker (Maguire). The film was directed by Sam Raimi. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted Dunst's ability to \"lend even the smallest line a tickle of flirtatious music\". Writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Kenneth Turan reviewed that Dunst and Maguire made a real connection onscreen, concluding that their relationship \"involved audiences to an extent rarely seen in films\". \"Spider-Man\" was a critical and commercial success. The film grossed $ during its opening weekend in North America and earned $ worldwide.\nDunst next co-starred with Billy Bob Thornton, Morgan Freeman and Holly Hunter in the drama \"Levity\" (2003), a story of a man who is released on parole and returns to his hometown seeking redemption. That same year, she co-starred opposite Julia Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Julia Stiles in the drama \"Mona Lisa Smile\" (2003). The film received mostly negative reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the \"Los Angeles Times\" describing it as \"smug and reductive\". Dunst co-starred as Mary Svevo opposite Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet and Tom Wilkinson in Michel Gondry's science fiction romantic comedy-drama \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004). The latter film was critically acclaimed, with \"Entertainment Weekly\" describing Dunst's subplot as \"nifty and clever\". The film grossed $ worldwide.\nThe success of the first \"Spider-Man\" led Dunst to reprise her role as Mary Jane Watson in 2004 in \"Spider-Man 2\". The film was acclaimed by critics and a commercial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With box office revenues of $ worldwide, it was the second highest-grossing film in 2004. Also in 2004, Dunst co-starred opposite Paul Bettany in the romantic comedy \"Wimbledon\" in which she portrayed a rising tennis player in the Wimbledon Championships, while Bettany portrayed a fading former tennis star. The film received mixed reviews, but many critics enjoyed Dunst's performance. Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" observed that the chemistry between Dunst and Bettany was potent, with Dunst doing a \"fine job as a sassy and self-assured player\".\nIn Dunst's sole project of 2005, she co-starred opposite Orlando Bloom in Cameron Crowe's romantic tragicomedy \"Elizabethtown\" as flight attendant Claire Colburn. The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Dunst revealed that working with Crowe was enjoyable, but more demanding than she had expected. The film garnered mixed reviews, with the \"Chicago Tribune\" rating it 1 out of 4 stars and describing Dunst's portrayal of a flight attendant as \"cloying\". It was also a box office disappointment. After \"Elizabethtown\", Dunst collaborated with Sofia Coppola again and starred as Marie Antoinette in the historical drama \"Marie Antoinette\" (2006), based on Antonia Fraser's book \"\". The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, and was reviewed favorably. The film grossed $ at the box office from a budget of $.\nIn 2007, Dunst reprised the role of Mary Jane Watson in \"Spider-Man 3\". In contrast to its predecessors' rave reviews, \"Spider-Man 3\" received a mixed reaction from critics. Ryan Gilbey of the \"New Statesman\" was critical of Dunst's character, remarking that \"the film-makers couldn't come up with much for Mary Jane to do other than scream a lot\". Nevertheless, with a worldwide gross of $, it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst's highest-grossing film to the end of 2008. Having initially signed on for three \"Spider-Man\" films, she said she would consider doing a fourth, but only if Raimi and Maguire returned. In January 2010, it was announced that the fourth film was canceled and that the \"Spider-Man\" film series would be restarted, therefore dropping the trio from the franchise.\nDunst's next role was in 2008, in which she co-starred opposite Simon Pegg in the comedy \"How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People\", based on former \"Vanity Fair\" contributing editor Toby Young's memoir of the same name. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 37%, with the film gaining mostly negative reviews. Robert Wilonsky of \"The Village Voice\" was critical of Dunst's performance, writing she \"seems to be speaking in four different accents at once, none of them quite of the English variety\". He added that the film \"plays like a made-for-CBS redo of \"The Devil Wears Prada\"\"\".\"\n2010\u20132016: Independent films.\nDunst made her screenwriting and directorial debut with the short film \"Bastard\", which she co-wrote with Sasha Sagan. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010 and was later featured at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. She co-starred opposite Ryan Gosling in the mystery drama \"All Good Things\" (2010), based on the true story of New York real estate developer Robert Durst, whose wife disappeared in 1982. The film received fair reviews, but was a commercial failure, earning only $ worldwide. The critic Roger Ebert praised Dunst for her ability to capture \"a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and what the true nature of his family involves\". The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" complimented her performance as \"the only one worth watching\", despite the film's \"slow crawl\" and lack of suspense. Also in 2010, Dunst co-starred with Brian Geraghty in Carlos Cuar\u00f3n's short film \"The Second Bakery Attack\", based on Haruki Murakami's short story.\nIn 2011, Dunst co-starred opposite Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kiefer Sutherland and Charlotte Rampling in Lars von Trier's drama film \"Melancholia\" as a woman suffering depression as the world ends. It premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and received positive reviews, in particular for Dunst's performance. Steven Loeb of \"Southampton Patch\" wrote \"This film has brought the best out of von Trier, as well as his star. Dunst is so good in this film, playing a character unlike any other she has ever attempted...\u00a0Even if the film itself were not the incredible work of art that it is, Dunst's performance alone would be incentive enough to recommend it\". Sukhdev Sandhu of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote: \"Dunst is exceptional, so utterly convincing in the lead role\u2014trouble, serene, a fierce savant\u2014that it feels like a career breakthrough. Dunst won several awards for her performance, including the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Actress Award from the U.S. National Society of Film Critics.\nDunst made a cameo in Beastie Boys' 2011 music video \"Fight For Your Right Revisited\", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. A year later, she starred in Juan Diego Solanas' science fiction romance \"Upside Down\" with Jim Sturgess. Described as a \"Romeo and Juliet\" story, Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" opined that there was no character development and Dunst \"brings competence but no passion to her underwritten roles\". The film's consensus on Rotten Tomatoes was also negative, with a 28% approval rating. Next, she had a role in Leslye Headland's romantic comedy \"Bachelorette\" (2012), starring Isla Fisher, Rebel Wilson and Lizzy Caplan; the film was produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. Dunst plays Regan Crawford, one of three women who reunite for the wedding of a friend who was ridiculed in high school. Dunst appeared in the drama \"On the Road\" (2012), an adaptation of Jack Kerouac's novel of the same name, in which she plays Camille Moriarty. Dunst was first approached for the role by director Walter Salles several years prior. The film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, and was released in the United States on December 21, 2012. \"On the Road\" gained mixed reviews and under-performed at the box office. Writing for \"Time\" magazine, Richard Corliss compared \"On the Road\" to \"a diorama in a Kerouac museum ... [the film] lacks the novel's exuberant syncopation\", but praises Dunst's performance. \"Chicago Tribune\"'s Michael Phillips was more positive, giving the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising the cinematic quality, and actors for their \"kind of fluid motion and freedom that periodically makes \"On the Road\" make sense and makes it feel alive\".\nHossein Amini's \"The Two Faces of January\" (2014) was Dunst's next major role, starring alongside Viggo Mortensen and Oscar Isaac. Playing Colette MacFarland, the wife of a con artist, the thriller is based on Patricia Highsmith's 1964 novel of the same name. Garnering mostly favorable reviews, the \"Los Angeles Times\" complimented the 1960s Greek setting and observed Dunst \"brings a potent complexity to Colette; every mood shift registers to the bone\". Jake Wilson of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" praised the script for \"condensing the book's plot while retaining its spirit\", although he thought there was some uneven editing. Of Dunst's performance, he called her \"typically teasing yet sympathetic\". Finally in 2014, Dunst voiced a character in the eighth episode of \"\", and made a guest appearance in an episode of \"Portlandia\". Throughout 2015, Dunst focused solely on television work. She was cast as hairdresser Peggy Blumquist in the second season of the critically acclaimed FX crime dark comedy-drama \"Fargo\", which earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.\nIn 2016, Dunst co-starred in Jeff Nichols' science fiction drama \"Midnight Special\" with Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton. The story is about a father and his eight-year-old son who go on the run upon discovering that the boy possesses mysterious powers. The film opened to mostly positive reviews; Tim Grierson of \"The New Republic\" was impressed by \"Midnight Special\"'s special effects which imitated a late 20th century retro style. However, he questioned the purpose of Dunst's character which \"simply has nothing to do\". Dunst had a supporting role in the biographical drama \"Hidden Figures\" (2016), a loose adaptation of the book of the same name, about African-American mathematicians who worked at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) during the Space Race. Dunst's portrayal of a white supervisor drew praise from \"Slant Magazine\"'s Elise Nakhnikian, while \"The Guardian\" thought the film was educational and entertaining despite its underdeveloped supporting cast. The film was a commercial success, grossing $ worldwide and was nominated for three Academy Awards. The cast also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. In addition to acting, Dunst served as a member of the main competition jury of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. In that year, Dunst planned to direct an adaptation of Sylvia Plath's novel \"The Bell Jar\", starring Dakota Fanning, but stepped down from the project before production.\n2017\u2013present.\nDunst had two film releases in 2017. She starred alongside Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning in the drama \"The Beguiled\", which marked her third collaboration with Sofia Coppola, who wrote and directed the film. It is a remake of Don Siegel's 1971 film of the same name about a wounded Union soldier who seeks shelter at an all-girls' school in the Confederate States of America. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 79% approval rating which was \"enlivened by strong performances from the cast\". Matthew Norman of the \"Evening Standard\" similarly took note of the \"impeccable\" acting performances and wrote, \"Dunst lends the ideal measure of coiled physical longing to her prim spinster\".\nDunst then starred in the psychological thriller \"Woodshock\", written and directed by her friends, Kate and Laura Mulleavy, founders of the Rodarte fashion label. The film is about a woman who falls deeper into paranoia after taking a deadly drug. The Mulleavys' personally approached Dunst for the lead role, which gave Dunst an \"emotional safety net\" during filming. She prepared for the role over the course of a year, undertaking dream experiments in order to try to inhabit the character's state of mind. Upon release, the film was unpopular with critics. Katie Rife of \"The A.V. Club\" acknowledged the \"sophisticated\" cinematography but thought \"Character development and motivation are practically nonexistent, and the already-thin plot pushes ambiguity to the point of incoherence\". \"Variety\"'s Guy Lodge shared a similar opinion with the character, writing \"Dunst has form in playing irretrievably inverted depression to riveting effect, but the Mulleavys' script hardly gives her as complex an emotional or intellectual palette to work with\".\nIn 2019, Dunst starred in the Showtime dark comedy television series \"On Becoming a God in Central Florida\", which premiered in August that year. For her role, she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress and a Critics Choice Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. In September 2019, Showtime renewed the series for a second season, but ultimately canceled it the following year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDunst co-starred with her partner Jesse Plemons in Jane Campion's film \"The Power of the Dog\" distributed by Netflix, and given a limited theatrical release in the USA on November 17, 2021. She received Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress along with two Critics' Choice Award nominations (Best Supporting Actress and Best Acting Ensemble).\nIn 2024, Dunst led the dystopian thriller film \"Civil War\", directed by Alex Garland. Her performance was particularly picked up for praise by critics.\nMusic career.\nIn 2001, Dunst made her singing debut in the comedy film \"Get Over It\", performing two songs written by Marc Shaiman.\nShe recorded Henry Creamer and Turner Layton's jazz standard \"After You've Gone\" that was used in the end credits of \"The Cat's Meow\". In \"Spider-Man 3\", she sang two songs as Mary Jane Watson, one during a Broadway performance, and one as a singing waitress in a jazz club. Dunst recorded the songs earlier and lip-synced while filming. She appeared in the music videos for Savage Garden's \"I Knew I Loved You\", Beastie Boys' \"Make Some Noise\" and R.E.M.'s \"We All Go Back to Where We Belong\" and she sang two tracks, \"This Old Machine\" and \"Summer Day\", on Jason Schwartzman's 2007 solo album \"Nighttiming\". In 2007, Dunst said she had no intention to release albums, saying, \"It worked when Barbra Streisand was doing it, but now it's a little cheesy, I think. It works better when singers are in movies\".\nDunst starred as the magical princess Majokko in the Takashi Murakami-and-McG-directed short \"Akihabara Majokko Princess\" singing a cover of The Vapors' 1980 song \"Turning Japanese\". This was shown at the \"Pop Life\" exhibition in London's Tate Modern gallery from October 1, 2009, to January 17, 2010. It shows Dunst dancing around Akihabara, a shopping district in Tokyo, Japan.\nPersonal life.\nIn early 2008, Dunst was treated for depression at the Cirque Lodge treatment center in Utah. In late March 2008, she left the treatment center and began filming \"All Good Things\". Two months later, she went public with this information in order to dispel rumors of substance abuse, stating, \"Now that I'm feeling stronger, I was prepared to say something. ... Depression is pretty serious and should not be gossiped about\".\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Dunst was in a relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. She was in a relationship with her \"On the Road\" co-star Garrett Hedlund from 2012 to 2016. Dunst and Hedlund were briefly engaged before eventually breaking up. She began a relationship with her \"Fargo\" co-star Jesse Plemons in 2016 and they became engaged in 2017. Their first son was born in May 2018. In a cover shoot for \"W\" directed by long-time collaborator Sofia Coppola, she announced that she was pregnant with her second child, and later gave birth to their second son in May 2021. Dunst and Plemons were married in July 2022 at a resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.\nDunst is a practicing Christian.\nOther ventures.\nDunst supports the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, for which she helped design and promote a necklace whose sales proceeds went to the Foundation. She worked in support of breast cancer awareness, participating in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon in September 2008 in order to raise funds for cancer research. On December 5, 2009, she participated in the Telet\u00f3n in Mexico, in order to raise awareness for cancer treatment and children's rehabilitation.\nDunst endorsed John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. She supported Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election, and directed and narrated a documentary, \"Why Tuesday\", about the tradition of voting on Tuesdays and low voter turnout in the United States, to \"influence people in a positive way\". She endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election. In 2011, she acquired German citizenship, which enabled her to \"film in Europe without a problem\". She now holds dual American and German citizenship.\nActing credits and awards.\nDunst's most acclaimed films according to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes include \"Little Women\" (1994), \"Spider-Man\" (2002), \"Spider-Man 2\" (2004), \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004), \"Melancholia\" (2011), \"The Two Faces of January\" (2014), \"Hidden Figures\" (2017), and \"The Power of the Dog\" (2021).\nDunst has been nominated for four Golden Globe awards: Best Supporting Actress for \"Interview with the Vampire\" (1994) and \"The Power of the Dog\", Best Actress for Miniseries or Television Film for \"Fargo\" (2015), and Best Actress for Television Series Musical or Comedy for \"On Becoming a God in Central Florida\" (2019). In August 2019, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Dunst was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for \"The Power of the Dog\" at the 2022 Academy Awards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for his studies on direct interfaces between computer systems and the human nervous system, and has also done research concerning robotics.\nBiography.\nKevin Warwick was born in 1954 in Keresley, Coventry, England, and was raised in the nearby village of Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire. His family attended a Methodist church but soon he began doubting the existence of God. He attended Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby, Warwickshire, where he was a contemporary of actor Arthur Bostrom. He left school at the age of 16 to start an apprenticeship with British Telecom. In 1976, he was granted his first degree at Aston University, followed by a PhD degree and a research job at Imperial College London.\nHe took up positions at Somerville College in Oxford, Newcastle University, the University of Warwick, and the University of Reading, before relocating to Coventry University in 2014.\nWarwick is a Chartered Engineer (CEng), a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (FIET) and a Fellow of the City and Guilds of London Institute (FCGI). He is Visiting Professor at the Czech Technical University in Prague, the University of Strathclyde, Bournemouth University, and the University of Reading, and in 2004 he was Senior Beckman Fellow at the University of Illinois in the United States. He is also on the Advisory Boards of the Instinctive Computing Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Centre for Intermedia at the University of Exeter.\nBy the age of 40, Warwick had been awarded a DSc degree by both Imperial College London and the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague, for his research output in two entirely unrelated areas. He has received the IET Achievement Medal, the IET Mountbatten Medal, and in 2011 the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine. In 2000, Warwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, entitled \"The Rise of Robots\".\nResearch.\nWarwick performs research in artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, control systems and robotics. Much of Warwick's early research was in the area of discrete time adaptive control. He introduced the first state space based self-tuning controller and unified discrete time state space representations of ARMA models. He has also contributed to mathematics, power engineering and manufacturing production machinery.\nArtificial intelligence.\nWarwick directed a research project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), which investigated the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to suitably stimulate and translate patterns of electrical activity from living cultured neural networks to use the networks for the control of mobile robots. Hence the behaviour process for each robot was effectively provided by a biological brain.\nPreviously, Warwick helped to develop a genetic algorithm named Gershwyn, which was able to exhibit creativity in producing popular songs, learning what makes a hit record by listening to examples of previous successful songs. Gershwyn appeared on BBC's \"Tomorrow's World\", having been successfully used to mix music for Manus, a group consisting of the four younger brothers of Elvis Costello.\nAnother of Warwick's projects involving AI was the robot head, Morgui. The head, which contained five \"senses\" (vision, sound, infrared, ultrasound and radar), was used to investigate sensor data fusion. It was X-rated by the University of Reading Research and Ethics Committee due to its image storage capabilities\u2014anyone under the age of 18 who wished to interact with the robot had to obtain parental approval.\nWarwick has very outspoken opinions about the future, particularly with respect to AI and its effect on the human species. He argues that humanity will need to use technology to enhance itself to avoid being overtaken by machines. He states that many human limitations, such as sensorimotor abilities, can be outperformed by machines, and he has said on record that he wants to gain these abilities: \"There is no way I want to stay a mere human.\"\nBioethics.\nWarwick directed the University of Reading team in a number of European Community projects such as: FIDIS (Future of Identity in the Information Society), researching the future of identity; and ETHICBOTS and RoboLaw, both of which considered the ethical aspects of robots and cyborgs.\nWarwick's topics of interest have many ethical implications, some due to his human enhancement experiments. The ethical dilemmas of his research are used by the Institute of Physics as a case study for schoolchildren and science teachers as a part of their formal Advanced level and GCSE studies. His work has also been discussed by the USA President's Council on Bioethics and the USA President's Panel on Forward Engagements. He is a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on \"Novel Neurotechnologies\".\nDeep brain stimulation.\nAlong with Tipu Aziz and his team at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and John Stein of the University of Oxford, Warwick is helping to design the next generation of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. Instead of stimulating the brain all the time, the goal is for the device to predict when stimulation is needed and to apply the signals prior to any tremors occurring, thereby stopping tremors before they start. Recent results have also shown that it is possible to identify different types of Parkinson's Disease.\nPublic awareness.\nWarwick has directed a number of projects intended to interest schoolchildren in the technology with which he is involved. In 2000, he received the EPSRC Millennium Award for his Schools Robot League. In 2007, 16 school teams were involved in a project to design a humanoid robot to dance and then complete an assault course, with the final competition staged at the Science Museum, London. The project, entitled 'Androids Advance' was funded by EPSRC and was presented as a news item by Chinese television.\nWarwick contributes significantly to the public understanding of science by giving regular public lectures, participating with radio programmes, and through popular writing. He has appeared in numerous television documentary programmes on AI, robotics and the role of science fiction in science, such as \"How William Shatner Changed the World\", \"Future Fantastic\" and \"Explorations\". He also appeared in the Ray Kurzweil-inspired movie \"Transcendent Man\" along with William Shatner, Colin Powell, and Stevie Wonder. He has guested on several television talk shows, including \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", \"F\u00f8rst &amp; sist\", \"Sunday Brunch\" and \"Richard &amp; Judy\". He has appeared on the cover of a number of magazines, for example the February 2000 edition of \"Wired\".\nIn 2005, Warwick was the subject of an early day motion tabled by members of the UK Parliament, in which he was congratulated for his work in attracting students to science and for teaching \"in a way that makes the subject interesting and relevant so that more students will want to develop a career in science.\"\nIn 2009, Warwick was interviewed about his work in cybernetics for two documentary features on the DVD release of the 1985 \"Doctor Who\" story \"Attack of the Cybermen\". He was also an interview subject for the televised lecture \"The Science of Doctor Who\" in 2013.\nIn 2013, Warwick appeared as a guest on BBC Radio 4's \"The Museum of Curiosity\" with Robert Llewellyn and Cleo Rocos. In 2014, he appeared on BBC Radio 4's \"Midweek\" with Libby Purves, Roger Bannister and Rachael Stirling.\nRobotics.\nWarwick's claims that robots can program themselves to avoid each other while operating in a group raise the issue of self-organisation. In particular, the works of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana, once purely speculative have now become immediately relevant with respect to synthetic intelligence.\nCyborg-type systems, if they are to survive, need to be not only homeostatic (meaning that they are able to preserve stable internal conditions in various environments) but also adaptive. Testing the claims of Varela and Maturana using synthetic devices is the more serious concern in the discussion about Warwick and those involved in similar research. \"Pulling the plug\" on independent devices cannot be as simple as it appears, because if the device displays sufficient intelligence, and assumes a diagnostic and prognostic stature, we may ultimately one day be forced to decide between what it could be telling us as counterintuitive (but correct) and our impulse to disconnect because of our limited and \"intuitive\" perceptions.\nWarwick's robots seemed to exhibit behaviour not anticipated by the research, one such robot \"committing suicide\" because it could not cope with its environment. In a more complex setting, it may be asked whether a \"natural selection\" might be possible, neural networks being the major operative.\nThe 1999 edition of the \"Guinness Book of Records\" recorded that Warwick performed the first robot learning experiment using the Internet. One robot, with an artificial neural network brain at the University of Reading in the UK, learned how to move around without bumping into things. It then taught, via the Internet, another robot at SUNY Buffalo in New York State to behave in the same way. The robot in the US was therefore not taught or programmed by a human, but rather by another robot based on what it had itself learnt.\nHissing Sid was a robot cat that Warwick took on a British Council lecture tour of Russia, where he presented it in lectures at such places as Moscow State University. The robot was put together as a student project; its name came from the noise made by the pneumatic actuators used to drive its legs when walking. Hissing Sid also appeared on BBC TV's \"Blue Peter\", but became better known when it was refused a ticket by British Airways on the grounds that they did not allow animals in the cabin.\nWarwick was also responsible for a robotic \"magic chair\" (based on the SCARA-form UMI RTX arm) used on BBC TV's \"Jim'll Fix It\". The chair provided the show's host Jimmy Savile with tea and stored Jim'll Fix It badges for him to hand out to guests. Warwick appeared on the programme himself for a Fix-it involving robots.\nWarwick was also involved in the development of the \"Seven Dwarves\" robots, a version of which was sold in kit form as \"Cybot\" on the cover of \"Real Robots\" magazine in 2001. The magazine series guided its readers through the stages of building and programming Cybot, an artificially intelligent robot capable of making its own decisions and thinking for itself.\nProject Cyborg.\nProbably the most famous research undertaken by Warwick\u2014and the origin of the nickname \"Captain Cyborg\" given to him by \"The Register\"\u2014is the set of experiments known as Project Cyborg, in which an array was implanted into his arm, with the goal of him \"becoming a cyborg\".&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe first stage of Project Cyborg, which began on 24 August 1998, involved a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick's skin, which was used to control doors, lights, heaters, and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity. He explained that the main purpose of this experiment was to test the limits of what the body would accept, and how easy it would be to receive a meaningful signal from the microprocessor.\nThe second stage of the research involved a more complex neural interface, designed and built especially for the experiment by Dr. Mark Gasson and his team at the University of Reading. This device consisted of a BrainGate sensor, a silicon square about 3mm wide, connected to an external \"gauntlet\" that housed supporting electronics. It was implanted under local anaesthetic on 14 March 2002 at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, where it was interfaced directly into Warwick's nervous system via the median nerve in his left wrist. The microelectrode array that was inserted contained 100 electrodes, each the width of a human hair, of which 25 could be accessed at any one time, whereas the nerve that was being monitored carries many times that number of signals. The experiment proved successful, and the output signals were detailed enough to enable a robot arm, developed by Warwick's colleague Dr. Peter Kyberd, to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm.\nBy means of the implant, Warwick's nervous system was connected to the Internet at Columbia University, New York. From there he was able to control the robot arm at the University of Reading and obtain feedback from sensors in the finger tips. He also successfully connected ultrasonic sensors on a baseball cap and experienced a form of extrasensory input.\nIn a highly publicised extension to the experiment, a simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife, with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal over huge distances. This experiment resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans. Finally, the effect of the implant on Warwick's hand function was measured using the University of Southampton's Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). There was a fear that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable side effect (nor any sign of rejection) was encountered.\nImplications.\nWarwick and his colleagues claim that the Project Cyborg research could result in new medical tools for treating patients with damage to the nervous system, as well as assisting the more ambitious enhancements Warwick advocates. Some transhumanists even speculate that similar technologies could be used for technology-facilitated telepathy.\nTracking device.\nA controversy began in August 2002, shortly after the Soham murders, when Warwick reportedly offered to implant a tracking device into an 11-year-old girl as an anti-abduction measure. The plan produced a mixed reaction, with endorsement from many worried parents but ethical concerns from children's societies. As a result, the idea did not go ahead.\nAnti-theft RFID chips are common in jewellery or clothing in some Latin American countries due to a high abduction rate, and the company VeriChip announced plans in 2001 to expand its line of available medical information implants, to be GPS trackable when combined with a separate GPS device.\nTuring test.\nWarwick participated as a \"Turing Interrogator\" on two occasions, judging machines in the 2001 and 2006 Loebner Prize competitions, platforms for an \"imitation game\" as devised by Alan Turing. The 2001 Prize, held at the London Science Museum, featured Turing's \"jury service\" or one-to-one Turing tests and was won by A.L.I.C.E. The 2006 contest staged \"parallel-paired\" Turing tests at University College London and the winner was Rollo Carpenter. Warwick co-organised the 2008 Loebner Prize at the University of Reading, which also featured parallel-paired Turing tests.\nIn 2012, he co-organised with Huma Shah a series of Turing tests held at Bletchley Park. According to Warwick, the tests strictly adhered to the statements made by Alan Turing in his papers. Warwick himself participated in the tests as a hidden human. Results of the tests were discussed in a number of academic papers. One paper, entitled \"Human Misidentification in Turing Tests\", became one of the top three most-downloaded papers in the \"Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence\".\nIn June 2014, Warwick helped Shah stage a series of Turing tests to mark the 60th anniversary of Alan Turing's death. The event was performed at the Royal Society, London. Warwick regarded the winning chatbot, \"Eugene Goostman\", as having \"passed the Turing test for the first time\" by fooling a third of the event's judges into making an incorrect identification, and termed this a \"milestone\". A paper containing all of the transcripts involving Eugene Goostman entitled \"Can Machines Think? A Report on Turing Test Experiments at the Royal Society\", has also become one of the top three most-downloaded papers in the \"Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence\".\nWarwick was criticised in the context of the 2014 Royal Society event, where he claimed that software program Eugene Goostman had passed the Turing test on the basis of its performance. The software successfully convinced over 30% of the judges who could not identify it as being a machine, on the basis of a five-minute text chat. Critics stated that the software's claim of being a young non-native English speaker weakened the spirit of the test, as any grammatical and semantic inconsistencies could be excused as a consequence of limited proficiency in the English language. Some critics also claimed that the software's performance had been exceeded by other programs in the past. However, the 2014 tests were entirely unrestricted in terms of discussion topics, whereas the previous tests referenced by the critics had been limited to very specific subject areas. Additionally, Warwick was criticised by editor and entrepreneur Mike Masnick for exaggerating the significance of the Eugene Goostman program to the press.\nOther work.\nWarwick was a member of the 2001 Higher Education Funding Council for England (unit 29) Research Assessment Exercise panel on Electrical and Electronic Engineering and was Deputy chairman for the same panel (unit 24) in 2008. In March 2009, he was cited as being the inspiration of National Young Scientist of the Year, Peter Hatfield.\nRoyal Institution Christmas Lectures.\nWarwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in December 2000, entitled \"Rise of the Robots\". Although the lectures were well received by some, British computer scientist Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick \"is not a spokesman for our subject\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is a danger to the public perception of science\". In response to Warwick's claims that computers could be creative, Colton, who is a Professor of Computational Creativity, also said: \"the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have\". Subsequent letters were generally positive; Ralph Rayner wrote: \"With my youngest son, I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. I applaud Warwick for his lectures\".\nAwards and recognition.\nWarwick received the Future Health Technology Award in 2000, and was presented with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Achievement Medal in 2004. In 2008, he was awarded the Mountbatten Medal. In 2009 he received the Marcellin Champagnat award from Universidad Marista Guadalajara and the Golden Eurydice Award. In 2011 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine. In 2014, he was elected to the membership of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 2018 Warwick was inducted into the International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences and in 2020 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Cybernetics Society.\nHe is the recipient of ten honorary doctorates, these being from Aston University, Coventry University, Robert Gordon University, Bradford University, University of Bedfordshire, Portsmouth University, Kingston University, Ss.

It is located on the Missouri River at its confluence with the Kansas River, within Jackson, Clay, Platte and Cass counties. It is the 38th-most populous city in the United States and sixth-most populous city in the Midwest, with a population of 508,090 at the 2020 census. The Kansas City metropolitan area, which straddles the Missouri\u2013Kansas state line, is the 31st-most populous metropolitan area in the nation, at 2.25 million residents. \nKansas City was founded in the 1830s as a port on the Missouri and Kansas rivers. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; soon afterwards, a region designated as the Kansas Territory was established. Confusion between the city and the territory of Kansas ensued, so the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish the city from the territory. Sited on Missouri's western border with Kansas and with downtown near the rivers' confluence, Kansas City, Missouri encompasses about , making it the 25th-largest city by total area in the United States. It is one of Jackson County's two seats along with the major satellite city of Independence; and Kansas City's other major Missouri suburbs include Blue Springs, Lee's Summit, Raytown, and Liberty. Kansas City Missouri's major Kansas suburbs include Overland Park, Olathe, Lenexa, and Kansas City, Kansas.\nThe city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the River Market District, 18th and Vine District, and the Country Club Plaza. Celebrated cultural traditions include Kansas City jazz; theater, as a historical center of the Vaudevillian Orpheum circuit in the 1920s; the nickname City of Fountains; the Chiefs and Royals sports franchises; and cuisine such as Kansas City\u2013style barbecue and strip steak.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe town of Kansas, Missouri, was incorporated on June 1, 1850, reincorporated and renamed City of Kansas on March 28, 1853, and renamed Kansas City in 1889. The area straddles the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, and was considered a good place to settle.\nThe Antioch Christian Church, Dr. James Compton House, and Woodneath are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nExploration and settlement.\nIn past centuries, the area's tribal inhabitants include the Hopewell tradition, Mississippian culture, Kansa, Osage, Otoe, and Missouri. The first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was \u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont, who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the Native American attack on Fort D\u00e9troit, he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about east near Brunswick, Missouri, where he illegally traded furs.\nTo clear his name, he wrote \"Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony\" in 1713 and \"The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River\" in 1714. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[i\u00e8re] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, as the first adoption of those names. French cartographer Guillaume Delisle used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.\nThe Spanish took over the region in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their fur trade under Spanish license. The Chouteau family operated under Spanish license at St. Louis, in the lower Missouri Valley as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau established Chouteau's Landing.\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase (1803).\nAfter the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Lewis and Clark visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of Mormons from New York state led by Joseph Smith settled in the area. They built the first school within what became Kansas City, but were forced out by mob violence in 1833.\nIn 1831, Gabriel Prudhomme Sr., a Canadian trapper and partner of Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau, purchased fronting the Missouri River. He established a home for his wife, Josephine, and six children. He operated a ferry on the river.\nIn 1833, John McCoy, son of Baptist missionary Isaac McCoy and brother-in-law of Johnston Lykins, established West Port along the Santa Fe Trail, south of the river. In 1834, McCoy established Westport Landing on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port, with Lykins as the first postmaster. He found it more convenient to have his goods offloaded at the Prudhomme landing next to Chouteau's landing than in Independence. Several years after Gabriel Prudhomme's death, a group of fourteen investors purchased his land at auction on November 14, 1838. By 1839, the investors divided the property and the first lots were sold in 1846 after legal complications were settled. The remaining lots were sold by February 1850.\nIn 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the town of Kansas, Missouri. By that time, the towns of Kansas, Westport, and nearby Independence, had become critical points in the westward expansion of the United States. Three major trails \u2013 the Santa Fe, California, and Oregon \u2013 all passed through Jackson County.\nOn February 22, 1853, Kansas was reincorporated and renamed the City of Kansas with its first elected mayor, William Samuel Gregory. Due to a legal discovery of living outside city boundaries, he was soon succeeded by Johnston Lykins as the second (but first legally elected) mayor. The city had an area of and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.\nAmerican Civil War.\nDuring the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the First Battle of Independence in August 1862 resulted in a Confederate States Army victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The Second Battle of Independence, which occurred on October 21\u201322, 1864, as part of Sterling Price's Missouri expedition of 1864, also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal Battle of Westport the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.\nGeneral Thomas Ewing, in response to a successful raid on nearby Lawrence, Kansas, led by William Quantrill, issued General Order No. 11, forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties \u2013 including Jackson \u2013 except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.\nAfter Civil War.\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly. The selection of the city over Leavenworth, Kansas, for the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad bridge over the Missouri River brought significant growth. The population exploding after 1869, when Hannibal Bridge, designed by Octave Chanute, opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.\nLandscape architect George Kessler shaped Kansas City into a leading example of the City Beautiful movement, with a network of boulevards and parks. New neighborhoods like Southmoreland and the Rockhill District were conceived to accommodate the city's largest residencies of palatial proportions.\nThe obsolescence of Union Depot in West Bottoms in favor of the new Union Station in 1914, and the opening of the Liberty Memorial in 1923, provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. Robert A. Long, president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the R. A. Long Building for the Long-Bell Lumber Company, his home, Corinthian Hall (now the Kansas City Museum) and Longview Farm.\nFurther spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative Country Club Plaza development by J. C. Nichols in 1925, as part of his Country Club District plan.\n20th century streetcar system.\nThe Kansas City streetcar system once had hundreds of miles of streetcars running through the city and was one of the largest systems in the country. In 1903 the 8th Street Tunnel was built as an underground streetcar system through the city. The last run of the streetcar was on June 23, 1957, but the tunnel still exists.\nPendergast era.\nAt the start of the 20th century, political machines gained clout in the city, with the one led by Tom Pendergast dominating the city by 1925. Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the Kansas City City Hall and the Jackson County Courthouse. During this time, he aided one of his nephew's friends, Harry S. Truman, in a political career. Truman eventually became a senator, then vice president, then president. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up his uniqueness:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.\nTroost redlining and white flight.\nTroost Avenue was once the eastern edge of Kansas City, Missouri and a residential corridor nicknamed Millionaire Row. It is now widely seen as one of the city's most prominent racial and economic dividing lines due to urban decay, which was caused by white flight. During the civil rights era the city blocked people of color from moving to homes west of Troost Avenue, causing the areas east of Troost to have one of the worst murder rates in the country. This led to the dominating economic success of neighboring Johnson County.\nIn 1950, African Americans represented 12.2% of Kansas City's population. The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic whites, declined from 89.5% in 1930 to 54.9% in 2010.\nIn 1940, the city had about 400,000 residents; by 2000, it had about 440,000. From 1940 to 1960, the city more than doubled its physical size, while increasing its population by only about 75,000. By 1970, the city covered approximately , more than five times its size in 1940. Aggressively annexing the surrounding suburbs and undeveloped land spared Kansas City from the severe population loss suffered by cities like St. Louis and Detroit, similar cities which both lost over 50% of their population in the postwar era. In the most neglected neighborhoods, however, the same pattern of abandonment occurred and left behind massive numbers of vacant lots and abandoned homes, especially in the areas east of Troost.\nHyatt Regency walkway collapse.\nThe Hyatt Regency walkway collapse was a major disaster that occurred on July 17, 1981, killing 114 people and injuring more than 200 others during a tea dance in the 45-story Hyatt Regency hotel in Crown Center. It is the deadliest structural collapse in US history other than the September 11 attacks. In 2015 a memorial called the Skywalk Memorial Plaza was built for the families of the victims of the disaster, across the street from the hotel which is now a Sheraton.\n21st century.\nDowntown Kansas City re-development.\nIn the 21st century, the Kansas City area has undergone extensive redevelopment, with more than $6 billion in improvements to the downtown area on the Missouri side. One of the main goals is to attract convention and tourist dollars, office workers, and residents to downtown KCMO. Among the projects include the redevelopment of the Power &amp; Light District into a retail and entertainment district; and the Sprint Center, an 18,500-seat arena that opened in 2007, funded by a 2004 ballot initiative involving a tax on car rentals and hotels, designed to meet the stadium specifications for a possible future NBA or NHL franchise, and was renamed T-Mobile Center in 2020; Kemper Arena, which was functionally superseded by Sprint Center, fell into disrepair and was sold to private developers. By 2018, the arena was being converted to a sports complex under the name Hy-Vee Arena. The Kauffman Performing Arts Center opened in 2011 providing a new, modern home to the KC Orchestra and Ballet. In 2015, an 800-room Hyatt Convention Center Hotel was announced for a site next to the Performance Arts Center &amp; Bartle Hall. Construction was scheduled to start in early 2018 with Loews as the operator.\nFrom 2007 to 2017, downtown residential population in Kansas City quadrupled and continues to grow. The area has grown from almost 4,000 residents in the early 2000s to nearly 30,000 as of 2017[ [update]]. Kansas City's downtown ranks as the sixth-fastest-growing downtown in America with the population expected to grow by more than 40% by 2022. Conversions of office buildings such as the Power &amp; Light Building and the Commerce Bank Tower into residential and hotel space has helped to fulfill the demand. New apartment complexes like One, Two, and Three Lights, River Market West, and 503 Main have begun to reshape Kansas City's skyline. Strong demand has led to occupancy rates in the upper 90%.\nThe residential population of downtown has boomed, and the office population has dropped significantly from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s. Top employers like AMC moved their operations to modern office buildings in the suburbs. High office vacancy plagued downtown, leading to the neglect of many office buildings. By the mid-2010s, many office buildings were converted to residential uses and the Class A vacancy rate plunged to 12% in 2017. Swiss Re, Virgin Mobile, AutoAlert, and others have begun to move operations to downtown Kansas City from the suburbs and expensive coastal cities.\nTransportation developments.\nThe area has seen additional development through various transportation projects, including improvements to the Grandview Triangle, which intersects Interstates 435 and 470, and U.S. Route 71.\nIn July 2005, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) launched Kansas City's first bus rapid transit line, the Metro Area Express (MAX), which links the River Market, downtown, Union Station, Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza. The KCATA continues to expand MAX with additional routes on Prospect Avenue, Troost Avenue, and Independence Avenue.\nIn 2013, construction began on a two-mile streetcar line in downtown Kansas City (funded by a $102 million ballot initiative that was passed in 2012) that runs between the River Market and Union Station, it began operation in May 2016. In 2017, voters approved the formation of a TDD to expand the streetcar line south 3.5 miles from Union Station to UMKC's Volker Campus. Additionally in 2017, the KC Port Authority began engineering studies for a Port Authority funded streetcar expansion north to Berkley Riverfront Park. Citywide, voter support for rail projects continues to grow with numerous light rail projects in the works.\nIn 2016, Jackson County, Missouri, acquired unused rail lines as part of a long-term commuter rail plan. For the time being, the line is being converted to a trail while county officials negotiate with railroads for access to tracks in downtown Kansas City.\nOn November 7, 2017, Kansas City voters overwhelmingly approved a new single terminal at Kansas City International Airport by a 75% to 25% margin. The new single terminal replaced the three existing \"Clover Leafs\" at KCI Airport on February 28, 2023.\nGeography.\nThe city has an area of , of which, is land and is water. Bluffs overlook the rivers and river bottom areas. Kansas City proper is bowl-shaped and is surrounded to the north and south by glacier-carved limestone and bedrock cliffs. Kansas City is at the confluence between the Dakota and Minnesota ice lobes during the maximum late Independence glaciation of the Pleistocene epoch. The Kansas and Missouri rivers cut wide valleys into the terrain when the glaciers melted and drained. A partially filled spillway valley crosses the central city. This valley is an eastward continuation of the Turkey Creek Valley. It is the closest major city to the geographic center of the contiguous United States, or \"Lower 48\".\nCityscape.\nKansas City comprises more than 240 neighborhoods, some with histories as independent cities or as the sites of major events.\nArchitecture.\nThe Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art opened its Euro-Style Bloch addition in 2007, and the Safdie-designed Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts opened in 2011. The Power and Light Building is influenced by the Art Deco style and sports a glowing sky beacon. The new world headquarters of H&amp;R Block is a 20-story all-glass oval bathed in a soft green light. The four industrial artworks atop the support towers of the Kansas City Convention Center (Bartle Hall) were once the subject of ridicule, but now define the night skyline near the T-Mobile Center along with One Kansas City Place (Missouri's tallest office tower), the KCTV-Tower (Missouri's tallest freestanding structure) and the Liberty Memorial, a World War I memorial and museum that flaunts simulated flames and smoke billowing into the night skyline. It was designated as the National World War I Museum and Memorial in 2004 by the United States Congress. Kansas City is home to significant national and international architecture firms including ACI Boland, BNIM, 360 Architecture, HNTB, Populous. Frank Lloyd Wright designed two private residences and Community Christian Church there.\nKansas City hosts more than 200 working fountains, especially on the Country Club Plaza. Designs range from French-inspired traditional to modern. Highlights include the Black Marble H&amp;R Block fountain in front of Union Station, which features synchronized water jets; the Nichols Bronze Horses at the corner of Main and J.C. Nichols Parkway at the entrance to the Plaza Shopping District; and the fountain at Hallmark Cards World Headquarters in Crown Center.\nCity Market.\nSince its inception in 1857, City Market has been one of the largest and most enduring public farmers' markets in the American Midwest, linking growers and small businesses to the community. More than 30 full-time merchants operate year-round and offer specialty foods, fresh meats and seafood, restaurants and cafes, floral, and home accessories. The City Market has the Arabia Steamboat Museum, which houses artifacts from a steamboat that sank near Kansas City in 1856.\nDowntown.\nDowntown Kansas City is bounded by the Missouri River to the north, 31st Street to the south, Troost Avenue to the east, and State Line Road to the west. Areas near Downtown Kansas City include the 39th Street District, which is known as Restaurant Row, and features one of Kansas City's largest selections of independently owned restaurants and boutique shops. It is a center of literary and visual arts, and bohemian culture. Crown Center is the headquarters of Hallmark Cards and a major downtown shopping and entertainment complex. It is connected to Union Station by a series of covered walkways. The Country Club Plaza, or \"the Plaza\", is an upscale, outdoor shopping, and entertainment district. It is the first suburban shopping district in the United States, designed to accommodate shoppers arriving by automobile, and is surrounded by apartments and condominiums, including several high rise buildings. The associated Country Club District to the south includes the Sunset Hill and Brookside neighborhoods, and is traversed by Ward Parkway, a landscaped boulevard known for its statuary, fountains, and large, historic homes. Union Station is home to Science City, restaurants, shopping, theaters, and the city's Amtrak facility.\nAfter years of neglect and seas of parking lots, Downtown Kansas City is undergoing a period of change with over $6 billion in development since 2000. Many residential properties recently have been or are under redevelopment in three surrounding warehouse loft districts and the Central Business District. The Power &amp; Light District, a new, nine-block entertainment district comprising numerous restaurants, bars, and retail shops, was developed by the Cordish Company of Baltimore, Maryland. Its first tenant opened on November 9, 2007. It is anchored by the T-Mobile Center, a 19,000-seat sports and entertainment complex.\nClimate.\nKansas City is in the Midwestern United States, near the geographic center of the country, at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas rivers. The city lies in either the humid continental zone when using the isotherm, or in the humid subtropical zone when using the isotherm. The city experiences roughly 104 air frosts on average per annum. The city is part of USDA plant hardiness zones 5b and 6a. In the center of North America, far removed from a significant body of water, there is significant potential for extreme hot and cold swings throughout the year. The warmest month is July, with a 24-hour average temperature of . The summer months are hot and humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico, and high temperatures surpass on 5.6 days of the year, and on 47 days. The coldest month of the year is January, with an average temperature of . Winters are cold, with 22 days where the high temperature is at or below and 2.5 nights with a low at or below . The official record highest temperature is , set on August 14, 1936, at Downtown Airport, while the official record lowest is , set on December 22 and 23, 1989. Normal seasonal snowfall is at Downtown Airport and at Kansas City International Airport. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 31 to April 4, while for measurable () snowfall, it is November 27 to March 16 as measured at Kansas City International Airport. Precipitation, both in frequency and total accumulation, shows a marked uptick in late spring and summer.\nKansas City is located in Tornado Alley, a broad region where cold air from Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms, especially during the spring. The Kansas City metropolitan area has experienced several significant outbreaks of tornadoes in the past, including the Ruskin Heights tornado in 1957 and the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence. The region can also experience ice storms during the winter, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands of residents lost power for days or weeks. Kansas City and its outlying areas are also subject to flooding, including the Great Floods of 1844, 1951, and 1993.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Latino/Hispanic population of Kansas City, which is heavily Mexican and Central American, is spread throughout the metropolitan area, with some concentration in the northeast part of the city and southwest of downtown. The Asian population, mostly Southeast Asian, is partly concentrated within the northeast side to the Columbus Park neighborhood in the Greater Downtown area, a historically Italian American neighborhood, the UMKC area and in River Market, in northern Kansas City.\nThe Historic Kansas City boundary is roughly and has a population density of about . It runs from the Missouri River to the north, 79th Street to the south, the Blue River to the east, and State Line Road to the west. During the 1960s and 1970s, Kansas City annexed large amounts of land, which are largely undeveloped.\nBetween the 2000 and 2010 census counts, the urban core of Kansas City continued to drop significantly in population. The areas of Greater Downtown in the center city, and sections near I-435 and I-470 in the south, and Highway 152 in the north are the only areas of Kansas City, Missouri, to have an increase in population, with the Northland population growing the most. Even so, the population of Kansas City as a whole from 2000 to 2010 increased by 4.1%.\nIn February 2022, the city had an estimated 3,000 homeless people.\nThe racial makeup (including Hispanics in the racial counts) was 55.30% (280,985) White alone, 26.10% (132,617) Black alone, 0.63% (3,221) Native American alone, 3.14% (15,966) Asian alone, 0.30% (1,501) Pacific Islander alone, 5.52% (28,063) other race alone, and 9.00% (45,737) Multiracial or Mixed Race.\nThe racial and ethnic makeup (where Hispanics are excluded from the racial counts and placed in their own category) was 52.80% (268,273) White alone (non-Hispanic), 25.78% (130,983) Black alone (non-Hispanic), 0.36% (1,854) Native Americans alone (non-Hispanic), 3.11% (15,793) Asian alone (non-Hispanic), 0.29% (1,456) Pacific Islander alone (non-Hispanic), 0.47% (2,366) other race alone (non-Hispanic), 5.20% (26,396) Multiracial or Mixed Race (non-Hispanic), and 12.00% (60,969) Hispanic or Latino.\nEconomy.\nThe federal government is the largest employer in the Kansas City metro area, with more than 146 agencies. Kansas City is one of ten regional office cities for the US government. The Internal Revenue Service maintains a large service center in Kansas City that occupies nearly . It is one of only two sites to process paper returns. The IRS has approximately 2,700 full-time employees in Kansas City, growing to 4,000 during tax season. The General Services Administration has more than 800 employees. Most are at the Bannister Federal Complex in South Kansas City. The Bannister Complex housed the Kansas City Plant, which is a National Nuclear Security Administration facility operated by Honeywell. The Kansas City Plant has since been moved to a new location on Botts Road. Honeywell employs nearly 2,700 at the Kansas City Plant, which produces and assembles 85% of the non-nuclear components of the United States nuclear bomb arsenal. The Social Security Administration has more than 1,700 employees in the metro, with more than 1,200 at its downtown Mid-America Program Service Center (MAMPSC).\nOne of the largest US drug manufacturing plants is the Sanofi-Aventis plant in south Kansas City on a campus developed by Ewing Kauffman's Marion Laboratories. It has been developing academic and economic institutions related to animal health sciences, with Manhattan, Kansas at one end of the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor, and Kansas City hosting the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility which researches animal diseases. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research engages in medical basic science research, working with Open University and University of Kansas Medical Center in a joint Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Biomedical Science (IGPBS).\nAgriculture companies include Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy co-op in the United States. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and The National Association of Basketball Coaches are based in Kansas City.\nThe Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank opened a new building in 2008 near Union Station. Missouri is the only state to have two of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank headquarters, with the second in St. Louis. Kansas City's effort to get the bank was helped by former mayor James A. Reed, who as senator, broke a tie to pass the Federal Reserve Act.\nThe national headquarters for the Veterans of Foreign Wars is located just south of Downtown.\nWith a Gross Metropolitan Product of $41.68 billion in 2004, Kansas City's (Missouri side only) economy makes up 20.5% of Missouri's gross state product.

Residents are Kansas Citians. It is officially nicknamed the City of Fountains. The fountains at Kauffman Stadium, commissioned by original Kansas City Royals owner Ewing Kauffman, are the largest privately funded fountains in the world. In 2018, UNESCO designated Kansas City its first and only City of Music in the US, in \"recognition of [Kansas City's] investment and commitment to music, arts, and creativity as a driver of urban economic development\". The city has more boulevards than any other city except Paris and has been called Paris of the Plains. Soccer's popularity, and Children's Mercy Park's popularity as a home stadium for the U.S. Men's National Team, led to the appellation Soccer Capital of America. The city is called the Heart of America, in proximity to the population center of the United States and the geographic center of the 48 contiguous states.\nPerforming arts.\nIn 1886, Kansas City had only two theaters when David Austin Latchaw, originally from rural Pennsylvania, moved there. Latchaw maintained friendly relations with several actors such as Otis Skinner, Richard Mansfield, Maude Adams, Margaret Anglin, John Drew, Minnie Maddern Fiske, Julia Marlowe, E. H. Sothern, and Robert Mantell.\nTheater troupes in the 1870s toured the state, performing in cities or small towns forming along the railroad lines. Rail transport had enhanced the theater troupe tour market, by allowing full costumes, props, and sets. As theater grew in popularity after the mid-1880s, that number increased and by 1912, ten new theaters had been built in Kansas City. By the 1920s, Kansas City was the center of the vaudevillian Orpheum circuit.\nThe Kansas City Repertory Theatre is the metro's top professional theatre company. The Starlight Theatre is an 8,105-seat outdoor theatre designed by Edward Delk. The Kansas City Symphony was founded by R. Crosby Kemper Jr. in 1982 to replace the defunct Kansas City Philharmonic, which was founded in 1933. The symphony performs at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. Matthias Pintscher is the symphony's music director and lead conductor. Lyric Opera of Kansas City, founded in 1958, performs at the Kauffman Center, offers one American contemporary opera production during its season, consisting of either four or five productions. The Civic Opera Theater of Kansas City performs at the downtown Folly Theater and at the UMKC Performing Arts Center.

Between 1986 and 2000, it combined with Dance St. Louis to form the State Ballet of Missouri, although it remained in Kansas City. From 1980 to 1995, the Ballet was run by dancer and choreographer Todd Bolender. The Ballet offers an annual repertory split into three seasons, performing classical to contemporary ballets. The Ballet also performs at the Kauffman Center. The Kansas City Chorale is a professional 24-voice chorus with an annual concert series and a concert in Phoenix each year with sister choir the Phoenix Chorale. The Chorale has made several recordings, including with the Phoenix Chorale.\nJazz.\nKansas City jazz in the 1930s marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. The 1979 documentary \"The Last of the Blue Devils\" portrays this era in interviews and performances by local jazz notables. In the 1970s, Kansas City attempted to resurrect the glory of the jazz era in a family-friendly atmosphere. In the 1970s, an effort to open jazz clubs in the River Quay area of City Market along the Missouri ended in a gang war. Three of the new clubs were blown up in what ultimately ended Kansas City mob influence in Las Vegas casinos. The annual Kansas City Blues and Jazz Festival attracts top jazz stars and large tourist audiences. In 2007 it was rated Kansas City's \"best festival\" by \"The Pitch\".\nLive music venues are throughout the city, with the highest concentration in the Westport entertainment district centered on Broadway and Westport Road near Country Club Plaza, and the 18th and Vine neighborhood's flourish for jazz music. A variety of music genres are performed or have originated there, including musicians Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Puddle of Mudd, Isaac James, The Get Up Kids, Shiner, Flee The Seen, The Life and Times, Reggie and the Full Effect, Coalesce, The Casket Lottery, The Gadjits, The Rainmakers, Vedera, The Elders, Blackpool Lights, The Republic Tigers, Tech N9ne, Krizz Kaliko, Kutt Calhoun, Skatterman &amp; Snug Brim, Mac Lethal, Ces Cru, and Sol\u00e8. Kansas City Jazz Orchestra is big band style.\nIn 2018, UNESCO named Kansas City a City of Music, as the only one in the United States. The designation is based on the city's rich musical heritage, and its $ budget for improving the 18th and Vine Jazz District in 2016.\nIrish culture.\nIn 2021, the US Census Bureau estimated 253,040 people of Irish descent in the metro, with 123,934 in Jackson, Clay, and Platte Counties. The Irish were the first large immigrant group to settle in Kansas City following the lead of Fr. Bernard Donnelly (c.\u20091800\u20131880) and founded its first newspaper. The Irish community includes bands, dancers, Irish stores, newspapers, and the Kansas City Irish Center at Drexel Hall in Midtown. The first book detailing Irish history in Kansas City is \"Missouri Irish: Irish Settlers on the American Frontier\", published in 1984. The Kansas City Irish Fest is held over Labor Day weekend in Crown Center and Washington Park.\nCasinos.\nMissouri voters approved riverboat casino gaming on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers by referendum with a 63% majority on November 3, 1992. The first casino facility in the state opened in September 1994 in North Kansas City by Harrah's Entertainment (now Caesar's Entertainment). The combined revenues for four casinos exceeded $153 million per month in May 2008. The metropolitan area is home to six casinos: Ameristar Kansas City, Argosy Kansas City, Harrah's North Kansas City, Isle of Capri Kansas City, the 7th Street Casino (which opened in Kansas City, Kansas, in 2008) and Hollywood Casino (which opened in February 2012 in Kansas City, Kansas).\nCuisine.\nKansas City is famous for its steak and Kansas City-style barbecue. During the heyday of the Kansas City Stockyards, the city was known for its Kansas City steaks or Kansas City strip steaks. The most famous of its steakhouses is the Golden Ox in the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange in the West Bottoms stockyards. These stockyards were second only to those of Chicago in size, but they never recovered from the Great Flood of 1951 and eventually closed. Jess &amp; Jim's Steakhouse was founded in 1938 in the Martin City neighborhood.\nThe Kansas City Strip cut of steak is similar to the New York Strip cut, and is sometimes referred to just as a strip steak. Along with Texas, Memphis, North Carolina, and South Carolina, Kansas City is lauded as a \"world capital of barbecue\". More than 90 barbecue restaurants operate in the metropolitan area. The American Royal each fall hosts what it claims is the world's biggest barbecue contest.\nClassic Kansas City-style barbecue was an inner-city phenomenon that evolved from the pit of Henry Perry, a migrant from Memphis who is generally credited with opening the city's first barbecue stand in 1921, and blossomed in the 18th and Vine neighborhood. Arthur Bryant's took over the Perry restaurant and added sugar to his sauce to sweeten the recipe a bit. In 1946 one of Perry's cooks, George W. Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for \"Playboy\" magazine in the 1960s. Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue is also well regarded. In 1977, Rich Davis, a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it KC Masterpiece, and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the Kingsford division of Clorox. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.\nKansas City has several James Beard Award-winning/nominated chefs and restaurants. Winning chefs include Michael Smith, Celina Tio, Colby Garrelts, Debbie Gold, Jonathan Justus and Martin Heuser. A majority of the Beard Award-winning restaurants are in the Crossroads district, downtown and in Westport.\nReligion.\n50.75% of Kansas City area residents have a known religious affiliation. The most common religious denominations in the area are:\nWalt Disney.\nIn 1911, Elias Disney moved his family from Marceline to Kansas City. They lived in a new home at 3028 Bellefontaine with a garage he built, in which Walt Disney made his first animation. In 1919, Walt returned from France where he had served as a Red Cross ambulance driver in World War I. He started the first animation company in Kansas City, Laugh-O-Gram Studio, in which he designed Mickey Mouse. When the company went bankrupt, Walt Disney moved to Hollywood and started The Walt Disney Company on October 16, 1923.\nSports.\nProfessional sports teams in Kansas City include the Kansas City Chiefs in the National Football League (NFL), the Kansas City Royals in Major League Baseball (MLB) and Sporting Kansas City in Major League Soccer (MLS).\nThe following table lists the professional teams in the Kansas City metropolitan area:\nProfessional football.\nThe Chiefs, now a member of the NFL's American Football Conference, started play in 1960 as the Dallas Texans of the American Football League before moving to Kansas City in 1963. The Chiefs lost Super Bowl I to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35\u201310. In 1969, the team became the last AFL champion and won Super Bowl IV. In 2020, they won Super Bowl LIV, in 2023, they won Super Bowl LVII, and in 2024 they won Super Bowl LVIII.\nProfessional baseball.\nThe Athletics baseball franchise played in the city from 1955, after moving from Philadelphia, to 1967, when the team relocated to Oakland, California. The city's current Major League Baseball franchise, the Royals, started play in 1969, and are the only major league sports franchise in Kansas City that has not relocated or changed its name. The Royals were the first American League expansion team to reach the playoffs (in 1976) to reach the World Series (in 1980) and to win the World Series (in 1985). The Royals returned to the World Series in 2014 and won in 2015.\nThe Kansas City Monarchs, formerly the Kansas City T-Bones, is an unaffiliated minor league team. It played in the independent Northern League from 2003 until 2010 and has been part of the independent American Association since 2011. Its home is Legends Field in Kansas City, Kansas.\nProfessional soccer.\nThe Kansas City Wiz became a charter member of Major League Soccer in 1996. It was renamed the Kansas City Wizards in 1997. In 2011, the team was renamed Sporting Kansas City and moved to its new stadium Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kansas. It won the MLS Cup twice, the Supporters' Shield once, and the US Open Cup four times.\nFC Kansas City played from 2013 to 2017 in the National Women's Soccer League; the team's home games were held at Swope Soccer Village. They won the NWSL in 2014 and 2015. The team folded after the 2017 season and its assets were transferred to Utah Royals FC. After the 2020 season, the Utah Royals folded and its assets were transferred to a new Kansas City team, now known as the Kansas City Current. The Current moved to Children's Mercy Park after spending their first season at Legends Field, where they were known as KC NWSL. On October 6, 2022, the team's ownership broke ground on an 11,500-seat soccer-specific stadium called CPKC Stadium on the Berkley Riverfront Park, which opened by March 2024.\nKansas City was selected on June 16, 2022, as one of the eleven US host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\nCollege athletics.\nIn college athletics, Kansas City has been the home of the Big 12 College Basketball Tournaments. The men's tournament has been played at T-Mobile Center since March 2008. The women's tournament is played at Municipal Auditorium.\nThe city has one NCAA Division I program, the Kansas City Roos, representing the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City (UMKC). The program, historically known as the UMKC Kangaroos, adopted its current branding after the 2018\u201319 school year.\nIn addition to serving as the home stadium of the Chiefs, Arrowhead Stadium serves as the venue for various intercollegiate football games. It has hosted the Big 12 Championship Game five times. On the last weekend in October, the MIAA Fall Classic rivalry game between Northwest Missouri State University and Pittsburg State University took place at the stadium.\nRugby.\nKansas City is represented on the rugby pitch by the Kansas City Blues RFC, a former member of the Rugby Super League and a Division 1 club. The team works closely with Sporting Kansas City and splits home-games between Sporting's training pitch and Rockhurst University's stadium.\nFormer teams.\nKansas City briefly had four short-term major league baseball teams between 1884 and 1915: the Kansas City Unions of the short-lived Union Association in 1884, the Kansas City Cowboys in the National League in 1886, a team of the same name in the then-major league American Association in 1888 and 1889, and the Kansas City Packers in the Federal League in 1914 and 1915. The Kansas City Monarchs of the now-defunct Negro National and Negro American Leagues represented Kansas City from 1920 through 1955. The city also had a number of minor league baseball teams between 1885 and 1955. After the Kansas City Cowboys began play in the 1885 Western League, from 1903 through 1954, the Kansas City Blues played in the high-level American Association minor league. In 1955, Kansas City became a major league city when the Philadelphia Athletics baseball franchise relocated to the city in 1955. Following the 1967 season, the team relocated to Oakland, California.\nKansas City was represented in the National Basketball Association by the Kansas City Kings (called the Kansas City-Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975), when the former Cincinnati Royals moved to the Midwest in 1972. The team left for Sacramento in 1985.\nIn 1974, the National Hockey League placed an expansion team in Kansas City called the Kansas City Scouts. The team moved to Denver in 1976, then to New Jersey in 1982 where they have remained ever since as the New Jersey Devils.\nParks and boulevards.\nKansas City has of boulevards and parkways, 214 urban parks, 49 ornamental fountains, 152 baseball diamonds, 10 community centers, 105 tennis courts, 5 golf courses, 5 museums and attractions, 30 pools, and 47 park shelters. These amenities are found across the city. Much of the system, designed by George E. Kessler, was constructed from 1893 to 1915.\nCliff Drive, in Kessler Park on the North Bluffs, is a designated State Scenic Byway. It extends from The Paseo and Independence Avenue through Indian Mound on Gladstone Boulevard at Belmont Boulevard, with many historical points and architectural landmarks.\nWard Parkway, on the west side of the city near State Line Road, is lined by many of the city's largest and most elaborate homes.\nThe Paseo is a major north\u2013south parkway that runs through the center of the city beginning at Cliff Drive. It was modeled on the \"Paseo de la Reforma\", a fashionable Mexico City boulevard. It has been recently renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and now the city has voted to change it back to the Paseo.\nSwope Park is one of the nation's largest city parks, comprising , more than twice the size of New York City's Central Park. It features a zoo, a woodland nature and wildlife rescue center, 2 golf courses, 2 lakes, an amphitheatre, a day-camp, and numerous picnic grounds. Hodge Park, in the Northland, covers (1.61 sq. mi). This park includes the Shoal Creek Living History Museum, a village of more than 20 historical buildings dating from 1807 to 1885. Berkley Riverfront Park, on the banks of the Missouri River on the north edge of downtown, holds annual Independence Day celebrations and other festivals.\nA program went underway to replace many of the fast-growing sweetgum trees with hardwood varieties.\nCivil Engineering Landmark.\nIn 1974, the Kansas City Park and Boulevard System was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The nomination noted that this park system was among \"...the first to integrate the aesthetics of landscape architecture with the practicality of city planning, stimulating other metropolitan areas to undertake similar projects.\" The park's plan developed by landscape architect George Kessler included some of the \"...first specifications for pavements, gutters, curbs, and walks. Other engineering advances included retaining walls, earth dams, subsurface drains, and an impoundment lake \u2013 all part of Kansas City's legacy that has influenced urban planning in cities throughout North America.\"\nLaw and government.\nCity government.\nKansas City is home to the largest municipal government in the state of Missouri. The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of city manager has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days.\nThe mayor is the head of the Kansas City City Council, which has 12 members elected from six districts (one member elected by voters in the district and one at-large member elected by voters citywide). The mayor is the presiding member. By charter, Kansas City has a \"weak-mayor\" system, in which most of the power is formally vested in the city council. However, in practice, the mayor is very influential in drafting and guiding public policy.\nKansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd-numbered year. The last citywide election was held in April 2023. The officials took office in August 2023 and will hold the position until 2027.\nPendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was Harry S. Truman, who became a Senator, Vice President and then President of the United States from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, one of two federal district courts in Missouri. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals, one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in Springfield).\nThe Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:\nNational political conventions.\nKansas City hosted the 1900 Democratic National Convention, the 1928 Republican National Convention and the 1976 Republican National Convention. The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.\nFederal representation.\nKansas City is represented by three members of the United States House of Representatives:\nCrime.\nSome of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City was during the American Civil War. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called Bleeding Kansas erupted, affecting border ruffians and Jayhawkers. During the war, Union troops burned all occupied dwellings in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the \"Kansas City Times\" turned outlaw Jesse James into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at Kearney, Missouri, and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.\nIn the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". Though this gave rise to Kansas City jazz and to the Kansas City mob (initially under Johnny Lazia), and the arrival of organized crime. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the River Quay entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss Nick Civella was recorded discussing gambling bets on Super Bowl IV (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the Stardust Casino, which was the basis for the 1995 film \"Casino\", though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections.\nAs of November 2012[ [update]], Kansas City ranked 18th on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000. Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side. Revitalizing the downtown and midtown areas has been fairly successful and now these areas have below average violent crime compared to other major downtowns. According to a 2007 analysis by \"The Kansas City Star\" and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, downtown experienced the largest drop in crime of any neighborhood in the city during the 2000s.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nMany universities, colleges, and seminaries are in the Kansas City metropolitan area, including:\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nThe city is not served by one unified school district, but 15 separate districts due to the historical unwillingness of suburban voters to merge their existing school districts with the Kansas City district as the city expanded its limits in the 1950s and 1960s. Prior to 1957, areas annexed by the City of Kansas City were obligated to join the KCMO school district. Briana O'Higgins of KCUR wrote that prior to Brown v. Board of Education community members of smaller school districts \"were happy to join KCMSD\", which at the time was racially segregated. After laws changed in 1957, expansion occurred in areas not in the KCMO school district, and the KCMO school district faced a decline in academics and facility quality.\nSchool outcomes vary between and even within districts, with a some high schools being nationally ranked, and others having some of the lowest graduation rates. There are also numerous private schools; Catholic schools are governed by the Diocese of Kansas City.\nThe following public school districts serve Kansas City:\nIn the Jackson County portion of the city:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the Cass County portion:\nIn the Clay County portion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the Platte County portion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMedia.\nPrint media.\n\"The Kansas City Star\" is the area's primary newspaper. William Rockhill Nelson and his partner, Samuel Morss, first published the evening paper on September 18, 1880. The \"Star\" competed with the morning \"Kansas City Times\" before acquiring that publication in 1901. The \"Times\" name was discontinued in March 1990, when the morning paper was renamed the \"Star\".\nWeekly newspapers include \"The Call\" (which is focused toward Kansas City's African-American community), the \"Kansas City Business Journal\", \"The Pitch\", \"Ink\", and the bilingual publications \"Dos Mundos\" and \"KC Hispanic News\".\nPublications include \"Ingram's Magazine\" and a local society journal, the \"Independent\".\nThe city is served by two major faith-oriented newspapers: The \"Kansas City Metro Voice\", serving the Christian community, and the \"Kansas City Jewish Chronicle\", serving the Jewish community. It is the headquarters of the \"National Catholic Reporter\", an independent Catholic newspaper.\nBroadcast media.\nThe Kansas City media market (ranked 32nd by Arbitron and 31st by Nielsen) includes 10 television stations, 30 FM and 21 AM radio stations. Kansas City broadcasting jobs have been a stepping stone for national television and radio personalities, notably Walter Cronkite and Mancow Muller.\nWDAF radio (now at 106.5 FM; original 610 AM frequency now occupied by KFNZ) signed on in 1927 as an affiliate of the NBC Red Network, under the ownership of \"The Star.\" In 1949, the \"Star\" signed on WDAF-TV as an affiliate of the NBC television network. The \"Star\" sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an antitrust investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the \"Star\") over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations. KCMO radio (originally at 810 AM, now at 710 AM) signed on KCMO-TV (now KCTV) in 1953. The respective owners of WHB (then at 710 AM, now at 810 AM) and KMBC radio (980 AM, now KMBZ), Cook Paint and Varnish Company and the Midland Broadcasting Company, signed on WHB-TV/KMBC-TV as a time-share arrangement on VHF channel 9 in 1953; KMBC-TV took over channel 9 full-time in June 1954, after Cook Paint and Varnish purchased Midland Broadcasting's stations.\nThe major broadcast television networks have affiliates in the Kansas City market (covering 32 counties in northwestern Missouri, with the exception of counties in the far northwestern part of the state that are within the adjacent Saint Joseph market, and northeastern Kansas); including WDAF-TV 4 (Fox), KCTV 5 (CBS), KMBC-TV 9 (ABC), KCPT 19 (PBS), KCWE 29 (The CW), KSHB-TV 41 (NBC) and KSMO-TV 62 (MyNetworkTV). Other television stations in the market include Saint Joseph-based KTAJ-TV 16 (TBN), Kansas City, Kansas-based TV25.tv (consisting of three locally owned stations throughout northeast Kansas, led by KCKS-LD 25, affiliated with several digital multicast networks), Lawrence, Kansas-based KMCI-TV 38 (independent), Spanish-language station KUKC-LD 20 (Univision), Spanish-language station KGKC-LD 39 (Telemundo), and KPXE-TV 50 (Ion Television). The Kansas City television stations also serve as alternates for the nearby Saint Joseph television market.\nFilm community.\nKansas City has been a locale for film and television productions. Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the Calvin Company, a large film production company that specialized in promotional shorts for corporations and in educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to Hollywood careers and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native Robert Altman directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, \"The Delinquents\", in Kansas City using many local players.\nThe 1983 television movie \"The Day After\" was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1995 film \"Truman\", starring Gary Sinise, was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include \"Article 99\", \"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge\", \"Kansas City\", \"Paper Moon\", \"In Cold Blood\", \"Ninth Street\", and \"Sometimes They Come Back\" (in and around nearby Liberty, Missouri). More recently, a scene in the controversial film \"Br\u00fcno\" was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.\nToday, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The Independent Filmmaker's Coalition is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level. Kansas City was named as a top city to live and work in as a movie maker in 2020.\nTransportation.\nOriginally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California trails. Later, with the construction of the Hannibal Bridge across the Missouri River, it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city. Trans World Airlines (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub.\nHighways.\nMissouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with Interstate 70. Interstate 435, which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the Interstate Highway System. (Interstate 275 around Cincinnati, Ohio is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited-access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. From 2013 to 2017 the average commuting time was 21.8 minutes. The Sierra Club blames the extensive freeway network for excessive sprawl and the decline of central Kansas City. However, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest logistics hubs.\nInterstate highways.\nKansas City has a confluence of major U.S. interstate highways: I-29, I-35, I-49, I-70, I-435, I-470, I-635, and I-670.\nUS highways.\nKansas City includes these US highways: US 24, US 40, US 50, US 56, US 69, US 71, and US 169.\nMissouri state highways.\nState routes are Route 1, Route 9, Route 12, Route 45, Route 78, Route 92, Route 150, Route 152, Route 210, Route 269, Route 283, Route 291, and Route 350. Missouri supplemental routes are Route AA, Route D, Route K, Route V, and Route W.\nOther routes.\nOther routes include the Chicago\u2013Kansas City Expressway and the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.\nAirports.\nKansas City International Airport (airport code MCI) was built to TWA's specifications to make a world hub. Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates from the street. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, it required a costly overhaul to conform to tighter security protocols from the Transportation Security Administration. In March 2023, a new $1.5 billion terminal opened on the site of the old Terminal A. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, it is a single, advanced technology terminal with 39 gates, eventually planned to entirely replace remaining Terminals B and C.\nCharles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (airport code MKC) was TWA's original headquarters and houses the Airline History Museum. It is used for general aviation and airshows.\nPublic transportation.\nLike most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.\nAmtrak currently operates two routes via Kansas City, the \"Southwest Chief\" to Chicago or Los Angeles, and the \"Missouri River Runner\" to St. Louis.\nKCATA RideKC.\nOn December 28, 1965, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning, and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.\nRideKC Bus and MAX.\nIn July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first bus rapid transit line, the Metro Area Express (MAX). MAX links River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center, and Country Club Plaza. MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable \"stations\". MAX features (real-time GPS tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue. The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.\nThe Prospect MAX line launched in 2019 and Mayor Quinton Lucas announced the service would be fare-free indefinitely.\nRideKC Streetcar.\nOn December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $, , modern KC Streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters. The streetcar route runs along Main Street from River Market to Union Station; it debuted on May 6, 2016. A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees \u2013 the Kansas City Streetcar Authority \u2013 operates and maintains the system. Unlike many similar systems around the U.S., no fare is to be charged initially. Residents within the proposed Transportation Development District are determining the fate of the KC Streetcar's southern extension through Midtown and the Plaza to UMKC. The Port Authority of Kansas City is also studying running an extension to Berkley Riverfront Park.\nRideKC Bridj.\nIn 2015, the KCATA, Unified Government Transit, Johnson County Transit, and IndeBus began merging from individual metro services into one coordinated transit service for the metropolitan area, called RideKC. The buses and other transit options are branded as RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016, much like a taxicab service and with a mobile app. The merger and full coordination is expected to be complete by 2019.\nIntercity transit.\nIntercity bus services to Kansas City are provided by Greyhound Lines and Jefferson Lines at the Kansas City Bus Station. Amtrak also serves the city at Union Station via the Southwest Chief and Missouri River Runner.\nWalkability.\nA 2015 study by Walk Score ranked Kansas City as the 42nd most walkable out of the 50 largest U.S. cities. As a whole, the city has a score of 34 out of 100. However, several of the more densely populated neighborhoods have much higher scores: Westport has a score of 91, the Downtown Loop has a score of 85, the Crossroads scored 85, and the Plaza scored 83. Those ratings range from \"A Walker's Paradise\" to \"Very Walkable\". In April 2017, voters approved an $800 million general obligation bond, part of which is designated for sidewalk repairs and creating complete-streets.\nModal characteristics.\nAccording to the American Community Survey, 81.6 percent of working Kansas City residents commuted to work by driving alone, 7.9 percent carpooled, 2.7 percent used public transportation, and 1.7 percent walked to work. About 1.5 percent commuted by other means, including taxi, bicycle, or motorcycle.

Also known as Debr\u00e9\u2013Semelaigne syndrome or cretinism-muscular hypertrophy, hypothyroid myopathy, hypothyroidism-large muscle syndrome, hypothyreotic muscular hypertrophy in children, infantile myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy, myopathy-myxoedema syndrome, myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy syndrome, myxoedema-myotonic dystrophy syndrome.\nThe adult-onset form of this syndrome is Hoffmann syndrome. Some sources claim that two of the differentiating symptoms between KDSS and Hoffmann syndrome is that Hoffmann syndrome lacks painful spasms and pseudomyotonia; however, this claim is in conflict with other sources that list these symptoms as also being present in Hoffmann syndrome.\nPresentation.\nThe age at which a child presents with KDSS may vary from new born to as late as 11 years of age. This disease is very rare as only less than 10% of children with hypothyroid myopathy develops this condition. Along with features of hypothyroidism (such as lethargy, slow heart rate, cold intolerance, dry skin, and hoarse voice) the main additional feature is muscle hypertrophy. It can happen in any muscle of the limbs, but commonly affects the calf muscles, giving the typical Herculean appearance.\nOther features are pseudomyotonia, myokymia, slow tendon reflex, slowed muscle contractions and relaxations, muscle stiffness, proximal muscle weakness and myopathy. The severity of these symptoms are determined by the period of hypothyroidism and the degree of deficiency of thyroid hormones. It may also include macroglossia.\nEMG is either normal or may show myopathic low amplitude and short duration motor unit action potentials (MUAPS). The enzymes creatine kinase is elevated usually.\nPathophysiology.\nThe assumed cause of muscle hypertrophy in KDSS is an abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates leading to increased glycogen accumulation and increased mucopolysaccharide deposits in the muscles. Yet another speculation is an excess intra cellular calcium due to ineffective reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which causes a sustained contraction and thereby hypertrophy.\nIn hypothyroidism the fast twitch muscle fiber is converted to slow twitch fiber, causing the slower reflex or hung up reflex. This may occur as a result of reduction in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and beta-adrenergic receptors, as well as the induction of an insulin-resistant state, due to decrease in thyroid hormones.\nThe causes for muscle weakness is said to be decrease in muscle carnitine, decreased muscle oxidation, expression of a slower ATPase in myosin chain and decreased transport across the cell membrane.\nThe rigidity associated with congenital hypothyroidism may be due to abnormal development of basal ganglia.\nDifferential diagnoses.\nDiseases known to have a pseudoathletic appearance of the calves (hypertrophy or pseudohypertrophy), including exercise intolerance and/or muscle weakness:\nThyroid metabolism can be disrupted secondary to a primary disease. A common comorbidity of the metabolic myopathy McArdle disease (Glycogen storage disease type V) is hypothyroidism. It is also a comorbidity of late-onset Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease type II). As both hyper- and hypothyroidism disrupts muscle glycogen metabolism, it is important to keep in mind differential diagnoses and their comorbidities when trying to determine whether signs and symptoms are either primary or secondary disease.\nTreatment.\nThe muscle hypertrophy and other symptoms are reversible on treatment with levothyroxine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are many varieties of ornamental koi, originating from breeding that began in Niigata, Japan, in the early 19th century. \nSeveral varieties are recognized by Japanese breeders and owners, distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, brown and cream, besides metallic shades like gold and silver-white ('platinum') scales. The most popular category of koi is the \"Gosanke\", which is made up of the \"K\u014dhaku\", \"Taish\u014d Sanshoku\" and \"Sh\u014dwa Sanshoku\" varieties.\nHistory.\nCarp are a large group of fish species originally native to Central Europe and Asia. Various carp species were originally domesticated in China, where they were used primarily for consumption. Carp are coldwater fish, and their ability to survive and adapt to many climates and water conditions allowed the domesticated species to be propagated to many new locations, including Japan.\nPrehistory.\nIn Japan, Miocene fossils of the carp family (\"Cyprinidae\") have been excavated from Iki Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. Furthermore, numerous carp pharyngeal teeth have been excavated from Jomon and Yayoi period sites. For example, pharyngeal teeth of the extinct species \"J\u014dmon Koi\" (\"Cyprinus sp.\") in addition to the modern species of carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\" or \"Cyprinus rubrofuscus\") have been excavated from the Akanoi Bay lakebed site () in Lake Biwa at the end of the Early Jomon Period (11,500 \u2013 7,000 years ago). In addition, pharyngeal teeth of all six subfamilies of the Cyprinidae family living in Japan today, including carp (Cyprinus), have been found at the Awazu lakebed site () dating from the Middle Jomon Period (5500 \u2013 4400 years ago).\nThere are differences in the length distribution of carp excavated from Jomon and Yayoi sites, as estimated from the size of their pharyngeal teeth. Specifically, not only adult carp but also juvenile carp (less than 150 mm in length) have been found at the Yayoi site. This difference is thought to be because the Jomon only collected carp from lakes and rivers, while the Yayoi cultivated primitive carp along with the spread of rice paddies.\nIt was previously thought that all Japanese carp were introduced from China in prehistoric times. However, recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed a significant evolutionary divergence (phylogenetic split) within common carp Cyprinus carpio between the native wild form found in Lake Biwa and the Eurasian wild form, along with domesticated varieties. This supports the idea of the ancient origin of the native Japanese form (Cyprinus sp.), as well as the East Asian ancient lineage of wild common carp (C. carpio), previously proposed on the basis of fossil data. However, it is unknown when the carp from the continent was introduced to Japan. In addition, a possible multiple origin of koi carp was indicated by the polyphyletic distribution of five mtDNA haplotypes of koi carp within the 'Eurasian' clade. Moreover, the oldest record of the introduction of non-native fish in Japan is that of goldfish from China (1502 or 1602), and there is no record of carp (including colored carp) until the introduction of the mirror carp, called \"Doitsugoi\" (German carp), in 1904.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn the Japanese history book \"Nihon Shoki\" (Chronicles of Japan, 720), it is written that Emperor Keik\u014d released carp in a pond for viewing when he visited Mino Province (present Gifu Prefecture) in the fourth year of his reign (74 CE). In Cui Bao's \"G\u01d4j\u012bnzh\u00f9\" (, Annotations on the Ancient and Modern Period) from the Western Jin Dynasty (4th century CE) in China, carp of the following colors are described: red horse (), blue horse (), black horse (), white horse (), and yellow pheasant (). In China in those days, carp were called horses because they were believed to be the vehicles of hermits and to run in the sky.\nJapan's oldest drug dictionary, Fukane Sukehito's \"\" (, 918) mentions red carp (), blue carp (), black carp (), white carp (), and yellow carp () as Japanese names corresponding to the above Chinese names, suggesting that carp of these colors existed in China and Japan in those days. In addition, Hitomi Hitsudai's drug dictionary \"Honch\u014d Shokkan\" (, Japanese Medicine Encyclopedia, 1697) states that red, yellow, and white carp of the three colors were in Japan at that time.\nHowever, it is believed that these single-colored carp were not a variety created by artificial selection, as is the case with today's koi, but rather a mutation-induced color change. In ancient times, carp was farmed primarily for food. Mutational color variation in carp is relatively common in nature, but is not suitable for development alongside farming for food in poor rural communities; color inheritance is unstable and selection to maintain color variation is costly. For example, in current-day farming of koi as ornamental fish, the percentage of superior colored fish to the number of spawn is less than 1%.\nThe Amur carp (\"Cyprinus rubrofuscus\") is a member of the cyprinid family species complex native to East Asia. Amur carp were previously identified as a subspecies of the common carp (as \"C. c. haematopterus\"), but recent authorities treat it as a separate species under the name \"C. rubrofuscus\". Amur carp have been aquacultured as a food fish at least as long ago as the fifth century BCE in China.\nModern period.\nThe systematic breeding of ornamental Amur carp began in the 1820s in an area known as \"Nij\u016bmurag\u014d\" (, lit.\u2009'twenty villages') which spans Ojiya and Yamakoshi in Niigata Prefecture (located on the northeastern coast of Honshu) in Japan. In Niigata Prefecture, Amur carp were farmed for food in Musubu Shinden, Kanbara County (present Akiba Ward, Niigata City) from the end of the Genna era (1615\u20131624). In the Nij\u016bmurag\u014d area, carp were also farmed in terraced ponds near terraced rice paddies by 1781 at the latest, but the ponds ran dry due to a severe drought that occurred around that time, and the carp escaped the disaster by taking refuge in ponds on the grounds of Senryu Shrine in and Juni Shrine in .\nDuring the Bunka and Bunsei eras (1804\u20131830), people in the Nij\u016bmurag\u014d area bred red and white koi in addition to black koi, and crossed them to produce red and white colored koi. After that, they further crossed them and perfected them.\nAround 1875, colored koi became popular and the number of breeders increased, and some expensive koi were produced, but Niigata Prefecture banned the aquaculture of ornamental koi because it was considered a speculative business, and the business suffered a major blow for a time. However, the ban was lifted soon after, thanks to the petition of the villagers. At that time, colored koi included \"K\u014dhaku\", \"Asagi\", \"Ki Utsuri\", etc. From this original handful of koi varieties, all other Nishikigoi varieties were bred, with the exception of the Ogon variety (single-colored, metallic koi), which was developed relatively recently.\nKoi breeding flourished in the Nij\u016bmurag\u014d area for two reasons: 1) the custom of raising koi in fallow fields for emergency food during the winter, and 2) the existence of many \"inden\" (), or hidden rice fields in the mountains, unknown to the lord, which allowed the farmers to avoid taxes and become relatively wealthy. Breeding of koi was promoted as a hobby of farmers who could afford it, and high-quality individuals came to be bought and sold.\nThe name \"Nishikigoi\" (brocaded carp) did not exist until the 1910s. Before that time, \"Nishikigoi\" were called \"Madaragoi\" (, lit.\u2009'spotted carp'), \"Kawarigoi\" (, lit.\u2009'variant carp'), \"Irogoi\" (, lit.\u2009'colored carp'), \"Moy\u014dgoi\" (, lit.\u2009'patterned carp'), and so on.\nA geographical book on Suruga Province (present-day Shizuoka Prefecture), Abe Masanobu's \"Sunkoku Zasshi\" (1843), mentions that in addition to Asagi, purple, red, and white carp, there are \"spotted carp (also known as Bekko carp).\" This probably refers to two- or three-colored carp caused by mutation, and is a valuable record of \"Nishikigoi\" of the Edo period (1603 \u2013 1868).\nIn 1900, there was a three-colored carp in Ritsurin Garden in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture, and the price was over 1,000 yen per fish, which was a high price for that time. The three-colored carp had a red belly and \"asagi\" (light blue) back with black spots, and is thought to have been a mutation similar to today's \"Asagi\" koi.\nThe magazine \"Shonen\" (1910) introduced \"Nishikigoi\" under the name of \"Madaragoi\" (spotted carp) or \"Kawarigoi\" (variant carp), and said that even skilled fish breeders did not know how they could produce \"Nishikigoi\", but only waited for them to be produced by chance. The price of \"Nishikigoi\" at a fish show in Fukagawa, Tokyo, was 100 to 150 yen per fish, which was \"extremely expensive\" at the time. Therefore, even at that time, mutant \"Nishikigoi\" were known to some fish breeders and hobbyists in Tokyo, but artificial breeds such as Nij\u016bmurag\u014d's \"Nishikigoi\" were still unknown to the general public.\nIn 1914, when the was held, the \"Koi Exhibit Association\" was formed mainly by koi breeders in Higashiyama and Takezawa villages, and koi were exhibited. At the time, they were still called \"colored carp\" or \"patterned carp,\" and they were described as \"the first of their kind ever seen in the Tokyo area.\" And the koi received much attention, winning a silver medal. After the exposition closed, they presented eight koi to the Crown Prince (Emperor Showa). This exhibition triggered an expansion of sales channels, and the market value of koi soared.\nIn 1917, the \"Taish\u014d Sanshoku\" (by Eizaburo Hoshino) was fixed as a breed. The name \"Nishikigoi\" is said to have been given by Kei Abe, who was the chief fisheries officer of the Niigata Prefectural Government in the Taisho era (1912\u20131926), after he admired the \"Taish\u014d Sanshoku\" when he first saw it. In 1917, the fixation of \"K\u014dhaku\" (by Kunizo Hiroi), which had first been produced in the 1880s, was also assured.\nApart from the koi of Niigata Prefecture's Nij\u016bmurag\u014d area, there is a variety called \"Sh\u016bsui\" (), which was created by Tokyo-based goldfish breeder Kichigoro Akiyama in 1906 by crossing a female leather carp imported from Germany with a male Japanese \"Asagi\" or spotted carp. The leather carp is a low scaled variety bred in 1782 in Austria, and was sent to Japan from Munich, Germany in 1904, along with the mirror carp, which also has few scales. In Japan, these two varieties are called \"Doitsugoi\" (German carp), and \"Sh\u016bsui\" and its lineage are also called \"Doitsu\" or \"Doitsugoi\" in koi.\nIn 1927, \"Sh\u014dwa Sanshoku\" (by Shigekichi Hoshino) was fixed as a breed, and in 1939, koi were exhibited at the Japanese pavilion at the Golden Gate International Exposition held in San Francisco.\nToday.\nThe hobby of keeping koi eventually spread worldwide. They are sold in many pet aquarium shops, with higher-quality fish available from specialist dealers. Collecting koi has become a social hobby. Passionate hobbyists join clubs, share their knowledge and help each other with their koi. In particular, since the 21st century, some wealthy Chinese have imported large quantities of koi from Niigata in Japan, and the price of high-quality carp has soared. In 2018, one carp was bought by a Chinese collector for about $2 million, the highest price ever. There are also cases in which purchased carp are bred in China and sold to foreign countries, and many breeds are spreading all over the world.\nEtymology.\nThe words \"koi\" and \"nishikigoi\" come from the Japanese words \u9bc9 (carp), and \u9326\u9bc9 (brocaded carp), respectively. In Japanese, \"koi\" is a homophone for \u604b, another word that means \"affection\" or \"love\", so koi are symbols of love and friendship in Japan.\nColored ornamental carp were originally called \"Irokoi\" (\u8272\u9bc9) meaning colored carp, \"Hanakoi\" (\u82b1\u9bc9) meaning floral carp, and \"Moy\u014dkoi\" (\u6a21\u69d8\u9bc9) meaning patterned carp. There are various theories as to how these words came to be disused, in favor of \"Nishikigoi\" (\u9326\u9bc9), which is used today. One theory holds that, during World War II, the words \"Irokoi\" and \"Hanakoi\" (which can have sexual meanings) were changed to \"Nishikigoi\" because they were not suitable for the social situation of war. Another theory is that\" Nishikigoi\", which was the original name for the popular Taish\u014d Sanshoku variety, gradually became the term used for all ornamental koi.\nTaxonomy.\nThe koi are a group of breeds produced by artificial selection primarily from black carp called \"\" (, lit.\u2009'wild carp') or \"magoi\" (, lit.\u2009'true carp'), which inhabit lakes, ponds, and rivers in Japan. The black carp refers to the Eurasian carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\"), which was previously thought to have been introduced to Japan from Eurasia in prehistoric times.\nPhilipp Franz von Siebold of the Netherlands, who stayed in Japan during the Edo period, reported in \"Fauna Japonica\" (1833\u20131850) that there were three species of carp in Japan: \"Cyprinus haematopterus\", \"Cyprinus melanotus\", and \"Cyprinus conirostris\". This classification has not received much attention until recently, and it was thought that only one species of carp existed in Japan. However, recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA has revealed that there are at least two species of carp in Japan: native carp and carp from Eurasia. Currently, the Japanese native carp is assumed to be \"Cyprinus melanotus\", and a new scientific name for it is being considered.\n\"Cyprinus haematopterus\" is thought to refer to the Amur carp of Eurasian origin, traditionally called \"Yamatogoi\" (, lit.\u2009'carp of Yamato Province') in Japan. \"Yamatogoi\" have been famous since the Edo period as farmed carp in Yamato Province (now Nara Prefecture). Other carp of the same type as \"Yamatogoi\" are known as \"Yodogoi\" (, Yodo River carp) from Osaka and \"Shinsh\u016bgoi\" (, introduced \"Yodogoi\") from Nagano Prefecture. These carp were famous for their delicious taste. Since the Meiji period, \"Yamatogoi\" have been released into lakes and rivers throughout Japan, causing genetic contamination with native carp and making research on the origin of the Japanese carp difficult. Koi is thought to be primarily of this \"Yamatogoi\" (Amur carp) lineage, but it also carries some genes of the native Japanese carp.\nIn the past, koi were commonly believed to have been bred from the common carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\"). Extensive hybridization between different populations, coupled with widespread translocations, has muddled the historical zoogeography of the common carp and its relatives. Traditionally, Amur carp (\"C. rubrofuscus\") were considered a subspecies of the common carp, often under the scientific name \"C. carpio haematopterus\". However, they differ in meristics from the common carp of Europe and Western Asia, leading recent authorities to recognize them as a separate species, \"C. rubrofuscus\" (\"C. c. haematopterus\" being a junior synonym). Although one study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was unable to find a clear genetic structure matching the geographic populations (possibly because of translocation of carp from separate regions), others based on mtDNA, microsatellite DNA and genomic DNA found a clear separation between the European/West Asian population and the East Asian population, with koi belonging in the latter. Consequently, recent authorities have suggested that the ancestral species of the koi is \"C. rubrofuscus\" (syn. \"C. c. haematopterus\") or at least an East Asian carp species instead of \"C. carpio\". Regardless, a taxonomic review of \"Cyprinus\" carp from eastern and southeastern Asia may be necessary, as the genetic variations do not fully match the currently recognized species pattern, with one study of mtDNA suggesting that koi are close to the Southeast Asian carp, but not necessarily the Chinese.\nVarieties.\nAccording to \"Zen Nippon Airinkai\", a group that leads the breeding and dissemination of koi in Japan, there are more than 100 varieties of koi created through breeding, and each variety is classified into 16 groups. Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, yellow, blue, and cream. Metallic shades of gold and platinum in the scales have also been developed through selective breeding. Although the possible colors are virtually limitless, breeders have identified and named a number of specific categories. The most notable category is , which is made up of the \"K\u014dhaku\", \"Taish\u014d Sanshoku\", and \"Sh\u014dwa Sanshoku\" varieties.\nNew koi varieties are still being actively developed. Ghost koi developed in the 1980s have become very popular in the United Kingdom; they are a hybrid of wild carp and Ogon koi and are distinguished by their metallic scales. Butterfly koi (also known as longfin koi, or dragon carp), also developed in the 1980s, are notable for their long and flowing fins. They are hybrids of koi with Asian carp. Butterfly koi and ghost koi are considered by some to be not true \"nishikigoi\".\nThe major named varieties include:\nDifferences from goldfish.\nGoldfish (\"Carassius auratus\") were developed in China more than a thousand years ago by selectively breeding colored varieties; by the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), yellow, orange, white, and red-and-white colorations had been developed. Goldfish were introduced to Japan in the 16th century and to Europe in the 17th century. On the other hand, most ornamental koi breeds currently distributed worldwide originate from Amur carp (\"Cyprinus rubrofuscus\") bred in Japan in the first half of the 19th century. Koi are domesticated Amur carp that are selected or culled for color; they are not a different species, and will revert to the original coloration within a few generations if allowed to breed freely.\nSome goldfish varieties, such as the common goldfish, comet goldfish, and shubunkin, have body shapes and coloration that are similar to koi, and can be difficult to tell apart from koi when immature. Goldfish and koi can interbreed; however, as they were developed from different species of carp, their offspring are sterile.\nHealth, maintenance, and longevity.\nThe Amur carp is a hardy fish, and koi retain that durability. Koi are coldwater fish, but benefit from being kept in the range, and do not react well to long, cold, winter temperatures; their immune systems are very weak below . Koi ponds usually have a metre or more of depth in areas of the world that become warm during the summer, whereas in areas that have harsher winters, ponds generally have a minimum of . Specific pond construction has been evolved by koi keepers intent on raising show-quality koi.\nThe bright colors of koi put them at a severe disadvantage against predators; a white-skinned \"K\u014dhaku\" is highly noticeable against the dark green of a pond. Herons, kingfishers, otters, raccoons, skunk, mink, cats, foxes, and badgers are all capable of spotting out koi and eating them. A well-designed outdoor pond has areas too deep for herons to stand, overhangs high enough above the water that mammals cannot reach in, and shade trees overhead to block the view of aerial passers-by. It may prove necessary to string nets or wires above the surface. A pond usually includes a pump and a filtration system to keep the water clear.\nKoi are an omnivorous fish. They eat a wide variety of foods, including peas, lettuce, and watermelon. Koi food is designed not only to be nutritionally balanced, but also to float so as to encourage them to come to the surface. When they are eating, koi can be checked for parasites and ulcers. Naturally, koi are bottom feeders with a mouth configuration adapted for that. Some koi have a tendency to eat mostly from the bottom, so food producers create a mixed sinking and floating combination food. Koi recognize the persons feeding them and gather around them at feeding times. They can be trained to take food from one's hand. In the winter, their digestive systems slow nearly to a halt, and they eat very little, perhaps no more than nibbles of algae from the bottom. Feeding is not recommended when the water temperature drops below . Care should be taken by hobbyists that proper oxygenation, pH stabilization, and off-gassing occur over the winter in small ponds. Their appetites do not come back until the water becomes warm in the spring.\nKoi have been reported to achieve ages of 100\u2013200 years. One famous scarlet koi named \"Hanako\" was owned by several individuals, the last of whom was Komei Koshihara. In July 1974, a study of the growth rings of one of the koi's scales reported that Hanako was 226 years old. Some sources give an accepted age for the species at little more than 50 years.\nDisease.\nKoi are very hardy. With proper care, they resist many of the parasites that affect more sensitive tropical fish species, such as \"Trichodina, Epistylis\", and \"Ichthyophthirius multifiliis\" infections. Water changes help reduce the risk of diseases and keep koi from being stressed. Two of the biggest health concerns among koi breeders are the koi herpes virus (KHV) and rhabdovirus carpio, which causes spring viraemia of carp (SVC). No treatment is known for either disease. Some koi farms in Israel use the KV3 vaccine, developed by M. Kotler from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and produced by Kovax, to immunise fish against KHV. Israel is currently the only country in the world to vaccinate koi against the KHV. The vaccine is injected into the fish when they are under one year old, and is accentuated by using an ultraviolet light. The vaccine has a 90% success rate and when immunized, the fish cannot succumb to a KHV outbreak and neither can the immunised koi pass KHV onto other fish in a pond. Only biosecurity measures such as prompt detection, isolation, and disinfection of tanks and equipment can prevent the spread of the disease and limit the loss of fish stock. In 2002, spring viraemia struck an ornamental koi farm in Kernersville, North Carolina, and required complete depopulation of the ponds and a lengthy quarantine period. For a while after this, some koi farmers in neighboring states stopped importing fish for fear of infecting their own stocks.\nBreeding.\nWhen koi naturally breed on their own they tend to spawn in the spring and summer seasons. The male will start following the female, swimming right behind her and nudging her. After the female koi releases her eggs they sink to the bottom of the pond and stay there. A sticky outer shell around the egg helps keep it in place so it does not float around. Although the female can produce many spawns, many of the fry do not survive due to being eaten by others.\nLike most fish, koi reproduce through spawning in which a female lays a vast number of eggs and one or more males fertilize them. Nurturing the resulting offspring (referred to as \"fry\") is a tricky and tedious job, usually done only by professionals. Although a koi breeder may carefully select the parents they wish based on their desired characteristics, the resulting fry nonetheless exhibit a wide range of color and quality.\nKoi produce thousands of offspring from a single spawning. However, unlike cattle, purebred dogs, or more relevantly, goldfish, the large majority of these offspring, even from the best champion-grade koi, are not acceptable as \"nishikigoi\" (they have no interesting colors) or may even be genetically defective. These unacceptable offspring are culled at various stages of development based on the breeder's expert eye and closely guarded trade techniques. Culled fry are usually destroyed or used as feeder fish (mostly used for feeding arowana due to the belief that it will enhance its color), while older culls, within their first year between 3 and 6 inches long (also called \"tosai\"), are often sold as lower-grade, pond-quality koi.\nThe semi-randomized result of the koi's reproductive process has both advantages and disadvantages for the breeder. While it requires diligent oversight to narrow down the favorable result that the breeder wants, it also makes possible the development of new varieties of koi within relatively few generations.\nIn the wild.\nKoi have been accidentally or deliberately released into the wild in every continent except Antarctica. They quickly revert to the natural coloration of an Amur carp within a few generations. In many areas, they are considered an invasive species and a pest. In the states of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, they are considered noxious fish.\nIn Japan, koi releases are sometimes held as an event for tourism purposes. However, as koi is artificial breed, this causes genetic pollution by breeding with native carps.\nKoi greatly increase the turbidity of the water because they are constantly stirring up the substrate. This makes waterways unattractive, reduces the abundance of aquatic plants, and can render the water unsuitable for swimming or drinking, even by livestock. In some countries, koi have caused so much damage to waterways that vast amounts of money and effort have been spent trying to eradicate them, largely unsuccessfully.\nIn many areas of North America, koi are introduced into the artificial \"water hazards\" and ponds on golf courses to keep water-borne insect larvae under control through predation.\nIn common culture.\nIn Japan, the koi is a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good fortune, and also of perseverance in the face of adversity. Ornamental koi are symbolic of Japanese culture and are closely associated with the country's national identity. The custom of \"koinobori\" (carp streamers), which began in the Edo period (1603\u20131867), is still practiced today and displayed in gardens on Children's Day, 5 May.\nIn Chinese culture, the koi represents fame, family harmony, and wealth. It is a feng shui favorite, symbolizing abundance as well as perseverance and strength, and has a mythical potential to transform into a dragon. Since the late 20th century, the keeping of koi in outdoor water gardens has become popular among the more affluent Chinese. Koi ponds are found in Chinese communities around the world, and the number of people who keep koi imported from Niigata, has been increasing. In addition, there are increasing numbers of Japanese koi bred in China that are sold domestically and exported to foreign countries.\nKoi are also popular in many countries in the equatorial region, where outdoor water gardens are popular. In Sri Lanka, interior courtyards most often have one or several fish ponds dedicated to koi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He published more than 23 novels, a collection of poetry, some short stories and plays, a travelogue, works of non-fiction and some essays.\nHamsun is considered \"one of the most influential and innovative literary stylists of the past hundred years\" (\"ca.\" 1890\u20131990). He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, and influenced authors such as Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Maxim Gorky, Stefan Zweig, Henry Miller, Hermann Hesse, John Fante, James Kelman, Charles Bukowski and Ernest Hemingway. Isaac Bashevis Singer called Hamsun \"the father of the modern school of literature in his every aspect\u2014his subjectiveness, his fragmentariness, his use of flashbacks, his lyricism. The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun\". Since 1916, several of Hamsun's works have been adapted into motion pictures. On 4 August 2009, the Knut Hamsun Centre was opened in Hamar\u00f8y Municipality.\nThe young Hamsun objected to realism and naturalism. He argued that the main object of modernist literature should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the \"whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow\". Hamsun is considered the \"leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt at the turn of the 20th century\", with works such as \"Hunger\" (1890), \"Mysteries\" (1892), \"Pan\" (1894), and \"Victoria\" (1898). His later works\u2014in particular his \"Nordland novels\"\u2014were influenced by the Norwegian new realism, portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect, irony, and humour. Hamsun published only one poetry collection, \"The Wild Choir\", which has been set to music by several composers.\nHamsun held strong Anglophobic views, and openly supported Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, travelling to meet Hitler during the German occupation of Norway. Due to his professed support for the occupation of Norway and the Quisling regime, he was charged with treason after the war. Due to alleged psychological problems and issues relating to old age, he was not convicted, but in 1948 he was heavily fined. Hamsun's last book, \"On Overgrown Paths\", authored in semi-imprisonment in Landvik, concerned his postwar treatment and his rebuttal to accusations of mental ineptness.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nKnut Hamsun was born as Knud Pedersen in Lom Municipality in the Gudbrandsdalen valley, Norway. He was the fourth son among the seven children of Tora Olsdatter and Peder Pedersen. When he was three, the family moved to Hamsund in Hamar\u00f8y Municipality in Nordland county. They were poor and an uncle had invited them to farm his land for him.\nAt nine Knut was separated from his family and lived with his uncle Hans Olsen, who needed help with the post office he ran. Olsen used to beat and starve his nephew, and Hamsun later stated that his chronic nervous difficulties were due to the way his uncle treated him.\nIn 1874 he finally escaped back to Lom. For the next five years he did any job for money; he was a store clerk, peddler, shoemaker's apprentice, sheriff's assistant, and an elementary-school teacher.\nAt 17 he became a ropemaker's apprentice; at about the same time he started to write. He asked businessman Erasmus Zahl to give him significant monetary support, and Zahl agreed. Hamsun later used Zahl as a model for the character \"Mack\" appearing in his novels \"Pan\" (1894), \"Dreamers\" (1904), \"Benoni\" (1908) and \"Rosa\" (1908).\nHe spent several years in America, traveling and working at various jobs, and published in 1889 his impressions under the title \"Fra det moderne Amerikas Aandsliv\" (\"From the Spiritual Life of Modern America\").\nEarly literary career.\nWorking all those odd jobs paid off, and he published his first book: \"Den Gaadefulde: En Kj\u00e6rlighedshistorie fra Nordland\" (\"The Enigmatic Man: A Love Story from Northern Norway\", 1877). It was inspired by job experiences and struggles he endured.\nIn his second novel \"Bj\u00f8rger\" (1878), he attempted to imitate Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson's writing style. The melodramatic story follows a poet, Bj\u00f8rger, and his love for Laura. This book was published under the pseudonym Knud Pedersen Hamsund. This book later served as the basis for \"Victoria: En K\u00e6rligheds Historie\" (1898; translated as \"Victoria: A Love Story\", 1923).\nAs of 1898 Hamsun was among the contributors of \"Ringeren\", a political and cultural magazine established by Sigurd Ibsen.\nMajor works.\nHamsun first received wide acclaim with his 1890 novel \"Hunger\" (\"Sult\"). The semiautobiographical work described a young writer's descent into near madness as a result of hunger and poverty in the Norwegian capital of Kristiania (modern name Oslo). To many, the novel presages the writings of Franz Kafka and other twentieth-century novelists with its internal monologue and bizarre logic.\nA theme to which Hamsun often returned is that of the perpetual wanderer, an itinerant stranger (often the narrator) who insinuates himself into the life of small rural communities. This theme is central to the novels \"Mysteries\", \"Pan\", \"Under the Autumn Star\", \"The Last Joy\", \"Vagabonds\", \"Rosa\", and others.\nHamsun's prose often contains rapturous depictions of the natural world, with intimate reflections on the Norwegian woodlands and coastline. For this reason, he has been linked with the spiritual movement known as pantheism (\"No one knows God,\" he once wrote, \"man knows only gods.\"). Hamsun saw mankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond. This connection between the characters and their natural environment is exemplified in the novels \"Pan\", \"A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings\", and the epic \"Growth of the Soil\", \"his monumental work\" credited with securing him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920.\nWorld War II, arrest and trial.\nDuring World War II, Hamsun supported the German war effort. He courted and met with high-ranking Nazi officers, including Adolf Hitler. Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote a long and enthusiastic diary entry concerning a private meeting with Hamsun; according to Goebbels, Hamsun's \"faith in German victory is unshakable\". In 1940 Hamsun wrote that \"the Germans are fighting for us\". After Hitler's death, he published a short obituary in which he described him as \"a warrior for mankind\" and \"a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations\".\nOn 13 June 1945, after the war, he was detained by police for treason, then committed to a hospital in Grimstad (\"Grimstad sykehus\") \"due to his advanced age\", according to Einar Kringlen, a professor and medical doctor. In 1947 he was tried in Grimstad and fined. Norway's supreme court reduced the fine from 575,000 to 325,000 Norwegian kroner.\nAfter the war, Norwegians were torn between aversion to Hamsun's Nazi sympathies and regard for his achievements and fame as a writer. At his trial Hamsun had pleaded ignorance. Other explanations have cited his contradictory personality, his distaste for \"hoi polloi\", his inferiority complex, his distress at the spread of indiscipline, his dislike of Norway's interwar democracy, and especially his Anglophobia.\nDeath.\nKnut Hamsun died on 19 February 1952, aged 92, in Grimstad. His ashes are buried in the garden of his home at N\u00f8rholm in Grimstad Municipality.\nLegacy.\nThomas Mann described Hamsun as a \"descendant of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche.\" Arthur Koestler was a fan of his love stories. H.G. Wells praised \"Growth of the Soil\", for which Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Isaac Bashevis Singer was a fan of Hamsun's modern subjectivism, flashbacks, fragmentation, and lyricism. A character in Charles Bukowski's book \"Women\" referred to Hamsun as the greatest writer who ever lived.\nA fifteen-volume edition of Hamsun's complete works was published in 1954. In 2009, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, a new 27-volume edition of his complete works was published, including short stories, poetry, plays, and articles not included in the 1954 edition. For this new edition, all of Hamsun's works underwent slight linguistic modifications to make them more accessible to contemporary Norwegian readers. New English translations of two of his major works, \"Growth of the Soil\" and \"Pan\", were published in 1998.\nHamsun's works remain popular. In 2009, a Norwegian biographer stated, \"We can't help loving him, though we have hated him all these years... That's our Hamsun trauma. He's a ghost that won't stay in the grave.\"\nThree of Hamsun's homes (Hamsund g\u00e5rd in Hamar\u00f8y Municipality, Hamsunstugu in Garmo in Lom Municipality, and N\u00f8rholm in Grimstad Municipality) are open to the public as museums, in addition to the Knut Hamsun Centre in Hamar\u00f8y.\nAfter gifting the medal to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels in 1943, the whereabouts of Hamsun's Nobel Prize medal remain unknown.\nWriting techniques.\nAlong with August Strindberg, Henrik Ibsen, and Sigrid Undset, Hamsun formed a quartet of Scandinavian authors who became internationally known for their works. Hamsun pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, as found in material by, for example, Joyce, Proust, Mansfield and Woolf. His writing also had a major influence on Franz Kafka. Hamsun's works were translated into German by Cl\u00e4re Mj\u00f8en.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1898, Hamsun married Bergljot G\u00f6pfert (n\u00e9e Bech), who bore daughter Victoria, but the marriage ended in 1906. Hamsun then married Marie Andersen (1881\u20131969) in 1909 and she was his companion until the end of his life. They had four children: sons Tore and Arild and daughters Ellinor and Cecilia.\nMarie wrote about her life with Hamsun in two memoirs. She was a promising actress when she met Hamsun but ended her career and traveled with him to Hamar\u00f8y. They bought a farm, planning \"to earn their living as farmers, with his writing providing some additional income\".\nAfter a few years they moved south, to Larvik. In 1918 they bought N\u00f8rholm, an old, somewhat dilapidated manor house between Lillesand and Grimstad. The main residence was restored and redecorated. Here Hamsun could occupy himself with writing undisturbed, although he often travelled to write in other cities and places, preferring spartan housing.\nRacism and admiration for Hitler.\nFrom his youth onward, Hamsun espoused anti-egalitarian and racist beliefs. In \"The Cultural Life of Modern America\" (1889), he denounced miscegenation: \"The Negros are and will remain Negros, a nascent human form from the tropics, rudimentary organs on the body of white society. Instead of founding an intellectual elite, America has established a mulatto studfarm.\"\nHamsun wrote several newspaper articles in the course of the Second World War, including his notorious 1940 assertion that \"the Germans are fighting for us, and now are crushing England's tyranny over us and all neutrals\". In 1943, he sent Germany's minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels his Nobel Prize medal as a gift. Hamsun's biographer Thorkild Hansen interpreted this as part of the strategy to get an audience with Hitler. Hamsun was eventually invited to meet with Hitler; during the meeting, Hamsun complained about the German civilian administrator in Norway, Josef Terboven and asked that imprisoned Norwegian citizens be released, enraging Hitler. Otto Dietrich describes the meeting in his memoirs as the only time that another person was able to get a word in edgeways with Hitler. He attributes this to Hamsun's deafness. Regardless, Dietrich notes that it took Hitler three days to get over his anger. Hamsun also on other occasions helped Norwegians who had been imprisoned for resistance activities and tried to influence German policies in Norway.\nNevertheless, a week after Hitler's death, Hamsun wrote a eulogy for him, saying \"He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations.\" Following the end of the war, angry crowds burned his books in public in major Norwegian cities and Hamsun was confined for several months in a psychiatric hospital.\nHamsun was forced to undergo a psychiatric examination, which concluded that he had \"permanently impaired mental faculties,\" and on that basis the charges of treason were dropped. Instead, a civil liability case was raised against him, and in 1948 he had to pay the ruinous sum of 325,000 kroner ($65,000 or \u00a316,250 at that time) to the Norwegian government for his alleged membership in Nasjonal Samling and for the moral support he gave to the Germans, but was cleared of any direct Nazi affiliation. Whether he was a member of Nasjonal Samling or not and whether his mental abilities were impaired is debated even today. Hamsun stated he was never a member of any political party. He wrote his last book \"Paa giengrodde Stier\" (\"On Overgrown Paths\") in 1949, a book many take as evidence of his functioning mental capabilities. In it, he harshly criticizes the psychiatrists and the judges and, in his view, proves that he is not mentally ill.\nDanish author Thorkild Hansen investigated the trial and wrote \"The Hamsun Trial\" (1978), which created a storm in Norway. Hansen viewed Hamsun's treatment as outrageous, writing, \"If you want to meet idiots, go to Norway.\" In 1996, Swedish filmmaker Jan Troell based the movie \"Hamsun\" on Hansen's book. In \"Hamsun\", Swedish actor Max von Sydow plays Knut Hamsun; his wife Marie is played by Danish actress Ghita N\u00f8rby.\nStudies on Hamsun's writings.\nHamsun's writings have been the subject of numerous books and journal articles. Some of these writings compare and contrast Hamsun's literary works with the political and cultural ideas expressed in his non-fiction.\nHamsun produced a voluminous correspondence during his lifetime. Norwegian scholar and Hamsun expert Harald N\u00e6ss spent four decades tracking these letters down in both the United States and Europe, producing a collection of thousands of letters. He published a selection in various volumes between 1994 and 2000.\nFilm and TV adaptations.\nPrime among all of Hamsun's works adapted to film is \"Hunger\", a 1966 film starring Per Oscarsson. It is still considered one of the top film adaptations of any Hamsun works. Hamsun's works have been the basis of 25 films and television mini-series adaptations, starting in 1916.\nThe book \"Mysteries\" was the basis of a 1978 film of the same name (by the Dutch film company Sigma Pictures), directed by Paul de Lussanet, starring Sylvia Kristel, Rutger Hauer, Andrea Ferreol and Rita Tushingham.\n\"Landstrykere\" (\"Wayfarers\") is a Norwegian film from 1990 directed by Ola Solum.\n\"The Telegraphist\" is a Norwegian movie from 1993 directed by Erik Gustavson. It is based on the novel \"Dreamers\" (\"Sv\u00e6rmere\", also published in English as \"Mothwise\").\n\"Pan\" has been the basis of four films between 1922 and 1995. The latest adaptation, the Danish film of the same name, was directed by Henning Carlsen, who also directed the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish coproduction of the 1966 film \"Sult\" from Hamsun's novel of the same name.\nRemodernist filmmaker Jesse Richards has announced he is in preparations to direct an adaptation of Hamsun's short story \"The Call of Life\".\nCinematized biography.\nA biopic, \"Hamsun\", was released in 1996, directed by Jan Troell.

The family moved from Ancaster to Erindale Woodlands, Toronto Township when Kain was in grade 6 (age 11, 1962) so she could begin training at the National Ballet School of Canada. (The majority of Toronto Township, including Erindale Woodlands, is now Mississauga.) Upon graduating in 1969, she was invited to join the National Ballet of Canada. She also participated in Girl Guides of Canada programs as a member.\nCareer.\nKain became a principal dancer in 1971, performing central roles in a wide array of ballets, eventually becoming well known in Canada, with the help of legendary dancer Rudolf Nureyev. She worked as a guest artist with Roland Petit's Ballet National de Marseilles, the Bolshoi Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet, the Hamburg Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet, and the Eliot Feld Ballet. Kain is a subject of The Portraits of Andy Warhol, c. 1980.\nDuring her career, she performed in many ballets from classical and modern repertoire including among others \"Swan Lake\" (Erik Bruhn) \"Copp\u00e9lia\", \"The Sleeping Beauty\" (Rudolph Nureyev), \"Giselle\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" (John Cranko), \"La fille mal gard\u00e9e\", \"Onegin\" (John Cranko), \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (John Cranko), \"Pastorale\" (James Kudelka), \"Carmen\" (Roland Petit), \"Concerto Barocco\" (Balanchine), \"A Month in the Country\" (Frederick Ashton) and \"Nutcracker\" in which she was often paired with dancer Frank Augustyn. The talent of Kain and Augustyn came to the attention of the public and peers as soon as 1973 when they won prizes at the 1973 Moscow International Ballet Competition.\nIn 1977, Kain stopped dancing, but started again in 1981 with the National Ballet of Canada, where she performed for 15 more years. In 1996, Kain reunited with Frank Augustyn to appear in her husband Ross Petty's panto production of \"Robin Hood\" at Toronto's Elgin Theatre. Kain retired as a professional dancer in 1997.\nIn 1998, she returned to the National Ballet of Canada as part of the senior management team, in the role of artistic associate. She supported artistic director James Kudelka against principal dancer Kimberley Glasco in a wrongful-dismissal suit. In 2005, she succeeded Kudelka as artistic director. She stepped down from that role in 2021.\nKain served as a president of the jury at the Prix de Lausanne ballet competition in 2009.\nKain was the founding board president of Canada's Dancer Transition Resource Centre. Kain's autobiography, \"Movement Never Lies\", was published in 1994 by McClelland and Stewart.\nAwards.\nIn 1973, she won silver in the women's competition and the first prize for best pas de deux (with Frank Augustyn) at the second International Ballet Competition in Moscow dancing the Bluebird pas de deux from Sleeping Beauty.\nIn 1976, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) and was made a Companion of the Order of Canada (CC) in 1991. She was made a member of the Order of Ontario in 1990. She holds honorary degrees from the University of Toronto, York University, McMaster University, Trent University, and the University of British Columbia.

Among Kain's other honours are the National Arts Centre Award, a companion award of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards (1997) and the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement (2002). In 1996, she became the first Canadian to receive the Cartier Lifetime Achievement Award. The choreographer Marguerite Derricks cited Kain as one of her heroes. in 1989 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation made a documentary about her, \"Karen Kain, Prima Ballerina\". In 2002, she received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal.\nKain had an arts based public middle school in Etobicoke named after her (Karen Kain School of the Arts) in 2008. In 2012, Kain received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. In 1998, she was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame.\nHonorary postage stamp.\nIn April 2021, Kain was recognized by Canada Post as a \"legend of ballet\" for her lifetime of artistic achievements with a permanent domestic stamp displaying a ballet leap.\nPersonal life.\nKain has been married since 1983 to Ross Petty, a stage and film actor, and producer of theatrical pantomime productions in Canada for over 20 years.

{"id": "17467", "revid": "158436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17467", "title": "Keiretsu", "text": "Type of conglomerate in Japan\nA is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings that dominated the Japanese economy in the second half of the 20th century. In the legal sense, it is a type of business group that is in a loosely organized alliance within Japan's business community. It rose up to replace the \"zaibatsu\" system that was dissolved in the occupation of Japan following the Second World War. Though their influence has shrunk since the late 20th century, they continue to be important forces in Japan's economy in the early 21st century.\nThe members' companies own small portions of the shares in each other's companies, centered on a core bank; this system helps insulate each company from stock market fluctuations and takeover attempts, thus enabling long-term planning in projects.\nOrigins.\nThe prototypical \"keiretsu\" appeared during the Japanese economic miracle which followed World War II, amid the dissolution of family-controlled vertical monopolies called \"zaibatsu\".\nThe \"zaibatsu\" had been at the heart of economic and industrial activity within the Empire of Japan since Japanese industrialization accelerated during the Meiji era. They held great influence over Japanese national and foreign policies which only increased following the Japanese victories in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905 and World War I. During the inter-war period the \"zaibatsu\" aided Japanese militarism and benefited from their conquest of East Asia by receiving lucrative contracts.\nAfter the surrender of Japan the Allied occupation forces partially attempted to dissolve the \"zaibatsu\" which had worked closely with the militarists during the first half of the 20th century and during the war. However, the United States government later rescinded those orders in an effort to reindustrialize Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia, so the \"zaibatsu\" were never completely dissolved.\nTypes.\nThe two types of \"keiretsu\", horizontal and vertical, can be further categorized as:\nHorizontal \"keiretsu\".\nThe primary aspect of a horizontal\" keiretsu\" (also known as financial \"keiretsu\") is that it is set up around a Japanese bank through cross-shareholding relationships with other companies. The bank assists these companies with a range of financial services. The leading horizontal Japanese \"keiretsu\", also referred to as the \"Big Six\", include: Fuyo, Sanwa, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and DKB Group. Horizontal \"keiretsu\" may also have vertical relationships, called branches.\nHorizontal \"keiretsu\" peaked around 1988, when over half of the value in the Japanese stock market consisted of cross-shareholdings. Since then, banks have gradually reduced their cross-shareholdings. The Japanese corporate governance code, effective from June 2015, requires listed companies to disclose a rationale for their cross-shareholdings. Partly as a result of this requirement, the four Japanese \"megabanks\" descended from the six major \"keiretsu\" banks (namely Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group and Mizuho Financial Group) have indicated plans to further reduce their balance of cross-shareholding investments.\nMembership in horizontal \"keiretsu\" is often loose and often not something considered in day-to-day decision making by its members.\nVertical \"keiretsu\".\nVertical \"keiretsu\" (also known as industrial or distribution\" keiretsu\") are used to link suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors of one industry. Banks have less influence on vertical \"keiretsu\". Examples of this type include Toyota, Toshiba, and Nissan. One or more sub-companies, arranged in tiers of importance, are created to benefit the parent company. Major suppliers form the second tier beneath the parent, and smaller manufacturing companies make up the third and fourth tiers. Those at the highest levels are most profitable, and most insulated from fluctuations in the market.\nSome vertical \"keiretsu\" may belong to one or another horizontal \"keiretsu\". Some vertical \"keiretsu\" are family businesses, such as the Hitotsubashi/Shogakukan, Otowa/Kodansha and APA groups. Studies have found these vertical \"keiretsus,\" particularly those that belong to the same horizontal \"keiretsu\", are more likely to form alliances than the other types or even those companies where one or two have \"keiretsu\" affiliations. Vertical \"keiretsu\" is considered an effective and competitive organizational model in the car industry.\nHistory.\nDuring the occupation of Japan, under the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General Douglas MacArthur, a partially successful attempt was made to dissolve the \"zaibatsu\" in the late 1940s. Sixteen \"zaibatsu\" were targeted for complete dissolution, and 26 more for reorganization after dissolution. However, the companies formed from the dismantling of the \"zaibatsu\" were later reintegrated. The dispersed corporations were reinterlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, \"keiretsu\" companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated, as well. In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand heavy pressures from intensified trade competition.\nThe major \"keiretsu\" were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the \"keiretsu\" member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each bank had great control over the companies in the \"keiretsu\" and acted as a monitoring and emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.\nAlthough the divisions between them have blurred in recent years, there have been eight major postwar \"keiretsu\".\nToyota is considered the biggest of the vertically integrated \"keiretsu\" groups, although the company is rather considered as a \"emerged\" \"keiretsu\", along with Softbank, Seven &amp; I Holdings Co. The banks at the top are not as large as normally required, so it is actually considered to be more horizontally integrated than other \"keiretsu\".\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the \"keiretsu\". Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This blurred the lines between the individual \"keiretsu\": Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the Japanese business community that the old \"keiretsu\" system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of \"keiretsu\" alliances. While they still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 2000s. For instance, many troubled Japanese companies are faced with a new reality in which receiving financial support from their main banks is getting harder and unlikelier than ever before. The companies include Sharp Corporation and Toshiba, both iconic Japanese corporations that were forced to accept foreign investment in the aftermath of financial difficulties in the 2010s.\nThis changed environment, in turn, has led to a growing corporate acquisition industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their banks, as well as rising derivative litigation by more independent shareholders.\nUnited States\u2013Japan bilateral relationship.\nBy April 2015, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari, representing the two largest economies of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, were involved in bilateral talks regarding agriculture and auto parts, the \"two largest obstacles for Japan.\" These bilateral accords would open each other's markets for products such as rice, pork and automobiles.\nDuring the two-day ministerial TPP negotiating session held in Singapore in May 2015, veteran US negotiator Wendy Cutler and Oe Hiroshi of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held bilateral trade talks regarding one of the most contentious trade issues, automobiles. American negotiators wanted the Japanese to open their entire \"keiretsu\" structure, a cornerstone of the Japanese economy, to American automobiles. They wanted Japanese dealer networks such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda to sell American cars. The successful conclusion of these bilateral talks was necessary before the other ten TPP members could complete the trade deal.\nOutside Japan.\nThe \"keiretsu\" model is fairly unique to Japan. However, many diversified non-Japanese businesses groups have been described as \"keiretsu\", such as the Virgin Group (UK), Tata Group (India), the Colombian Grupo Empresarial Antioque\u00f1o and the Venezuelan Grupo Cisneros.\nThe automotive and banking industries have created broad cross-ownership networks across nations, but the national companies are normally independently managed. Banks cited as being central to \"keiretsu\"-like systems include Deutsche Bank and some \"keiretsu\"-like systems, generally referred to as trusts, were created by investment banks in the United States such as JP Morgan and Mellon Financial/Mellon family beginning in the late 19th century (roughly the same period they were created in Japan), but they were largely curtailed through anti-trust legislation championed by Theodore Roosevelt in the early part of the 20th century. A form of \"keiretsu\" can also be found in the cross-shareholdings of the large media companies throughout most developed nations. These are largely designed to link content producers to particular distribution channels, and larger content projects, such as expensive movies, are often incorporated with ownership spread across a number of larger companies.\nContrarian view.\nHarvard Law School professor J. Mark Ramseyer and University of Tokyo professor Yoshiro Miwa have argued that the postwar \"keiretsu\" are a \"fable\" created by Marxist thinkers in the 1960s so as to argue that monopoly capital dominated the Japanese economy. They point to the sparsity and tenuousness of cross-shareholding relationships within the \"keiretsu\", the inconsistency in members' relationships with the \"main banks\" of each \"keiretsu\", and the lack of power and reach of the \"zaibatsu\" alumni \"lunch clubs\" which are often argued to form a core of \"keiretsu\" governance. This contrarian view has been disputed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before he became Chancellor he served as Minister-President of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg from 1958 to 1966 and as President of the Federal Council from 1962 to 1963. He was Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union from 1967 to 1971.\nKiesinger gained his certificate as a lawyer in March 1933 and worked as a lawyer in Berlin's Kammergericht court from 1935 to 1940. He had joined the Nazi Party in 1933, but remained a largely inactive member. To avoid conscription, in 1940 he was appointed to the broadcast policy department of the Foreign Office by Joachim von Ribbentrop, and became deputy head of the broadcasting and propaganda departments in 1942. In 1946 he became a member of the Christian Democratic Union. He was elected to the Bundestag in 1949, and was a member of the Bundestag until 1958 and again from 1969 to 1980. He left federal politics for eight years (from 1958 to 1966) to serve as Minister-President of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, and subsequently became Chancellor by forming a grand coalition with Willy Brandt's Social Democratic Party.\nKiesinger was considered an outstanding orator and mediator, and was dubbed \"Chief Silver Tongue\". He was an author of poetry and various books, and founded the universities of Konstanz and Ulm as Minister-President of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Kiesinger is also considered controversial, which is mainly due to his affiliation and work with the Nazis. The student movement in particular, but also other sections of the population, saw Kiesinger as a politician who stood for the inadequacy of Germans' coming to terms with the past.\nEarly life.\nKurt Georg Kiesinger was born in Ebingen, Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg (now Albstadt, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg). His father was a commercial clerk in companies engaged in the local textile industry. Kiesinger was baptized Catholic because his mother was Catholic, though his father was Protestant. His mother died six months after he was born. His maternal grandmother exerted a strong influence on Kiesinger and encouraged him, while his father was indifferent to his advancement. After a year, his father was remarried to a Karoline Victoria Pfaff. They had seven children, of whom Kiesinger's half-sister Maria died a year after she was born. Pfaff was also a Catholic. Kiesinger was therefore shaped by both denominations and later referred to himself gladly as a \"Protestant Catholic\". Politically, Kiesinger grew up in a liberal, democratically-minded milieu.\nKiesinger studied law in Berlin and worked as a then as lawyer in Berlin from 1935 to 1940. As a student, he joined the (non-\"couleur\" wearing) Roman Catholic corporations \"\" and Askania-Burgundia Berlin. \nNazi career.\nHe became a member of the Nazi Party in February 1933. In 1940, he was called to arms but avoided mobilization by finding a job in the Foreign Office's broadcasting department, rising quickly to become deputy head of the department from 1943 to 1945 and the department's liaison with the Propaganda Ministry. He worked under Joachim von Ribbentrop, who would later be condemned to death at Nuremberg. After the war, he was interned by the Americans for his connection to Ribbentrop and spent 18 months in the Ludwigsburg camp before being released as a case of mistaken identity.\nFranco-German journalist Beate Klarsfeld demonstrated Kiesinger's close connections to Ribbentrop and Joseph Goebbels, the head of Nazi Germany's Propaganda Ministry. She also asserted that Kiesinger had been chiefly responsible for the contents of German international broadcasts which included anti-Semitic and war propaganda, and had collaborated closely with SS functionaries Gerhard R\u00fchle and Franz Alfred Six. The latter was responsible for mass murders in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe and was tried as a war criminal in the \"Einsatzgruppen Trial\" at Nuremberg. Even after becoming aware of the extermination of the Jews, Kiesinger had continued to produce anti-Semitic propaganda. These allegations were based in part on documents that Albert Norden published about the culprits of war and Nazi crimes.\nEarly CDU career.\nKiesinger joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 1946. From 1946 he gave private lessons to law students, and in 1948 he resumed his practice as a lawyer. In 1947 he also became unpaid secretary-general of the CDU in W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern.\nIn the federal election in 1949 he was elected to the Bundestag, in which he went on to sit until 1958 and again from 1969 to 1980. In his first legislative term he represented the constituency of Ravensburg, in which he achieved record results of over 70 percent, from 1969 the constituency of Waldshut. For the 1976 federal election, Kiesinger renounced his own constituency and entered parliament via the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state list of his party. In the first two legislative periods (1949\u20131957) he was chairman of the mediation committee of the Bundestag and Bundesrat. On 19 October 1950, Kiesinger received 55 votes against his party friend Hermann Ehlers (201 votes) in the election for President of the Bundestag, although he had not been proposed. In 1951 he became a member of the CDU executive board. From 17 December 1954 to 29 January 1959, he was chairman of the Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs, to which he had been a member since 1949.\nDuring that time, he became known for his rhetorical brilliance, as well as his in-depth knowledge of foreign affairs. However, despite the recognition he enjoyed within the Christian Democrat parliamentary faction, he was passed over during various cabinet reshuffles. Consequently, he decided to switch from federal to state politics.\nMinister-President of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nKiesinger became Minister-President of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on 17 December 1958, an office in which he served until 1 December 1966. At that time Kiesinger was also a member of the Landtag of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. As Minister-President he was President of the German Bundesrat from 1 November 1962 to 31 October 1963. During his time in office the state founded two universities, the University of Konstanz and the University of Ulm.\nIn the early days of the Federal Republic of Germany, oversized coalitions were not uncommon at the state level, and so Kiesinger led a coalition of the CDU, SPD, FDP/DVP and BHE until 1960, but then a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition, coalition from 1960 to 1966. On 15 April 1961, the BHE disbanded.\nChancellor of West Germany (1966\u20131969).\nIn 1966, following the collapse of the existing CDU/CSU-FDP coalition in the Bundestag, Kiesinger was elected to replace Ludwig Erhard as Federal Chancellor, heading a new CDU/CSU-SPD alliance with the SPD leader Willy Brandt as Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. The Kiesinger government remained in power for nearly three years. Kiesinger reduced tensions with the Soviet bloc nations, establishing diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, but he opposed any major conciliatory moves. A number of progressive reforms were also realised during Kiesinger's time as Chancellor. Pension coverage was extended in 1967 via the abolition of the income-ceiling for compulsory membership. In education, student grants were introduced, together with a university building programme, while a constitutional reform of 1969 empowered the federal government to be involved with the L\u00e4nder in educational planning through joint planning commission. Vocational training legislation was also introduced, while a reorganisation of unemployment insurance promoted retraining schemes, counselling and advice services, and job creation places. In addition, under the \"Lohnfortzahlunggesetz\" of 1969, employers had to pay all employees\u2019 wages for the first six weeks of sickness. In August 1969, the \"Landabgaberente\" (a higher special pension for farmers willing to cede farms that were unprofitable according to certain criteria) was introduced.\nThe historian Tony Judt has observed that Kiesinger's chancellorship, like the presidency of Heinrich L\u00fcbke, showed the \"a glaring contradiction in the Bonn Republic's self-image\" in view of their previous Nazi allegiances. One of his low points as Chancellor was in 1968 when Nazi-hunter Beate Klarsfeld, who campaigned with her husband Serge Klarsfeld against Nazi criminals, publicly slapped him in the face during the 1968 Christian Democrat convention, while calling him a Nazi. She did so in French and, whilst being dragged out of the room by two ushers, repeated her words in German, saying \"Kiesinger! Nazi! Abtreten!\" (\"Kiesinger! Nazi! Step down!\") Kiesinger, holding his left cheek, did not respond, though Klarsfeld was sentenced to a year in prison that same day under expedited proceedings. Up to his death he refused to comment on the incident, and in other opportunities he denied explicitly that he had been opportunistic by joining the NSDAP in 1933 (although he admitted to joining the German Foreign Ministry to dodge his 1940 draft by the Wehrmacht). Other prominent critics included the writers Heinrich B\u00f6ll and G\u00fcnter Grass. (In 1966, Grass had written an open letter urging Kiesinger not to accept the chancellorship). In 2006, 40 years later, Grass, in an interview with the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", would confess to a Waffen-SS membership, which became a controversy on its own. \nAfter the election of 1969, the SPD preferred to form a coalition with the FDP, ending the uninterrupted post-war reign of the CDU chancellors. Kiesinger was succeeded as Chancellor by his former Vice-Chancellor Willy Brandt.\nLater years and death.\nKiesinger continued to head the CDU/CSU in opposition and remained a member of the Bundestag until 1980. In July 1971 Kiesinger was succeeded as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union by Rainer Barzel. In 1972 he held the main speech for justification to the constructive vote of no confidence by the CDU/CSU parliamentary group against Willy Brandt in the Bundestag. The election of then CDU leader Rainer Barzel as chancellor was unsuccessful because of the bribery of Julius Steiner and probably Leo Wagner by GDR's Stasi.\nIn 1980 Kiesinger ended his career as politician and worked on his memoir. Of his planned memoirs, only the first part (\"Dark and Bright Years\") was completed, covering the years up to 1958. It was released after his death in 1989. Kiesinger died in T\u00fcbingen on 9 March 1988, 28 days short of his 84th birthday. After a requiem mass in Stuttgart's St. Eberhard Church, his funeral procession was followed by protesters (mainly students) who wanted his former membership in the Nazi Party remembered.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name originated in Middle English via Latin from the Greek word (), derived from the Indo-European root ('light', 'brightness'), in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes.\nAppearance.\nLynx have a short tail, characteristic tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears, large, padded paws for walking on snow and long whiskers on the face. Under their neck, they have a ruff, which has black bars resembling a bow tie, although this is often not visible.\nBody colour varies from medium brown to goldish to beige-white, and is occasionally marked with dark brown spots, especially on the limbs. All species of lynx have white fur on their chests, bellies and on the insides of their legs, fur which is an extension of the chest and belly fur. The lynx's colouring, fur length and paw size vary according to the climate in their range. In the Southwestern United States, they are short-haired, dark in colour and their paws are smaller and less padded. In colder northern climates lynx have thicker and lighter fur as well as larger and more padded paws that are well-adapted to snow.\nThe smallest species are the bobcat and the Canada lynx, while the largest is the Eurasian lynx, with considerable variations within species.\nSpecies.\nAll living species of \"Lynx\" are thought to descend from \"Lynx issiodorensis,\" which first appeared during the early Pliocene in Africa, around 4 million years ago, shortly afterwards dispersing into Eurasia. The bobcat is thought to have arisen from a dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge during the Early Pleistocene, around 2.5-2.4 million years ago, with the Iberian lynx suggested to have speciated around 1 million years ago, at the end of the Early Pleistocene, the Eurasian lynx is thought to have evolved from Asian populations of \"Lynx issidorensis\". The Canada lynx is thought to descend from a separate later migration of Eurasian lynx over the Bering Land Bridge around 200,000 years ago.\nThe Pliocene felid \"Felis rexroadensis\" from North America has been proposed as an even earlier ancestor; however, this was larger than any living species, and is not currently classified as a true lynx. Another extinct species of \"Lynx\", \"L. shansius\", inhabited what is now northern China during the Early Pleistocene, though this species is considered by some researchers to be a junior synonym of \"L. issiodorensis\".\nEurasian lynx.\nOf the four lynx species, the Eurasian lynx (\"Lynx lynx\") is the largest in size. It is native to European, Central Asian, and Siberian forests. While its conservation status has been classified as \"least concern\", populations of Eurasian lynx have been reduced or extirpated from much of Europe, where it is now being reintroduced.\nDuring the summer, the Eurasian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat which is replaced by a much thicker silver-grey to greyish-brown coat during winter. The lynx hunts by stalking and jumping on its prey, helped by the rugged, forested country in which it resides. A favorite prey for the lynx in its woodland habitat is roe deer. It will feed however on whatever animal appears easiest, as it is an opportunistic predator much like its cousins.\nCanada lynx.\nThe Canada lynx (\"Lynx canadensis\"), or Canadian lynx, is a North American felid that ranges in forest and tundra regions across Canada and into Alaska, as well as some parts of the northern United States. Historically, the Canadian lynx ranged from Alaska across Canada and into many of the northern U.S. states. In the eastern states, it resided in the transition zone in which boreal coniferous forests yielded to deciduous forests. By 2010, after an 11-year effort, it had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado, where it had become extirpated in the 1970s. In 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the Canada lynx a threatened species in the lower 48 states.\nThe Canada lynx is a good climber and swimmer; it constructs rough shelters under fallen trees or rock ledges. It has a thick coat and broad paws, and is twice as effective as the bobcat at supporting its weight on the snow. The Canada lynx feeds almost exclusively on snowshoe hares; its population is highly dependent on the population of this prey animal. It will also hunt medium-sized mammals and birds if hare numbers fall.\nIberian lynx.\nThe Iberian lynx (\"Lynx pardinus\") is a vulnerable species native to the Iberian Peninsula in Southern Europe. It was the most endangered cat species in the world, but conservation efforts have changed its status from critical to endangered to vulnerable. The loss of the species would have been the first feline extinction since the \"Smilodon\" 10,000 years ago. The species used to be classified as a subspecies of the Eurasian lynx, but is now considered a separate species. Both species occurred together in central Europe in the Pleistocene epoch, being separated by habitat choice. The Iberian lynx is believed to have evolved from \"Lynx issiodorensis\".\nBobcat.\nThe bobcat (\"Lynx rufus\") is a North American wild cat. With 13 recognized subspecies, the bobcat is common throughout southern Canada, the continental United States, and northern Mexico. Like the Eurasian lynx, its conservation status is \"least concern.\" The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits deciduous, coniferous, or mixed woodlands, but unlike other \"Lynx\", does not depend exclusively on the deep forest, and ranges from swamps and desert lands to mountainous and agricultural areas, its spotted coat serving as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey. Nonetheless, the bobcat is often killed by larger predators such as coyotes.\nThe bobcat resembles other species of the genus \"Lynx\", but is on average the smallest of the four. Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. There is generally an off-white color on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions have the darkest.\nBehavior and diet.\nThe lynx is usually solitary, although a small group of lynx may travel and hunt together occasionally. Mating takes place in the late winter and once a year the female gives birth to between one and four kittens. The gestation time of the lynx is about 70 days. The young stay with the mother for one more winter, a total of around nine months, before moving out to live on their own as young adults. The lynx creates its den in crevices or under ledges. It feeds on a wide range of animals from white-tailed deer, reindeer, roe deer, small red deer, and chamois, to smaller, more usual prey: snowshoe hares, fish, foxes, sheep, squirrels, mice, turkeys and other birds, and goats. It also eats ptarmigans, voles, and grouse.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe lynx inhabits high altitude forests with dense cover of shrubs, reeds, and tall grass. Although this cat hunts on the ground, it can climb trees and can swim swiftly, catching fish.\nEurope and Asia.\nThe Eurasian lynx ranges from central and northern Europe across Asia up to Northern Pakistan and India. In Iran, they live in Mount Damavand area. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Eurasian lynx was considered extinct in the wild in Slovenia and Croatia. A resettlement project, begun in 1973, has successfully reintroduced lynx to the Slovenian Alps and the Croatian regions of Gorski Kotar and Velebit, including Croatia's Plitvice Lakes National Park and Risnjak National Park. In both countries, the lynx is listed as an endangered species and protected by law. The lynx was distributed throughout Japan during J\u014dmon period; with no paleontological evidence thereafter suggesting extinction at that time.\nSeveral lynx resettlement projects begun in the 1970s have been successful in various regions of Switzerland. Since the 1990s, there have been numerous efforts to resettle the Eurasian lynx in Germany, and since 2000, a small population can now be found in the Harz mountains near Bad Lauterberg.\nThe lynx is found in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest in northeastern Poland, and in the northern and western parts of China, particularly the Tibetan Plateau. In Romania, the numbers exceed 2,000, the largest population in Europe outside of Russia, although most experts consider the official population numbers to be overestimated.\nThe lynx is more common in northern Europe, especially in Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, and the northern parts of Russia. The Swedish population is estimated to be 1200\u20131500 individuals, spread all over the country, but more common in middle Sweden and in the mountain range. The lynx population in Finland was 1900\u20132100 individuals in 2008, and the numbers have been increasing every year since 1992. The lynx population in Finland is estimated currently to be larger than ever before. Lynx in Britain were wiped out in the 17th century, but there have been calls to reintroduce them to curb the numbers of deer.\nThe endangered Iberian lynx lives in southern Spain and formerly in eastern Portugal. There is an Iberian lynx reproduction center outside Silves in the Algarve in southern Portugal.\nNorth America.\nThe two \"Lynx\" species in North America, Canada lynx and bobcats, are both found in the temperate zone. While the bobcat is common throughout southern Canada, the continental United States and northern Mexico, the Canada lynx is present mainly in boreal forests of Canada and Alaska.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "17503", "revid": "1174762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17503", "title": "Leisure", "text": "Time that is freely disposed by individuals\nLeisure (, ) has often been defined as a quality of experience or as free time. Free time is time spent away from business, work, job hunting, domestic chores, and education, as well as necessary activities such as eating and sleeping. Leisure as an experience usually emphasizes dimensions of perceived freedom and choice. It is done for \"its own sake\", for the quality of experience and involvement. Other classic definitions include Thorstein Veblen's (1899) of \"nonproductive consumption of time.\" Free time is not easy to define due to the multiplicity of approaches used to determine its essence. Different disciplines have definitions reflecting their common issues: for example, sociology on social forces and contexts and psychology as mental and emotional states and conditions. From a research perspective, these approaches have an advantage of being quantifiable and comparable over time and place.\nLeisure studies and sociology of leisure are the academic disciplines concerned with the study and analysis of leisure. Recreation differs from leisure in that it is a purposeful activity that includes the experience of leisure in activity contexts. Economists consider that leisure times are valuable to a person like wages. If it were not, people would have worked instead of taking leisure. However, the distinction between leisure and unavoidable activities is not a rigidly defined one, e.g. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility. A related concept is social leisure, which involves leisurely activities in social settings, such as extracurricular activities, e.g. sports, clubs. Another related concept is that of family leisure. Relationships with others is usually a major factor in both satisfaction and choice.\nThe concept of leisure as a human right was realised in article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nHistory.\nLeisure has historically been the privilege of the upper class. Opportunities for leisure came with more money, or organization, and less working time, rising dramatically in the mid-to-late 19th century, starting in Great Britain and spreading to other rich nations in Europe. It spread as well to the United States, although that country had a reputation in Europe for providing much less leisure despite its wealth. Immigrants to the United States discovered they had to work harder than they did in Europe. Economists continue to investigate why Americans work longer hours. In a recent book, Laurent Turcot argues that leisure was not created in the 19th century but is imbricated in the occidental world since the beginning of history.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, leisure in the country is related to the decline in work hours and is shaped by moral values, and the ethnic-religious and gender communities. In a cold country with winter's long nights, and summer's extended daylight, favorite leisure activities include horse racing, team sports such as hockey, singalongs, roller skating and board games. The churches tried to steer leisure activities, by preaching against drinking and scheduling annual revivals and weekly club activities. By 1930 radio played a major role in uniting Canadians behind their local or regional hockey teams. Play-by-play sports coverage, especially of ice hockey, absorbed fans far more intensely than newspaper accounts the next day. Rural areas were especially influenced by sports coverage.\nFrance.\nLeisure by the mid-19th century was no longer an individualistic activity. It was increasingly organized. In the French industrial city of Lille, with a population of 80,000 in 1858, the cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1300, or one for every three houses. Lille counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets, festivals and competitions. At the turn of the century thousands of these clubs had been created.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAs literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the mid-19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.\nOpportunities for leisure activities increased because real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline. In urban Britain, the nine-hour day was increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours. The movement toward an eight-hour day. Furthermore, system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class. Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays.\nBy the late Victorian era, the leisure industry had emerged in all British cities, and the pattern was copied across Western Europe and North America. It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length and convenient locales at inexpensive prices. These include sporting events, music halls, and popular theater. By 1880 football was no longer the preserve of the social elite, as it attracted large working-class audiences. Average gate was 5,000 in 1905, rising to 23,000 in 1913. That amounted to 6 million paying customers with a weekly turnover of \u00a3400,000. Sports by 1900 generated some three percent of the total gross national product in Britain. Professionalization of sports was the norm, although some new activities reached an upscale amateur audience, such as lawn tennis and golf. Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, tennis, badminton and gymnastics.\nLeisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. There were class differences with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs. Heavy drinking declined; there was more betting on outcomes. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for average English people, and their interest in spectator sports increased dramatically.\nBy the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages, and genders in very large numbers. Giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 percent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 percent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.\nThe British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, that any rival. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play. Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Soccer proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports, there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing. New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.\nCricket had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, and was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada. Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the most famous is that between Australia and Britain for \"The Ashes\".\nTypes.\nThe range of leisure activities extends from the very informal and casual to highly organised and long-lasting activities. A significant subset of leisure activities are hobbies which are undertaken for personal satisfaction, usually on a regular basis, and often result in satisfaction through skill development or recognised achievement, sometimes in the form of a product. The list of hobbies is ever changing as society changes.\nSubstantial and fulfilling hobbies and pursuits are described by Sociologist Robert Stebbins as \"serious leisure\". The \"serious leisure perspective\" is a way of viewing the wide range of leisure pursuits in three main categories: casual leisure, serious leisure, and project-based leisure.\nSerious leisure.\n\"\"Serious leisure\" is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer ... that is highly substantial, interesting, and fulfilling and where ... participants find a [leisure] career...\". For example, collecting stamps or maintaining a public wetland area.\nPeople undertaking serious leisure can be categorised as amateurs, volunteers or hobbyists. Their engagement is distinguished from casual leisure by a high level of perseverance, effort, knowledge and training required and durable benefits and the sense that one can create in effect a leisure career through such activity.\nThe range of serious leisure activities is growing rapidly in modern times with developed societies having greater leisure time, longevity and prosperity. The Internet is providing increased support for amateurs and hobbyists to communicate, display and share products.\nReading.\nAs literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900, reading became a popular pastime. Libraries saw heavy demand for new fiction. A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by Allen Lane (1902\u201370) at Penguin Books in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworths. Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \"middlebrow\" audience. It avoided the downscale image of American paperbacks. The line signaled cultural self-improvement and political education. The more polemical Penguin Specials, typically with a leftist orientation for Labour readers, were widely distributed during World War II. However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on Paternoster Square in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.\nRomantic fiction was especially popular, with Mills and Boon the leading publisher. Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy. Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were perceived as exciting and just.\nCasual leisure.\n\"\"Casual leisure\" is immediately, intrinsically rewarding; and it is a relatively short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no special training to enjoy it.\" For example, watching TV or going for a swim.\nProject-based leisure.\n\"\"Project-based leisure\" is a short-term, moderately complicated, either one-shot or occasional, though infrequent, creative undertaking carried out in free time.\" For example, working on a single Wikipedia article or building a garden feature.\nCultural differences.\nTime available for leisure varies from one society to the next, although anthropologists have found that hunter-gatherers tend to have significantly more leisure time than people in more complex societies. As a result, band societies such as the Shoshone of the Great Basin came across as extraordinarily lazy to European colonialists.\nWorkaholics, less common than the social myths, are those who work compulsively at the expense of other activities. They prefer to work rather than spend time socializing and engaging in other leisure activities.\nEuropean and American men statistically have more leisure time than women, due to both household and parenting responsibilities and increasing participation in the paid employment. In Europe and the United States, adult men usually have between one and nine hours more leisure time than women do each week.\nFamily leisure.\nFamily leisure is defined as time that parents, children and siblings spend together in free time or recreational activities, and it can be expanded to address intergenerational family leisure as time that grandparents, parents, and grandchildren spend together in free time or recreational activities. Leisure can become a central place for the development of emotional closeness and strong family bonds. Contexts such as urban/rural shape the perspectives, meanings, and experiences of family leisure. For example, leisure moments are part of work in rural areas, and the rural idyll is enacted by urban families on weekends, but both urban and rural families somehow romanticize rural contexts as ideal spaces for family making (connection to nature, slower and more intimate space, notion of a caring social fabric, tranquillity, etc.). Also, much \"family leisure\" requires tasks that are most often assigned to women. Family leisure also includes playing together with family members on the weekend day.\nAging.\nLeisure is important across the lifespan and can facilitate a sense of control and self-worth. Older adults, specifically, can benefit from physical, social, emotional, cultural, and spiritual aspects of leisure. Leisure engagement and relationships are commonly central to \"successful\" and satisfying aging. For example, engaging in leisure with grandchildren can enhance feelings of generativity, whereby older adults can achieve well-being by leaving a legacy beyond themselves for future generations.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is the recipient of a Golden Globe Award, two BAFTA Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award, in addition to nominations for two Academy Awards.\nCaron began her career as a ballerina. She made her film debut in the musical \"An American in Paris\" (1951), followed by roles in \"The Man with a Cloak\" (1951), \"Glory Alley\" (1952) and \"The Story of Three Loves\" (1953), before her role of an orphan in \"Lili\" (also 1953), which earned her the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress and garnered nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.\nAs a leading lady, Caron starred in films such as \"The Glass Slipper\" (1955), \"Daddy Long Legs\" (1955), \"Gigi\" (1958), \"Fanny\" (1961), \"Guns of Darkness\" (1962), \"The L-Shaped Room\" (1962), \"Father Goose\" (1964) and \"A Very Special Favor\" (1965). For her role as a single pregnant woman in \"The L-Shaped Room\", Caron, in addition to receiving a second Academy Award nomination, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and a second BAFTA Award.\nCaron's other roles include \"Is Paris Burning?\" (1966), \"The Man Who Loved Women\" (1977), \"Valentino\" (1977), \"Damage\" (1992), \"Funny Bones\" (1995), \"Chocolat\" (2000) and \"Le Divorce\" (2003). In 2007, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for portraying heiress and rape victim, Lorraine Delmas, in \"\".\nEarly life and family.\nCaron was born in Boulogne-sur-Seine, Seine (now Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine), the daughter of Margaret (n\u00e9e Petit), an American dancer on Broadway, and Claude Caron, a French chemist, pharmacist, perfumer and boutique owner who founded the artisanal perfumier Guermantes. While her older brother, Aimery Caron, became a chemist like their father, Leslie was prepared for a performing career from childhood by her mother. Her great-grandfather, Ernest Caron was a distinguished Parisian politician of the Belle \u00c9poque and her grandmother Andr\u00e9e Caron was a grandchild of Armand Savalle, the global still maker.\nCaron attended an elite convent school whose students typically married wealthy men, but her family lost its wealth during World War II and could not provide a dowry. \"My mother said: 'There's only one profession that leads you to marrying money and becoming a princess or duchess, and that's ballet.'\", Caron recalled. \"My grandfather whispered heavily: 'Margaret, you want your daughter to be a whore?' I heard it. This has always followed me\".\nCaron said \"My mother died of\" the lost fortune. Having grown up poor, she became depressed and an alcoholic from being no longer wealthy, and committed suicide in her 60s.\nCareer.\nCaron was initially a ballerina. Gene Kelly discovered her in the Roland Petit company \"Ballet des Champs Elys\u00e9es\" and cast her to appear opposite him in the musical \"An American in Paris\" (1951), a role for which a pregnant Cyd Charisse was originally cast. The prosperity, sunshine and abundance of California was a cultural shock to Caron. She had lived in Paris during the German occupation, which left her malnourished and anemic. She later remarked how nice people were in comparison to wartime Paris, in which poverty and deprivation had caused people to be bitter and violent. She had a friendly relationship with Kelly, who nicknamed her \"Lester the Pester\" and \"kid\". Kelly helped the inexperienced Caron\u2014who had never spoken on stage\u2014adjust to filmmaking..\nHer role led to a seven-year MGM contract. The films which followed included the musical \"The Glass Slipper\" (1955) and the drama \"The Man with a Cloak\" (1951), with Joseph Cotten and Barbara Stanwyck. Still, Caron has said of herself: \"Unfortunately, Hollywood considers musical dancers as hoofers. Regrettable expression.\" She also starred in the musicals \"Lili\" (1953, receiving an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination), with Mel Ferrer; \"Daddy Long Legs\" (1955), with Fred Astaire; and \"Gigi\" (1958) with Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier.\nDissatisfied with her career despite her success (\"I thought musicals were futile and silly\", she said in 2021; \"I appreciate them better now\"), Caron studied the Stanislavski method. In the 1960s and thereafter, Caron worked in European films as well. For her performance in the British drama \"The L-Shaped Room\" (1962), she won the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress and the Golden Globe, and was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Her other film assignments in this period included \"Father Goose\" (1964) with Cary Grant; Ken Russell's \"Valentino\" (1977), in the role of silent-screen legend Alla Nazimova; and Louis Malle's \"Damage\" (1992). Sometime in 1970, Caron was one of the many actresses considered for the lead role of Eglantine Price in Disney's \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\", losing the role to British actress Angela Lansbury.\nIn 1967, Caron was a member of the jury of the 5th Moscow International Film Festival (MIFF). In 1989, she was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival. Caron returned to France in the early 1970s, which she later said was a mistake. \"They adore someone who's really British or really American\", Caron said, \"but somebody who's French and has made it in Hollywood \u2013 and I was the only one who had really made it in a big way \u2013 they can't forgive\". \nDuring the 1980s, she appeared in several episodes of the soap opera \"Falcon Crest\" as Nicole Sauguet. Caron is one of the few actresses from the classic era of MGM musicals who are still active in film \u2014 a group that includes Rita Moreno, Margaret O'Brien and June Lockhart. Caron's later credits include \"Funny Bones\" (1995) with Jerry Lewis and Oliver Platt; \"The Last of the Blonde Bombshells\" (2000) with Judi Dench and Cleo Laine; \"Chocolat\" (2000) and \"Le Divorce\" (2003), directed by James Ivory, with Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts. On June 30, 2003, Caron travelled to San Francisco to appear as the special guest star in \"The Songs of Alan Jay Lerner: I Remember It Well\", a retrospective concert staged by San Francisco's 42nd Street Moon Company. \nIn 2007, her guest appearance on \"\" earned her a Primetime Emmy Award. On April 27, 2009, Caron travelled to New York as an honoured guest at a tribute to Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe at the Paley Center for Media. For her contributions to the film industry, Caron was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 8, 2009, with a motion pictures star located at 6153 Hollywood Boulevard. In February 2010, she played Madame Armfeldt in \"A Little Night Music\" at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, which also featured Greta Scacchi and Lambert Wilson. In 2016, Caron appeared in the ITV television series \"The Durrells\" (produced by her son Christopher Hall) as the Countess Mavrodaki. Veteran documentarian Larry Weinstein's \"Leslie Caron: The Reluctant Star\" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on June 28, 2016.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and relationships.\nIn September 1951, Caron married American George Hormel II, a grandson of George A. Hormel, the founder of the Hormel meat-packing company. They divorced in 1954. During that period, while under contract to MGM, she lived in Laurel Canyon in a Normandie style 1927 mansion near the country store on Laurel Canyon Blvd. One bedroom was all mirrored for her dancing rehearsals. \nHer second husband was British theatre director Peter Hall. They married in 1956 and had two children: Christopher John Hall, a television drama producer, and Jennifer Caron Hall, a writer, painter and actress. Her son-in-law, married to Jennifer, is Glenn Wilhide, a producer and screenwriter. Caron had an affair with Warren Beatty in 1961. When she and Hall divorced in 1965, Beatty was named as a co-respondent and was ordered by the London court to pay the costs of the case. In 1969, Caron married Michael Laughlin, the producer of the film \"Two-Lane Blacktop;\" the couple divorced in 1980. Caron was also romantically linked to Dutch television actor Robert Wolders from 1994 to 1995.\nFamily and interests.\nFrom 1981, she rented and lived for a few years in a mill (the \"Moulin Neuf\") in the French village of Chaumot, Yonne, which had belonged to Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony in the late 18th century and which depended on his princely castle. From June 1993 until September 2009, Caron owned and operated the hotel and restaurant \"Auberge la Lucarne aux Chouettes\" (The Owls' Nest), in Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, about south of Paris. Caron's mother had committed suicide in her 60s; suffering from a lifetime of depression, Caron also considered doing so in 1995. She was hospitalized for a month and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous. Unhappy with the lack of acting opportunities in France, she returned to England in 2013.\nIn her autobiography, \"Thank Heaven\", she states that she obtained American citizenship in time to vote for Barack Obama for president. In October 2021, she was chosen to receive the Oldie of the Year Award by The Oldie magazine. It had been initially offered to Queen Elizabeth II, who had declined it on the grounds that she did not meet the criteria, even though she was five years older than Caron.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the three Baltic states, along with Estonia to the north and Lithuania to the south. It borders Russia to the east and Belarus to the southeast and shares a maritime border with Sweden to the west. Latvia covers an area of , with a population of 1.8million. The country has a temperate seasonal climate. Its capital and largest city is Riga. Latvians, who are the titular nation and comprise 65.5% of the country's population, belong to the ethnolinguistic group of the Balts and speak Latvian. Russians are the most prominent minority in the country, at almost a quarter of the population; 37.7% of the population speak Russian as their native tongue.\nAfter centuries of Teutonic, Swedish, Polish-Lithuanian, and Russian rule, the independent Republic of Latvia was established on 18 November 1918 after breaking away from the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War\u00a0I. The country became increasingly autocratic after the coup in 1934 established the dictatorship of K\u0101rlis Ulmanis. Latvia's \"de facto\" independence was interrupted at the outset of World War\u00a0II, beginning with forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union, followed by the invasion and occupation by Nazi Germany in 1941 and the re-occupation by the Soviets in 1944, which formed the Latvian SSR for the next 45 years. As a result of extensive immigration during the Soviet occupation, ethnic Russians became the most prominent minority in the country. The peaceful Singing Revolution started in 1987 among the Baltic Soviet republics and ended with the restoration of both \"de facto\" and official independence on 21 August 1991. Latvia has since been a democratic unitary parliamentary republic.\nLatvia is a developed country with a high-income, advanced economy ranking 39th in the Human Development Index. It is a member of the European Union, Eurozone, NATO, the Council of Europe, the United Nations, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the International Monetary Fund, the Nordic-Baltic Eight, the Nordic Investment Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the World Trade Organization.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Latvija\" is derived from the name of the ancient Latgalians, one of four Indo-European Baltic tribes (along with Curonians, Selonians and Semigallians), which formed the ethnic core of modern Latvians together with the Finnic Livonians. Henry of Latvia coined the latinisations of the country's name, \"Lettigallia\" and \"Lethia\", both derived from the Latgalians. The terms inspired the variations on the country's name in Romance languages from \"Letonia\" and in several Germanic languages from \"Lettland\".\nHistory.\nAround 3000 BC, the Proto-Baltic ancestors of the Latvian people settled on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. The Balts established trade routes to Rome and Byzantium, trading local amber for precious metals. By 900 AD, four distinct Baltic tribes inhabited Latvia: Curonians, Latgalians, Selonians, Semigallians (in Latvian: \"kur\u0161i\", \"latga\u013ci\", \"s\u0113\u013ci\" and \"zemga\u013ci\"), as well as the Finnic tribe of Livonians (\"l\u012bbie\u0161i\") speaking a Finnic language.\nIn the 12th century in the territory of Latvia, there were lands with their rulers: Vanema, Ventava, Bandava, Piemare, Duvzare, Selen, Koknese, Jersika, T\u0101lava and Atzele.\nMedieval period.\nAlthough the local people had contact with the outside world for centuries, they became more fully integrated into the European socio-political system in the 12th century. The first missionaries, sent by the pope, sailed up the Daugava River in the late 12th century, seeking converts. The local people, however, did not convert to Christianity as readily as the church had hoped.\nGerman crusaders were sent, or more likely decided to go of their own accord as they were known to do. Saint Meinhard of Segeberg arrived in Ik\u0161\u0137ile, in 1184, traveling with merchants to Livonia, on a Catholic mission to convert the population from their original pagan beliefs. Pope Celestine III had called for a crusade against pagans in northern Europe in 1193. When peaceful means of conversion failed to produce results, Meinhard plotted to convert Livonians by force of arms.\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, Germans ruled large parts of what is currently Latvia. The influx of German crusaders especially increased in the second half of the 13th century following the decline and fall of the Crusader States in the Middle East. Together with southern Estonia, these conquered areas formed the crusader state that became known as Terra Mariana (Medieval Latin for \"Land of Mary\") or Livonia. In 1282, Riga, and later the cities of C\u0113sis, Limba\u017ei, Koknese and Valmiera, became part of the Hanseatic League. Riga became an important point of east\u2013west trading and formed close cultural links with western Europe. The first German settlers were knights from northern Germany and citizens of northern German towns who brought their Low German language to the region, which shaped many loanwords in the Latvian language.\nReformation period and Polish and Swedish rule.\nAfter the Livonian War (1558\u20131583), Livonia (northern Latvia and southern Estonia) fell under the hegemony of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The lands were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Duchy of Livonia (\"Ducatus Livoniae Ultradunensis\"). Gotthard Kettler, the last master of the Order of Livonia, formed the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. Though the duchy was a vassal state to the Lithuanian Grand Duchy and later of Poland\u2013Lithuania, it retained a considerable degree of autonomy and experienced a golden age in the 16th century. Latgalia, the easternmost region of Latvia, became a part of the Inflanty Voivodeship of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn the 17th and early 18th centuries, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Sweden, and Russia struggled for supremacy in the eastern Baltic. After the Polish\u2013Swedish War, northern Livonia (including Vidzeme) came under Swedish rule. Riga became the capital of Swedish Livonia and the largest city in the entire Swedish Empire. Fighting continued sporadically between Sweden and Poland until the Truce of Altmark in 1629. In Latvia, the Swedish period is generally remembered as positive; serfdom was eased, a network of schools was established for the peasantry, and the power of the regional barons was diminished.\nSeveral important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted Lutheranism as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs, and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the Latvian people, speaking one Latvian language. An actual Latvian state had not been established, so the borders and definitions of who fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of Latvia, southern Latgallians adopted Catholicism under Polish/Jesuit influence. The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords.\nLivonia and Courland in the Russian Empire.\nDuring the Great Northern War (1700\u20131721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague. Half the residents of Riga were killed by plague in 1710\u20131711. The capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad, ending the Great Northern War in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the Riga Governorate). The Latgale region remained part of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth as Inflanty Voivodeship until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, was annexed by Russia in 1795 in the Third Partition of Poland, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the Russian Empire. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local official language and their own parliament, the Landtag.\nThe emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819. In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility, as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates \"of their own free will\". During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom \u2013 ports were expanded (Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire), railways built; new factories, banks, and a university were established; many residential, public (theatres and museums), and school buildings were erected; new parks formed; and so on. Riga's boulevards and some streets outside the Old Town date from this period. Numeracy was also higher in the Livonian and Courlandian parts of the Russian Empire, which may have been influenced by the Protestant religion of the inhabitants.\nDuring the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically. A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained. Many Latvians left for the cities and sought education and industrial jobs. There also developed a growing urban proletariat and an increasingly influential Latvian bourgeoisie. The Young Latvian () movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the Slavophiles for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order. The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the First National Awakening. Russification began in Latgale after the Polish led the January Uprising in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s. The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the New Current, a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s. Popular discontent exploded in the 1905 Russian Revolution, which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.\nDeclaration of independence and interwar period.\nWorld War I devastated the territory and other western parts of the Russian Empire. Demands for self-determination were initially confined to autonomy, until a power vacuum was created by the Russian Revolution in 1917, followed by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Russia and Germany in March 1918, then the Allied armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. The People's Council of Latvia proclaimed the independence, and K\u0101rlis Ulmanis was entrusted to set up a government and he took the position of prime minister. The general representative of Germany August Winnig formally handed over political power to the Latvian provisional government on 26 November, and he became its first prime minister.\nThe war of independence that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments: the provisional government headed by Ulmanis, supported by the Tautas padome and the Inter-Allied Commission of Control; the Latvian Soviet government led by P\u0113teris Stu\u010dka, supported by the Red Army; and the provisional government headed by Andrievs Niedra, supported by Baltic-German forces composed of the \"Baltische Landeswehr\" (\"Baltic Defence Force\") and the Freikorps formation \"Eiserne Division\" (\"Iron Division\"). Estonian and Latvian forces defeated the Germans at the Battle of Wenden in June 1919, and a massive attack by a predominantly German force\u2014the West Russian Volunteer Army\u2014under Pavel Bermondt-Avalov was repelled in November. Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the Battle of Daugavpils was a part of the Polish\u2013Soviet War).\nA freely elected constituent assembly convened on 1 May 1920 and adopted a liberal constitution, the \"Satversme\", in February 1922. On 15 May 1934, Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup, establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940. After 1934, Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of \"Latvianising\" the economy. The constitution was partly suspended by Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today. With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical land reform was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.\nOccupations, 1940\u20131990.\nEarly in the morning of 24 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\". In the north, Latvia, Finland and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.\nAfter the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis's government and Nazi Germany under the Heim ins Reich programme. Most of those who remained left for Germany in summer 1940, when a second resettlement scheme was agreed. The racially approved being resettled mainly in Poland, being given land and businesses in exchange for the money they had received from the sale of their previous assets.\nOn 5 October 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a \"mutual assistance\" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory. State administrators were murdered and replaced by Soviet cadres. Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions. The resulting people's assembly immediately requested admission into the USSR, which the Soviet Union granted. Latvia, then a puppet government, was headed by Augusts Kirhen\u0161teins. The Soviet Union incorporated Latvia on 5 August 1940, as the \"Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.\"\nThe Soviets dealt harshly with their perceived opponents\u00a0\u2013 prior to Operation Barbarossa, in less than a year, at least 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed. Most were deported to Siberia where deaths were estimated at 40 percent.\nOn 22 June 1941, German troops attacked Soviet forces in Operation Barbarossa. There were some spontaneous uprisings by Latvians against the Red Army which helped the Germans. By 29 June Riga was reached and with Soviet troops killed, captured or retreating, Latvia was left under the control of German forces by early July.\nUnder German occupation, Latvia was administered as part of \"Reichskommissariat Ostland\". Latvian paramilitary and Auxiliary Police units established by the occupation authority participated in the Holocaust and other atrocities. 30,000 Jews were shot in Latvia in the autumn of 1941. Another 30,000 Jews from the Riga ghetto were killed in the Rumbula Forest in November and December 1941, to reduce overpopulation in the ghetto and make room for more Jews being brought in from Germany and the West. There was a pause in fighting, apart from partisan activity, until after the siege of Leningrad ended in January 1944, and the Soviet troops advanced, entering Latvia in July and eventually capturing Riga on 13 October 1944.\nThe Soviets reoccupied the country in 1944\u20131945, and further deportations followed as the country was collectivised\nand Sovietised. \nIn the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods. Rural areas were forced into collectivization. An extensive program to impose bilingualism was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favor of using Russian as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belarusian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian. An influx of new colonists, including laborers, administrators, military personnel and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 Russian settlers arrived and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.\nSince Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major machinery factory RAF in Jelgava, electrotechnical factories in Riga, chemical factories in Daugavpils, Valmiera and Olaine\u2014and some food and oil processing plants. Latvia manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods. Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories. To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic. The population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people.\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called glasnost and perestroika. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the Freedom Monument\u2014a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the Popular Front of Latvia, was opposed by the Interfront. The Latvian SSR, along with the other Baltic Republics was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war Flag of Latvia flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990. In 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a resolution on the \"Occupation of the Baltic states\", in which it declared the occupation \"not in accordance with law\", and not the \"will of the Soviet people\". Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the Supreme Council in the March 1990 democratic elections.\n1990\u2013present.\nOn 4 May 1990, the Supreme Council adopted the Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia, and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia.\nHowever, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia.\nThe Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship, however, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. Instead, citizenship was granted to persons who had been citizens of Latvia on the day of loss of independence in 1940 as well as their descendants. As a consequence, the majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship since neither they nor their parents had ever been citizens of Latvia, becoming non-citizens or citizens of other former Soviet republics. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalization exams and received Latvian citizenship, but in 2015 there were still 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represented 14.1% of the population. They have no citizenship of any country, and cannot participate in the parliamentary elections. Children born to non-nationals or stateless persons after the re-establishment of independence on 21 August 1991 are automatically entitled to citizenship.\nThe Republic of Latvia declared the end of the transitional period and restored full independence on 21 August 1991, in the aftermath of the failed Soviet coup attempt. Latvia resumed diplomatic relations with Western states, including Sweden. The Saeima, Latvia's parliament, was again elected in 1993. Russia ended its military presence by completing its troop withdrawal in 1994 and shutting down the Skrunda-1 radar station in 1998.\nThe major goals of Latvia in the 1990s, to join NATO and the European Union, were achieved in 2004. The NATO Summit 2006 was held in Riga. Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga was President of Latvia from 1999 until 2007. She was the first female head of state in the former Soviet bloc state and was active in Latvia joining both NATO and the European Union in 2004. Latvia signed the Schengen agreement on 16 April 2003 and started its implementation on 21 December 2007.\nApproximately 72% of Latvian citizens are Latvian, while 20% are Russian. The government denationalized private property confiscated by the Soviets, returning it or compensating the owners for it, and privatized most state-owned industries, reintroducing the prewar currency. Latvia is one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union, despite its difficult re-orientation towards Western Europe and economic liberalization. In November 2013, the roof collapsed at a shopping center in Riga, causing Latvia's worst post-independence disaster with the deaths of 54 rush hour shoppers and rescue personnel.\nIn late 2018 the National Archives of Latvia released a full alphabetical index of some 10,000 people recruited as agents or informants by the Soviet KGB. The publication took place after two decades of public debate, as well as the passage of a special law. As a result, the names, code names, birthplaces, and other data on active and former KGB agents (as of 1991, when Latvia regained independence) were revealed.\nIn May 2023, the parliament elected Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds as new President of Latvia, making him the European Union's first openly gay head of state. After years of debates, Latvia ratified the EU \"Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence\", otherwise known as the Istanbul Convention in November 2023.\nGeography.\nLatvia lies in Northern Europe, on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea and northwestern part of the East European Craton (EEC), between latitudes 55\u00b0 and 58\u00b0 N (a small area is north of 58\u00b0), and longitudes 21\u00b0 and 29\u00b0 E (a small area is west of 21\u00b0). Latvia has a total area of of which land, agricultural land, forest land and inland water.\nThe total length of Latvia's boundary is . The total length of its land boundary is , of which is shared with Estonia to the north, with the Russian Federation to the east, with Belarus to the southeast and with Lithuania to the south. The total length of its maritime boundary is , which is shared with Estonia, Sweden and Lithuania. Extension from north to south is and from west to east .\nMost of Latvia's territory is less than above sea level. Its largest lake, Lub\u0101ns, has an area of , its deepest lake, Dr\u012bdzis, is deep. The longest river on Latvian territory is the Gauja, at in length. The longest river flowing through Latvian territory is the Daugava, which has a total length of , of which is on Latvian territory. Latvia's highest point is Gaizi\u0146kalns, . The length of Latvia's Baltic coastline is . An inlet of the Baltic Sea, the shallow Gulf of Riga is situated in the northwest of the country.\nClimate.\nLatvia has a temperate climate that has been described in various sources as either humid continental () or oceanic/maritime (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfb\").\nCoastal regions, especially the western coast of the Courland Peninsula, possess a more maritime climate with cooler summers and milder winters, while eastern parts exhibit a more continental climate with warmer summers and harsher winters. Nevertheless, the temperature variations are little as the territory of Latvia is relatively small. Moreover, Latvia's terrain is particularly flat (no more than 350 meters high), thus the Latvian climate is not differentiated by altitude.\nLatvia has four pronounced seasons of near-equal length. Winter starts in mid-December and lasts until mid-March. Winters have average temperatures of and are characterized by stable snow cover, bright sunshine, and short days. Severe spells of winter weather with cold winds, extreme temperatures of around and heavy snowfalls are common. Summer starts in June and lasts until August. Summers are usually warm and sunny, with cool evenings and nights. Summers have average temperatures of around , with extremes of . Spring and autumn bring fairly mild weather.\n2019 was the warmest year in the history of weather observation in Latvia with an average temperature +8.1\u00a0\u00b0C higher.\nEnvironment.\nMost of the country is composed of fertile lowland plains and moderate hills. In a typical Latvian landscape, a mosaic of vast forests alternates with fields, farmsteads, and pastures. Arable land is spotted with birch groves and wooded clusters, which afford a habitat for numerous plants and animals. Latvia has hundreds of kilometres of undeveloped seashore\u2014lined by pine forests, dunes, and continuous white sand beaches.\nLatvia has the fifth highest proportion of land covered by forests in the European Union, after Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Slovenia. Forests account for or 56% of the total land area.\nLatvia has over 12,500 rivers, which stretch for . Major rivers include the Daugava River, Lielupe, Gauja, Venta, and Salaca, the largest spawning ground for salmon in the eastern Baltic states. There are 2,256 lakes that are bigger than , with a collective area of . Mires occupy 9.9% of Latvia's territory. Of these, 42% are raised bogs; 49% are fens; and 9% are transitional mires. 70% percent of the mires are untouched by civilization, and they are a refuge for many rare species of plants and animals.\nAgricultural areas account for or 29% of the total land area. With the dismantling of collective farms, the area devoted to farming decreased dramatically \u2013 now farms are predominantly small. Approximately 200 farms, occupying , are engaged in ecologically pure farming (using no artificial fertilizers or pesticides).\nLatvia's national parks are Gauja National Park in Vidzeme (since 1973), \u0136emeri National Park in Zemgale (1997), Sl\u012btere National Park in Kurzeme (1999), and R\u0101zna National Park in Latgale (2007).\nLatvia has a long tradition of conservation. The first laws and regulations were promulgated in the 16th and 17th centuries. There are 706 specially state-level protected natural areas in Latvia: four national parks, one biosphere reserve, 42 nature parks, nine areas of protected landscapes, 260 nature reserves, four strict nature reserves, 355 nature monuments, seven protected marine areas and 24 microreserves. Nationally protected areas account for or around 20% of Latvia's total land area. Latvia's Red Book (Endangered Species List of Latvia), which was established in 1977, contains 112 plant species and 119 animal species. Latvia has ratified the international Washington, Bern, and Ramsare conventions.\nThe 2012 Environmental Performance Index ranks Latvia second, after Switzerland, based on the environmental performance of the country's policies.\nAccess to biocapacity in Latvia is much higher than world average. In 2016, Latvia had 8.5 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, much more than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In 2016 Latvia used 6.4 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use less biocapacity than Latvia contains. As a result, Latvia is running a biocapacity reserve.\nBiodiversity.\nApproximately 30,000 species of flora and fauna have been registered in Latvia. Larger mammalian wildlife in Latvia include deer, wild boar, moose, lynx, bear, fox, beaver and wolves. Non-marine molluscs of Latvia include 170 species.\nSpecies that are endangered in other European countries but common in Latvia include: black stork (\"Ciconia nigra\"), corncrake (\"Crex crex\"), lesser spotted eagle (\"Aquila pomarina\"), white-backed woodpecker (\"Picoides leucotos\"), Eurasian crane (\"Grus grus\"), Eurasian beaver (\"Castor fiber\"), Eurasian otter (\"Lutra lutra\"), European wolf (\"Canis lupus\") and European lynx (\"Felis lynx\").\nPhytogeographically, Latvia is shared between the Central European and Northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Latvia belongs to the ecoregion of Sarmatic mixed forests. 56 percent of Latvia's territory is covered by forests, mostly Scots pine, birch, and Norway spruce. It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 2.09/10, ranking it 159th globally out of 172 countries.\nSeveral species of flora and fauna are considered national symbols. Oak (\"Quercus robur\", ), and linden (\"Tilia cordata\", ) are Latvia's national trees and the daisy (\"Leucanthemum vulgare\", ) its national flower. The white wagtail (\"Motacilla alba\", ) is Latvia's national bird. Its national insect is the two-spot ladybird (\"Adalia bipunctata\", ). Amber, fossilized tree resin, is one of Latvia's most important cultural symbols. In ancient times, amber found along the Baltic Sea coast was sought by Vikings as well as traders from Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire. This led to the development of the Amber Road.\nSeveral nature reserves protect unspoiled landscapes with a variety of large animals. At Pape Nature Reserve, where European bison, wild horses, and recreated aurochs have been reintroduced, there is now an almost complete Holocene megafauna also including moose, deer, and wolf.\nGovernment and politics.\nPolitics in Latvia operate under a framework laid out in the Constitution of Latvia. \nGovernment.\nA unicameral parliament, called the \"Saeima,\" is the legislature of the Republic of Latvia. The Saeima is also responsible for adopting the state's budgets, approving the state's accounts, appointing and exercising control of the Government, and taking part in international co-operation. Bills may be initiated by the Government or by members of parliament.\nLatvia is a representative democracy with universal suffrage. Membership of the Saeima is based on proportional representation of political parties, with a 5% electoral threshold. Latvia elects 100 members to the Saeima. Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the prime minister to ask the president to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a vote of no confidence, the Saeima may force a single minister or an entire government to resign.\nThe Government of Latvia operates as a cabinet government, where executive authority is exercised by the prime minister and other cabinet ministers, who head ministries. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Latvia. The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of a majority in the Saeima; this is often the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Saeima has often been ruled by coalition governments, themselves usually minority governments dependent on non-government parties.\nThe president is elected by the \"Saeima\" in a separate election, also held every four years. The president appoints a prime minister who, together with his cabinet, forms the executive branch of the government, which has to receive a confidence vote by the \"Saeima\". This system also existed before World War II. The most senior civil servants are the thirteen Secretaries of State.\nFollowing the October 2022 Latvian parliamentary election, Prime Minister Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 formed the Second Kari\u0146\u0161 cabinet in December 2022, a coalition of New Unity, National Alliance, and United List. On 14 August 2023, Kari\u0146\u0161 resigned, citing National Alliance's opposition to expanding the coalition to include The Progressives and the Union of Greens and Farmers. The Sili\u0146a cabinet, comprising New Unity, Union of Greens and Farmers, and The Progressives, was sworn in on 15 September 2023.\nAccording to International IDEA\u2019s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Latvia performs in the high range on overall democratic measures, with particular weaknesses in inclusive suffrage, electoral participation, and civic engagement.\nAdministrative divisions.\nLatvia is a unitary state, currently divided into 43 local government units consisting of 36 municipalities () and 7 state cities () with their own city council and administration: Daugavpils, Jelgava, J\u016brmala, Liep\u0101ja, R\u0113zekne, Riga, and Ventspils. There are four historical and cultural regions in Latvia\u00a0\u2013 Courland, Latgale, Vidzeme, Zemgale, which are recognised in the Constitution of Latvia. Selonia, a part of Zemgale, is sometimes considered culturally distinct region, but it is not part of any formal division. The borders of historical and cultural regions usually are not explicitly defined and in several sources may vary. In formal divisions, Riga region, which includes the capital and parts of other regions that have a strong relationship with the capital, is also often included in regional divisions; e.g., there are five planning regions of Latvia (), which were created in 2009 to promote balanced development of all regions. Under this division Riga region includes large parts of what traditionally is considered Vidzeme, Courland, and Zemgale. Statistical regions of Latvia, established in accordance with the EU Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, duplicate this division.\nThe largest city in Latvia is Riga, the second largest city is Daugavpils and the third largest city is Liepaja.\nPolitical culture.\nIn 2010 parliamentary election ruling centre-right coalition won 63 out of 100 parliamentary seats. Left-wing opposition Harmony Centre supported by Latvia's Russian-speaking minority got 29 seats. In November 2013, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, in office since 2009, resigned after at least 54 people were killed and dozens injured in the collapse at a supermarket in Riga.\nIn 2014 parliamentary election was won again by the ruling centre-right coalition formed by the Unity Party, the National Alliance and the Union of Greens and Farmers. They got 61 seats and Harmony got 24. In December 2015, country's first female prime minister, in office since January 2014, Laimdota Straujuma resigned. In February 2016, a coalition of Union of Greens and Farmers, The Unity and National Alliance was formed by new Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis.\nIn 2018 parliamentary election pro-Russian Harmony was again the biggest party securing 23 out of 100 seats, the second and third were the new populist parties KPV LV and New Conservative Party. Ruling coalition, comprising the Union of Greens and Farmers, the National Alliance and the Unity party, lost. In January 2019, Latvia got a government led by new Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins of the centre-right New Unity. Karins' coalition was formed by five of the seven parties in parliament, excluding only the pro-Russia Harmony party and the Union of Greens and Farmers. On 15 September 2023, Evika Sili\u0146a became the new prime minister of Latvia, following resignation of former Prime Minister Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161 previous month. Sili\u0146a's government is a three-party coalition between her own New Unity (JV) party, the Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS), and the social-democratic Progressives (PRO) with total 52 of 100 seats in the parliament.\nForeign relations.\nLatvia is a member of the United Nations, European Union, Council of Europe, NATO, OECD, OSCE, IMF, and WTO. It is also a member of the Council of the Baltic Sea States and Nordic Investment Bank. It was a member of the League of Nations (1921\u20131946). Latvia is part of the Schengen Area and joined the Eurozone on 1 January 2014.\nLatvia has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries. It has 44 diplomatic and consular missions and maintains 34 embassies and 9 permanent representations abroad. There are 37 foreign embassies and 11 international organisations in Latvia's capital Riga. Latvia hosts one European Union institution, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC).\nLatvia's foreign policy priorities include co-operation in the Baltic Sea region, European integration, active involvement in international organisations, contribution to European and transatlantic security and defence structures, participation in international civilian and military peacekeeping operations, and development co-operation, particularly the strengthening of stability and democracy in the EU's Eastern Partnership countries.\nSince the early 1990s, Latvia has been involved in active trilateral Baltic states co-operation with its neighbours Estonia and Lithuania, and Nordic-Baltic co-operation with the Nordic countries. Latvia is a member of the interparliamentary Baltic Assembly, the intergovernmental Baltic Council of Ministers and the Council of the Baltic Sea States. Nordic-Baltic Eight (NB-8) is the joint co-operation of the governments of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden. Nordic-Baltic Six (NB-6), comprising Nordic-Baltic countries that are European Union member states, is a framework for meetings on EU-related issues. Interparliamentary co-operation between the Baltic Assembly and Nordic Council was signed in 1992 and since 2006 annual meetings are held as well as regular meetings on other levels. Joint Nordic-Baltic co-operation initiatives include the education programme NordPlus and mobility programmes for public administration, business and industry and culture. The Nordic Council of Ministers has an office in Riga.\nLatvia participates in the Northern Dimension and Baltic Sea Region Programme, European Union initiatives to foster cross-border co-operation in the Baltic Sea region and Northern Europe. The secretariat of the Northern Dimension Partnership on Culture (NDPC) will be located in Riga. In 2013 Riga hosted the annual Northern Future Forum, a two-day informal meeting of the prime ministers of the Nordic-Baltic countries and the UK. The Enhanced Partnership in Northern Europe or \"e-Pine\" is the U.S. Department of State diplomatic framework for co-operation with the Nordic-Baltic countries.\nLatvia hosted the 2006 NATO Summit and since then the annual Riga Conference has become a leading foreign and security policy forum in Northern Europe. Latvia held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2015.\nSince February 2022 Latvia's relations with Russia have deteriorated to the extent that Latvia withdrew its ambassador from Russia and expelled Russia's ambassador to Latvia in January 2023 and banned Russians from entering Latvia.\nMilitary.\nThe National Armed Forces (Latvian: \"Nacion\u0101lie bru\u0146otie sp\u0113ki (NAF)\") of Latvia consists of the Land Forces, Naval Forces, Air Force, National Guard, Special Tasks Unit, Military Police, NAF staff Battalion, Training and Doctrine Command, and Logistics Command. Latvia's defence concept is based upon the Swedish-Finnish model of a rapid response force composed of a mobilisation base and a small group of career professionals. From 1 January 2007, Latvia switched to a professional fully contract-based army.\nLatvia participates in international peacekeeping and security operations. Latvian armed forces have contributed to NATO and EU military operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1996\u20132009), Albania (1999), Kosovo (2000\u20132009), Macedonia (2003), Iraq (2005\u20132006), Afghanistan (since 2003), Somalia (since 2011) and Mali (since 2013). Latvia also took part in the US-led Multi-National Force operation in Iraq (2003\u20132008) and OSCE missions in Georgia, Kosovo and Macedonia. Latvian armed forces contributed to a UK-led Battlegroup in 2013 and the Nordic Battlegroup in 2015 under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the European Union. Latvia acts as the lead nation in the coordination of the Northern Distribution Network for transportation of non-lethal ISAF cargo by air and rail to Afghanistan. It is part of the Nordic Transition Support Unit (NTSU), which renders joint force contributions in support of Afghan security structures ahead of the withdrawal of Nordic and Baltic ISAF forces in 2014. Since 1996 more than 3600 military personnel have participated in international operations, of whom 7 soldiers perished. Per capita, Latvia is one of the largest contributors to international military operations.\nLatvian civilian experts have contributed to EU civilian missions: border assistance mission to Moldova and Ukraine (2005\u20132009), rule of law missions in Iraq (2006 and 2007) and Kosovo (since 2008), police mission in Afghanistan (since 2007) and monitoring mission in Georgia (since 2008).\nSince March 2004, when the Baltic states joined NATO, fighter jets of NATO members have been deployed on a rotational basis for the Baltic Air Policing mission at \u0160iauliai Airport in Lithuania to guard the Baltic airspace. Latvia participates in several NATO Centres of Excellence: Civil-Military Co-operation in the Netherlands, Cooperative Cyber Defence in Estonia and Energy Security in Lithuania. It plans to establish the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence in Riga.\nLatvia co-operates with Estonia and Lithuania in several trilateral Baltic defence co-operation initiatives:\nFuture co-operation will include sharing of national infrastructures for training purposes and specialisation of training areas \"(BALTTRAIN)\" and collective formation of battalion-sized contingents for use in the NATO rapid-response force. In January 2011, the Baltic states were invited to join Nordic Defence Cooperation, the defence framework of the Nordic countries. In November 2012, the three countries agreed to create a joint military staff in 2013.\nOn 21 April 2022, Latvian Saeima passed amendments developed by the Ministry of Defence for the legislative draft Amendments to the Law on Financing of National Defence, which provide for gradual increase in the defence budget to 2.5% of the country's GDP over the course of the next three year.\nHuman rights.\nAccording to the reports by Freedom House and the US Department of State, human rights in Latvia are generally respected by the government: Latvia is ranked above-average among the world's sovereign states in democracy, press freedom, privacy and human development.\nMore than 56% of leading positions are held by women in Latvia, which ranks first in Europe; Latvia ranks first in the world in women's rights sharing the position with five other European countries according to World Bank.\nThe country has a large ethnic Russian community, which was guaranteed basic rights under the constitution and international human rights laws ratified by the Latvian government.\nApproximately 206,000 non-citizens\u00a0\u2013 including stateless persons\u00a0\u2013 have limited access to some political rights \u2013 only citizens are allowed to participate in parliamentary or municipal elections, although there are no limitations in regards to joining political parties or other political organizations. In 2011, the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities \"urged Latvia to allow non-citizens to vote in municipal elections.\" Additionally, there have been reports of police abuse of detainees and arrestees, poor prison conditions and overcrowding, judicial corruption, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and societal violence and incidents of government discrimination against homosexuals. Same-sex marriage is constitutionally prohibited in Latvia, but same-sex civil unions are recognized.\nEconomy.\nLatvia is a member of the World Trade Organization (1999) and the European Union (2004). On 1 January 2014, the euro became the country's currency, superseding the Lats. According to statistics in late 2013, 45% of the population supported the introduction of the euro, while 52% opposed it. Following the introduction of the Euro, Eurobarometer surveys in January 2014 showed support for the euro to be around 53%, close to the European average.\nSince the year 2000, Latvia has had one of the highest (GDP) growth rates in Europe. However, the chiefly consumption-driven growth in Latvia resulted in the collapse of Latvian GDP in late 2008 and early 2009, exacerbated by the global economic crisis, shortage of credit and huge money resources used for the bailout of Parex Bank. The Latvian economy fell 18% in the first three months of 2009, the biggest fall in the European Union.\nThe economic crisis of 2009 proved earlier assumptions that the fast-growing economy was heading for implosion of the economic bubble, because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic consumption, financed by a serious increase of private debt, as well as a negative foreign trade balance. The prices of real estate, which rose 150% from 2004 to 2006, was a significant contributor to the economic bubble.\nPrivatisation in Latvia is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been privatised, leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies. The private sector accounted for 70% of the country's GDP in 2006. \nForeign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in north-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of Latvia's total foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. In the same year, the United States of America exported $58.2 million of goods and services to Latvia and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic institutions like the World Trade Organization, OECD, and the European Union, Latvia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995\u2014with a 4-year transition period. Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment, trade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation.\nIn 2010, Latvia launched a Residence by Investment program (Golden Visa) in order to attract foreign investors and make local economy benefit from it. This program allows investors to get a Latvian residence permit by investing at least \u20ac250,000 in property or in an enterprise with at least 50 employees and an annual turnover of at least \u20ac10M.\nThe Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values. The national account deficit for 2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while inflation was running at 10%.\nLatvia's unemployment rate rose sharply in this period from a low of 5.4% in November 2007 to over 22%. In April 2010 Latvia had the highest unemployment rate in the EU, at 22.5%, ahead of Spain, which had 19.7%.\nPaul Krugman, the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008, wrote in his New York Times Op-Ed column on 15 December 2008:\nThe most acute problems are on Europe's periphery, where many smaller economies are experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America and Asia: Latvia is the new Argentina\nHowever, by 2010, commentators noted signs of stabilisation in the Latvian economy. Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's raised its outlook on Latvia's debt from negative to stable. Latvia's current account, which had been in deficit by 27% in late 2006 was in surplus in February 2010. Kenneth Orchard, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service argued that:\nThe strengthening regional economy is supporting Latvian production and exports, while the sharp swing in the current account balance suggests that the country's 'internal devaluation' is working.\nThe IMF concluded the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia in July 2012 announcing that Latvia's economy has been recovering strongly since 2010, following the deep downturn in 2008\u201309. Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 was underpinned by export growth and a recovery in domestic demand. The growth momentum has continued into 2012 and 2013 despite deteriorating external conditions, and the economy is expected to expand by 4.1 percent in 2014. The unemployment rate has receded from its peak of more than 20 percent in 2010 to around 9.3 percent in 2014.\nGDP at current prices rose from \u20ac23.7 billion in 2014 to \u20ac30.5 billion in 2019. The employment rate rose in the same period from 59.1% to 65% with unemployment falling from 10.8% to 6.5%.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nThe transport sector is around 14% of GDP. Transit between Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan as well as other Asian countries and the West used to be large.\nThe four biggest ports of Latvia are located in Riga, Ventspils, Liep\u0101ja and Skulte. Most transit traffic uses these and half the cargo is crude oil and oil products. Free port of Ventspils is one of the busiest ports in the Baltic states. Apart from road and railway connections, Ventspils is also linked to oil extraction fields and prior to 2022, transportation routes of Russian Federation via system of two pipelines from Polotsk, Belarus.\nRiga International Airport is the busiest airport in the Baltic states with 7.8 million passengers in 2019. It has direct flight to over 80 destinations in 30 countries. The only other airport handling regular commercial flights is Liep\u0101ja International Airport.\nairBaltic is the Latvian flag carrier airline and a low-cost carrier with hubs in all three Baltic States, but main base in Riga, Latvia.\nLatvian Railway's main network consists of 1,860\u00a0km of which 1,826\u00a0km is 1,520\u00a0mm Russian gauge railway of which 251\u00a0km are electrified, making it the longest railway network in the Baltic States. Latvia's railway network is currently incompatible with European standard gauge lines. However, Rail Baltica railway, linking Helsinki-Tallinn-Riga-Kaunas-Warsaw is under construction and is set to be completed in 2026.\nNational road network in Latvia totals 1675\u00a0km of main roads, 5473\u00a0km of regional roads and 13 064\u00a0km of local roads. Municipal roads in Latvia totals 30 439\u00a0km of roads and 8039\u00a0km of streets. The best known roads are A1 (European route E67), connecting Warsaw and Tallinn, as well as European route E22, connecting Ventspils and Terehova. In 2017 there were a total of 803,546 licensed vehicles in Latvia.\nEnergy.\nLatvia has three large hydroelectric power stations in P\u013cavi\u0146u HES (908 MW), R\u012bgas HES (402 MW) and \u0136eguma HES-2 (248 MW). In recent years a couple of dozen of wind farms as well as biogas or biomass power stations of different scale have been built in Latvia. In 2022, the Latvian Prime Minister announced about the planned investments of 1 billion euros in the new wind farms and the completed project will expectedly provide additional 800 MW of capacity.\nLatvia operates \"In\u010dukalns underground gas storage facility\", one of the largest underground gas storage facilities in Europe and the only one in the Baltic states. Unique geological conditions at In\u010dukalns and other locations in Latvia are particularly suitable for underground gas storage.\nDemographics.\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in 2023 was estimated to be 1.36 children born/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2012, 45.0% of births were to unmarried women. The life expectancy in 2013 was estimated at 73.2 years (68.1 years male, 78.5 years female). As of 2015, Latvia is estimated to have the lowest male-to-female ratio in the world, at 0.85 males per female. In 2017, there were 1,054,433 females and 895,683 males living in Latvian territory. Every year, more boys are born than girls. Up to the age of 39, there are more males than females. Above the age of 70, there are 2.3 times as many females as males.\nEthnic groups.\nIn 2025, Latvians formed about 65.5% of the population, while Russians were 24.1%, Belarusians 2.9%, Ukrainians 2.9%, Poles 1.9%, Lithuanians 1.1%, and other ethnic groups 1.6%.\nIn some cities, including Daugavpils and R\u0113zekne, ethnic Latvians constitute a minority of the total population. Despite a steadily increasing proportion of ethnic Latvians for more than a decade, ethnic Latvians also still make up slightly less than a half of the population of the capital city of Latvia \u2013 Riga.\nThe share of ethnic Latvians declined from 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 52% (1,387,757) in 1989. In the context of a decreasing overall population, there were fewer Latvians in 2011 than in 1989, but their share of the population was larger\u00a0\u2013 1,285,136 (62.1% of the population).\nThe majority of Latvia's population are Latvians, who are an ethnic Baltic people. The country also has a significant Russian minority, as well as smaller populations of Ukrainians, Belarusians, and other Slavic peoples. These ethnic groups are all descended from peoples who settled in Latvia during the centuries of Russian and Soviet rule.\nLatvia's ethnic diversity is a result of a number of factors, including a long history of foreign rule, its location on the Baltic Sea trade route, and its proximity to other Slavic countries. The Russian Empire conquered Latvia in the 18th century and ruled the country for over 200 years. During this time, the Russian authorities encouraged the settlement of Russian colonists in Latvia. After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1918, Latvia became an independent country. However, the country was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and remained under Soviet rule until 1991. The Soviets expelled some groups and resettled others in Latvia, especially Russians. After 1991 many of the expellees returned to Latvia.\nAs a result of deteriorating relations with Russia, Latvia has decided it does not want Russian citizens in Latvia who will not integrate. In late 2023 it is expected that around 5-6,000 Russians will be returned to Russia as they have made little effort to learn the Latvian language, integrate with Latvia, or apply to become Latvian citizens.\nAccording to the European Commission, 5,600 Romani people reside in Latvia. Much of their population was exterminated in the country by the Nazis along with Jews.\nLanguage.\nThe sole official language of Latvia is Latvian, which belongs to the Baltic language sub-group of the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct Livonian language of the Finnic branch of the Uralic language family, which enjoys protection by law; Latgalian\u00a0\u2013 as a dialect of Latvian is also protected by Latvian law but as a historical variation of the Latvian language. Russian, which was widely spoken during the Soviet period, is still the most widely used minority language by far (in 2023, 37.7% spoke it as their mother tongue and 34.6% spoke it at home, including people who were not ethnically Russian). While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian, schools also include English, German, French and Russian in their curricula. English is also widely accepted in Latvia in business and tourism. As of 2014[ [update]] there were 109 schools for minorities that use Russian as the language of instruction (27% of all students) for 40% of subjects (the remaining 60% of subjects are taught in Latvian).\nOn 18 February 2012, Latvia held a constitutional referendum on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language. According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%.\nFrom 2019, instruction in the Russian language was gradually discontinued in private colleges and universities in Latvia, as well as general instruction in Latvian public high schools, except for subjects related to culture and history of the Russian minority, such as Russian language and literature classes. All schools, including pre-schools, still using the Russian language in 2023 need to transition to using Latvian in all classes within three years.\nReligion.\nThe largest religion in Latvia is Christianity (79%). The largest groups as of 2011[ [update]] were:\nIn the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 38% of Latvian citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", while 48% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 11% stated that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force\".\nLutheranism was more prominent before the Soviet occupation, when it was adhered to by about 60% of the population, a reflection of the country's strong historical links with the Nordic countries, and to the influence of the Hansa in particular and Germany in general. Since then, Lutheranism has declined to a slightly greater extent than Catholicism in all three Baltic states. The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. An internal document of 18 March 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in Latvia, but the faith has since experienced a revival.\nThe country's Orthodox Christians belong to the Latvian Orthodox Church, a semi-autonomous body within the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2011, there were 416 religious Jews in Latvia and 319 Muslims in Latvia. As of 2004, there were more than 600 Latvian neopagans, \"Dievturi\" (The Godskeepers), whose religion is based on Latvian mythology. About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion.\nLatvia has been seeking for a number of years to separate the Latvian Orthodox Church from Moscow, stating that longstanding ties to Russia pose \"national security concerns\". This was achieved in September 2022 with a law removing all influence or power over the Orthodox Church from non-Latvians, which would include the patriarch of Moscow.\nEducation and science.\nThe University of Latvia and Riga Technical University are two major universities in the country, both successors to Riga Polytechnical Institute, and located in Riga. Other important universities, which were established on the base of State University of Latvia, include the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies (established in 1939 on the basis of the Faculty of Agriculture) and Riga Stradi\u0146\u0161 University (established in 1950 on the basis of the Faculty of Medicine). Both nowadays cover a variety of different fields. The University of Daugavpils is another significant centre of education.\nLatvia closed 131 schools between 2006 and 2010, which is a 12.9% decline, and in the same period enrolment in educational institutions has fallen by over 54,000 people, a 10.3% decline.\nLatvian policy in science and technology has set out the long-term goal of transitioning from labor-consuming economy to knowledge-based economy. By 2020 the government aims to spend 1.5% of GDP on research and development, with half of the investments coming from the private sector. Latvia plans to base the development of its scientific potential on existing scientific traditions, particularly in organic chemistry, medical chemistry, genetic engineering, physics, materials science and information technologies. The greatest number of patents, both nationwide and abroad, are in medical chemistry. Latvia was ranked 41st in the Global Innovation Index in 2025.\nHealth.\nThe Latvian healthcare system is a universal programme, largely funded through government taxation. It is among the lowest-ranked healthcare systems in Europe, due to excessive waiting times for treatment, insufficient access to the latest medicines, and other factors. There were 59 hospitals in Latvia in 2009, down from 94 in 2007 and 121 in 2006.\nCulture.\nTraditional Latvian folklore, especially the dance of the folk songs, dates back well over a thousand years. More than 1.2 million texts and 30,000 melodies of folk songs have been identified.\nIn the 19th century, Latvian nationalist movements emerged. They promoted Latvian culture and encouraged Latvians to take part in cultural activities. The 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often regarded by Latvians as a classical era of Latvian culture. Posters show the influence of other European cultures, for example, works of artists such as the Baltic-German artist Bernhard Borchert and the French Raoul Dufy. With the onset of World War II, many Latvian artists and other members of the cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work, largely for a Latvian \u00e9migr\u00e9 audience.\nThe Latvian Song and Dance Festival is an important event in Latvian culture and social life. It has been held since 1873, normally every five years. Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event. Folk songs and classical choir songs are sung, with emphasis on a cappella singing, though modern popular songs have recently been incorporated into the repertoire as well.\nAfter incorporation into the Soviet Union, Latvian artists and writers were forced to follow the socialist realism style of art. During the Soviet era, music became increasingly popular, with the most popular being songs from the 1980s. At this time, songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving Latvian identity. This aroused popular protests against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry. Since independence, theatre, scenography, choir music, and classical music have become the most notable branches of Latvian culture.\nDuring July 2014, Riga hosted the eighth World Choir Games as it played host to over 27,000 choristers representing over 450 choirs and over 70 countries. The festival is the biggest of its kind in the world and is held every two years in a different host city.\nStarting in 2019 Latvia hosts the inaugural https:// , a new festival in which world-famous orchestras and conductors perform across four weekends during the summer. The festival takes place at the Latvian National Opera, the Great Guild, and the Great and Small Halls of the Dzintari Concert Hall. This year features the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Russian National Orchestra.\nCuisine.\nLatvian cuisine typically consists of agricultural products, with meat featuring in most main meal dishes. Fish is commonly consumed due to Latvia's location on the Baltic Sea. Latvian cuisine has been influenced by neighbouring countries. Common ingredients in Latvian recipes are found locally, such as potatoes, wheat, barley, cabbage, onions, eggs, and pork. Latvian food is generally quite fatty and uses few spices.\nGrey peas with speck are generally considered as staple foods of Latvians. Sorrel soup (\"sk\u0101be\u0146u zupa\") is also consumed by Latvians. Rye bread is considered the national staple.\nSport.\nIce hockey is usually considered the most popular sport in Latvia. Latvia has had many famous hockey stars like Helmuts Balderis, Art\u016brs Irbe, K\u0101rlis Skrasti\u0146\u0161 and Sandis Ozoli\u0146\u0161 and more recently Zemgus Girgensons, whom the Latvian people have strongly supported in international and NHL play, expressed through the dedication of using the NHL's All Star Voting to bring Zemgus to number one in voting. Dinamo Riga is the country's strongest hockey club, playing in the Latvian Hockey Higher League. The national tournament is the Latvian Hockey Higher League, held since 1931. The 2006 IIHF World Championship was held in Riga.\nThe second most popular sport is basketball. Latvia has a long basketball tradition, as the Latvian national basketball team won the first ever EuroBasket in 1935 and silver medals in 1939, after losing the final to Lithuania by one point. Latvia has had many European basketball stars like J\u0101nis Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161, Maigonis Valdmanis, Valdis Mui\u017enieks, Valdis Valters, Igors Miglinieks, as well as the first Latvian NBA player Gundars V\u0113tra. Andris Biedri\u0146\u0161 is one of the most well-known Latvian basketball players, who played in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors and the Utah Jazz. Current NBA players include Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is, who plays for the Boston Celtics, D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns, who plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Rodions Kurucs, who last played for the Milwaukee Bucks. Former Latvian basketball club R\u012bgas ASK won the Euroleague tournament three times in a row before becoming defunct. Currently, VEF R\u012bga, which competes in EuroCup, is the strongest professional basketball club in Latvia. BK Ventspils, which participates in EuroChallenge, is the second strongest basketball club in Latvia, previously winning LBL eight times and BBL in 2013. Latvia was one of the EuroBasket 2015 hosts and will be one of the hosts once again in 2025.\nOther popular sports include football, floorball, tennis, volleyball, cycling, bobsleigh and skeleton. The Latvian national football team's only major FIFA tournament participation has been the 2004 UEFA European Championship.\nLatvia has participated successfully in both Winter and Summer Olympics. The most successful Olympic athlete in the history of independent Latvia has been M\u0101ris \u0160trombergs, who became a two-time Olympic champion in 2008 and 2012 at Men's BMX.\nIn Boxing, Mairis Briedis is the first and only Latvian to date, to win a boxing world title, having held the WBC cruiserweight title from 2017 to 2018, the WBO cruiserweight title in 2019, and the IBF / The Ring magazine cruiserweight titles in 2020.\nIn 2017, Latvian tennis player Je\u013cena Ostapenko won the 2017 French Open Women's singles title, being the first unseeded player to do so in the open era.\nIn futsal, Latvia will host the UEFA Futsal Euro 2026 alongside Lithuania, their national team will make their debut as co-host.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "17515", "revid": "50436504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17515", "title": "Luxembourg", "text": "Country in Western Europe\nLuxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in Western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France on the south. Its capital and most populous city, Luxembourg City, is one of the four institutional seats of the European Union and hosts several EU institutions, notably the Court of Justice of the European Union, the highest judicial authority in the EU.\nAs part of the Low Countries, Luxembourg has close historic, political, and cultural ties to Belgium and The Netherlands. Luxembourg's culture, people, and languages are greatly influenced by France and Germany: Luxembourgish, a Germanic language, is the only recognized national language of the Luxembourgish people and of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg; French is the sole language for legislation; and both languages along with German are used for administrative matters.\nWith an area of , Luxembourg is Europe's seventh-smallest country. In 2025, it had a population of 681,973, which makes it one of the least-populated countries in Europe, albeit with the highest population growth rate; foreign nationals account for almost half the population. Luxembourg is a representative democracy headed by a constitutional monarch, Grand Duke Guillaume, making it the world's only remaining sovereign grand duchy.\nThe County of Luxembourg was established in the 11th century as a state within the Holy Roman Empire. Its ascension culminated in its monarch, Henry VII, becoming the Holy Roman Emperor in the 14th century. Luxembourg came under Habsburg rule in the 15th century, and was annexed by France in the 18th century. Luxembourg was partitioned three times, reducing its size. Having been restored in 1815 after the defeat of Napoleon, it regained independence in 1867 after the Luxembourg Crisis.\nLuxembourg is a developed country with an advanced economy and one of the world's highest PPP-adjusted GDPs per capita, per the IMF and World Bank. It also ranks highly in terms of life expectancy, human development, and human rights. The historic city of Luxembourg was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the exceptional preservation of its vast fortifications and historic quarters. Luxembourg is a founding member of the European Union, OECD, the United Nations, NATO, and the Benelux. It served on the United Nations Security Council for the first time in 2013 and 2014.\nHistory.\nBefore AD 963.\nThe first traces of settlement in what is now Luxembourg are dated back to the Paleolithic Age, about 35,000 years ago. From the 6th century BC, Celtic tribes settled in the region between the rivers Rhine and Meuse.\nSix centuries later the Romans named the Celtic tribes inhabiting these exact regions collectively as the \"Treveri\". Many examples of archaeological evidence proving their existence in Luxembourg have been discovered, the most famous being the Oppidum of Titelberg.\nIn around 58 to 51 BC, the Romans invaded the country when Julius Caesar conquered Gaul and part of Germania up to the Rhine border, thus the area of what is now Luxembourg became part of the Roman Empire for the next 450 years, living in relative peace under the Pax Romana.\nSimilar to those in Gaul, the Celts of Luxembourg adopted Roman culture, language, morals and a way of life, effectively becoming what historians later described as Gallo-Roman civilization. Evidence from that period includes the Dalheim Ricciacum and the Vichten mosaic, on display at the National Museum of History and Art in Luxembourg City.\nThe territory was infiltrated by the Germanic Franks from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406,65 after which it became part of the Kingdom of the Franks. The Salian Franks who settled in the area are often described as the ones having brought the Germanic language to present-day Luxembourg, since the old Frankish language spoken by them is considered by linguists to be a direct forerunner of the Moselle Franconian dialect, which later evolved into, among others, the modern-day Luxembourgish language.70\nThe Christianization of Luxembourg is usually dated back to the end of the 7th century. The most famous figure in this context is Willibrord, a Northumbrian missionary saint, who together with other monks established the Abbey of Echternach in AD 698, and is celebrated annually in the dancing procession of Echternach. For a few centuries the abbey would become one of northern Europe's most influential abbeys. The Codex Aureus of Echternach, an important surviving codex written entirely in gold ink, was produced here in the 11th century. The so-called Emperor's Bible and the Golden Gospels of Henry III were also produced in Echternach at this time.\nEmergence and expansion (963\u20131312).\nWhen the Carolingian Empire was divided many times starting with the Treaty of Verdun in 843, today's Luxembourgish territory became successively part of the Kingdom of Middle Francia (843\u2013855), the Kingdom of Lotharingia (855\u2013959) and finally of the Duchy of Lorraine (959\u20131059), which itself had become a state of the Holy Roman Empire.\nThe recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of \"Lucilinburhuc\" (today Luxembourg Castle) situated on the Bock rock by Siegfried, Count of the Ardennes, in 963 through an exchange act with St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier. Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the center of a state of great strategic value within the Duchy of Lorraine. Over the years, the fortress was extended by Siegfried's descendants and by 1083, one of them, Conrad I, was the first to call himself a \"Count of Luxembourg\", and with it effectively creating the independent County of Luxembourg (which was still a state within the Holy Roman Empire).\nBy the middle of the 13th century, the counts of Luxembourg had managed to gain considerable wealth and power and had expanded their territory from the river Meuse to the Moselle. By the time of the reign of Henry V the Blonde, Bitburg, La Roche-en-Ardenne, Durbuy, Arlon, Thionville, Marville, Longwy, and in 1264 the competing County of Vianden (and with it St Vith and Schleiden) had either been incorporated directly or become vassal states to the County of Luxembourg. The only major setback during their rise in power came in 1288, when Henry VI and his three brothers died at the Battle of Worringen while trying unsuccessfully to add the Duchy of Limburg to their realm. But despite the defeat, the Battle of Worringen helped the Counts of Luxembourg to achieve military glory, which they had previously lacked, as they had mostly enlarged their territory by means of inheritances, marriages and fiefdoms.\nThe ascension of the Counts of Luxembourg culminated when Henry VII became King of the Romans, King of Italy and finally, in 1312, Holy Roman Emperor.\nGolden Age (1312\u20131443).\nWith the ascension of Henry VII as Emperor, the dynasty of the House of Luxembourg not only began to rule the Holy Roman Empire, but rapidly began to exercise growing influence over other parts of Central Europe as well.\nHenry's son, John the Blind, in addition to being Count of Luxembourg, also became King of Bohemia. He remains a major figure in Luxembourgish history and folklore and is considered by many historians the epitome of chivalry in medieval times. He is also known for having founded the Schueberfouer in 1340 and for his heroic death at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in 1346. John the Blind is considered a national hero in Luxembourg.\nIn the 14th and early 15th centuries, three more members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors and Bohemian Kings: John's descendants Charles IV, Sigismund (who also was King of Hungary and Croatia), and Wenceslaus IV. Charles IV created the long-lasting Golden Bull of 1356, a decree which fixed important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Empire. Luxembourg remained an independent fief (county) of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1354, Charles IV elevated it to the status of a duchy with his half-brother Wenceslaus I becoming the first Duke of Luxembourg. While his kin were occupied ruling and expanding their power within the Holy Roman Empire and elsewhere, Wenceslaus, annexed the County of Chiny in 1364, and with it, the territories of the new Duchy of Luxembourg reached its greatest extent.\nDuring these 130 years, the House of Luxembourg was contending with the House of Habsburg for supremacy within the Holy Roman Empire and Central Europe. It all came to end in 1443, when the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne. Since Sigismund and Elizabeth of G\u00f6rlitz were both heirless, all possessions of the Luxembourg Dynasty were redistributed among the European aristocracy. The Duchy of Luxembourg become a possession of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.\nAs the House of Luxembourg had become extinct and Luxembourg now became part of the Burgundian Netherlands, this would mark the start of nearly 400 years of foreign rule over Luxembourg.\nHabsburg rule and French invasions (1444\u20131794).\nIn 1482, Philip the Handsome inherited all of what became then known as the Habsburg Netherlands, and with it the Duchy of Luxembourg. For nearly 320 years Luxembourg would remain a possession of the mighty House of Habsburg, at first under Austrian rule (1506\u20131556), then under Spanish rule (1556\u20131714), before going back again to Austrian rule (1714\u20131794).\nWith having become a Habsburg possession, the Duchy of Luxembourg became, like many countries in Europe at the time, heavily involved in the many conflicts for dominance of Europe between the Habsburg-held countries and the Kingdom of France.\nIn 1542, the King of France, Fran\u00e7ois I, invaded Luxembourg twice, but the Habsburgs under Charles V managed to reconquer the Duchy each time.\nLuxembourg became part of the Spanish Netherlands in 1556, and when France and Spain went to war in 1635 it resulted in the Treaty of the Pyrenees, in which the first partition of Luxembourg was decided. Under the Treaty, Spain ceded the Luxembourgish fortresses of Stenay, Thionville, and Montm\u00e9dy, and the surrounding territory to France, effectively reducing the size of Luxembourg for the first time in centuries.\nIn context of the Nine Years' War in 1684, France invaded Luxembourg again, conquering and occupying the Duchy until 1697 when it was returned to the Spanish to garner support for the Bourbon cause during the prelude to the War of the Spanish Succession. When the war broke out in 1701 Luxembourg and the Spanish Netherlands were administered by the pro-French faction under the governor Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and sided with the Bourbons. The duchy was subsequently occupied by the pro-Austrian allied forces during the conflict and was awarded to Austria at its conclusion in 1714.\nAs the Duchy of Luxembourg repeatedly passed back and forth from Spanish and Austrian to French rule, each of the conquering nations contributed to strengthening and expanding the Fortress that the Castle of Luxembourg had become over the years. One example of this includes French military engineer Marquis de Vauban who advanced the fortifications around and on the heights of the city, fortification walls that are still visible today.\nFrench rule (1794\u20131815).\nDuring the War of the First Coalition, Revolutionary France invaded the Austrian Netherlands, and with it, Luxembourg. In the years 1793 and 1794 most of the Duchy was conquered relatively quickly and the French Revolutionary Army committed many atrocities and pillages against the Luxembourgish civilian population and abbeys, the most infamous being the massacres of Differdange and Dudelange, as well as the destruction of the abbeys of Clairefontaine, Echternach and Orval. However the Fortress of Luxembourg resisted for nearly 7 months before the Austrian forces holding it surrendered. Luxembourg's long defence led Lazare Carnot to call Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname \"the Gibraltar of the North\".\nLuxembourg was annexed by France, becoming the \"d\u00e9partement des for\u00eats\" (department of forests), and the incorporation of the former Duchy as a \"d\u00e9partement\" into France was formalized at the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797.\nFrom the start of the occupation the new French officials in Luxembourg, who spoke only French, implemented many republican reforms, among them the principle of laicism, which led to an outcry in strongly Catholic Luxembourg. Additionally French was implemented as the only official language and Luxembourgish people were barred access to all civil services. When the French Army introduced military duty for the local population, riots broke out which culminated in 1798 when Luxembourgish peasants started a rebellion. Even though the French managed to rapidly suppress this revolt called \"Kl\u00ebppelkrich\", it had a profound effect on the historical memory of the country and its citizens.\nHowever, many republican ideas of this era continue to have a lasting effect on Luxembourg; one of the many examples features the implementation of the Napoleonic Code Civil which was introduced in 1804 and is still valid today.\nNational awakening (1815\u20131890).\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna decided to restore the Duchy of Luxembourg. However, as the territory had been part of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Habsburgian Netherlands in the past, both the Kingdom of Prussia and the newly formed United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which included both the present Kingdom of the Netherlands and Belgium, now claimed possession of the territory. Thus the great powers decided that Luxembourg would become a member state of the newly formed German Confederation, but at the same time would be joined with the Netherlands in personal union under King William I of the Netherlands, the son of the last Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, William V, Prince of Orange. To satisfy Prussia, it was decided that not only would the Fortress of Luxembourg be manned by Prussian troops, but also that large parts of Luxembourgish territory (mainly the areas around Bitburg and St. Vith) would become Prussian possessions. This marked the second time that the Duchy of Luxembourg was reduced in size and is generally known as the Second Partition of Luxembourg. To compensate the Duchy for this loss, it was decided to elevate the Duchy to a Grand Duchy, thus giving the Dutch monarchs the additional title of Grand Duke of Luxembourg. However, from 1816 to 1830, William I ignored the Duchy's sovereignty, treating Luxembourg as a conquered nation while subjecting Luxembourg to high taxes.\nAfter Belgium became an independent country following the victorious Belgian Revolution of 1830\u20131831, it claimed the entire Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg as being part of Belgium. However, neither the Dutch King, who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, nor Prussia wanted to lose their grip on the mighty fortress of Luxembourg and therefor did not agree with the Belgian claims. The dispute would be resolved at the 1839 Treaty of London, where the Third Partition of Luxembourg was decided. This time the territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country (but also the then Luxembourgish-speaking part of Arelerland) was transferred to the new Kingdom of Belgium under Leopold I of Belgium, thereby giving Luxembourg its modern-day borders. The treaty of 1839 also established full independence of the remaining Germanic-speaking Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.\nIn 1842, Luxembourg joined the German Customs Union (\"Zollverein\"). This resulted in the opening of the German market, the development of Luxembourg's steel industry, and expansion of Luxembourg's railway network from 1855 to 1875.\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and France, as both were unwilling to see the other taking influence over Luxembourg and its mighty fortress, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were reaffirmed by the Second Treaty of London and Prussia was finally willing to withdraw its troops from the Fortress of Luxembourg under the condition that the fortifications would be dismantled. That happened the same year. At the time of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, Luxembourg's neutrality was respected, and neither France nor Germany invaded the country.\nAs a result of the recurring disputes between the major European powers, the people of Luxembourg gradually developed a consciousness of independence and a national awakening took place in the 19th century. The people of Luxembourg began referring to themselves as \"Luxembourgers\", rather than being part of one of the larger surrounding nations. This consciousness of \"Mir w\u00eblle bleiwe wat mir sinn\" (\"\"We want to remain what we are\")\" culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the Dutch monarchy ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of Luxembourg. Beginning with Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg, the Grand-Duchy would have its own monarchy, thus reaffirming its full independence.\nGerman occupations and interwar political crisis (1890\u20131945).\nIn August 1914, during World War I, Imperial Germany violated Luxembourg's neutrality by invading it to defeat France. Nevertheless, despite the German occupation, Luxembourg was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms. Unaware of the fact that Germany secretly planned to annex the Grand-Duchy in case of a German victory (the Septemberprogramm), the Luxembourgish government continued to pursue a policy of strict neutrality. However, the Luxembourgish population did not believe Germany had good intentions, fearing that it would annex Luxembourg. Around 1,000 Luxembourgers served in the French army; their sacrifices have been commemorated at the G\u00eblle Fra.\nAfter the war, Grand-Duchess Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde was seen by many people (including the French and Belgian governments) as having collaborated with the Germans and calls for her abdication and the establishment of a Republic became louder. After the retreat of the German army, communists in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette tried to establish a soviet worker's republic similar to the ones emerging in Germany, but these attempts lasted only two days.\nIn November 1918, a motion in the Chamber of Deputies demanding the abolition of the monarchy was defeated narrowly by 21 votes to 19 (with three abstentions).\nFrance questioned the Luxembourgish government's, and especially Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde's, neutrality during the war, and calls for an annexation of Luxembourg to either France or Belgium grew louder in both countries. In January 1919, a company of the Luxembourgish Army rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, but French troops intervened and put an end to the rebellion. Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, who abdicated in favour of her sister Charlotte 5 days later. The same year, in a popular referendum, 77.8% of the Luxembourgish population declared in favour of maintaining monarchy and rejected the establishment of a republic. During this time, Belgium pushed for an annexation of Luxembourg. However, all such claims were ultimately dismissed at the Paris Peace Conference, thus securing Luxembourg's independence.\nIn 1939, the Luxembourg army increased to 425 due to Nazi Germany presence. On May 9, 1940 Luxembourg closed the defensive Schuster line with Germany; one day later, Luxembourg's neutrality was violated again when Nazi Germany's \"Wehrmacht\" entered the country \"entirely without justification\". In contrast to the First World War, under the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II, the country was treated as German territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of Nazi Germany, Gau Moselland. This time, Luxembourg did not remain neutral as Luxembourg's government in exile based in London supported the Allies, sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion, and multiple resistance groups formed inside the occupied country.\nWith 2.45% of its prewar population killed, and a third of all buildings in Luxembourg being destroyed or heavily damaged (mainly due to the Battle of the Bulge), Luxembourg suffered the highest such loss in Western Europe, but its commitment to the Allied war effort was never questioned. Around 1,000\u20132,500 of Luxembourg's Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.\nRomani people were also exterminated in Luxembourg by the Nazis.\nIntegration into NATO and European Union (1945\u2013).\nThe Grand Duchy became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. Luxembourg's neutral status under the constitution formally ended in 1948, and in April 1949 it also became a founding member of NATO. During the Cold War, Luxembourg continued its involvements on the side of the Western Bloc. In the early fifties a small contingent of troops fought in the Korean War.\nLuxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF.\nIn the 1950s, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Communities, following the 1952 establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, and subsequent 1958 creations of the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community. In 1993, the former two of these were incorporated into the European Union. With Robert Schuman (one of the founding fathers of the EU), Pierre Werner (considered the father of the Euro), Gaston Thorn, Jacques Santer and Jean-Claude Juncker (all former presidents of the European Commission), Luxembourgish politicians contributed substantially to the EU's formation and establishment. In 1999, Luxembourg joined the eurozone. Thereafter, the country was elected non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (2013\u201314).\nThe steel industry exploiting the Red Lands' rich iron-ore grounds in the beginning of the 20th century drove Luxembourg's industrialization. After the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the country focused on establishing itself as a global financial center and developed into the banking hub it is reputed to be. Since the beginning of the 21st century, its governments have focused on developing the country into a knowledge economy, with the founding of the University of Luxembourg and a national space program. In 2020, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to provide free public transport at a national scale.\nOn 19 December 2023, Luxembourg's Chamber of Deputies adopted a law to modernize the current investment tax credit. It took effect less than two weeks later on 1 January 2024.\nGovernment and politics.\nLuxembourg is described as a \"full democracy\", with a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Executive power is exercised by the grand duke and the cabinet, which consists of several members with the titles of minister, minister delegate or secretary of state, who are headed by a Prime Minister. The current Constitution of Luxembourg, the supreme law of Luxembourg, was originally adopted on 17 October 1868. The Constitution was last updated on 1 July 2023.\nThe grand duke has the power to dissolve the legislature, in which case new elections must be held within three months. But since 1919, sovereignty has resided with the nation, exercised by the grand duke in accordance with the Constitution and the law.\nLegislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (\"Conseil d'\u00c9tat\"), composed of 21 members appointed by the grand duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation.\nLuxembourg has three lower tribunals (\"justices de paix\"; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch), and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.\nAccording to International IDEA\u2019s Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices and Democracy Tracker, Luxembourg performs in the high range on overall democratic measures, with particular strengths in elected government, freedom of religion, and freedom of movement.\nAdministrative divisions.\nLuxembourg is divided into 12 cantons, which are further divided into 100 communes. Twelve of the communes have city status; the city of Luxembourg is the largest.\nForeign relations.\nLuxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and economic integration. In 1921, Luxembourg and Belgium formed the Belgium\u2013Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create a regime of inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs. Luxembourg is a member of the Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the Schengen Group (named after the Luxembourg village of Schengen where the agreements were signed). At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy.\nLuxembourg is considered a European capital, and is the site of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the European Investment Bank, the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in Brussels and sometimes in Strasbourg. Luxembourg is also site of the EFTA Court, which is responsible for the three EFTA members who are part of the European Single Market through the EEA Agreement.\nMilitary.\nThe Luxembourgish army is mostly based in its casern, the \"Centre militaire Caserne Grand-Duc Jean\" on the \"H\u00e4rebierg\" in Diekirch. The general staff is based in the capital, the \"\u00c9tat-Major\". The army is under civilian control, with the grand duke as Commander-in-Chief. The Minister for Defense, Yuriko Backes, oversees army operations. The professional head of the army is the Chief of Defense, who answers to the minister and holds the rank of general.\nBeing landlocked, Luxembourg has no navy. Seventeen NATO AWACS aeroplanes are registered as aircraft of Luxembourg. In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane.\nLuxembourg has participated in the Eurocorps, has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR and IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia, and has participated with a small contingent in the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for Kurds and providing emergency supplies to Albania.\nGeography.\nLuxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries, ranking 168th in size of the 194 independent countries of the world; it is about in size, measuring long and wide. It lies between latitudes 49\u00b0 and 51\u00b0 N, and longitudes 5\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 E.\nTo the east, Luxembourg borders the German \"Bundesl\u00e4nder\" of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and to the south, it borders the French \"r\u00e9gion\" of Grand Est (Lorraine). The Grand Duchy borders Belgium's Wallonia, in particular the Belgian provinces of Luxembourg and Li\u00e8ge, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north, respectively.\nThe northern third of the country is known as the \u00c9islek or \"Oesling\", and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange, which is the highest point, at . Other mountains are the Buurgplaatz at near Huldange and the Napol\u00e9onsgaard at near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than five thousand people.\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the Guttland, and is more densely populated than the \u00c9islek. It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Guttland and the \u00c9islek.\nEnvironment.\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking fourth out of 132 assessed countries. In 2020, it ranked second out of 180 countries. Luxembourg also ranks sixth among the top ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer's. The country wants to cut GHG emissions by 55% in 10 years and reach zero emissions by 2050. Luxembourg wants to increase its organic farming fivefold. It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.12/10, ranking it 164th globally out of 172 countries.\nIn 2024, Luxembourg is ranked 2nd in Environmental Performance Index globally.\nClimate.\nLuxembourg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"), marked by high levels of precipitation, particularly in late summer. The summers are warm and winters cool.\nEconomy.\nLuxembourg's stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation. Unemployment is traditionally low, though it reached 6.1% by May 2012 after the Great Recession. In 2011, according to the IMF, Luxembourg was the world's second-richest country, with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $80,119; by 2023 it was ranked first. Its GDP per capita in purchasing power standards was 261% of the EU average (100%) in 2019. Luxembourg ranks 13th in The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, 26th in the United Nations' Human Development Index, and fourth in the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life index. It ranked 23rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2025.\nThe industrial sector, dominated by steel until the 1960s, has since diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During recent decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel production. Services, especially banking and finance, account for the majority of the economic output. Luxembourg is the world's second-largest investment fund center (after the United States), the most important private banking center in the eurozone and Europe's leading center for reinsurance companies. Moreover, Luxembourg's government has aimed to attract Internet startups, with Skype and Amazon being two of the many Internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg. Other high-tech companies have established themselves in Luxembourg, including 3d scanner developer/manufacturer Artec 3D.\nAgriculture employed about 2.1% of Luxembourg's active population in 2010, when there were 2,200 agricultural holdings with an average area per holding of 60 hectares.\nLuxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see Benelux), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European market.\nWith $171\u00a0billion in May 2015, the country ranked 11th in the world in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. However, securities owned by non-Luxembourg residents, but held in custodial accounts in Luxembourg, are included in this figure.\nAs of 2019[ [update]], Luxembourg's public debt totalled $15,687,000,000, or $25,554 per capita. The debt to GDP was 22.10%.\nThe Luxembourg labour market represents 445,000 jobs occupied by 120,000 Luxembourgers, 120,000 foreign residents and 205,000 cross-border commuters. The latter pay their taxes in Luxembourg, but their education is partially financed by their country of residence. Luxembourg's government has never shared its tax revenues with the local authorities on the French border. This system is seen by some as one of the keys to Luxembourg's economic growth, but at the expense of the border countries.\nLuxembourg as a tax haven.\nIn April 2009, concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, as well as its reputation as a tax haven, led to its being added to a \"gray list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20. In response, the country soon adopted OECD standards on exchange of information and was subsequently added into the category of \"jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard\". In March 2010, the \"Sunday Telegraph\" reported that most of Kim Jong Il's $4\u00a0billion in secret accounts was in Luxembourg banks. Amazon.co.uk also benefits from Luxembourg tax loopholes by channelling substantial UK revenues, as reported by \"The Guardian\" in April 2012. Luxembourg ranked third on the Tax Justice Network's 2011 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's major tax havens, scoring only slightly behind the Cayman Islands. In 2013, Luxembourg was ranked the second safest tax haven in the world, behind Switzerland.\nIn early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the European Commission, Luxembourg's former Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was hit by media disclosures\u2014derived from a document leak known as LuxLeaks\u2014that Luxembourg had turned into a major European center of corporate tax avoidance under his premiership.\nInfrastructure.\nTransport.\nLuxembourg has road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernized in recent years with of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened in 2008. Luxembourg City reintroduced trams in December 2017 and there are plans to open light-rail lines to connect Luxembourg City with Esch-sur-Alzette by 2030.\nThere are 681 cars per 1000 persons in Luxembourg\u2014higher than in most other states, though surpassed by the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and other small states like the Principality of Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and Brunei.\nOn 29 February 2020, Luxembourg became the first country to introduce no-charge public transportation, which is almost completely funded by public taxation. Ridership of buses, trains and trams has grown consistently since, though operating costs had nearly doubled by 2025.\nCommunications.\nThe telecommunications industry in Luxembourg is liberalized and the electronic communications networks are significantly developed. Competition between the different operators is guaranteed by the legislative framework Paquet Telecom of the Government of 2011 which transposes the European Telecom Directives into Luxembourgish law. This encourages the investment in networks and services. The regulator ILR \u2013 Institut Luxembourgeois de R\u00e9gulation ensures the compliance to these legal rules.\nLuxembourg has modern and widely deployed optical fibre and cable networks throughout the country. In 2010, the Luxembourg Government launched its National strategy for very high-speed networks with the aim to become a global leader in terms of very high-speed broadband by achieving full 1\u00a0Gbit/s coverage of the country by 2020. In 2011, Luxembourg had an NGA coverage of 75%. In April 2013, Luxembourg featured the sixth highest download speed worldwide and the second highest in Europe: 32,46\u00a0Mbit/s. The country's location in Central Europe, stable economy and low taxes favour the telecommunication industry.\nIt ranks second in the world in the development of the Information and Communication Technologies in the ITU ICT Development Index and 8th in the Global Broadband Quality Study 2009 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo.\nLuxembourg is connected to all major European Internet Exchanges (AMS-IX Amsterdam, DE-CIX Frankfurt, LINX London), datacenters and POPs through redundant optical networks. In addition, the country is connected to the virtual meetme room services (vmmr) of the international data hub operator Ancotel. This enables Luxembourg to interconnect with all major telecommunication operators and data carriers worldwide. The interconnection points are in Frankfurt, London, New York and Hong Kong. Luxembourg has established itself as one of the leading financial technology (FinTech) hubs in Europe, with the Luxembourg government supporting initiatives like the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology.\nSome 20 data centers are operating in Luxembourg. Six data centers are Tier IV Design certified: three of ebrc, two of LuxConnect and one of European Data Hub. In a survey on nine international data centers carried out in December 2012 and January 2013 and measuring availability (up-time) and performance (delay by which the data from the requested website was received), the top three positions were held by Luxembourg data centers.\nEnergy.\nLuxembourg has a high demand for transportation fuels and fossil fuels. But despite that, Luxembourg's climate law sets a goal that by 2030 it would have reduced emission down to 55%. As well as getting 49% of all cars to be electric by 2030. Luxembourg has adopted some measures to reach that goal. Including a carbon tax that encourage renewable generations. Several groups also support energy efficiency.\nHealthcare.\nAccording to data from the World Health Organization, healthcare spending on behalf of the government of Luxembourg topped $4.1 Billion, amounting to about $8,182 for each citizen in the nation. Luxembourg allows residents to choose their own doctor. While also having public healthcare cover 80% to 90% of all healthcare costs. The nation of Luxembourg collectively spent nearly 7% of its Gross domestic product on health, placing it among the highest spending countries on health services and related programs in 2010, and 6th place in highest health index of countries in Europe in 2023.\nDemographics.\nLargest towns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEthnicity.\nThe people of Luxembourg are called Luxembourgers. The immigrant population increased in the 20th century due to the arrival of immigrants from Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal; the last comprised the largest group. In 2013 about 88,000 Luxembourg inhabitants possessed Portuguese nationality. In 2025, there were 681,973 permanent residents, 47% of which were of foreign nationals; the largest foreign national groups were the Portuguese, comprising 13.2% of the total population, followed by the French (7.2%), Italians (3.7%), Belgians (2.7%) and Germans (1.8%). Another 7.2% were of another EU nationality, 3.5% were non-EU European, and 7.2% were from outside Europe.\nSince the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, Luxembourg has seen many immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia. Annually, over 10,000 new immigrants arrive in Luxembourg, mostly from the EU states, as well as Eastern Europe. In 2000 there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37% of the total population. There were an estimated 5,000 illegal immigrants in Luxembourg in 1999.\nLanguage.\nLuxembourg does not have any \"official\" languages per se. As determined by the 1984 Language Regimen Act (French: \"Loi sur le r\u00e9gime des langues\"), Luxembourgish is the sole national language of the Luxembourgish people. It is considered the mother tongue or \"language of the heart\" for Luxembourgers and the language they generally use to speak or write to each other. Luxembourgish as well as the dialects in adjacent Germany belong to the Moselle Franconian subgroup of the main West Central German dialect group, which are largely mutually intelligible across the border, but Luxembourgish also has more than 5,000 words of French origin. Knowledge of Luxembourgish is a criterion for naturalization.\nIn addition to Luxembourgish, French and German are used in administrative and judicial matters, making all three administrative languages of Luxembourg. Per article 4 of the law promulgated in 1984, if a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.\nLuxembourg is largely multilingual. According to 2021 census data, 48.9% of citizens claimed Luxembourgish as their main language, 15.4% Portuguese, 14.9% French, 3.6% English, 3.6% Italian, 2.9% German and 10.8% different languages (the most spoken ones being Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, Russian, Polish and Romanian). \nThough not the most common mother tongue in Luxembourg, French is the most widely-known language in the country: in 2018, 98% of citizens were able to speak it. The vast majority of Luxembourg residents are able to speak it as a second or third language. As of 2018[ [update]], much of the population was able to speak multiple other languages: 80% of citizens reported being able to hold a conversation in English, 78% in German and 77% in Luxembourgish, claiming these languages as their respective second, third or fourth language.\nEach of the three official languages is used as a primary language in certain spheres of everyday life, without being exclusive. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak and write to each other, and there has been a recent increase in the production of novels and movies in the language. At the same time, the numerous expatriate workers (approximately 44% of the population) generally do not use it to speak to each other.\nMost official business and written communication is carried out in French, which is also the language mostly used for public communication, with written official statements, advertising displays and road signs generally in French. Due to the historical influence of the Napoleonic Code on the legal system of the Grand Duchy, French is also the sole language of the legislation and generally the preferred language of the government, administration and justice. Parliamentary debates are mostly conducted in Luxembourgish, whereas written government communications and official documents (e.g. administrative or judicial decisions, passports, etc.) are drafted mostly in French and sometimes additionally in German.\nAlthough professional life is largely multilingual, French is described by private sector business leaders as the main working language of their companies (56%), followed by Luxembourgish (20%), English (18%), and German (6%).\nGerman is very often used in much of the media along with French and is considered by most Luxembourgers their second language. This is mostly due to the high similarity of German to Luxembourgish but also because it is the first language taught to children in primary school (language of literacy acquisition).\nDue to the large community of Portuguese origin, the Portuguese language is fairly prevalent in Luxembourg, though it remains limited to the relationships inside this community. Portuguese has no official status, but the administration sometimes makes certain informative documents available in Portuguese.\nEven though Luxembourg is largely multilingual today, some people claim that Luxembourg is subject of intense francization and that Luxembourgish and German are in danger of disappearing in the country. This would make Luxembourg either a unilingual Francophone country, or at best a bilingual French- and English-speaking country sometime in the far future.\nReligion.\nLuxembourg is a secular state, but the state recognizes certain religions as officially mandated religions. This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages. Religions covered by such arrangements are Catholicism, Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Russian Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Mennonitism, and Islam.\nSince 1980, it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices. According to a 2021 Eurobarometer survey, 53% are Christian (46% Catholic, 2% protestant, 2% Orthodox, 3% other christians), 1% Muslim, 38% unaffiliated (25% not religious or agnostic and 13% atheist) and 7% follow other religions.\nAccording to a 2005 Eurobarometer poll, 44% of Luxembourg citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 28% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\", and 22% that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force\".\nEducation.\nLuxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German; while in secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French. Proficiency in all three languages is required for graduation from secondary school. In addition to the three national languages, English is taught in compulsory schooling and much of the population of Luxembourg can speak English. The past two decades have highlighted the growing importance of English in several sectors, in particular the financial sector. Portuguese, the language of the largest immigrant community, is also spoken by large segments of the population, but by relatively few from outside the Portuguese-speaking community.\nThe University of Luxembourg is the only university based in Luxembourg. In 2014, Luxembourg School of Business, a graduate business school, was created through private initiative and received the accreditation from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg in 2017. Miami University, an American university, maintains the Dolibois European Center satellite campus in Differdange.\nHealthcare.\nAccording to data from the World Health Organization, healthcare spending on behalf of the government of Luxembourg topped $4.1 Billion, amounting to about $8,182 for each citizen in the nation. Luxembourg allows residents to choose their own doctor while also having public healthcare cover 80% to 90% of all healthcare costs. The nation of Luxembourg collectively spent nearly 7% of its Gross domestic product on health, placing it among the highest spending countries on health services and related programs in 2010, and 6th place in highest health index of countries in Europe in 2023.\nCulture.\nLuxembourg has been heavily influenced by the culture of its neighbours. It retains a number of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country. There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the National Museum of History and Art (NMHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of the Bulge. The historic city of Luxembourg is part of the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications.\nThe country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Th\u00e9o Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, and photographer Edward Steichen, whose \"The Family of Man\" exhibition has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register, and is now permanently housed in Clervaux. Editor and author Hugo Gernsback, whose publications crystallized the concept of science fiction, was born in Luxembourg City. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish descent.\nLuxembourg was a founding participant of the Eurovision Song Contest, and participated every year between 1956 and before it was relegated after the 1993 competition, with the exception of 1959. Although Luxembourg was free to participate again in 1995, it chose not to return to the competition before 2024. It has won the competition a total of five times, 1961, 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1983 and hosted the contest in 1962, 1966, 1973, and 1984. Only nine of its 38 entries before 2024, and none of its five winning entries, were performed by Luxembourgish artists. Its 2024 return had a particular emphasis on promoting music and artists from Luxembourg.\nLuxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders physically, psychologically, artistically and emotionally.\nLuxembourg was represented at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China, from 1 May to 31 October 2010 with its own pavilion. The pavilion, designed as a forest and fortress, was based on the transliteration of the word Luxembourg into Chinese, \"L\u00fas\u0113nb\u01ceo\", which when directly translated, means \"forest and fortress\". It represented Luxembourg as the \"Green Heart in Europe\".\nSports.\nUnlike most countries in Europe, sports in Luxembourg are not concentrated upon a particular national sport, but instead encompass a number of sports, both team and individual. Despite the lack of a central sporting focus, over 100,000 people in Luxembourg, out of a total population of 660,000, are licensed members of one sports federation or another. The Stade de Luxembourg, situated in Gasperich, southern Luxembourg City, is the country's national stadium and largest sports venue in the country with a capacity of 9,386 for sporting events, including football and rugby union, and 15,000 for concerts. The largest indoor venue in the country is d'Coque, Kirchberg, north-eastern Luxembourg City, which has a capacity of 8,300. The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the 2007 Women's European Volleyball Championship. Hess Cycling Team is a Luxembourgish women's road cycling team.\nCuisine.\nLuxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighbouring France and Germany. More recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes, the same as in neighbouring Germany.\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita. However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighbouring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.\nLuxembourg has the second highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita with Japan ranked at number one and Switzerland following Luxembourg at number three.\nMedia.\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily \"Luxemburger Wort\". Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition, there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES is conducted in French.\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg and RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily. There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.\nLuxembourg won an Oscar in 2014 in the Animated Short Films category with \"Mr Hublot\".\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the literature of location parameter estimation, the probability distributions with such parameter are found to be formally defined in one of the following equivalent ways:\nA direct example of a location parameter is the parameter formula_6 of the normal distribution. To see this, note that the probability density function formula_7 of a normal distribution formula_8 can have the parameter formula_6 factored out and be written as: \nformula_10\nthus fulfilling the first of the definitions given above.\nThe above definition indicates, in the one-dimensional case, that if formula_1 is increased, the probability density or mass function shifts rigidly to the right, maintaining its exact shape.\nA location parameter can also be found in families having more than one parameter, such as location\u2013scale families. In this case, the probability density function or probability mass function will be a special case of the more general form\nformula_12\nwhere formula_1 is the location parameter, \"\u03b8\" represents additional parameters, and formula_14 is a function parametrized on the additional parameters.\nDefinition.\nSource:\nLet formula_15 be any probability density function and let formula_6 and formula_17 be any given constants. Then the function\nformula_18\nis a probability density function.\nThe location family is then defined as follows:\nLet formula_19 be any probability density function. Then the family of probability density functions formula_20 is called the location family with standard probability density function formula_19, where formula_22 is called the location parameter for the family.\nAdditive noise.\nAn alternative way of thinking of location families is through the concept of additive noise. If formula_1 is a constant and \"W\" is random noise with probability density formula_24 then formula_25 has probability density formula_26 and its distribution is therefore part of a location family.\nProofs.\nFor the continuous univariate case, consider a probability density function formula_27, where formula_28 is a vector of parameters. A location parameter formula_1 can be added by defining:\nformula_30\nit can be proved that formula_31 is a p.d.f. by verifying if it respects the two conditions formula_32 and formula_33. formula_31 integrates to 1 because:\nformula_35\nnow making the variable change formula_36 and updating the integration interval accordingly yields:\nformula_37\nbecause formula_38 is a p.d.f. by hypothesis. formula_32 follows from formula_31 sharing the same image of formula_41, which is a p.d.f. so its range is contained in formula_42."}

He started higher education at Seattle Pacific University in 1976, majoring in chemistry and music and later pre-medicine. After a hiatus of several years working in the university's computing center, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Natural and Artificial Languages.\nWhile in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, Wall and his wife were studying linguistics with the intention of finding an unwritten language, perhaps in Africa, and creating a writing system for it. They would then use this new writing system to translate various texts into the language, among them the Bible. For health reasons these plans were cancelled, and they remained in the United States, where Wall instead joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory after he finished graduate school.\nCareer.\nWall is the author of the codice_1 Usenet client and the widely used codice_2 program. He has won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest twice and was the recipient of the first Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software in 1998.\nWall developed the Perl language and interpreter while working for System Development Corporation, which later became part of Burroughs and then Unisys. He is the co-author of \"Programming Perl\" (often referred to as the \"Camel Book\" and published by O'Reilly), which is the definitive resource for Perl programmers; and edited the \"Perl Cookbook\". He then became employed full-time by O'Reilly Media to further develop Perl and write books on the subject.\nWall's training as a linguist is apparent in his books, interviews, and lectures. He often compares Perl to a natural language and explains his decisions in Perl's design with linguistic rationale. He also often uses linguistic terms for Perl language constructs, so instead of traditional terms such as \"variable\", \"function\", and \"accessor\" he sometimes says \"noun\", \"verb\", and \"topicalizer\".\nPersonal life.\nWall is an active member of the New Life, Church of the Nazarene. He also works with his local church for Bible Quizzing for the Nor-Cal district. \nWall's Christian faith has influenced some of the terminology of Perl, such as the name itself, a biblical reference to the \"pearl of great price\" (Matthew 13:46). Similar references are the function name \"bless\", and the organization of Raku (previously known as Perl 6) design documents with categories such as \"apocalypse\" and \"exegesis\". Wall has also alluded to his faith when speaking at conferences, including at the Perl Conference 3.0 on August 23, 1999.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
