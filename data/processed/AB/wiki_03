Widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature, his work fuses elements of realism and the fantastique, and typically features isolated protagonists facing bizarre or surreal predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. The term \"\" has entered the lexicon to describe situations like those depicted in his writings. His best-known works include the novella \"The Metamorphosis\" (1915) and the novels \"The Trial\" (1924) and \"The Castle\" (1926). His work has widely influenced artists, philosophers, composers, filmmakers, literary historians, religious scholars, and cultural theorists.\nKafka was born into a middle-class German- and Yiddish-speaking Czech Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (later the capital of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic). He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education was employed full-time in various legal and insurance jobs. His professional obligations led to internal conflict as he felt that his true vocation was writing. Only a minority of his works were published during his life; the story-collections \"Contemplation\" (1912) and \"A Country Doctor\" (1919), and individual stories, such as his novella \"The Metamorphosis\", were published in literary magazines, but they received little attention. He wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died relatively unknown in 1924 of tuberculosis, aged 40. \nThough Kafka is most famous for his novels and short stories, he is also celebrated for his brief fables and aphorisms. Like his longer fiction, these sketches may be brutal in some aspects, but their dreadfulness is frequently comedic. A close acquaintance of Kafka's remarked that both his audience and the author himself sometimes laughed so much during readings that Kafka could not continue in his delivery, finding it necessary to collect himself before completing his recitation of the work. His writings are sometimes seen as prophetic or premonitory of a totalitarian future.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nKafka was born near the Old Town Square in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family were German-speaking middle-class Ashkenazi Jews. His father, Hermann Kafka, was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka, a or kosher butcher in Osek, a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near Strakonice in southern Bohemia. Hermann \"came to Prague in the 1870s and opened a store selling haberdashery and ladies' accessories\". He employed up to 15 people and used the image of a jackdaw ( in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as \"kafka\") as his business logo. Kafka's mother, Julie, was the daughter of Jakob L\u00f6wy, a \"cloth-maker in Humpolec in eastern Bohemia\".\nKafka's parents, from traditional Jewish society, spoke German replete with influences from their native Yiddish; their children, raised in an acculturated environment, spoke Standard German. The cleanliness and \"almost platonic purity\" of Kafka's German may derive from the fact that he grew up speaking the language in a country whose native speech was not German. His prose is not hindered by slang or warped by fads of contemporary usage that mark the style of his generational peers from the heart of the empire in Vienna or, for that matter, at the center of the Second Reich in Berlin.\nHermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele (\"Elli\"), Valerie (\"Valli\") and Ottilie (\"Ottla\"). All three were murdered in the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto in occupied Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her; it is assumed she did not survive the war. Ottilie was Kafka's favourite sister.\nHermann is described by Kafka scholar and translator Stanley Corngold as a \"huge, selfish, overbearing businessman\" and by Franz Kafka as \"a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, knowledge of human nature, a certain way of doing things on a grand scale, of course also with all the defects and weaknesses that go with these advantages and into which your temperament and sometimes your hot temper drive you\". On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12\u00a0hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely, and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka's troubled relationship with his father is evident in his (\"Letter to His Father\") of more than 100\u00a0pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character; his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy. The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant influence on Kafka's writing.\nThe Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913, the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.\nEducation.\nFrom 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the German boys' elementary school at the (meat market), now known as Masn\u00e1 Street. His Jewish education ended with his \"bar mitzvah\" celebration at the age of 13. Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and went with his father only on four high holidays each year.\nAfter leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, located within Kinsk\u00fd Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech. He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Kafka received compliments for his Czech, but never considered himself fluent in the language. He spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.\nKafka was admitted to the of Prague in 1901. He was originally admitted for philosophy, and he had additionally signed up for chemistry. Kafka began studying chemistry but switched to law after two weeks. Although this field did not excite him, it offered a range of career possibilities, which pleased his father. In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history. He also joined a student club, (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organised literary events, readings and other activities. Among Kafka's friends were the journalist Felix Weltsch, who studied philosophy, the actor Yitzchak Lowy who came from an orthodox Hasidic Warsaw family, and the writers Ludwig Winder, Oskar Baum and Franz Werfel.\nAt the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met Max Brod, a fellow law student who became a close friend for life. Years later, Brod coined the term (\"The Close Prague Circle\") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and Brod himself. Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound. Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life; together he and Brod read Plato's \"Protagoras\" in the original Greek, on Brod's initiative, and Gustave Flaubert's and (\"The Temptation of Saint Anthony\") in French, at his own suggestion. Kafka considered Fyodor Dostoevsky, Flaubert, Nikolai Gogol, Franz Grillparzer, and Heinrich von Kleist to be his \"true blood brothers\". Besides these, he took an interest in Czech literature and was also fond of the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, though his \"admiration for Goethe was, however, somewhat ambivalent: 'By the power of his works Goethe probably holds back the development of the German language.'\" Kafka was awarded the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 June 1906 and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as a law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.\nEmployment.\nOn 1 November 1907, Kafka was employed at the , an insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a work schedule\u2014from 08:00 until 18:00\u2014that made it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later, he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia (). The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace, owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws, which were rarely fitted with safety guards.\nHis father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally \"bread job\", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were well received by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing.\nIn late 1911, Elli's husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first asbestos factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann &amp; Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time. During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of Yiddish theatre. After seeing a Yiddish theatre troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka \"immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature\". This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism. It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian. Around 1915, Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World WarI, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. He later attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with tuberculosis, with which he was diagnosed in 1917. In 1918, the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in sanatoriums.\nPersonal life.\nKafka never married. According to Brod, Kafka was \"tortured\" by sexual desire, and filled with a fear of \"sexual failure\". Kafka visited brothels for most of his adult life, and his collection of erotica and pornographic photographs demonstrates a connoisseur's range of interest in the genre. In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his lifetime. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met Felice Bauer, a relative of Brod's, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a dictaphone company. A week after the meeting at Brod's home, Kafka wrote in his diary:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Miss FB. When I arrived at Brod's on 13 August, she was sitting at the table. I was not at all curious about who she was, but rather took her for granted at once. Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly. Bare throat. A blouse thrown on. Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it turned out, she by no means was. (I alienate myself from her a little by inspecting her so closely\u00a0...) Almost broken nose. Blonde, somewhat straight, unattractive hair, strong chin. As I was taking my seat I looked at her closely for the first time, by the time I was seated I already had an unshakeable opinion.\nShortly after this meeting, Kafka wrote the story \"\" (\"The Judgment\") in only one night and in a productive period worked on (\"The Man Who Disappeared\") and (\"The Metamorphosis\"). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice. Kafka's extant letters to Bauer were published as (\"Letters to Felice\"); her letters did not survive. After he had written to Bauer's father asking to marry her, Kafka wrote in his diary:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My job is unbearable to me because it conflicts with my only desire and my only calling, which is literature... I am nothing but literature and can and want to be nothing else ... Nervous states of the worst sort control me without pause ... A marriage could not change me, just as my job cannot change me.\nAccording to the biographers Stach and James Hawes, Kafka became engaged a third time around 1920, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid. Kafka's father objected to Wohryzek because of her Zionist beliefs. Although Kafka and Wohryzek rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time, Kafka began a draft of \"Letter to His Father\". Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman. \nStach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe \"Grete\" Bloch, a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921. However, Kafka's biographer Peter-Andr\u00e9 Alt says that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father, as the pair were never intimate. Stach notes contradictory evidence as to whether Kafka was the father.\nKafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis in August 1917 and moved for a few months to the Bohemian village of Z\u00fcrau (Si\u0159em in Czech), where his sister Ottla worked on the farm of her brother-in-law Karl Hermann. He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best period of his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and made notes in exercise books (). From those notes, Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on single pieces of paper (); these were later published as (The Z\u00fcrau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).\nIn 1920, Kafka began an intense relationship with Milena Jesensk\u00e1, a Czech journalist and writer who was non-Jewish and who was married, but whose marriage, when she met Kafka, was a \"sham\". His letters to her were later published as . During a vacation in July 1923 to Graal-M\u00fcritz on the Baltic Sea, Kafka met Dora Diamant, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Kafka, hoping to escape the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin (September 1923-March 1924) and lived with Diamant. She became his lover and reignited his interest in the Talmud. He completed four stories, which were published shortly after his death under the title of one of them, (\"A Hunger Artist\").\nSiblings.\nKafka's parents had six children; Franz was the eldest. His two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy; his three sisters, Gabriele (\"Elli\") (22 September 1889 \u2013 fall of 1942), Valerie (\"Valli\") (1890\u20131942) and Ottilie (\"Ottla\") (1892\u20131943), are believed to have been murdered in the Holocaust of the Second World War. Ottilie was Kafka's favourite sister.\nGabriele was Kafka's eldest sister. She was known as Elli or Ellie; her married name is variously rendered as Hermann or Hermannov\u00e1. She attended a German girls' school in Prague's \u0158eznick\u00e1 Street and later a private girls' secondary school. She married Karl Hermann (1883\u20131939), a salesman, in 1910. The couple had a son, Felix (1911\u20131940), and two daughters, Gertrude (Gerti) Kaufmann (1912\u20131972), and Hanna Seidner (1920\u20131941). After her marriage to Hermann, she became closer to her brother, whose letters showed an active interest in the upbringing and education of her children. He accompanied her on a 1915 trip to Hungary to visit Hermann, who was stationed there, and spent a summer with her and her children in M\u00fcritz the year before he died.\nWith the outbreak of the Great Depression in 1929, the Hermann family business experienced financial difficulties and eventually went bankrupt. Karl Hermann died 27 February 1939, and Elli was supported financially by her sisters. On 21 October 1941, she was deported together with her daughter Hanna to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto, where she lived temporarily with her sister Valli and Valli's husband in the spring of 1942. She was probably killed in the Kulmhof extermination camp in the fall of 1942. Of Elli's three children, only her daughter Gerti survived the Second World War. A memorial plaque commemorates the three sisters at the family grave in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague.\nPersonality.\nKafka had a lifelong suspicion that people found him mentally and physically repulsive. However, those who met him found him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence and a dry sense of humour; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance. Kafka was thought to be \"very self-analytic\". Brod compared Kafka to Heinrich von Kleist, noting that both writers had the ability to describe a situation realistically with precise details. Brod thought Kafka was one of the most entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing his humour with his friends but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice. According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, able to phrase his speech as though it were music. Brod felt that two of Kafka's most distinguishing traits were \"absolute truthfulness\" () and \"precise conscientiousness\" (). He explored inconspicuous details in depth and with such precision and love that unforeseen things surfaced that seemed strange but absolutely true ().\nKafka's letters and unexpurgated diaries reveal homoerotic themes, including a scenario with novelist Franz Werfel and references to the work of Hans Bl\u00fcher on male bonding. Saul Friedl\u00e4nder argues that this mental struggle may have informed the themes of alienation and psychological brutality in his writing.\nAlthough Kafka showed little interest in exercise as a child, he later developed a passion for games and physical activity and was an accomplished rider, swimmer, and rower. On weekends, he and his friends embarked on long hikes, often planned by Kafka himself. His other interests included alternative medicine, modern education systems such as Montessori, and technological novelties such as airplanes and film. Writing was vitally important to Kafka; he considered it a \"form of prayer\". He was highly sensitive to noise and preferred absolute quiet when writing. Kafka was also a vegetarian and did not drink alcohol.\nP\u00e9rez-\u00c1lvarez has claimed that Kafka had symptomatology consistent with schizoid personality disorder. His style, it is claimed, not only in (\"The Metamorphosis\") but in other writings, appears to show low- to medium-level schizoid traits, which P\u00e9rez-\u00c1lvarez claims to have influenced much of his work. His anguish can be seen in this diary entry from 21 June 1913:\nThe tremendous world I have inside my head, but how to free myself and free it without being torn to pieces. And a thousand times rather be torn to pieces than retain it in me or bury it. That, indeed, is why I am here, that is quite clear to me.\nand in Z\u00fcrau Aphorism number 50:\nMan cannot live without a permanent trust in something indestructible within himself, though both that indestructible something and his own trust in it may remain permanently concealed from him.\nThe Italian medical researchers Alessia Coralli and Antonio Perciaccante have posited in a 2016 article that Kafka may have had borderline personality disorder with co-occurring psychophysiological insomnia. Joan Lachkar interpreted as \"a vivid depiction of the borderline personality\" and described the story as \"model for Kafka's own abandonment fears, anxiety, depression, and parasitic dependency needs. Kafka illuminated the borderline's general confusion of normal and healthy desires, wishes, and needs with something ugly and disdainful\".\nThough Kafka never married, he held marriage and children in high esteem. He had several girlfriends and lovers during his life. He may have suffered from an eating disorder. Doctor Manfred M. Fichter of the Psychiatric Clinic, University of Munich, presented \"evidence for the hypothesis that the writer Franz Kafka had suffered from an atypical anorexia nervosa\", and that Kafka was not just lonely and depressed but also \"occasionally suicidal\". In his 1995 book \"Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient\", Sander Gilman investigated \"why a Jew might have been considered 'hypochondriacal' or 'homosexual' and how Kafka incorporates aspects of these ways of understanding the Jewish male into his own self-image and writing\". Kafka considered suicide at least once, in late 1912.\nPolitical views.\nBefore World War\u00a0I, Kafka attended several meetings of the \"Klub mlad\u00fdch\", a Czech anarchist, anti-militarist, and anti-clerical organization. Hugo Bergmann, who attended the same elementary and high schools as Kafka, fell out with Kafka during their last academic year (1900\u20131901) because \"[Kafka's] socialism and my Zionism were much too strident\". Bergmann said: \"Franz became a socialist, I became a Zionist in 1898. The synthesis of Zionism and socialism did not yet exist.\" Bergmann claims that Kafka wore a red carnation to school to show his support for socialism. In one diary entry, Kafka made reference to the influential anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin: \"Don't forget Kropotkin!\"\nDuring the communist era, the legacy of Kafka's work for Eastern Bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from the notion that he satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.\nJudaism and Zionism.\nKafka grew up in Prague as a German-speaking Jew. He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary contains many references to Yiddish writers. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life. On 8 January 1914, he wrote in his diary:\nWhat have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe.\nAs a teenager, Kafka declared himself an atheist. Issues such as Judaism, the Talmud, the Zohar, and the Kabbalah remain a theme in his diaries. He notes in his diary, shortly before embarking on his composition of \"The Castle\", that in the demonic onslaught of visions assaulting him he perceives \"the intimations of a secret doctrine, a new Kabbalah\" whose development has been barred by Zionism. \nIn the final issue of \"Die Sammlung,\" a journal for exiles from the Third Reich in Western Europe, Klaus Mann writes, \"[T]he collected works of Kafka, offered by the Schocken Verlag in Berlin, are the noblest and most significant publications that have come out of Germany. [Kafka contributes] the epoch's purest and most singular works of literature. . . . [T]his spiritual event has occurred within a splendid isolation, in a ghetto far from the German cultural ministry\". \nIn 1935, as the Nazi Race Laws were being promulgated and prepared for their introduction at that year's Nuremberg Rally, the word \"ghetto\" bore the same connotation it carried since the early 17th century: 'a part of the city where Jews were compelled to live'. Mann's mention of the ghetto here is an allusion to Kafka's status as a Jewish writer, and a swipe at Hitler's antisemitic policies. Very likely as a result of this message, the German cultural ministry sent a cease-and-desist letter to Schocken, reminding the publisher that Kafka's name had been placed on the Third Reich's \"index librorum prohibitorum\" several weeks earlier. \nThat same year, a Rabbi of the Bar Kochba Youth Movement in Prague, Martin Buber, wrote to the editor of Kafka's \"Werke\" that these stories were \"a great possession . . . that could show how one can live marginally with complete integrity and without loss of background\". First published in Buber's \"Der Jude\" in 1917, Kafka's story \"Jackals and Arabs\" is an illustration of the tendency that Buber describes in this letter: Arabs are called Arabs, elsewhere Chinese may be directly referred to as people from China, but in this case references to Jews are zoomorphic, as elsewhere, and in other places Jewish characters are simply not named as such.\nBenjamin remarks that Kafka's world is pre-animistic (as opposed to the dualism of later religions)\u2014implying a universal and primordial ur-phenomenology (prior to the distinction of the spiritual and the substantial in human perception) that emerges as a hallmark of Kafka's style. But in the same essay, Benjamin includes a parable of an obviously Chasidic character to describe Kafka's work, and in his correspondence attached to this essay he refers to Kafka's stories as a \"haggadic\" (referring to stories in the Talmud) uprising against \"halakha\" (referring to legal doctrine). Arendt echoes and expands on Benjamin's larger sentiment (which at that time was still a novelty in Kafka criticism), repeating the injunction that it is a mistake to refer to Kafka as a particularly Jewish or religious figure. Arendt's article, which appeared in the Partisan Review in 1944, was a sequel to Benjamin's earlier piece in many respects. Arendt was a close confidant of Benjamin's and worked as an editor-at-large in Paris for Schocken Books in the late 1930s, when it published the final volumes of Kafka's works. Arendt was also employed by various Zionist associations devoted to facilitating the emigration of Jewish children to Palestine so that they could escape the Third Reich. Arendt and Benjamin both emphasized that Kafka belongs to the whole world. \nHawes suggests that, though Kafka was conscious of his own Jewishness, in his fiction he concealed that of his Jewish characters. In the opinion of literary critic Harold Bloom, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer. Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: \"The presence of Jewishness in Kafka's is no longer subject to doubt\". Pavel Eisner, one of Kafka's first translators, interprets (\"The Trial\") as the embodiment of the \"triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer). He stands for the 'guiltless guilt' that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although there is no evidence that he himself is a Jew\".\nIn his essay \"Sadness in Palestine?!\", Dan Miron explores Kafka's connection to Zionism: \"It seems that those who claim that there was such a connection and that Zionism played a central role in his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles.\" Kafka considered moving to Palestine with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied Hebrew while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod's from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him and attending Rabbi Julius Gr\u00fcnthal and Rabbi Julius Guttmann's classes in the Berlin (College for the Study of Judaism), where he also studied the Talmud.\nLivia Rothkirchen calls Kafka the \"symbolic figure of his era\". His contemporaries included numerous Jewish, Czech, and German writers who were sensitive to Jewish, Czech, and German culture. According to Rothkirchen, \"This situation lent their writings a broad cosmopolitan outlook and a quality of exaltation bordering on transcendental metaphysical contemplation. An illustrious example is Franz Kafka\".\nTowards the end of his life Kafka sent a postcard to his friend Hugo Bergmann in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to emigrate to Palestine. Bergmann refused to host Kafka because he had young children and was afraid that Kafka would infect them with tuberculosis.\nDeath.\nKafka's laryngeal tuberculosis worsened and in March 1924 he returned from Berlin to Prague, where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, as well as Dora Diamant, took care of him. He went to Hugo Hoffmann's sanatorium in Kierling just outside Vienna for treatment on 10 April, and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since parenteral nutrition had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him. Kafka was editing \"A Hunger Artist\" on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment. His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague-\u017di\u017ekov. His obituary appeared in the \"Prager Presse\" and the \"Berliner Tageblatt\". Kafka was virtually unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He rose to fame rapidly after his death, particularly after World War II. The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect Leopold Ehrmann.\nWorks.\nAll of Kafka's published works were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted scant public attention.\nKafka finished none of his full-length novels and burned around 90 percent of his work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years as a writer he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described in a letter to Bauer as frightening and whom he considered closer than his own family.\nThe first mention of Kafka's work was in an article by Max Brod on 9 February 1907 in the Berlin weekly \"Die Gegenwart\", two years prior to his first publication. Brod would write about his friend again in 1921 in an essay entitled \"Der Dichter Frank Kafka\".\nStories.\nKafka's earliest published works were eight stories that appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal \"Hyperion\" under the title (\"Contemplation\"). He wrote the story \"\" (\"Description of a Struggle\") in 1904; in 1905 he showed it to Brod, who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to \"Hyperion\". Kafka published a fragment in 1908 and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.\nIn a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story \"Das Urteil\" (\"The Judgment\", literally: \"The Verdict\") and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fianc\u00e9e, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer. The story is often considered Kafka's breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son's engagement. Kafka later described writing it as \"a complete opening of body and soul\", a story that \"evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime\". The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated \"to Miss Felice Bauer\", and in subsequent editions \"for F.\"\nIn 1912, Kafka wrote \"Die Verwandlung\" (\"The Metamorphosis\", or \"The Transformation\"), published in 1915 in Leipzig. The story begins with a travelling salesman waking to find himself transformed into an , a monstrous vermin, being a general term for unwanted and unclean pests, especially insects. Critics regard the work as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century. The story \"In der Strafkolonie\" (\"In the Penal Colony\"), dealing with an elaborate torture and execution device, was written in October 1914, revised in 1918, and published in Leipzig during October 1919. The story \"Ein Hungerk\u00fcnstler\" (\"A Hunger Artist\"), published in the periodical in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of starving himself for extended periods. His last story, \"Josefine, die S\u00e4ngerin oder Das Volk der M\u00e4use\" (\"Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk\"), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.\nNovels.\nKafka began his first novel in 1912; its first chapter is the story \"Der Heizer\" (\"The Stoker\"). He called the work, which remained unfinished, (\"The Man Who Disappeared\" or \"The Missing Person\"), but when Brod published it after Kafka's death he named it \"Amerika\". The inspiration for the novel was the time Kafka spent in the audience of Yiddish theatre the previous year, bringing him to a new awareness of his heritage, which led to the thought that an innate appreciation for one's heritage lives deep within each person. More explicitly humorous and slightly more realistic than most of Kafka's works, the novel shares the motif of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations. It uses many details of experiences from his relatives who had emigrated to America and is the only work for which Kafka considered an optimistic ending.\nIn 1914 Kafka began the novel (\"The Trial\"), the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. He did not complete the novel, although he finished the final chapter. According to Nobel Prize-winning author Elias Canetti, Felice is central to the plot of \"Der Process\" and Kafka said it was \"her story\". Canetti titled his book on Kafka's letters to Felice \"Kafka's Other Trial\", in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel. Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for \"The New York Times\" that Kafka's letters have the \"earmarks of his fiction: the same nervous attention to minute particulars; the same paranoid awareness of shifting balances of power; the same atmosphere of emotional suffocation\u2014combined, surprisingly enough, with moments of boyish ardour and delight.\"\nAccording to his diary, Kafka was already planning his novel (\"The Castle\"), by 11 June 1914; however, he did not begin writing it until 27 January 1922. The protagonist is the (land surveyor) named K., who struggles for unknown reasons to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle who govern the village. Kafka's intent was that the castle's authorities notify K. on his deathbed that his \"legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was to be permitted to live and work there\". Dark and at times surreal, the novel is focused on alienation, bureaucracy, the seemingly endless frustrations of man's attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unattainable goal. Hartmut M. Rastalsky noted in his thesis: \"Like dreams, his texts combine precise 'realistic' detail with absurdity, careful observation and reasoning on the part of the protagonists with inexplicable obliviousness and carelessness.\"\nDrawings.\nKafka drew and sketched extensively. His interest in art grew from 1901 to 1906. He \"practiced drawing, took drawing classes, attended art history lectures, and sought to establish a connection to Prague's artistic circles\". According to Max Brod, Kafka \"was even more indifferent, or perhaps better, more hostile to his drawings than he was to his literary production\". As he did with his writings, Kafka asked in his testament for his drawings to be destroyed. Brod preserved all of Kafka's drawings that Kafka gave him or that he could rescue from the wastebasket or otherwise, but \"[a]nything that I didn't rescue was destroyed\". Until May 2021, only about 40 of his drawings were known. In 2022, Yale University Press published \"Franz Kafka: The Drawings\". The book brought to light about 150 sketches by Kafka.\nPublishing history.\nKafka's stories were initially published in literary periodicals. His first eight were printed in 1908 in the first issue of the bi-monthly \"Hyperion\". Franz Blei published two dialogues in 1909 which became part of \"Beschreibung eines Kampfes\" (\"Description of a Struggle\"). A fragment of the story \"Die Aeroplane in Brescia\" (\"The Aeroplanes at Brescia\"), written on a trip to Italy with Brod, appeared in the daily \"Bohemia\" on 28 September 1909. On 27 March 1910, several stories that later became part of the book were published in the Easter edition of \"Bohemia\". In Leipzig during 1913, Brod and publisher Kurt Wolff included \"\" (\"The Judgment. A Story by Franz Kafka.\") in their literary yearbook for the art poetry \"Arkadia\". In the same year, Wolff published \"Der Heizer\" (\"The Stoker\") in the J\u00fcngste Tag series, where it enjoyed three printings. The story \"\" (\"Before the Law\") was published in the 1915 New Year's edition of the independent Jewish weekly ; it was reprinted in 1919 as part of the story collection (\"A Country Doctor\") and became part of the novel . Other stories were published in various publications, including Martin Buber's \"Der Jude\", the paper , and the periodicals , \"Genius\", and \"Prager Presse\".\nKafka's first published book, (\"Contemplation\", or \"Meditation\"), was a collection of 18stories written between 1904 and 1912. On a summer trip to Weimar, Brod initiated a meeting between Kafka and Kurt Wolff; Wolff published in the at the end of 1912 (with the year given as 1913). Kafka dedicated it to Brod, \", and added in the personal copy given to his friend \" (\"As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max\").\nKafka's novella \"Die Verwandlung\" (\"The Metamorphosis\") was first printed in the October 1915 issue of , a monthly edition of expressionist literature, edited by Ren\u00e9 Schickele. Another story collection, (\"A Country Doctor\"), was published by Kurt Wolff in 1919, dedicated to Kafka's father. Kafka prepared a final collection of four stories for print, \"(A Hunger Artist)\", which appeared in 1924 after his death, in . On 20 April 1924, the published Kafka's essay on Adalbert Stifter.\nMax Brod.\nAt the time of his death, Kafka's works were probably known only to a small circle of Czech and German writers. Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and literary executor Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka's death; Kafka wrote: \"Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread.\" Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. Brod defended his action by claiming that he had told Kafka, \"I shall not carry out your wishes\", and that \"Franz should have appointed another executor if he had been absolutely determined that his instructions should stand\".\nBrod took many of Kafka's papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939. Kafka's last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20notebooks and 35letters. These were confiscated by the Gestapo in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.\nAs Brod published the bulk of the writings in his possession, Kafka's work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to arrange Kafka's notebooks in chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end. Brod finished many of Kafka's incomplete works for publication. For example, Kafka left with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content; Brod rearranged chapters, copy-edited the text, and changed the punctuation. appeared in 1925 in . Kurt Wolff published two other novels, in 1926 and \"Amerika\" in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as \"The Great Wall of China\", including the titular short story [[The Great Wall of China (short story)|\"The Great Wall of China\"]]. The book appeared in the [[Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlag]]. Brod's sets are usually called the \"Definitive Editions\".\nModern editions.\nIn 1961 [[Malcolm Pasley]] acquired for the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[Bodleian Library]] most of Kafka's original handwritten works. The text for was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in [[Marbach am Neckar]], Germany. Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including Gerhard Neumann, Jost Schillemeit and J\u00fcrgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels; republished them. Pasley was the editor for , published in 1982, and (\"The Trial\"), published in 1990. Jost Schillemeit was the editor of () published in 1983. These are called the \"Critical Editions\" or the \"Fischer Editions\".\nIn 2023, the first unexpurgated edition of [[Franz Kafka's Diaries|Kafka's diaries]] was published in English, \"more than three decades after this complete text appeared in German. The sole previous English edition, with Brod's edits, was issued in the late 1940s\". The new edition revealed that Brod had expunged homoerotic references, and negative comments about Eastern European Jews.\nUnpublished papers.\nWhen Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka's unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary [[Esther Hoffe]]. She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the [[National Library of Israel]], which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to [[British Palestine]] in 1939. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of for US$2\u00a0million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive [[Museum of Modern Literature]] in Marbach am Neckar. A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued. The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library of Israel argues they are \"cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people\". The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family Court ruled in October 2012, six months after Ruth's death, that the papers were the property of the National Library. The Israeli Supreme Court upheld the decision in December 2016.\nCritical response.\nAfter-death biographies and critiques.\nAfter his death, [[Rudolf Kayser]] wrote an article titled \"Anmerkungen zu Franz Kafka\" for the \"[[Neue Rundschau]]\", and Manfred Sturmann wrote a biographical essay titled \"Erinnerungen an Kafka\" for the \"[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]\". In 1935, Brod wrote a biography. \"Since this work was written in German, however, it was not available to the majority of English critics\".\nFrom 1924 to 1927, Brod arranged for the publication of Kafka's three unfinished novels and otherwise promoted Kafka's works. During this period, many analytical essays were written about his work. In the late 1920s, 55 articles were written about Kafka's work, most of them reviews and references. Examples include Heinrich Jacob's \"Kafka oder die Wahrhaftigkeit\" for \"Der Feuerreiter\" in 1924 and Brod's \"Infantilismus Kleist und Kafka\" in 1927.\nKafka's work was translated to English in the 1930s, and American journals and magazines such as \"[[The New Yorker]]\", \"[[The Nation and Athenaeum]]\", \"[[The Nation]]\", \"[[Scribner's Monthly|Scribners]]\", \"[[New York Tribune]]\", and \"[[The Bookman (New York City)|The Bookman]]\", wrote reviews about his books. \"The Castle\" was specially very well reviewed. But afterwards, until 1937, only three articles were written.\nAt the same time, in Germany, in 1930 only four articles were written, and the following year saw eight articles. But in 1932, only one article was published, possibly because of the rise of the [[National Socialist]] party, as there was a strong antisemitic bias at a time. In [[Nazi Germany]], between 1933 and 1937, only 11 articles about Kafka were published, mostly by Jews in periodical such as \"[[Der Morgen]]\", \"[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]\", \"[[J\u00fcdische Rundschau]]\", and \"[[Hochland (magazine)|Hochland]]\". From 1937 to 1939, no articles were written.\nKafka's writings began to receive the highest possible critical acclaim when they were re-released amidst the imposition of the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Racial Hygiene Laws]] in 1935 as a complete set by [[Schocken Books|Schocken]], however distribution and broad awareness of these works was stymied by the totalitarian atmosphere of the [[Nazi regime]]. The final volumes of this set were released after Schocken was forced to relocate to Prague. The works became more famous in German-speaking countries after [[World War II]], influencing [[German literature]], and its influence spread elsewhere in the world in the 1960s. A critical edition of his complete works, including many elements that had been edited out by [[Max Brod|Brod]] in the earlier Schocken collection, was released by [[S. Fischer Verlag]] in the final decades of the 20th century.\nIn 1937, \"The Trial\" was translated to English. There were 12 reviews in the United States, but the book was reviewed 20 times in other languages, including in France and Brazil. The reviews were mixed, with \"[[The New York Times]]\" reviewer stating that \"it is beyond me\" and other reviewers stating that Kafka was \"one of the most extraordinary writers of our time\".\nIn the following year, \"Amerika\" was translated to English and generally well received by four English and two American reviewers. In the same year, \"Das Schloss\" was translated into French and received five reviews.\nIn 1939, Kafka's work was reviewed in many countries, including in the periodicals \"[[The Southern Review]]\", \"[[The Kenyon Review]]\" and \"Expressionism in German Life\". In 1940, \"The Southern Review\" published a religious interpretation of \"The Trial\". In 1941, eleven reviews and articles were published, including \"a doctor's dissertation at the [[University of Z\u00fcrich]]\" by Herbert Tauber, entitled \"Franz Kafka, eine Deutung seiner Werke\". Other countries whose writers showed interest in Kafka's work were Peru, Cuba, and Brazil.\nIn the first years of [[World War II]], interest in Kafka's work diminished in the United States, with only two articles published. In 1943, four articles were published, with one that \"criticized Kafka as a symbol of the social decadence which was responsible for the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]]\". But in the following year, interest in his work increased again, with six articles published. As World War II drew to a close, interest in Kafka grew once again, with 16 articles appearing in various countries' periodicals, including \"Focus One\", \"[[Quarterly Review of Literature]]\", and \"[[Les Cahiers du Sud]]\", as well as in the book \"Freudism and the Literary Mind\". Many intellectuals grew interested on Kafka's work, with articles by [[Parker Tyler]] in \"Accent\", [[Albert Camus]] in \"Hope and Absurdity\", and [[Jean Wahl]] in \"Kierkegaard and Kafka\" tying his work to [[existentialism]]. In 1946, Kafka's work was popular, with 21 articles on it written that year.\nCritical interpretations.\nThe British-American poet [[W. H. Auden]] called Kafka \"the [[Dante]] of the twentieth century\"; the novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century. [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] noted the reading of Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\" showed him \"that it was possible to write in a different way\". A prominent theme of Kafka's work, first established in the short story \"The Judgment\", is father\u2013son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement. Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.\nKafka's style has been compared to that of Kleist as early as 1916, in a review of \"Die Verwandlung\" and \"Der Heizer\" by Oscar Walzel in \"Berliner Beitr\u00e4ge\". The nature of Kafka's prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools. [[Marxists]], for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka's works. Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism. The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of [[existentialism]]. Some of Kafka's books are influenced by the [[expressionist]] movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental [[Literary modernism|modernist]] genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burrows claims that such work is centred on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships. Others, such as [[Thomas Mann]], see Kafka's work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.\nAccording to [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]], the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been overemphasised by critics. They argue that Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive\u2014and more joyful\u2014than it may first appear. They point out that focusing on the futility of Kafka's characters' struggles reveals Kafka's humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems but rather is pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often creates malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka translator [[Mark Harman (translator)|Mark Harman]] writes, \"When Kafka read his own work aloud to his friends he evidently brought covert humor to the surface even when his writing was at its bleakest.\" [[Max Brod]], Harman adds, recollected that Kafka's friends \"laughed quite immoderately\" even when he read the first chapter of \"The Trial\", despite its \"fearful earnestness\", and there were moments when Kafka himself laughed so much that \"he couldn't read any further\". The novelist [[Milan Kundera]] suggests that Kafka's [[surreal humour]] may have been an inversion of Dostoevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's \"The Trial\", a character is punished even though he has committed no crime. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and from living in a totalitarian state.\nAttempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Many interpretations identify the importance of the law in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka's works, rather than representing any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control. Critics who support this [[absurdism|absurdist]] interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Enclosed in my own four walls, I found myself as an immigrant imprisoned in a foreign country;... I saw my family as strange aliens whose foreign customs, rites, and very language defied comprehension;... though I did not want it, they forced me to participate in their bizarre rituals;... I could not resist.\nHowever, James Hawes argues many of Kafka's descriptions of the legal proceedings in \u2014metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear\u2014are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were [[inquisitorial]] rather than [[Adversarial system|adversarial]]. Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was \"keenly aware of the legal debates of his day\". In a 2009 publication that uses Kafka's office writings as its point of departure, Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law \"has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination\".\nKafka's work often refers to animals \u2014 \"zoopoetics,\" in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s term. Joachim Seyppel has noted that his stories contain \"countless references to animals, human-animal comparisons, allusions to animal life, fables, and animal motifs; there are important works in which the human person has been transformed into an animal, or vice versa. There are hardly any stories in which Kafka did not include at least one significant reference to creatures of the animal kingdom\". \"Already in his earliest surviving correspondence, he uses animal figures to convey psychological insights, his favorite being the mole.\" In Kafka's work animals sometimes \"occupy leading roles, as narrators and central characters\", but there is a \"comparative absence of named species in Kafka's fiction\". Themes of his stories range from [[animal cruelty]] to [[entomophobia]] to [[animal training]]. Animals are often shown as \"others\" that suffer from human \"animalesque\" actions, with Kafka's ideas thus converging with [[ecocentrist]] and [[postcolonialist]] thoughts.\nTranslations.\nThe first instance of Kafka being translated into English was in 1925, when William A. Drake published \"A Report for an Academy\" in the \"[[New York Herald Tribune]]\". Eugene Jolas translated Kafka's \"The Judgment\" for the modernist journal \"[[Transition (literary journal) (1927-1938)|transition]]\" in 1928. In 1930, [[Edwin Muir|Edwin]] and [[Willa Muir]] translated the first German edition of . This was published as \"The Castle\" by [[Secker &amp; Warburg]] in England and [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the United States. In the 1930s, [[Alberto Spaini]] translated \"The Process\" to Italian and Alexandre Vialatte translated it to French. A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka's popularity in the United States during the late 1940s. The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by [[Schocken Books]] in 1948 as \"[[The Penal Colony: Stories and Short Pieces]]\", including additionally \"The First Long Train Journey\", written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka's \"A Novel about Youth\", a review of Felix Sternheim's \"Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald\", his essay on Kleist's \"Anecdotes\", his review of the literary magazine \"[[Hyperion (magazine)|Hyperion]]\", and an epilogue by Brod.\nLater editions, notably those of 1954 (\"[[Dearest Father: Stories and Other Writings]]\"), included text, translated by [[Eithne Wilkins]] and [[Ernst Kaiser]], that had been deleted by earlier publishers. Known as \"Definitive Editions\", they include translations of \"The Trial, Definitive\", \"[[The Castle, Definitive Edition, Muir Translation|The Castle, Definitive]]\", and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation. Published in 1961 by Schocken Books, \"[[Parables and Paradoxes]]\" presented in a bilingual edition by [[Nahum N. Glatzer]] selected writings, drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel \"Der Process\".\nNew translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit\u200d\u2014\u200c\"[[The Castle, Critical Edition, Harman Translation|The Castle, Critical]]\" by [[Mark Harman (translator)|Mark Harman]] ([[Schocken Books]], 1998), \"The Trial, Critical\" by [[Breon Mitchell]] (Schocken Books, 1998), and \"The Man Who Disappeared (Amerika)\" by [[Michael Hofmann]] ([[Penguin Books]], 1996) and \"Amerika: The Missing Person\" by Mark Harman (Schocken Books, 2008).\nTranslation problems to English.\nKafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to German, which permits long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences sometimes deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop, finalizing the meaning and focus of the sentence. This is due to the construction of [[subordinate clauses in German]], which require that the verb be at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or an at least equivalent) effect as the original text. German's more flexible word order and [[Syntactic ambiguity|syntactical]] differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English. An example is the first sentence of Kafka's \"[[The Metamorphosis#Translations of the opening sentence|The Metamorphosis]]\", which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014original\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014literal word-for-word translation\nThe sentence above also exemplifies an instance of another difficult problem facing translators: dealing with the author's intentional use of ambiguous [[idiom]]s and words that have several meanings, which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely. English translators often render the word as 'insect'; in Middle German, however, literally means 'an animal unclean for sacrifice'; in today's German, it means 'vermin'. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean 'bug'\u2014a very general term, unlike the scientific 'insect'. Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation. Another example of this can be found in the final sentence of \"[[Das Urteil]]\" (\"The Judgement\"), with Kafka's use of the German noun . Literally, means 'intercourse' and, as in English, can have either a sexual or a non-sexual meaning. The word is additionally used to mean 'transport' or 'traffic'; therefore the sentence can also be translated as: \"At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge.\" The double meaning of \"Verkehr\" is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line he was thinking of \"a violent ejaculation\".\nLegacy.\nLiterary and cultural influence.\n[[File:Kafka statue Prague.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|[[Jaroslav R\u00f3na]]'s bronze \"[[Statue of Franz Kafka]]\" in Prague|alt=The statue is a man with no head or arms, with another man sitting on his shoulders]]\nUnlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective. Kafka had a strong influence on [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]], [[Milan Kundera]] and the novel \"[[The Palace of Dreams]]\" by [[Ismail Kadare]]. Shimon Sandbank, a professor, literary critic, and writer, also identifies Kafka as having influenced [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]], [[J.\u00a0M. Coetzee]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. A \"[[Financial Times]]\" literary critic credits Kafka with influencing [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], and Al Silverman, a writer and editor, states that [[J.\u00a0D. Salinger]] loved to read Kafka's works. The Romanian writer [[Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu]] said \"Kafka is the author I love the most and who means, for me, the gate to literature\"; he also described Kafka as \"the saint of literature\".\nKafka has been cited as an influence on the Swedish writer [[Stig Dagerman]], and the Japanese writer [[Haruki Murakami]], who paid homage to Kafka in his novel \"[[Kafka on the Shore]]\" with the namesake protagonist.\n[[File:David-\u010cern\u00fd,-Franz-Kafka,-opposite orientation-2014).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[David \u010cern\u00fd]]'s \"[[Head of Franz Kafka]]\" sculpture in Prague]]\nIn 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked and the second and ninth [[Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century|most significant German-language novels of the 20th century]]. [[Harold Bloom]] said \"when he is most himself, Kafka gives us a continuous inventiveness and originality that rivals [[Dante]] and truly challenges [[Proust]] and [[James Joyce|Joyce]] as that of the dominant Western author of our century\". Sandbank argues that despite Kafka's pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated. Neil Christian Pages, a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at [[Binghamton University]] who specialises in Kafka's works, says Kafka's influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture. Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka \"has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century\". Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the \"century of Kafka\".\nMichel-Andr\u00e9 Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the \"irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world\". His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follows the themes and precepts of Kafka's universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as [[George Orwell]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].\nThe following are examples of works across a range of dramatic, literary, and musical genres that demonstrate the extent of Kafka's cultural influence:\n\"Kafkaesque\".\nHowever, with common usage, the term has become so ubiquitous that Kafka scholars note it is often misused. More accurately then, according to author [[Ben Marcus]], paraphrased in \"What it Means to be Kafkaesque\" by Joe Fassler in \"[[The Atlantic]]\", \"Kafka's quintessential qualities are affecting use of language, a setting that straddles fantasy and reality, and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness\u2014hopelessly and full of hope.\"\nCommemorations.\n[[File:Czech-2013-Prague-Plaque (birthplace of Franz Kafka).jpg|thumb|Plaque marking the birthplace of Franz Kafka in Prague, designed by Karel Hlad\u00edk and Jan Kaplick\u00fd, 1966]]\n[[3412 Kafka]] is an [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 6 kilometers in diameter.

{"id": "10859", "revid": "2051880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10859", "title": "Fields Medal", "text": "Mathematics award\nThe Fields Medal is a prize awarded to two, three, or four mathematicians under 40 years of age at the International Congress of the International Mathematical Union (IMU), a meeting that takes place every four years. The name of the award honours the Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields.\nThe Fields Medal is regarded as one of the highest honors a mathematician can receive, and has been described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics, although there are several major differences, including frequency of award, number of awards, age limits, monetary value, and award criteria. According to the annual Academic Excellence Survey by ARWU, the Fields Medal is consistently regarded as the top award in the field of mathematics worldwide, and in another reputation survey conducted by IREG in 2013\u201314, the Fields Medal came closely after the Abel Prize as the second most prestigious international award in mathematics.\nThe prize includes a monetary award which, since 2006, has been CA$15,000. Fields was instrumental in establishing the award, designing the medal himself, and funding the monetary component, though he died before it was established and his plan was overseen by John Lighton Synge.\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. In 2014, the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani became the first female Fields Medalist. In total, 64 people have been awarded the Fields Medal.\nThe most recent group of Fields Medalists received their awards on 5 July 2022 in an online event which was live-streamed from Helsinki, Finland. It was originally meant to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but was moved following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nConditions of the award.\nThe Fields Medal has long been regarded as the most prestigious award in the field of mathematics and is often described as the Nobel Prize of Mathematics. Unlike the Nobel Prize, the Fields Medal is only awarded every four years. The Fields Medal also has an age limit: a recipient must be under age 40 on 1 January of the year in which the medal is awarded. The under-40 rule is based on Fields's desire that \"while it was in recognition of work already done, it was at the same time intended to be an encouragement for further achievement on the part of the recipients and a stimulus to renewed effort on the part of others.\" Moreover, an individual can only be awarded one Fields Medal; winners are ineligible to be awarded future medals.\nFirst awarded in 1936, 64 people have won the medal as of 2022. With the exception of two PhD holders in physics (Edward Witten and Martin Hairer), only people with a PhD in mathematics have won the medal.\nList of Fields medalists.\nIn certain years, the Fields medalists have been officially cited for particular mathematical achievements, while in other years such specificities have not been given. However, in every year that the medal has been awarded, noted mathematicians have lectured at the International Congress of Mathematicians on each medalist's body of work. In the following table, official citations are quoted when possible (namely for the years 1958, 1998, and every year since 2006). For the other years through 1986, summaries of the ICM lectures, as written by Donald Albers, Gerald L. Alexanderson, and Constance Reid, are quoted. In the remaining years (1990, 1994, and 2002), part of the text of the ICM lecture itself has been quoted. The upcoming awarding of the Fields Medal at the 2026 International Congress of the International Mathematical Union is planned to take place in Philadelphia.\nLandmarks.\nThe medal was first awarded in 1936 to the Finnish mathematician Lars Ahlfors and the American mathematician Jesse Douglas, and it has been awarded every four years since 1950. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions.\nIn 1954, Jean-Pierre Serre became the youngest winner of the Fields Medal, at 27. He retains this distinction.\nIn 1966, Alexander Grothendieck boycotted the ICM, held in Moscow, to protest against Soviet military actions taking place in Eastern Europe. L\u00e9on Motchane, founder and director of the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, attended and accepted Grothendieck's Fields Medal on his behalf.\nIn 1970, Sergei Novikov, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Nice to receive his medal.\nIn 1978, Grigory Margulis, because of restrictions placed on him by the Soviet government, was unable to travel to the congress in Helsinki to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: \"I cannot but express my deep disappointment\u2014no doubt shared by many people here\u2014in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration.\"\nIn 1982, the congress was due to be held in Warsaw but had to be rescheduled to the next year, because of martial law introduced in Poland on 13 December 1981. The awards were announced at the ninth General Assembly of the IMU earlier in the year and awarded at the 1983 Warsaw congress.\nIn 1990, Edward Witten became the first physicist to win the award.\nIn 1998, at the ICM, Andrew Wiles was presented by the chair of the Fields Medal Committee, Yuri I. Manin, with the first-ever IMU silver plaque in recognition of his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Don Zagier referred to the plaque as a \"quantized Fields Medal\". Accounts of this award frequently make reference that at the time of the award Wiles was over the age limit for the Fields medal. Although Wiles was slightly over the age limit in 1994, he was thought to be a favorite to win the medal; however, a gap (later resolved by Taylor and Wiles) in the proof was found in 1993.\nIn 2006, Grigori Perelman, who proved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, refused his Fields Medal and did not attend the congress.\nIn 2014, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first Iranian as well as the first woman to win the Fields Medal, and Artur Avila became the first South American and Manjul Bhargava became the first person of Indian origin to do so.\nIn 2022, Maryna Viazovska became the first Ukrainian (second, counting Vladimir Drinfeld, who at the time of the award was still a citizen of USSR) to win the Fields Medal, and June Huh became the first person of Korean ancestry to do so.\nMedal.\nThe medal was designed by Canadian sculptor R. Tait McKenzie. It is made of 14KT gold, has a diameter of 63.5mm, and weighs 169g.\nTranslation: \"Mathematicians gathered from the entire world have awarded [understood but not written: 'this prize'] for outstanding writings.\"\nIn the background, there is the representation of Archimedes' tomb, with the carving illustrating his theorem On the Sphere and Cylinder, behind an olive branch. (This is the mathematical result of which Archimedes was reportedly most proud: Given a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter, the ratio between their volumes is equal to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443.)\nThe rim bears the name of the prizewinner.\nFemale recipients.\nThe Fields Medal has had two female recipients, Maryam Mirzakhani from Iran in 2014, and Maryna Viazovska from Ukraine in 2022.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Fields Medal gained some recognition in popular culture due to references in the 1997 film, \"Good Will Hunting\". In the movie, Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) is an MIT professor who won the award prior to the events of the story. Throughout the film, references made to the award are meant to convey its prestige in the field.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10861", "revid": "13561751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10861", "title": "The Trial", "text": "1925 novel by Franz Kafka\nThe Trial () is a novel written by Franz Kafka in 1914 and 1915 and published posthumously on 26 April 1925. One of his best-known works, it tells the story of Josef K., a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Heavily influenced by Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and \"The Brothers Karamazov\", Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoevsky a blood relative. Like Kafka's two other novels, \"The Castle\" and \"Amerika\", \"The Trial\" was never completed, although it does include a chapter that appears to bring the story to an intentionally abrupt ending.\nAfter Kafka's death in 1924, his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede. The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar, Germany. The first English-language translation, by Willa and Edwin Muir, was published in 1937. In 1999, the book was listed in \"Le Monde\"'s 100 Books of the Century and as No.\u00a02 of the Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century.\nDevelopment.\nKafka drafted the opening sentence of \"The Trial\" in August 1914 and worked on the novel throughout 1915. This was an unusually productive period for Kafka, despite the outbreak of World War I, which significantly increased the pressures of his day job as an insurance agent.\nHaving begun by writing the opening and concluding sections of the novel, Kafka worked on the intervening scenes in a haphazard manner, using several different notebooks simultaneously. His friend Max Brod, knowing Kafka's habit of destroying his own work, eventually took the manuscript for safekeeping. It consisted of 161 loose pages torn from notebooks, which Kafka had bundled together into chapters. The order of the chapters was not made clear to Brod; nor was he told which parts were complete and which were unfinished. Following Kafka's death in 1924, Brod edited the work and assembled it into a novel to the best of his ability. Further editorial work has been done by later scholars, but Kafka's final vision for \"The Trial\" remains unknown.\nPlot summary.\nOn the morning of his thirtieth birthday, Josef K., the chief clerk of a bank, is unexpectedly arrested by two agents from an unidentified agency for an unspecified crime. The agents discuss the situation with Josef in the unoccupied room of his fellow lodger Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner, in the unexplained presence of three junior clerks from Josef's bank. Josef is not imprisoned, but left free to go about his business. His landlady, Frau Grubach, tries to console Josef about the trial. He visits B\u00fcrstner to explain the events, and then harasses her by kissing her without consent.\nJosef finds that Fr\u00e4ulein Montag, a lodger from another room, has moved in with Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner. He suspects that this is a coy manoeuvre meant to distance him from B\u00fcrstner, and resolves that she will eventually fall for his charms.\nJosef is summoned to appear at the court's address the coming Sunday, without being told the time or location. After a period of exploration he finds the court in the attic of a dilapidated working-class tenement block, at the back of a young washerwoman's home. Josef is rebuked for his lateness and mistaken for a house painter rather than a bank clerk. He arouses the assembly's hostility after a passionate plea about the absurdity of the trial and the falseness of the accusation, despite still not knowing the charges. The proceedings are interrupted by a man sexually assaulting the washerwoman in a corner. Josef notices that all the assembly members are wearing pins on their lapels which he interprets as signifying their membership of a secret organisation.\nThe following Sunday Josef goes to the courtroom again, but the court is not in session. The washerwoman gives him information about the process and attempts to seduce him before a law student, the man who assaulted her the previous week, takes her away, claiming her to be his mistress. The woman's husband, a court usher, then takes Josef on a tour of the court offices, which ends after Josef becomes extremely weak in the presence of other court officials and defendants.\nOne evening, in a storage room at his own bank, Josef discovers the two agents who arrested him being whipped for soliciting bribes from Josef, which he had complained about at court. Josef tries to argue with the flogger, saying that the men need not be whipped, but the flogger cannot be swayed. The next day he returns to the storage room and is shocked to find everything as he had found it the day before, including the whipper and the two agents.\nJosef is visited by his uncle Karl, who lives in the country. Worried by the rumors about his nephew, Karl introduces Josef to Herr Huld, a sickly and bedridden lawyer tended to by Leni, a young woman who shows an immediate attraction to Josef. During a conversation between Karl and Huld about Josef's case, Leni calls Josef away for a sexual encounter. Afterwards, Josef meets his angry uncle outside, who claims that Josef's lack of respect for the advocate, by leaving the meeting and romantically engaging with the woman who is apparently Huld's mistress, has hurt his case.\nJosef has become increasingly preoccupied by his case, to the detriment of his work. He has further meetings with Huld, and continues to engage in discreet trysts with Leni, but the advocate's work appears to be having no effect on the proceedings. At the bank, one of Josef's clients recommends he seek the advice of Titorelli, the court's official painter. Titorelli outlines the options he can help Josef pursue: indefinite postponement of the process, or a temporary acquittal that could at any point result in re-arrest. Unequivocal acquittal is not a viable option. \nSuspicious of the advocate's motives and the apparent lack of progress, Josef finally decides to dismiss Huld and take control of matters himself. Upon arriving at Huld's office, he meets a downtrodden merchant, Rudi Block, who offers Josef some insight from a fellow defendant's perspective. Block's case has continued for five years and he has gone from being a successful businessman to being almost bankrupt and is virtually enslaved by his dependence on the lawyer and Leni, with whom he appears to be sexually involved. The lawyer mocks Block in front of Josef for his dog-like subservience. This experience further poisons Josef's opinion of his lawyer.\nJosef is put in charge of accompanying an important Italian client to the city's cathedral, but the client never meets him there. While inside the cathedral, a priest calls Josef by name and tells him a fable (which was published earlier as \"Before the Law\") that is meant to explain his situation. The priest tells Josef that the parable is an ancient text of the court, and many generations of court officials have interpreted it differently.\nOn the eve of Josef's thirty-first birthday, two men arrive at his apartment. The three walk through the city, and Josef catches a brief glimpse of Fr\u00e4ulein B\u00fcrstner. They arrive at a small quarry outside the city, and the men kill Josef, stabbing him in the heart with a butcher's knife while strangling him. Josef summarizes his situation with his last words: \"Like a dog!\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10862", "revid": "32589484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10862", "title": "The Metamorphosis", "text": "1915 novella by Franz Kafka\nThe Metamorphosis (), also translated as The Transformation, is a novella by Franz Kafka published in 1915. One of Kafka's best-known works, \"The Metamorphosis\" tells the story of salesman Gregor Samsa, who wakes to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect (, lit. \"monstrous vermin\") and struggles to adjust to this condition, as does his family. The novella has been widely discussed among literary critics, who have offered varied interpretations. In popular culture and adaptations of the novella, the insect is commonly depicted as a cockroach.\nAbout 70 printed pages, it is the longest of the stories Kafka considered complete and published during his lifetime. It was first published in 1915 in the October issue of the journal \"Die wei\u00dfen Bl\u00e4tter\" under the editorship of Ren\u00e9 Schickele. The first edition in book form appeared in December 1915 in the series \"Der j\u00fcngste Tag\", edited by Kurt Wolff.\nPlot.\nGregor Samsa wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a \"monstrous vermin\". He initially considers the transformation to be temporary and slowly ponders the consequences of his metamorphosis. Stuck on his back and unable to get up and leave the bed, Gregor reflects on his job as a traveling salesman and cloth merchant, which he characterizes as being \"plagued with ... the always changing, never enduring human exchanges that don't ever become intimate\".\nHe sees his employer as a despot and would quickly quit his job if he were not his family's sole breadwinner and working off his bankrupt father's debts. While trying to move, Gregor finds that his office manager, the chief clerk, has shown up to check on him, indignant about Gregor's unexcused absence.\nGregor attempts to communicate with both the manager and his family, but all they can hear from behind the door is incomprehensible vocalizations. Gregor laboriously drags himself across the floor and opens the door. The clerk, upon seeing the transformed Gregor, flees the apartment. Gregor's family is horrified, and his father drives him back towards his room. Gregor is injured when he tries to force himself through the narrow doorway but gets unstuck when his father shoves him through.\nWith Gregor's unexpected transformation, his family is deprived of financial stability. They keep Gregor locked in his room, and he begins to accept his new identity and adapt to his new body. His sister Grete is the only one willing to bring him food, which she finds Gregor likes only if it is rotten. He spends much of his time crawling around on the floor, walls, and ceiling.\nUpon discovering Gregor's new pastime, Grete decides to remove his furniture to give him more space. She and her mother begin to empty the room of everything, except the sofa under which Gregor hides whenever anyone comes in. He finds their actions deeply distressing, fearing that he might forget his past as a human, and desperately tries to save a particularly loved portrait on the wall of a woman clad in fur. His mother loses consciousness at the sight of him clinging to the image to protect it.\nWhen Grete rushes out of the room to get some aromatic spirits, Gregor follows her and is slightly hurt when she drops a medicine bottle and it breaks. Their father returns home and angrily hurls apples at Gregor, one of which becomes lodged in his back, severely wounding him.\nGregor suffers from his injuries and eats very little. His father, mother, and sister all get jobs and increasingly begin to neglect him, and they use his room for storage. For a time, his family leaves Gregor's door open in the evenings so he can listen to them talk to each other, but this happens less frequently once they rent a room in the apartment to three male tenants, who are not told about Gregor.\nOne day, the charwoman, who briefly looks in on Gregor each day when she arrives and before she leaves, neglects to close his door fully. Attracted by Grete's violin-playing in the living room, Gregor crawls out and is spotted by the unsuspecting tenants, who complain about the apartment's unhygienic conditions and say they are leaving, will not pay anything for the time they have already stayed, and may take legal action.\nGrete, who is tired of taking care of Gregor and realizes the burden his existence puts on each member of the family, tells her parents they must get rid of \"it\" or they will all be ruined. Gregor, understanding that he is no longer wanted, laboriously makes his way back to his room and dies of starvation before sunrise. His body is discovered by the charwoman, who alerts his family and then disposes of the corpse.\nThe relieved and optimistic father, mother, and sister all take the day off work. They travel by tram into the countryside and make plans to move to a smaller apartment to save money. During the short trip, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa realize that, despite the hardships that have brought some paleness to her face, Grete has grown up into a pretty young lady with a good figure and they think about finding her a husband.\nCharacters.\nGregor Samsa.\nGregor is the main character of the story. He works as a traveling salesman in order to provide money for his sister and parents. He wakes up one morning finding himself transformed into an insect. After the metamorphosis, Gregor becomes unable to work and is confined to his room for most of the remainder of the story. This prompts his family to begin working once again. Gregor is depicted as isolated from society and often both misunderstands the true intentions of others and is misunderstood.\nGrete Samsa.\nGrete is Gregor's younger sister, and she becomes his caretaker after his metamorphosis. They initially have a close relationship, but this quickly fades. At first, she volunteers to feed him and clean his room, but she grows increasingly impatient with the burden and begins to leave his room in disarray out of spite. Her initial decision to take care of Gregor may have come from a desire to contribute and be useful to the family, since she becomes angry and upset when the mother cleans his room. It is made clear that Grete is disgusted by Gregor, as she always opens the window upon entering his room to keep from feeling nauseous and leaves without doing anything if Gregor is in plain sight. She plays the violin and dreams of going to the conservatory to study, a dream Gregor had intended to make happen; he had planned on making the announcement on Christmas Day. To help provide an income for the family after Gregor's transformation, she starts working as a salesgirl. Grete is also the first to suggest getting rid of Gregor, which causes Gregor to plan his own death. At the end of the story, Grete's parents realize that she has become beautiful and full-figured and decide to consider finding her a husband.\nMr. Samsa.\nMr. Samsa is Gregor's father. After the metamorphosis, he is forced to return to work in order to support the family financially. His attitude towards his son is harsh. He regards the transformed Gregor with disgust and possibly even fear and attacks Gregor on several occasions. Even when Gregor was human, Mr. Samsa regarded him mostly as a source of income for the family. Gregor's relationship with his father is modelled after Kafka's own relationship with his father. The theme of alienation becomes quite evident here.\nMrs. Samsa.\nMrs. Samsa is Gregor's mother. She is portrayed as a submissive wife. She suffers from asthma, which is a constant source of concern for Gregor. She is initially shocked at Gregor's transformation, but she still wants to enter his room. However, it proves too much for her and gives rise to a conflict between her maternal impulse and sympathy and her fear and revulsion at Gregor's new form.\nThe Charwoman.\nThe charwoman is an old widowed lady who is employed by the Samsa family after their previous maid begs to be dismissed on account of the fright she experiences owing to Gregor's new form. She is paid to take care of their household duties. Apart from Grete and her father, the charwoman is the only person who is in close contact with Gregor, and she is unafraid in her dealings with Gregor. She does not question his changed state; she seemingly accepts it as a normal part of his existence. She is the one who notices Gregor has died and disposes of his body.\nInterpretations.\nLike much of Kafka's work, \"The Metamorphosis\" tends to be given a religious (Max Brod) or psychological interpretation. It has been particularly common to read the story as an expression of Kafka's father complex, as was first done by Charles Neider in his \"The Frozen Sea: A Study of Franz Kafka\" (1948). Besides the psychological approach, interpretations focusing on sociological aspects, which see the Samsa family as a portrayal of general social circumstances, have also gained a large following.\nVladimir Nabokov rejected such interpretations, noting that they do not live up to Kafka's art. He instead chose an interpretation guided by the artistic detail but excluded any symbolic or allegoric meanings. Arguing against the popular father-complex theory, he observed that it is the sister more than the father who should be considered the cruelest person in the story, since she is the one backstabbing Gregor. In Nabokov's view, the central narrative theme is the artist's struggle for existence in a society replete with narrow-minded people who destroy him step by step. Commenting on Kafka's style, he writes, \"The transparency of his style underlines the dark richness of his fantasy world. Contrast and uniformity, style and the depicted, portrayal and fable are seamlessly intertwined\".\nIn 1989, Nina Pelikan Straus wrote a feminist interpretation of \"The Metamorphosis\", noting that the story is not only about the metamorphosis of Gregor but also about the metamorphosis of his family and, in particular, his younger sister Grete. Straus suggested that the social and psychoanalytic resonances of the text depend on Grete's role as a woman, daughter, and sister, and that prior interpretations failed to recognize Grete's centrality to the story.\nIn 1999, Gerhard Rieck pointed out that Gregor and his sister, Grete, form a pair, which is typical of many of Kafka's texts: it is made up of one passive, rather austere, person and another active, more libidinal, person. The appearance of figures with such almost irreconcilable personalities who form couples in Kafka's works has been evident since he wrote his short story \"Description of a Struggle\" (e.g. the narrator/young man and his \"acquaintance\"). They also appear in \"The Judgment\" (Georg and his friend in Russia), in all three of his novels (e.g. Robinson and Delamarche in \"Amerika\") as well as in his short stories \"A Country Doctor\" (the country doctor and the groom) and \"A Hunger Artist\" (the hunger artist and the panther). Rieck views these pairs as parts of one single person (hence the similarity between the names Gregor and Grete) and in the final analysis as the two determining components of the author's personality. Not only in Kafka's life but also in his oeuvre does Rieck see the description of a fight between these two parts.\nReiner Stach argued in 2004 that no elucidating comments were needed to illustrate the story and that it was convincing by itself, self-contained, even absolute. He believes that there is no doubt the story would have been admitted to the canon of world literature even if we had known nothing about its author.\nAccording to Peter-Andr\u00e9 Alt (2005), the figure of the insect becomes a drastic expression of Gregor Samsa's deprived existence. Reduced to carrying out his professional responsibilities, anxious to guarantee his advancement and vexed with the fear of making commercial mistakes, he is the creature of a functionalistic professional life.\nIn 2007, Ralf Sudau wrote that particular attention should be paid to the motifs of self-abnegation and disregard for reality. Gregor's earlier behavior was characterized by self-renunciation and his pride in being able to provide a secure and leisured existence for his family. When he finds himself in need of assistance and in danger of becoming a parasite, he does not want to admit this to himself and be disappointed by the treatment he receives from his family, which is becoming more and more careless and even hostile to him. According to Sudau, Gregor engages in self-denial by hiding his nauseating appearance under the sofa and gradually famishing, thereby complying with the more or less blatant wish of his family. His gradual emaciation and \"self-reduction\" shows signs of a fatal hunger strike (which on the part of Gregor is unconscious and unsuccessful, and on the part of his family not understood or ignored). Sudau also lists the names of selected interpreters of \"The Metamorphosis\" (e.g. Beicken, Sokel, Sautermeister and Schwarz) to whom the narrative is a metaphor for the suffering resulting from leprosy, an escape into the disease or a symptom onset, an image of an existence which is defaced by the career, or a revealing staging which cracks the veneer and superficiality of everyday circumstances and exposes its cruel essence. Sudau further notes that Kafka's representational style is on one hand characterized by an idiosyncratic interpenetration of realism and fantasy, a worldly mind, rationality, and clarity of observation, and on the other hand by folly, outlandishness, and fallacy. He also points to the grotesque and tragicomical, silent film-like elements.\nFernando Bermejo-Rubio (2012) argues that the story is often unjustly viewed as inconclusive. He reads the descriptions of Gregor and his family environment in \"The Metamorphosis\" to contradict each other. Diametrically opposed versions exist of Gregor's back, his voice, of whether he is ill or already undergoing the metamorphosis, whether he is dreaming or not, which treatment he deserves, of his moral point of view (false accusations made by Grete), and whether his family is blameless or not. Bermejo-Rubio emphasizes that Kafka ordered in 1915 that there should be no illustration of Gregor. He argues that it is exactly this absence of a visual narrator that is essential for Kafka's project, for he who depicts Gregor would stylize himself as an omniscient narrator. Another reason why Kafka opposed such an illustration is that the reader should not be biased in any way before reading. That the descriptions are not compatible with each other indicates that the opening statement is not to be trusted. If the reader is not hoodwinked by the first sentence and still thinks of Gregor as a human being, he will see that the story is conclusive and realize that Gregor is a victim of his own degeneration.\nVolker Dr\u00fcke (2013) believes that a crucial metamorphosis in the story is that of Grete, and the title of the story may be directed at her as well as Gregor. Gregor's metamorphosis is followed by his languishing and ultimately dying. Grete, by contrast, matures as a result of the new family circumstances and assumes responsibility. In the end \u2013 after the brother's death \u2013 the parents also notice that their daughter, \"who was getting more animated all the time, ... had recently blossomed into a pretty and shapely girl\", and they want to look for a partner for her. From this standpoint Grete's metamorphosis from a girl into a woman, is a subtextual theme of the story.\nAllan Beveridge (2009) believes that the story shows the isolating effects of being different from others around you. He states that the story \"shows how easy it is for carers and psychiatric staff to be unintentionally cruel to sufferers.\" The reaction of the family to Gregor's suffering can be viewed as a metaphor for the presence of a disabled individual in the family and the challenges that come along with it, not only to the individual but to the family itself.\nTranslations of the opening sentence.\n\"The Metamorphosis\" has been translated into English more than twenty times. In Kafka's original, the opening sentence is \"\". In their 1933 translation of the story \u2013 the first into English \u2013 Willa Muir and Edwin Muir rendered it as \"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect\". In Middle High German, \"Ungeziefer\" literally means \"unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice\" and is sometimes used colloquially to mean \"bug\", with the connotation of \"dirty, nasty bug\". It can also be translated as \"vermin\".\nThe phrase \"ungeheuren Ungeziefer\", describing the creature into which Gregor Samsa transforms, has been translated in at least sixteen different ways. These include the following:\nWhat kind of bug or vermin Kafka envisaged remains a debated mystery. Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor as any specific thing, but instead was trying to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation. In his letter to his publisher of 25 October 1915, in which he discusses his concern about the cover illustration for the first edition, Kafka does use the term \"Insekt\", though, saying \"The insect itself is not to be drawn. It is not even to be seen from a distance.\" Indeed, a \"conspicuous lack of naming is a characteristic of Kafka's writing, and its aim is arguably far more ingenious than to inspire readers to speculate on species classification... To seek to locate the animal in the encyclopedia is, in many ways, antithetical to the way Kafka's stories are constructed and incorporate ambiguity.\"\nVladimir Nabokov, who was a lepidopterist as well as a writer and literary critic, concluded from details in the text that Gregor was not a cockroach, but a beetle with wings under his shell, and capable of flight. Nabokov left a sketch annotated \"just over three feet long\" on the opening page of his English teaching copy. In his accompanying lecture notes, he discusses the type of insect Gregor has been transformed into. Noting that the cleaning lady addressed Gregor as \"dung beetle\" (\"Mistk\u00e4fer\"), e.g., \"Come here for a bit, old dung beetle!\" or \"Hey, look at the old dung beetle!\", Nabokov remarks that this was just her friendly way of addressing him, and that Gregor \"is not, technically, a dung beetle. He is merely a big beetle.\"\nTranslations of other passages.\nPaul Reitter, a professor of German Languages and Literature, compares three translations of a passage early in the novella, after Gregor awakes and wonders why he didn't hear his alarm clock: the Muirs', Susan Bernofsky's, and Mark Harman's.\nTranslation of the title.\nThe Translation Website states: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The German title, \"Die Verwandlung\", can be translated as either \"The Transformation\" or \"The Metamorphosis\". The most frequent choice is \"metamorphosis\", but this word has the disadvantage of being more \"literary\" and less commonly used in English than \"verwandlung\" is in German. The appearance of this word in the title perhaps too quickly alerts the reader to the strangeness of the story to follow; it doesn't really fit with the much more \"ordinary\" tone in which the story is narrated. Another problem is that those readers familiar with the word may know it primarily as a biological term referring to a caterpillar's transformation into a butterfly, not at all the type of transformation that the story describes. But despite these disadvantages, most contemporary translations use \"The Metamorphosis\" as the title of the story \u2014 mainly because it's the title that was most often used in earlier translations and therefore the one most familiar to English-language readers.\nMark Harman explains why he chose the title \"The Transformation\" for his translation of the story: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Although that story is commonly known as \"The Metamorphosis,\" Kafka, who had as a schoolboy not only read Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", that classic tale of \"forms changed into new bodies,\" but also translated a portion of it from the Latin, could have entitled his story \"Die Metamorphose\", but he did not do so. His decision to call the story \"Die Verwandlung\" certainly deserves to be respected in translation...\nAlthough M. A. Roberts titled his 2005 translation \"The Metamorphosis\", he notes that \"\"Kafka's title actually translates as\" The Transformation\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOnline editions"}

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His paintings, drawings, and engravings reflected contemporary historical upheavals and influenced important 19th- and 20th-century painters. Goya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.\nGoya was born in Fuendetodos, Aragon to a middle-class family in 1746. He studied painting from age 14 under Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n y Mart\u00ednez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs. He married Josefa Bayeu in 1773. Goya became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo-style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.\nAlthough Goya's letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He had a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 that left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and more pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social, and political levels and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year Manuel Godoy made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799, Goya became \"Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara\" (Prime Court Painter), the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his \"La maja desnuda\", a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. In 1800\u201301, he painted \"Charles IV of Spain and His Family\", also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez.\nIn 1807, Napoleon led the French army into the Peninsular War against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war, which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not speak his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his \"Disasters of War\" series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings \"The Second of May 1808\" and \"The Third of May 1808\". Other works from his mid-period include the \"Caprichos\" and \"Los Disparates\" etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity, mental asylums, witches, fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health.\nHis late period culminates with the \"Black Paintings\" of 1819\u20131823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the Quinta del Sordo (\"House of the Deaf Man\") where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain, he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of Bordeaux, accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, Leocadia Weiss, who may have been his lover. There he completed his \"La Tauromaquia\" series and a number of other works. Following a stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side, Goya died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82.\nEarly years (1746\u20131771).\nFrancisco de Goya was born in Fuendetodos, Arag\u00f3n, Spain, on 30 March 1746 to Jos\u00e9 Benito de Goya y Franque and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador. The family had moved that year from the city of Zaragoza, but there is no record of why; likely, Jos\u00e9 was commissioned to work there. They were lower middle-class. Jos\u00e9 was the son of a notary and of Basque origin, his ancestors being from Zerain, earning his living as a gilder, specialising in religious and decorative craftwork. He oversaw the gilding and most of the ornamentation during the rebuilding of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar (\"Santa Maria del Pilar\"), the principal cathedral of Zaragoza. Francisco was their fourth child, following his sister Rita (b. 1737), brother Tom\u00e1s (b. 1739) (who was to follow in his father's trade) and second sister Jacinta (b. 1743). There were two younger sons, Mariano (b. 1750) and Camilo (b. 1753).\nHis mother's family had pretensions of nobility and the house, a modest brick cottage, was owned by her family and, perhaps fancifully, bore their crest. About 1749 Jos\u00e9 and Gracia bought a home in Zaragoza and were able to return to live in the city. Although there are no surviving records, it is thought that Goya may have attended the Escuelas P\u00edas de San Ant\u00f3n, which offered free schooling. His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening; he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics. According to Robert Hughes the artist \"seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters, and his views on painting ... were very down to earth: Goya was no theoretician.\" At school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil Mart\u00edn Zapater; the 131 letters Goya wrote to him from 1775 until Zapater's death in 1803 give valuable insight into Goya's early years at the court in Madrid.\nVisit to Italy.\nAt age 14 Goya studied under the painter Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n, where he copied stamps for 4 years until he decided to work on his own, as he wrote later on \"paint from my invention\". He moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs, a popular painter with Spanish royalty. He clashed with his master, and his examinations were unsatisfactory. Goya submitted entries for the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1763 and 1766 but was denied entrance into the academia.\nRome was then the cultural capital of Europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity, while Spain lacked a coherent artistic direction, with all of its significant visual achievements in the past. Having failed to earn a scholarship, Goya relocated at his own expense to Rome in the old tradition of European artists stretching back at least to Albrecht D\u00fcrer. He was an unknown at the time and so the records are scant and uncertain. Early biographers have him travelling to Rome with a gang of bullfighters, where he worked as a street acrobat, or for a Russian diplomat, or fell in love with a beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abduct from her convent. It is possible that Goya completed two surviving mythological paintings during the visit, a \"Sacrifice to Vesta\" and a \"Sacrifice to Pan\", both dated 1771.\nIn 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition organized by the City of Parma. That year he returned to Zaragoza and painted elements of the cupolas of the Basilica of the Pillar (including \"Adoration of the Name of God\"), a cycle of frescoes for the monastic church of the Charterhouse of Aula Dei, and the frescoes of the Sobradiel Palace. He studied with the Aragonese artist Francisco Bayeu y Sub\u00edas and his painting began to show signs of the delicate tonalities for which he became famous. He befriended Francisco Bayeu and married his sister Josefa (he nicknamed her \"Pepa\") on 25 July 1773. Their first child, Antonio Juan Ramon Carlos, was born on 29 August 1774. Of their seven children only one, a son named Javier, survived into adulthood.\nMadrid (1775\u20131789).\nFrancisco Bayeu (Josefa Bayeu's brother), 1765 membership of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, and directorship of the tapestry works from 1777 helped Goya earn a commission for a series of tapestry cartoons for the Royal Tapestry Factory. Over five years he designed some 42 patterns, many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of El Escorial and the Palacio Real del Pardo, the residences of the Spanish monarchs. While designing tapestries was neither prestigious nor well paid, his cartoons are mostly popular in a rococo style, and Goya used them to bring himself to wider attention.\nThe cartoons were not his only royal commissions and were accompanied by a series of engravings, mostly copies after old masters such as Marcantonio Raimondi and Vel\u00e1zquez. Goya had a complicated relationship with the latter artist; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in Goya's attempts to copy and emulate him, he had access to a wide range of the long-dead painter's works that had been contained in the royal collection. Nonetheless, etching was a medium that the young artist was to master, a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs. His c.\u20091779 etching of \"The Garrotted Man\" (\"El agarrotado\") was the largest work he had produced to date, and an obvious foreboding of his later \"Disasters of War\" series.\nGoya was beset by illness, and his condition was used against him by his rivals, who looked jealously upon any artist seen to be rising in stature. Some of the larger cartoons, such as \"The Wedding\", were more than 8 by 10 feet, and had proved a drain on his physical strength. Ever resourceful, Goya turned this misfortune around, claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal. However, he found the format limiting, as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture, and was unsuited to the impasto and glazing techniques he was by then applying to his painted works. The tapestries seem as comments on human types, fashion and fads.\nOther works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the Church of San Francisco El Grande in Madrid, which led to his appointment as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art.\nCourt painter.\nIn 1783, the Count of Floridablanca, favorite of King Charles III, commissioned Goya to paint his portrait. He became friends with the King's half-brother Luis, and spent two summers working on portraits of both the Infante and his family. During the 1780s, his circle of patrons grew to include the Duke and Duchess of Osuna, the King and other notable people of the kingdom whom he painted. In 1786, Goya was given a salaried position as a painter to Charles III.\nGoya was appointed court painter to Charles IV in 1789. The following year he became First Court Painter, with a salary of 50,000 reales and an allowance of 500 ducats for a coach. He painted portraits of the king and the queen, and the Spanish Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy and many other nobles. These portraits are notable for their disinclination to flatter; his \"Charles IV of Spain and His Family\" is an especially brutal assessment of a royal family. Modern interpreters view the portrait as satirical; it is thought to reveal the corruption behind the rule of Charles IV. Under his reign his wife Louisa was thought to have had the real power, and thus Goya placed her at the center of the group portrait. From the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer, and the painting behind the family depicts Lot and his daughters, thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay.\nGoya earned commissions from the highest ranks of the Spanish nobility, including Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 9th Duke of Osuna and his wife Mar\u00eda Josefa Pimentel, 12th Countess-Duchess of Benavente, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba and his wife Mar\u00eda del Pilar de Silva, and Mar\u00eda Ana de Pontejos y Sandoval, Marchioness of Pontejos. In 1801 he painted Godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief War of the Oranges against Portugal. The two were friends, even if Goya's 1801 portrait is usually seen as satire. Yet even after Godoy's fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms. Godoy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the Caprichos and is widely believed to have commissioned \"La maja desnuda\".\nMiddle period (1793\u20131799).\n\"La Maja Desnuda\" (\"La maja desnuda\") has been described as \"the first totally profane life-size female nude in Western art\" without pretense to allegorical or mythological meaning. The identity of the \"Majas\" is uncertain. The most popularly cited models are the Duchess of Alba, with whom Goya was sometimes thought to have had an affair, and Pepita Tud\u00f3, mistress of Manuel de Godoy. Neither theory has been verified, and it remains as likely that the paintings represent an idealized composite. The paintings were never publicly exhibited during Goya's lifetime and were owned by Godoy. In 1808 all Godoy's property was seized by Ferdinand VII after his fall from power and exile, and in 1813 the Inquisition confiscated both works as 'obscene', returning them in 1836 to the Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando.\nIn 1798 he painted luminous and airy scenes for the pendentives and cupola of the Real Ermita (Chapel) of San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid. His depiction of a miracle of Saint Anthony of Padua is devoid of the customary angels and instead treats the miracle as if it were a theatrical event performed by ordinary people.\nAt some time between late 1792 and early 1793, an undiagnosed illness left Goya deaf. He became withdrawn and introspective while the direction and tone of his work changed. He began the series of aquatinted etchings, published in 1799 as the \"Caprichos\"\u2014completed in parallel with the more official commissions of portraits and religious paintings. In 1799 Goya published 80 \"Caprichos\" prints depicting what he described as \"the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and from the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual\". The visions in these prints are partly explained by the caption \"The sleep of reason produces monsters\". Yet these are not solely bleak; they demonstrate the artist's sharp satirical wit, as in \"Capricho\" number 52, \"What a Tailor Can Do!\"\nWhile convalescing between 1793 and 1794, Goya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin that marked a significant change in the tone and subject matter of his art, and drew from the dark and dramatic realms of fantasy nightmare. \"Yard with Lunatics\" is a vision of loneliness, fear and social alienation. The condemnation of brutality towards prisoners (whether criminal or insane) is a subject that Goya assayed in later works that focused on the degradation of the human figure. It was one of the first of Goya's mid-1790s cabinet paintings, in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between naturalism and fantasy that would preoccupy him for the rest of his career. He was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness, and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own self-doubt, anxiety and fear that he was losing his mind. Goya wrote that the works served \"to occupy my imagination, tormented as it is by contemplation of my sufferings.\" The series, he said, consisted of pictures which \"normally find no place in commissioned works\".\nGoya's physical and mental breakdown seems to have happened a few weeks after the French declaration of war on Spain. A contemporary reported, \"The noises in his head and deafness aren't improving, yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance.\" These symptoms may indicate a prolonged viral encephalitis, or possibly a series of miniature strokes resulting from high blood pressure and which affected the hearing and balance centres of the brain. Symptoms of tinnitus, episodes of imbalance and progressive deafness are typical of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. It is possible that Goya had cumulative lead poisoning, as he used massive amounts of lead white\u2014which he ground himself\u2014in his paintings, both as a canvas primer and as a primary colour.\nOther postmortem diagnostic assessments include Susac's syndrome or may point toward paranoid dementia, possibly due to brain trauma, as evidenced by marked changes in his work after his recovery, culminating in the \"black\" paintings. Art historians have noted Goya's singular ability to express his personal demons as horrific and fantastic imagery that speaks universally, and allows his audience to find its own catharsis in the images.\nPeninsular War (1808\u20131814).\nThe French army invaded Spain in 1808, leading to the Peninsular War of 1808\u20131814. The extent of Goya's involvement with the court of the \"intruder king\", Joseph I, the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, is not known; he painted works for French patrons and sympathisers, but kept neutral during the fighting. After the restoration of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII in 1814, Goya denied any involvement with the French. By the time of his wife Josefa's death in 1812, he was painting \"The Second of May 1808\" and \"The Third of May 1808\", and preparing the series of etchings later known as \"The Disasters of War\" (\"Los desastres de la guerra\"). Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in 1814 but relations with Goya were not cordial. The artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries, but not for the king himself.\nAlthough Goya did not make his intention known when creating \"The Disasters of War\", art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War and the move against liberalism in the aftermath of the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. The scenes are singularly disturbing, sometimes macabre in their depiction of battlefield horror, and represent an outraged conscience in the face of death and destruction. They were not published until 1863, 35 years after his death. It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons.\nThe first 47 plates in the series focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series (plates 48 to 64) record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811\u201312, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and opposed both state and religious reform. Since their first publication, Goya's scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the \"prodigious flowering of rage\".\nHis works from 1814 to 1819 are mostly commissioned portraits, but also include the altarpiece of Santa Justa and Santa Rufina for the Cathedral of Seville, the print series of \"La Tauromaquia\" depicting scenes from bullfighting, and probably the etchings of \"Los Disparates\".\nQuinta del Sordo and Black Paintings (1819\u20131822).\nRecords of Goya's later life are relatively scant, and ever politically aware, he suppressed a number of his works from this period, working instead in private. He was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness. Goya had been a successful and royally placed artist, but withdrew from public life during his final years. From the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside Madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio. The house had become known as \"La Quinta del Sordo\" (The House of the Deaf Man), after the nearest farmhouse that had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man.\nArt historians assume Goya felt alienated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, and that he viewed these developments as reactionary means of social control. In his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into Medievalism. It is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform, but like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored Bourbon monarchy and Catholic hierarchy rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812.\nAt the age of 75, alone and in mental and physical despair, he completed the work of his 14 \"Black Paintings\", all of which were executed in oil directly onto the plaster walls of his house. Goya did not intend for the paintings to be exhibited, did not write of them, and likely never spoke of them. Around 1874, 50 years after his death, they were taken down and transferred to a canvas support by owner Baron Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric \u00c9mile d'Erlanger. Many of the works were significantly altered during the restoration, and in the words of Arthur Lubow what remain are \"at best a crude facsimile of what Goya painted.\" The effects of time on the murals, coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas, meant that most of the murals suffered extensive damage and loss of paint. Today, they are on permanent display at the , Madrid.\nBordeaux (October 1824 \u2013 1828).\nLeocadia Weiss (n\u00e9e Zorrilla, 1790\u20131856), the artist's maid, younger by 35 years, and a distant relative, lived with and cared for Goya after Bayeu's death. She stayed with him in his Quinta del Sordo villa until 1824 with her daughter Rosario. Leocadia was probably similar in features to Goya's first wife Josefa Bayeu, to the point that one of his well-known portraits bears the cautious title of \"Josefa Bayeu (or Leocadia Weiss)\".\nNot much is known about her beyond her fiery temperament. She was likely related to the Goicoechea family, a wealthy dynasty into which the artist's son, Javier, had married. It is known that Leocadia had an unhappy marriage with a jeweler, Isidore Weiss, but was separated from him since 1811, after he had accused her of \"illicit conduct\". She had two children before that time, and bore a third, Rosario, in 1814 when she was 26. Isidore was not the father, and it has often been speculated\u2014although with little firm evidence\u2014that the child belonged to Goya. There has been much speculation that Goya and Weiss were romantically linked; however, it is more likely the affection between them was sentimental.\nGoya died on 16 April 1828. Leocadia was left nothing in Goya's will; mistresses were often omitted in such circumstances, but it is also likely that he did not want to dwell on his mortality by thinking about or revising his will. She wrote to a number of Goya's friends to complain of her exclusion but many of her friends were Goya's also and by then were old men or had died, and did not reply. Largely destitute, she moved into rented accommodation, later passing on her copy of the \"Caprichos\" for free.\nGoya's body was later re-interred in the Real Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida in Madrid. Goya's skull was missing, a detail the Spanish consul immediately communicated to his superiors in Madrid, who wired back, \"Send Goya, with or without head.\"\nGoya's influence on modern and contemporary artists and writers.\nGoya is often referred to as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. Among the 20th-century painters influenced by Goya are the Spanish masters Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal\u00ed who drew influence from \"Los caprichos\" and the \"Black Paintings\" of Goya. In the 21st century, American postmodern painters such as Michael Zansky and Bradley Rubenstein draw inspiration from \"The Dream of Reason Produces Monsters\" (1796\u201398) and Goya's \"Black Paintings\". Zanksy's \"Giants and Dwarf Series\" (1990\u20132002) of large-scale paintings and wood carvings use imagery from Goya.\nGoya's influence has extended beyond the visual arts:\nIn 2024, an extensive exhibition of Goya's etchings was held at the Norton Simon Museum in Southern California.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10869", "revid": "14383484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10869", "title": "Frequentist probability", "text": "Interpretation of probability\nFrequentist probability or frequentism is an interpretation of probability; it defines an event's probability (the \"long-run probability\") as the limit of its relative frequency in infinitely many trials.\nProbabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process, as in repeated sampling from the same population, and are thus ideally devoid of subjectivity. The continued use of frequentist methods in scientific inference, however, has been called into question.\nThe development of the frequentist account was motivated by the problems and paradoxes of the previously dominant viewpoint, the classical interpretation. In the classical interpretation, probability was defined in terms of the principle of indifference, based on the natural symmetry of a problem, so, for example, the probabilities of dice games arise from the natural symmetric 6-sidedness of the cube. This classical interpretation stumbled at any statistical problem that has no natural symmetry for reasoning.\nDefinition.\nIn the frequentist interpretation, probabilities are discussed only when dealing with well-defined random experiments. The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space of the experiment. An event is defined as a particular subset of the sample space to be considered. For any given event, only one of two possibilities may hold: It occurs or it does not. The relative frequency of occurrence of an event, observed in a number of repetitions of the experiment, is a measure of the probability of that event. This is the core conception of probability in the frequentist interpretation.\nA claim of the frequentist approach is that, as the number of trials increases, the change in the relative frequency will diminish. Hence, one can view a probability as the \"limiting value\" of the corresponding relative frequencies.\nScope.\nThe frequentist interpretation is a philosophical approach to the definition and use of probabilities; it is one of several such approaches. It does not claim to capture all connotations of the concept 'probable' in colloquial speech of natural languages.\nAs an interpretation, it is not in conflict with the mathematical axiomatization of probability theory; rather, it provides guidance for how to apply mathematical probability theory to real-world situations. It offers distinct guidance in the construction and design of practical experiments, especially when contrasted with the Bayesian interpretation. As to whether this guidance is useful, or is apt to mis-interpretation, has been a source of controversy. Particularly when the frequency interpretation of probability is mistakenly assumed to be the only possible basis for frequentist inference. So, for example, a list of mis-interpretations of the meaning of p-values accompanies the article on p-values; controversies are detailed in the article on statistical hypothesis testing. The Jeffreys\u2013Lindley paradox shows how different interpretations, applied to the same data set, can lead to different conclusions about the 'statistical significance' of a result.\nAs Feller notes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is no place in our system for speculations concerning the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow. Before speaking of it we should have to agree on an (idealized) model which would presumably run along the lines \"out of infinitely many worlds one is selected at random\u00a0...\" Little imagination is required to construct such a model, but it appears both uninteresting and meaningless.\nHistory.\nThe frequentist view may have been foreshadowed by Aristotle, in \"Rhetoric\",\nwhen he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nthe probable is that which for the most part happens \u2014 Aristotle \"Rhetoric\"\nPoisson (1837) clearly distinguished between objective and subjective probabilities.\nSoon thereafter a flurry of nearly simultaneous publications by Mill, Ellis (1843)\nand Ellis (1854), Cournot (1843),\nand Fries introduced the frequentist view. Venn (1866, 1876, 1888) provided a thorough exposition two decades later.\nThese were further supported by the publications of Boole and Bertrand. By the end of the 19th\u00a0century the frequentist interpretation was well established and perhaps dominant in the sciences. The following generation established the tools of classical inferential statistics (significance testing, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals) all based on frequentist probability.\nAlternatively,\nBernoulli\nunderstood the concept of frequentist probability and published a critical proof (the weak law of large numbers) posthumously (Bernoulli, 1713).\nHe is also credited with some appreciation for subjective probability (prior to and without Bayes' theorem).\nGauss and Laplace used frequentist (and other) probability in derivations of the least squares method a century later, a generation before Poisson.\nLaplace considered the probabilities of testimonies, tables of mortality, judgments of tribunals, etc. which are unlikely candidates for classical probability. In this view, Poisson's contribution was his sharp criticism of the alternative \"inverse\" (subjective, Bayesian) probability interpretation. Any criticism by Gauss or Laplace was muted and implicit. (However, note that their later derivations of least squares did not use inverse probability.)\nMajor contributors to \"classical\" statistics in the early 20th century included Fisher, Neyman, and Pearson. Fisher contributed to most of statistics and made significance testing the core of experimental science, although he was critical of the frequentist concept of \"repeated sampling from the same population\";\nNeyman formulated confidence intervals and contributed heavily to sampling theory; Neyman and Pearson paired in the creation of hypothesis testing. All valued objectivity, so the best interpretation of probability available to them was frequentist.\nAll were suspicious of \"inverse probability\" (the available alternative) with prior probabilities chosen by using the principle of indifference. Fisher said, \"...\u00a0the theory of inverse probability is founded upon an error, [referring to Bayes' theorem] and must be wholly rejected.\"\nWhile Neyman was a pure frequentist,\nFisher's views of probability were unique: Both Fisher and Neyman had nuanced view of probability. von Mises offered a combination of mathematical and philosophical support for frequentism in the era.\nEtymology.\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the term \"frequentist\" was first used by M.G. Kendall in 1949, to contrast with Bayesians, whom he called \"non-frequentists\".\nKendall observed\n3. ... we may broadly distinguish two main attitudes. One takes probability as 'a degree of rational belief', or some similar idea...the second defines probability in terms of frequencies of occurrence of events, or by relative proportions in 'populations' or 'collectives';(p101)\n12. It might be thought that the differences between the frequentists and the non-frequentists (if I may call them such) are largely due to the differences of the domains which they purport to cover.(p104)\n\"I assert that this is not so\" ... The essential distinction between the frequentists and the non-frequentists is, I think, that the former, in an effort to avoid anything savouring of matters of opinion, seek to define probability in terms of the objective properties of a population, real or hypothetical, whereas the latter do not. [emphasis in original]\n\"The Frequency Theory of Probability\" was used a generation earlier as a chapter title in Keynes (1921).\nThe historical sequence:\nThe primary historical sources in probability and statistics did not use the current terminology of \"classical\", \"subjective\" (Bayesian), and \"frequentist\" probability.\nAlternative views.\nProbability theory is a branch of mathematics. While its roots reach centuries into the past, it reached maturity with the axioms of Andrey Kolmogorov in 1933. The theory focuses on the valid operations on probability values rather than on the initial assignment of values; the mathematics is largely independent of any interpretation of probability.\nApplications and interpretations of probability are considered by philosophy, the sciences and statistics. All are interested in the extraction of knowledge from observations\u2014inductive reasoning. There are a variety of competing interpretations;\nAll have problems. The frequentist interpretation does resolve difficulties with the classical interpretation, such as any problem where the natural symmetry of outcomes is not known. It does not address other issues, such as the dutch book.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Esfandiary; ; October 15, 1930 \u2013 July 8, 2000) was a Belgian-born Iranian-American author, teacher, transhumanist philosopher, futurist, consultant, and Olympic athlete.\nHe became notable as a transhumanist with the book \"Are You a Transhuman?: Monitoring and Stimulating Your Personal Rate of Growth in a Rapidly Changing World\", published in 1989. In addition, he wrote a number of works of fiction under his original name F. M. Esfandiary.\nEarly life and education.\nFM-2030 was born Fereydoon M. Esfandiary on October 15, 1930, in Belgium to Iranian diplomat Abdol-Hossein \"A. H.\" Sadigh Esfandiary (1894\u20131986), who served from 1920 to 1960. He travelled widely as a child, having lived in 17 countries including Iran, India, and Afghanistan, by age 11. He represented Iran as a basketball player and wrestler at the 1948 Olympic Games in London. He attended primary school in Iran and England and completed his secondary education at Colleges Des Freres, a Jesuit school in Jerusalem. By the time he was 18, aside from his native Persian, he learned to speak 4 languages: Arabic, Hebrew, French and English. He then started his college education at the University of California, Berkeley, but later transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, where he graduated in 1952. Afterwards, he served on the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine from 1952 to 1954.\nName change and opinions.\nIn 1970, after publishing his book \"Optimism One\", F. M. Esfandiary started going by FM-2030 for two main reasons: firstly, to reflect the hope and belief that he would live to celebrate his 100th birthday in 2030; secondly, and more importantly, to break free of the widespread practice of naming conventions that he saw as rooted in a collectivist mentality, and existing only as a relic of humankind's tribalistic past. He formalized his name change in 1988. He viewed traditional names as almost always stamping a label of collective identity \u2013 varying from gender to nationality \u2013 on the individual, thereby existing as \"prima facie\" elements of thought processes in the human cultural fabric, that tended to degenerate into stereotyping, factionalism, and discrimination. In his own words, \"Conventional names define a person's past: ancestry, ethnicity, nationality, religion. I am not who I was ten years ago and certainly not who I will be in twenty years. [...] The name 2030 reflects my conviction that the years around 2030 will be a magical time. In 2030 we will be ageless, and everyone will have an excellent chance to live forever. 2030 is a dream and a goal.\" As a staunch anti-nationalist, he believed \"There are no illegal immigrants, only irrelevant borders.\".\nIn 1973, he published a political manifesto \"Up-Wingers: A Futurist Manifesto\" in which he portrays both the ideological left and right as outdated, and in their place proposes a schema of Up-Wingers (those who look to the sky and the future) and Down-Wingers (those who look to the earth and the past). FM-2030 identified with the former. He argued that the nuclear family structure and the idea of a city would disappear, being replaced by modular social communities he called \"mobilia\", powered by communitarianism, which would persist and then disappear.\nFM-2030 believed that synthetic body parts would one day make life expectancy irrelevant; shortly before his death from pancreatic cancer, he described the pancreas as \"a stupid, dumb, wretched organ\".\nIn terms of civilization, he stated: \"No civilization of the past was great. They were all primitive and persecutory, founded on mass subjugation and mass murder.\" In terms of identity, he stated \"The young modern is not losing his identity. He is gladly disencumbering himself of it.\" He believed that eventually, nations would disappear, and that identities would shift from cultural to personal. In a 1972 op-Ed in \"The New York Times\", he wrote that the leadership in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict had failed, and that the warring sides were \"acting like adolescents, refuse to resolve their wasteful 25-year-old brawl\", and he believed that the world was \"irreversibly evolving beyond the concept of national homeland\".\nPersonal life.\nFM-2030 was a lifelong vegetarian and said he would not eat anything that had a mother. He famously refused to answer any questions about his nationality, age and upbringing, claiming that such questions were irrelevant and that he was a \"global person\". FM-2030 once said, \"I am a 21st century person who was accidentally launched in the 20th. I have a deep nostalgia for the future.\" As he spent much of his childhood in India, he was noted to have spoken English with a slight Indian accent. He taught at The New School, University of California, Los Angeles, and Florida International University. He worked as a corporate consultant for Lockheed and J. C. Penney. He was also an atheist.\nFM-2030 was, in his own words, a follower of \"up-wing\" politics (i.e. neither right-wing nor left-wing but something else), and by which he meant that he endorsed universal progress. He had been in a non-exclusive \"friendship\" (his preferred term for relationship) with Flora Schnall, a lawyer and fellow Harvard Law Class of 1959 graduate, from the 1960s until his death. FM-2030 and Schnall attended the same class as Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He resided in Westwood, Los Angeles, as well as Miami.\nDeath.\nFM-2030 died on July 8, 2000, from pancreatic cancer at a friend's apartment in Manhattan. He was placed in cryonic suspension at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona, where his body remains today. He did not yet have remote standby arrangements, so no Alcor team member was present at his death, but FM-2030 was the first person to be vitrified, rather than simply frozen as previous cryonics patients had been. FM-2030 was survived by four sisters and one brother.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some of the main cities where West Flemish is widely spoken are Bruges, Kortrijk, Ostend, Roeselare and Ypres in Belgium and Hazebrouck, Cassel, Halluin, and Bailleul in France.\nWest Flemish is listed as a \"vulnerable\" language in UNESCO's online Red Book of Endangered Languages.\nPhonology.\nWest Flemish has a phonology that differs significantly from that of Standard Dutch, being similar to Afrikaans in the case of long E, O and A. Also where Standard Dutch has \"sch\", in some parts of West Flanders, West-Flemish, like Afrikaans, has \"sk\". However, the best known traits are the replacement of Standard Dutch (pre-)velar fricatives \"g\" and \"ch\" in Dutch () with glottal \"h\" . The following differences are listed by their Dutch spelling, as some different letters have merged their sounds in Standard Dutch but remained separate sounds in West Flemish. Pronunciations can also differ slightly from region to region.\nThe absence of and in West Flemish makes pronouncing them very difficult for native speakers. That often causes hypercorrection of the sounds to a or .\nStandard Dutch also has many words with an \"-en\" () suffix (mostly plural forms of verbs and nouns). While Standard Dutch and most dialects do not pronounce the final \"n\", West Flemish typically drops the \"e\" and pronounces the \"n\" inside the base word. For base words already ending with \"n\", the final \"n\" sound is often lengthened to clarify the suffix. That makes many words become similar to those of English: \"beaten\", \"listen\" etc.\nThe short \"o\" () can also be pronounced as a short \"u\" (), a phenomenon also occurring in Russian and some other Slavic languages, called akanye. That happens spontaneously to some words, but other words keep their original short \"o\" sounds. Similarly, the short \"a\" () can turn into a short \"o\" () in some words spontaneously.\nThe diphthong \"ui\" () does not exist in West Flemish and is replaced by a long \"u\" () or a long \"ie\" (). Like for the \"ui\", the long \"o\" () can be replaced by an (\"eu\") for some words but a for others. That often causes similarities to ranchers English. \nHere are some examples showing the sound shifts that are part of the vocabulary:\nGrammar.\nPlural form.\nPlural forms in Standard Dutch most often add \"-en\", but West Flemish usually uses \"-s\", like the Low Saxon dialects and even more prominently in English in which \"-en\" has become very rare. Under the influence of Standard Dutch, \"-s\" is being used by fewer people, and younger speakers tend to use \"-en\".\nVerb conjugation.\nThe verbs \"zijn\" (\"to be\") and \"hebben\" (\"to have\") are also conjugated differently.\nDouble subject.\nWest Flemish often has a double subject.\nArticles.\nStandard Dutch has an indefinite article that does not depend on gender, unlike in West Flemish. However, a gender-independent article is increasingly used. Like in English, \"n\" is pronounced only if the next word begins with a vowel sound.\nConjugation of \"yes\" and \"no\".\nAnother feature of West Flemish is the conjugation of \"ja\" and \"nee\" (\"yes\" and \"no\") to the subject of the sentence. That is somewhat related to the double subject, but even when the rest of the sentence is not pronounced, \"ja\" and \"nee\" are generally used with the first part of the double subject.\nThis conjugation can be negated with the extra word, \"toet\" (), or strengthened by adding mo- or ba- (or both). \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10875", "revid": "35751661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10875", "title": "Fritz Leiber", "text": "American fantasy, horror, and SF writer (1910\u20131992)\nFritz Reuter Leiber Jr. ( ; December 24, 1910\u00a0\u2013 September 5, 1992) was an American writer of fantasy, horror, and science fiction.\nLife.\nFritz Leiber was born December 24, 1910, in Chicago, Illinois, to the actors Fritz Leiber and Virginia Bronson Leiber. For a time, he seemed inclined to follow in his parents' footsteps; the theater and actors feature in his fiction. He spent 1928 touring with his parents' Shakespeare company (Fritz Leiber &amp; Co.) before entering the University of Chicago, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received an undergraduate Ph.B. degree in psychology and physiology or biology with honors in 1932. From 1932 to 1933, he worked as a lay reader and studied as a candidate for the ministry, without taking a degree, at the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea, Manhattan, an affiliate of the Episcopal Church.\nAfter pursuing graduate studies in philosophy at the University of Chicago from 1933 to 1934 and again not taking a degree, he remained in Chicago while touring under the stage name of \"Francis Lathrop\" intermittently with his parents' company and pursuing a literary career. Six short stories later included in the 2010 collection \"Strange Wonders: A Collection of Rare Fritz Leiber Works\" carry 1934 and 1935 dates. He also appeared alongside his father in uncredited parts in George Cukor's \"Camille\" (1936), James Whale's \"The Great Garrick\" (1937), and William Dieterle's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1939).\nIn 1936, he initiated a brief, intense correspondence with H. P. Lovecraft, who \"encouraged and influenced [Leiber's] literary development\" before Lovecraft died in March 1937. Leiber introduced Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser in \"Two Sought Adventure\", his first professionally published short story in the August 1939 edition of \"Unknown\", edited by John W. Campbell.\nLeiber married Jonquil Stephens on January 16, 1936. Their only child, philosopher and science fiction writer Justin Leiber, was born in 1938. From 1937 to 1941, Fritz Leiber was employed by Consolidated Book Publishing as a staff writer for the \"Standard American Encyclopedia\". In 1941, the family moved to California, where Leiber served as a speech and drama instructor at Occidental College during the 1941\u20131942 academic year.\nUnable to conceal his disdain for academic politics as the United States entered World War II, he decided that the struggle against fascism mattered more than his long-held pacifist convictions. He accepted a position with Douglas Aircraft in quality inspection, primarily working on the C-47 Skytrain. Throughout the war, he continued to regularly publish fiction.\nThereafter, the family returned to Chicago, where Leiber served as associate editor of \"Science Digest\" from 1945 to 1956. During this decade (forestalled by a fallow interregnum from 1954 to 1956), his output (including the 1947 Arkham House anthology \"Night's Black Agents\") was characterized by Poul Anderson as \"a lot of the best science fiction and fantasy in the business\". In 1958, the Leibers returned to Los Angeles. By then, he could afford to relinquish his journalistic career and support his family as a full-time fiction writer.\nJonquil's death in 1969 precipitated Leiber's permanent relocation to San Francisco and exacerbated his longstanding alcoholism after twelve years of fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous. He gradually regained sobriety, an effort impeded by comorbid barbiturate abuse, over the next two decades. Perhaps as a result of his substance abuse, Leiber seems to have suffered periods of penury in the 1970s; Harlan Ellison wrote of his anger at finding that the much-awarded Leiber had to write his novels on a manual typewriter propped up over the sink in his apartment. Marc Laidlaw wrote that, when visiting Leiber as a fan in 1976, he \"was shocked to find him occupying one small room of a seedy San Francisco residence hotel, its squalor relieved mainly by walls of books\". Other reports suggest that Leiber preferred to live simply in the city, spending his money on dining, movies, and travel. In the last years of his life, royalty checks from TSR, Inc. (the makers of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", who had licensed the mythos of the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser series) were enough in themselves to ensure that he lived comfortably. In 1977, he returned to his original form with a fantasy novel set in modern-day San Francisco, \"Our Lady of Darkness\", which is about a writer of weird tales who must deal with the death of his wife and his recovery from alcoholism.\nIn 1992, the last year of his life, Leiber married his second wife, Margo Skinner, a journalist and poet with whom he had been friends for years. Leiber died a few weeks after a physical collapse while traveling from a science fiction convention in London, Ontario, with Skinner. His cause of death was a stroke.\nHe wrote a 100-page-plus memoir, \"Not Much Disorder and Not So Early Sex\", which can be found in \"The Ghost Light\" (1984).\nLeiber's own literary criticism, including several essays on Lovecraft, was collected in the volume \"Fafhrd and Me\" (1990).\nTheater.\nAs the child of two Shakespearean actors, Leiber was fascinated with the stage, describing itinerant Shakespearean companies in stories like \"No Great Magic\" and \"Four Ghosts in Hamlet\", and creating an actor/producer protagonist for his novel \"A Specter is Haunting Texas\".\nAlthough his \"Change War\" novel, \"The Big Time\", is about a war between two factions, the \"Snakes\" and the \"Spiders\", changing and rechanging history throughout the universe, all the action takes place in a small bubble of isolated space-time the size of a theatrical stage, and with only a handful of characters. Judith Merril (in the July 1969 issue of \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\") remarks on Leiber's acting skills when the writer won a science fiction convention costume ball. Leiber's costume consisted of a cardboard military collar over turned-up jacket lapels, cardboard insignia, an armband, and a spider pencilled large in black on his forehead, thus turning him into an officer of the Spiders, one of the combatants in his Change War stories. \"The only other component,\" Merril writes, \"was the Leiber instinct for theatre.\"\nFilms.\nDue to having the same name as his father, Leiber Jr. was incorrectly attributed to some roles which were in fact played by his father. Fritz Leiber Sr. was the evil Inquisitor in the Errol Flynn adventure film \"The Sea Hawk\" (1940) and many other movies from 1917 to the late 1950s. It is the elder Leiber, not the younger, who appears in Charlie Chaplin's \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (1947) and the Vincent Price vehicle \"The Web\" (1947).\nThe younger Leiber can be seen briefly as Valentin in the 1936 film version of \"Camille\" starring Greta Garbo. In the cult horror film \"Equinox\" (1970) directed by Dennis Muren and Jack Woods, Leiber has a cameo appearance as a geologist, Dr. Watermann. In the edited second version of the movie, Leiber has no spoken dialogue but appears in a few scenes. The original version of the movie has a longer appearance by Leiber recounting the ancient book and a brief speaking role; all were cut from the re-release.\nHe also appears as Chavez in the 1979 Schick Sunn Classics documentary \"The Bermuda Triangle\", based on the book by Charles Berlitz.\nWriting career.\nLeiber was heavily influenced by H. P. Lovecraft, Robert Graves, John Webster, and Shakespeare in the first two decades of his career. Beginning in the late 1950s, he was increasingly influenced by the works of Carl Jung, particularly by the concepts of the anima and the shadow. In the mid-1960s, he began incorporating elements of Joseph Campbell's \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\". These concepts are often mentioned in his stories, especially the anima, which becomes a method of exploring his fascination with, but estrangement from, the female.\nLeiber liked cats, which are featured in many of his stories. Tigerishka, for example, is a cat-like alien who is sexually attractive to the human protagonist yet repelled by human customs in the novel \"The Wanderer\". Leiber's \"Gummitch\" stories feature a kitten with an I.Q. of 160, just waiting for his ritual cup of coffee so that he can become human, too.\nHis first stories in the 1930s and 40s were inspired by Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. A notable critic and historian of the wider Mythos, S. T. Joshi, has singled out Leiber's \"The Sunken Land\" (\"Unknown Worlds\", February 1942) as the most accomplished of the early stories based on Lovecraft's Mythos. Leiber also later wrote several essays on Lovecraft the man, such as \"A Literary Copernicus\" (1949), the publication of which formed a key moment in the emergence of a serious critical appreciation of Lovecraft's life and work.\nLeiber's first professional sale was \"Two Sought Adventure\" (\"Unknown\", August 1939), which introduced his most famous characters, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. In 1943, his first two novels were serialized in \"Unknown\" (the supernatural horror-oriented \"Conjure Wife\", inspired by his experiences on the faculty of Occidental College) and \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (\"Gather, Darkness\").\n1947 marked the publication of his first book, \"Night's Black Agents\", a short story collection containing seven stories grouped as 'Modern Horrors', one as a 'Transition', and two grouped as 'Ancient Adventures': \"The Sunken Land\" and \"Adept's Gambit\", which are both stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.\nThe science fiction novel \"Gather, Darkness\" followed in 1950. It deals with a futuristic world that follows the Second Atomic Age which is ruled by scientists, until in the throes of a new Dark Age, the witches revolt.\nIn 1951, Leiber was Guest of Honor at the World Science Fiction Convention in New Orleans. Further novels followed during the 1950s, and in 1958 \"The Big Time\" won the Hugo Award for Best Novel.\nLeiber continued to publish in the 1960s. His novel \"The Wanderer\" (1964) also won the Hugo for Best Novel. In the novel, an artificial planet nicknamed the Wanderer materializes from hyperspace within earth's orbit. The Wanderer's gravitational field captures the moon and shatters it into something like one of Saturn's rings. On Earth, the Wanderer's gravity well triggers earthquakes, tsunamis, and tidal phenomena. The multi-threaded plot follows the exploits of an ensemble cast as they struggle to survive the global disaster.\nIn the same period, Leiber published \"Black Gondolier\", a short story in which a protagonist uncovers a cosmic conspiracy in which oil from ancient fossils preys upon human beings and human civilizations. Leiber received the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1970 and 1971 for \"Ship of Shadows\" (1969) and \"Ill Met in Lankhmar\" (1970). \"Gonna Roll the Bones\" (1967), his contribution to Harlan Ellison's \"Dangerous Visions\" anthology, won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette and the Nebula Award for Best Novelette in 1968.\n\"Our Lady of Darkness\" (1977), originally serialized in short form in \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\" under the title \"The Pale Brown Thing\" (1977), featured cities as the breeding grounds for new types of elementals called paramentals, summonable by the dark art of megapolisomancy, with such activities centering on the Transamerica Pyramid. Its main characters include Franz Westen, Jaime Donaldus Byers, and the magician Thibault de Castries. \"Our Lady of Darkness\" won the World Fantasy Award\u2014Novel.\nLeiber, a lifelong devotee of Edgar Rice Burroughs, also wrote the 1966 novelization of the Clair Huffaker screenplay of \"Tarzan and the Valley of Gold\".\nMany of Leiber's most acclaimed works are short stories, especially in the horror genre, including \"The Smoke Ghost\", \"The Girl With the Hungry Eyes\", and \"You're All Alone\" (later expanded as \"The Sinful Ones\"). Leiber also challenged the conventions of science fiction through reflexive narratives such as \"A Bad Day For Sales\" (first published in \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", July 1953), in which the protagonist, Robie, \"America\u2019s only genuine mobile salesrobot\", references the title character of Isaac Asimov's idealistic robot story, \"Robbie\". Questioning Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, Leiber imagines the futility of automatons in a post-apocalyptic New York City. In his later years, Leiber returned to short story horror in such works as \"Horrible Imaginings\", \"Black Has Its Charms\" and the award-winning \"The Button Moulder\".\nThe short parallel worlds story \"Catch That Zeppelin!\" (1975) won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story and the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1976. It presents an alternate reality much better than our own, as opposed to the usual parallel universe story depicting a world worse than our own. \"Belsen Express\" (1975) won the World Fantasy Award\u2014Short Fiction.\nLeiber was named the second Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy by participants in the 1975 World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), after the posthumous inaugural award to J. R. R. Tolkien. Next year he won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. He was Guest of Honor at the 1979 Worldcon in Brighton, England (1979). The Science Fiction Writers of America made him its fifth SFWA Grand Master in 1981; the Horror Writers Association made him an inaugural winner of the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1988 (named in 1987); and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2001, its sixth class of two deceased and two living writers.\nLeiber was a founding member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of Heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter. Some works by SAGA members were published in Carter's \"Flashing Swords!\" anthologies. Leiber himself is credited with inventing the term sword and sorcery for the particular subgenre of epic fantasy exemplified by his Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories.\nIn an appreciation in the July 1969 \"Special Fritz Leiber Issue\" of \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\", Judith Merril writes of Leiber's connection with his readers: \"That this kind of \"personal\" response...is shared by thousands of other readers, has been made clear on several occasions.\" The November 1959 issue of \"Fantastic\", for instance: Leiber had just come out of one of his recurrent dry spells, and editor Cele Lalli bought up all his new material until there was enough [five stories] to fill an issue; the magazine came out with a big black headline across its cover \u2014 \"Leiber Is Back!\"\nFafhrd and the Gray Mouser.\nHis legacy has been consolidated by his most famous creations, the \"Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser\" stories, written over a span of 50 years. The first, \"Two Sought Adventure\", appeared in \"Unknown\", August 1939. The stories are about an unlikely pair of heroes found in and around the city of Lankhmar. Fafhrd was based on Leiber himself and the Mouser on his friend Harry Otto Fischer, and the two characters were created in a series of letters exchanged by the two in the mid-1930s. These stories were among the progenitors of many of the tropes of sword and sorcery.\nSome Fafhrd and Mouser stories were recognized by annual genre awards: \"Scylla's Daughter\" (1961) was \"Short Story\" Hugo finalist, and \"Ill Met in Lankhmar\" (1970) won the \"Best Novella\" Hugo and Nebula Awards. Leiber's last major work, \"The Knight and Knave of Swords\" (1991), closed out the series while leaving room for possible sequels. In his last year, Leiber considered allowing other writers to continue the series, but his sudden death made this more difficult. One new Fafhrd and the Mouser novel, \"Swords Against the Shadowland\", by Robin Wayne Bailey, appeared in 1998.\nThe stories influenced the shaping of sword and sorcery and other works. Joanna Russ' stories about thief-assassin Alyx (collected in 1976 in \"The Adventures of Alyx\") were in part inspired by Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Alyx made guest appearances in two of Leiber's stories. More recently, playing off the visit of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser to our world in \"Adept's Gambit\" (set in second century B.C. Tyre), Steven Saylor's short story \"Ill Seen in Tyre\" takes his Roma Sub Rosa series hero Gordianus to the city of Tyre a hundred years later, where the two visitors from Nehwon are remembered as local legends.\nFischer and Leiber contributed to the original design of the 1976 wargame \"Lankhmar\" from TSR.\nSelected works.\nScreen adaptations.\n\"Conjure Wife\" has been made into feature films four times under other titles:\n\"The Girl with the Hungry Eyes\" was filmed under that title by Kastenbaum Films in 1995.

However, there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics, and history, and sometimes involving neighbouring countries. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish, which can also refer to the collective of Dutch dialects spoken in that area, or more generally the Belgian variant of Standard Dutch. \nMost Flemings live within the Flemish Region, which is a federal state within Belgium with its own elected government. However, like Belgium itself, the official capital of Flanders is the City of Brussels, which lies within the Brussels-Capital Region, not the Flemish Region, and the majority of residents there are French speaking. The powers of the Flemish Government in Brussels are limited mainly to Flemish culture and education.\nGeographically, Flanders is mainly flat, and incorporates the whole coast of Belgium on the North Sea. It borders the French department of Nord to the south-west near the coast, the Dutch provinces of Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg to the north and east, and the Walloon provinces of Hainaut, Walloon Brabant and Li\u00e8ge to the south. Despite accounting for only 45% of Belgium's territory, more than half the population lives there \u2013 6,821,770 (or 58%) out of 11,763,650 Belgian inhabitants, as of January 2024. Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated at . The Brussels Region is an officially bilingual enclave within the Flemish Region. Flanders also has exclaves of its own: Voeren in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and Baarle-Hertog in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands. Not including Brussels, there are five present-day Flemish provinces: Antwerp, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant, Limburg and West Flanders. The official language is Dutch.\nThe area of today's Flanders has figured prominently in European history since the Middle Ages. The original County of Flanders stretched around AD 900 from the Strait of Dover to the Scheldt estuary and expanded from there. This county also still corresponds roughly with the modern-day Belgian provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders, along with neighbouring parts of France and the Netherlands. In this period, cities such as Ghent and Bruges of the historic County of Flanders, and later Antwerp of the Duchy of Brabant made it one of the richest and most urbanised parts of Europe, trading, and weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy.\nBelgium was one of the centres of the 19th-century Industrial Revolution, but this occurred mainly in French-speaking Wallonia. In the second half of the 20th century, and due to massive national investments in port infrastructure, Flanders' economy modernised rapidly, and today Flanders and Brussels are much wealthier than Wallonia, being among the wealthiest regions in Europe and the world. In accordance with late 20th century Belgian state reforms, Flanders was made into two political entities: the Flemish Region () and the Flemish Community (). These entities were merged, although geographically the Flemish Community, which has a broader cultural mandate, covers Brussels, whereas the Flemish Region does not.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nModern Belgium.\nThe term \"Flanders\" has several main modern meanings:\nHistorical.\nThe name originally applied to the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\" territory called the County of Flanders, that existed from the 8th century (Latin \"Flandria\") until its absorption by the French First Republic. Until the 1600s, this county also extended over parts of what are now France and the Netherlands.\nHowever, the term came to be used for a bigger territory, and this is critical to the evolution of modern terminology. Once the Counts of Flanders (who were also Dukes of Burgundy) expanded their regional power to create the bigger entity, now referred to by historians as the Burgundian Netherlands, \"Flanders\", along with Latin \"Belgium\", were the first two common names to describe this regional block. With the breakaway of the northern Netherlands in the early modern period, the term Flanders continued to be associated with the whole southern part of the Low Countries\u2014the Southern, Spanish or Austrian Netherlands, which were the successors of the Burgundian state, and also predecessors of modern Belgium. The restriction of the term Flanders to the Germanic speaking part of the population occurred later.\nDutch-speaking part of Belgium.\nThe term \"Flemish\" came to be a term for the language Dutch, and during the 19th and 20th centuries, it became increasingly common to refer exclusively to the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium as \"Flanders\". Belgium divided itself into official French- and Dutch-speaking parts starting in the early 1960s. Today Flanders extends over the northern part of Belgium, including not only the Dutch-speaking Belgian parts of the medieval Duchy of Brabant, which was united with Flanders since the Middle Ages, but also Belgian Limburg, which corresponds closely to the medieval County of Loon, and was never under Burgundian control.\nThe ambiguity between this wider cultural area and that of the county or province still remains in discussions about the region. In most present-day contexts however, the term Flanders is taken to refer to either the political, social, cultural, and linguistic community (and the corresponding official institution, the Flemish Community), or the geographical area, one of the three institutional regions in Belgium, namely the Flemish Region.\nIn the history of art and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and Netherlandish are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term \"Flemish Primitives\", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for \"Early Netherlandish painting\", and it is not uncommon to see Mosan art categorized as Flemish art. In music the \"Franco-Flemish School\" is also known as the \"Dutch School\".\nWithin this Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, French has never ceased to be spoken by some citizens, and Jewish groups have been speaking Yiddish in Antwerp for centuries. Regardless of nationality or linguistic background, according to Belgian Law education in schools located in the Flemish Region must be mainly in the Dutch language. In Brussels, teaching is also done in French.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nWhen Julius Caesar conquered the area he described it as the less economically developed and more warlike part of \"Gallia Belgica\". His informants told him that especially in the east, the tribes claimed ancestral connections and kinship with the \"Germanic\" peoples then east of the Rhine. Under the Roman Empire the whole of \"Gallia Belgica\" became an administrative province. The future counties of Flanders and Brabant remained part of this province connected to what is now France, but in the east modern Limburg became part of the Rhine frontier province of \"Germania Inferior\" connected to what is now the Netherlands and Germany. \"Gallia Belgica\" and \"Germania Inferior\" were the two most northerly continental provinces of the Roman Empire.\nIn the future county of Flanders, the main Belgic tribe in early Roman times was the Menapii, but also on the coast were the Marsacii and Morini. In the central part of modern Belgium were the Nervii, whose territory corresponded to medieval Brabant as well as French-speaking Hainaut. In the east was the large district of the Tungri which covered both French- and Dutch-speaking parts of eastern Belgium. The Tungri were understood to have links to Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. Another notable group were the Toxandrians who appear to have lived in the Kempen region, in the northern parts of both the Nervian and Tungrian districts, probably stretching into the modern Netherlands. The Roman administrative districts (\"civitates\") of the Menapii, Nervii and Tungri therefore corresponded roughly with the medieval counties of Flanders, Brabant and Loon, and the modern Flemish provinces of East and West Flanders (Menapii), Brabant and Antwerp (the northern Nervii), and Belgian Limburg (part of the Tungri). Brabant appears to have been separated from the Tungri by a relatively unpopulated forest area, the Silva Carbonaria, forming a natural boundary between northeast and southwest Belgium.\nLinguistically, the tribes in this area were under Celtic influence in the south, and Germanic influence in the east, but there is disagreement about what languages were spoken locally (apart from Vulgar Latin), and there may even have been an intermediate \"Nordwestblock\" language related to both. By the first century AD, Germanic languages appear to have become prevalent in the area of the Tungri.\nAs Roman influence waned, Frankish populations settled in the Tungiran area east of the Silva Carbonaria, and eventually pushed through it under Chlodio. They had kings in each Roman district (\"civitas\"). In the meantime, the Franks contributed to the Roman military. The first Merovingian king Childeric I was king of the Franks within the military of Gaul. He became leader of the administration of \"Belgica Secunda\", which included the \"civitas\" of the Menapii (the future county of Flanders). From there, his son Clovis I managed to conquer both the Roman populations of northern France and the Frankish populations beyond the forest areas.\nHistorical Flanders.\nThe County of Flanders was a feudal fief in West Francia. The first certain Count in the comital family, Baldwin I of Flanders, is first reported in a document of 862, when he eloped with a daughter of his king Charles the Bald. The region developed as a medieval economic power with a large degree of political autonomy. While its trading cities remained strong, it was weakened and divided when districts fell under direct French royal rule in the late 12th century. The remaining parts of Flanders came under the rule of the counts of neighbouring imperial Hainaut under Baldwin V of Hainaut in 1191.\nDuring the late Middle Ages, Flanders's trading towns (notably Ghent, Bruges and Ypres) made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a sophisticated culture developed, with impressive art and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Ghent, Bruges, Ypres and the Franc of Bruges formed the Four Members, a form of parliament that exercised considerable power in Flanders.\nIncreasingly powerful from the 12th century, the territory's autonomous urban communes were instrumental in defeating a French attempt at annexation (1300\u20131302), finally defeating the French in the Battle of the Golden Spurs (11 July 1302), near Kortrijk. Two years later, the uprising was defeated and Flanders indirectly remained part of the French Crown. Flemish prosperity waned in the following century, due to widespread European population decline following the Black Death of 1348, the disruption of trade during the Anglo-French Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453), and increased English cloth production. Flemish weavers had gone over to Worstead and North Walsham in Norfolk in the 12th century and established the woolen industry.\nThe County of Flanders started to take control of the neighbouring County of Brabant during the life of Louis II, Count of Flanders (1330\u20131384), who fought his sister-in-law Joanna, Duchess of Brabant for control of it.\nThe entire area, straddling the ancient boundary of France and the Holy Roman Empire, later passed to Philip the Bold in 1384, the Duke of Burgundy, with his capital in Brussels. The titles were eventually more clearly united under his grandson Philip the Good (1396 \u2013 1467). This large Duchy passed in to the Habsburg dynasty, and in 1556 to the kings of Spain. Western and southern districts of Flanders were confirmed under French rule under successive treaties of 1659 (Artois), 1668 and 1678.\nThe County of Loon, approximately the modern Flemish province of Limburg, remained independent of France, forming a part of the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge until the French Revolution, but surrounded by the Burgundians, and under their influence.\nLow Countries.\nBeeldenstorm.\nIn 1500, Charles V was born in Ghent. He inherited the Seventeen Provinces (1506), Spain (1516) with its colonies and in 1519 was elected Holy Roman Emperor. Charles V issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, which established the Low Countries as the Seventeen Provinces (or Spanish Netherlands in its broad sense) as an entity separate from the Holy Roman Empire and from France. In 1556 Charles V abdicated due to ill health (he suffered from crippling gout). Spain and the Seventeen Provinces went to his son, Philip II of Spain.\nOver the first half of the 16th century Antwerp grew to become the second-largest European city north of the Alps by 1560. Antwerp was the richest city in Europe at this time. According to Luc-Normand Tellier \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Americas.\"\nMeanwhile, Protestantism had reached the Low Countries. Among the wealthy traders of Antwerp, the Lutheran beliefs of the German Hanseatic traders found appeal, perhaps partly for economic reasons. The spread of Protestantism in this city was aided by the presence of an Augustinian cloister (founded 1514) in the St. Andries quarter. Luther, an Augustinian himself, had taught some of the monks, and his works were in print by 1518. The first Lutheran martyrs came from Antwerp. The Reformation resulted in consecutive but overlapping waves of reform: a Lutheran, followed by a militant Anabaptist, then a Mennonite, and finally a Calvinistic movement. These movements existed independently of each other.\nPhilip II, a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the Counter-Reformation, suppressed Calvinism in Flanders, Brabant and Holland (what is now approximately Belgian Limburg was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge and was Catholic \"de facto\"). In 1566, the wave of iconoclasm known as the \"Beeldenstorm\" was a prelude to religious war between Catholics and Protestants, especially the Anabaptists. The \"Beeldenstorm\" started in what is now French Flanders, with open-air sermons () that spread through the Low Countries, first to Antwerp and Ghent, and from there further east and north.\nThe Eighty Years' War and its consequences.\nSubsequently, Philip II of Spain sent the Duke of Alba to the Provinces to repress the revolt. Alba recaptured the southern part of the Provinces, who signed the Union of Atrecht, which meant that they would accept the Spanish government on condition of more freedom. But the northern part of the provinces signed the Union of Utrecht and settled in 1581 the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. Spanish troops quickly started fighting the rebels, and the Spanish armies conquered the important trading cities of Bruges and Ghent. Antwerp, which was then the most important port in the world, also had to be conquered. But before the revolt was defeated, a war between Spain and England broke out, forcing Spanish troops to halt their advance. On 17 August 1585, Antwerp fell. This ended the Eighty Years' War for the (from now on) Southern Netherlands. The United Provinces (the Northern Netherlands) fought on until 1648 \u2013 the Peace of Westphalia.\nDuring the war with England, the rebels from the north, strengthened by refugees from the south, started a campaign to reclaim areas lost to Philip II's Spanish troops. They conquered a considerable part of Brabant (the later North Brabant of the Netherlands), and the south bank of the Scheldt estuary (Zeelandic Flanders), before being stopped by Spanish troops. The front at the end of this war stabilized and became the border between present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The Dutch (as they later became known) had managed to reclaim enough of Spanish-controlled Flanders to close off the river Scheldt, effectively cutting Antwerp off from its trade routes.\nThe fall of Antwerp to the Spanish and the closing of the Scheldt caused considerable emigration. Many Calvinist merchants of Antwerp and other Flemish cities left Flanders and migrated north. Many of them settled in Amsterdam, which was a smaller port, important only in the Baltic trade. The Flemish exiles helped to rapidly transform Amsterdam into one of the world's most important ports. This is why the exodus is sometimes described as \"creating a new Antwerp\".\nFlanders and Brabant, went into a period of relative decline from the time of the Thirty Years' War. In the Northern Netherlands, the mass emigration from Flanders and Brabant became an important driving force behind the Dutch Golden Age.\nSouthern Netherlands (1581\u20131795).\nAlthough arts remained relatively impressive for another century with Peter Paul Rubens (1577\u20131640) and Anthony van Dyck, Flanders lost its former economic and intellectual power under Spanish, Austrian, and French rule. Heavy taxation and rigid imperial political control compounded the effects of industrial stagnation and Spanish-Dutch and Franco-Austrian conflict. The Southern Netherlands suffered severely under the Franco-Dutch War, Nine Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession. But under the reign of Empress Maria-Theresia, these lands again flourished economically. Influenced by the Enlightenment, the Austrian Emperor Joseph II was the first sovereign who had been in the Southern Netherlands since King Philip II of Spain left them in 1559.\nFrench Revolution and Napoleonic France (1795\u20131815).\nIn 1794, the French Republican Army started using Antwerp as the northernmost naval port of France. The following year, France officially annexed Flanders as the \"d\u00e9partements\" of Lys, Escaut, Deux-N\u00e8thes, Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure and Dyle. Obligatory (French) army service for all men aged 16\u201325 years was a main reason for the uprising against the French in 1798, known as the \"Boerenkrijg\" (\"Peasants' War\"), with the heaviest fighting in the Campine area.\nUnited Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131830).\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo in Brabant, the Congress of Vienna (1815) gave sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands \u2013 Belgium minus the East Cantons and Luxembourg \u2013 to the United Netherlands (Dutch: \"Verenigde Nederlanden\") under Prince William I of Orange Nassau, making him William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. William I started rapid industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. But the political system failed to forge a true union between the north and south. Most of the southern bourgeoisie was Roman Catholic and French-speaking, while the north was mainly Protestant and Dutch-speaking.\nIn 1815, the Dutch Senate was reinstated (Dutch: \"Eerste Kamer der Staaten Generaal\"). The nobility, mainly coming from the south, became increasingly estranged from their northern colleagues. Resentment grew between the Roman Catholics from the south and the Protestants from the north, and also between the powerful liberal bourgeoisie from the south and their more moderate colleagues from the north. On 25 August 1830 (after the showing of the opera 'La Muette de Portici' of Daniel Auber in Brussels) the Belgian Revolution sparked. On 4 October 1830, the Provisional Government (Dutch: \"Voorlopig Bewind\") proclaimed its independence, which was later confirmed by the National Congress that issued a new Liberal Constitution and declared the new state a Constitutional Monarchy, under the House of Saxe-Coburg. Flanders now became part of the Kingdom of Belgium, which was recognized by the major European Powers on 20 January 1831. The cessation was recognized by the United Kingdom of the Netherlands on 19 April 1839.\nKingdom of Belgium.\nIn 1830, the Belgian Revolution led to the splitting up of the two countries. Belgium was confirmed as an independent state by the Treaty of London of 1839, but deprived of the eastern half of Limburg (now Dutch Limburg), and the Eastern half of Luxembourg (now the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg). Sovereignty over Zeelandic Flanders, south of the Westerscheldt river delta, was left with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was allowed to levy a toll on all traffic to Antwerp harbour until 1863.\nRise of the Flemish Movement.\nIn 1873, Dutch became an official language in public secondary schools. In 1898, Dutch and French were declared equal languages in laws and Royal orders. In 1930, the first Flemish university was opened.\nThe first official translation of the Belgian constitution in Dutch was not published until 1967.\nWorld War I and its consequences.\nFlanders (and Belgium as a whole) saw some of the greatest loss of life on the Western Front of the First World War, in particular from the three battles of Ypres.\nThe war strengthened Flemish identity and consciousness. The occupying German authorities took several Flemish-friendly measures. The resulting suffering of the war is remembered by Flemish organizations during the yearly Yser pilgrimage in Diksmuide at the monument of the Yser Tower.\nRight-wing nationalism in the interbellum and World War II.\nDuring the interbellum and World War II, several right-wing fascist and/or national-socialistic parties emerged in Belgium. Since these parties were promised more rights for the Flemings by the German government during World War II, many of them collaborated with the Nazi regime. After the war, collaborators (or people who were \"Zwart\", \"Black\" during the war) were prosecuted and punished, among them many Flemish nationalists whose main political goal had been the emancipation of Flanders. As a result, until today Flemish nationalism is often associated with right-wing politics. Flemish nationalism is however a direct consequence of the events of the years prior to the first World War, in which many were oppressed by the French speaking majority. This ultimately gave way to a rising feeling of cultural autonomy and even a sense of a nationalism.\nFlemish autonomy.\nAfter World War II, the differences between Dutch-speaking and French-speaking Belgians became clear in a number of conflicts, such as the Royal Question, the question whether King Leopold III should return (which most Flemings supported but Walloons did not) and the use of Dutch in the Catholic University of Leuven. As a result, several state reforms took place in the second half of the 20th century, which transformed the unitary Belgium into a federal state with communities, regions and language areas. This resulted also in the establishment of a Flemish Parliament and Government. During the 1970s, all major political parties split into a Dutch and French-speaking party.\nSeveral Flemish parties still advocate for more Flemish autonomy, some even for Flemish independence (see Partition of Belgium), whereas the French-speakers would like to keep the current state as it is. Recent governments (such as Verhofstadt I Government) have transferred certain federal competences to the regional governments.\nOn 13 December 2006, a spoof news broadcast by the Belgian Francophone public broadcasting station RTBF announced that Flanders had decided to declare independence from Belgium.\nThe 2007 federal elections showed more support for Flemish autonomy, marking the start of the 2007\u20132011 Belgian political crisis. All the political parties that advocated a significant increase of Flemish autonomy gained votes as well as seats in the Belgian federal parliament. This was especially the case for Christian Democratic and Flemish and New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) (who had participated on a shared electoral list). The trend continued during the 2009 regional elections, where CD&amp;V and N-VA were the clear winners in Flanders, and N-VA became even the largest party in Flanders and Belgium during the 2010 federal elections, followed by the longest-ever government formation after which the Di Rupo I Government was formed excluding N-VA. Eight parties agreed on a sixth state reform which aim to solve the disputes between Flemings and French-speakers. However, the 2012 provincial and municipal elections continued the trend of N-VA becoming the biggest party in Flanders.\nHowever, sociological studies show no parallel between the rise of nationalist parties and popular support for their agenda. Instead, a recent study revealed a majority in favour of returning regional competences to the federal level.\nGovernment and politics.\nBoth the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region are constitutional institutions of the Kingdom of Belgium, exercising certain powers within their jurisdiction, granted following a series of state reforms. In practice, the Flemish Community and Region together form a single body, with its own parliament and government, as the Community legally absorbed the competences of the Region. The parliament is a directly elected legislative body composed of 124 representatives. The government consists of up to 11 members and is presided by a Minister-President, currently Geert Bourgeois (New Flemish Alliance) leading a coalition of his party (N-VA) with Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD&amp;V) and Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten (Open VLD).\nThe area of the Flemish Community is represented on the maps above, including the area of the Brussels-Capital Region (hatched on the relevant map). Roughly, the Flemish Community exercises competences originally oriented towards the individuals of the Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education, and the use of the language. Extensions to personal matters less directly associated with language comprise sports, health policy (curative and preventive medicine), and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, immigrant assistance services, etc.)\nThe area of the Flemish Region is represented on the maps above. It has a population of more than 6 million (excluding the Dutch-speaking community in the Brussels Region, grey on the map for it is not a part of the Flemish Region). Roughly, the Flemish Region is responsible for territorial issues in a broad sense, including economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit, and foreign trade. It supervises the provinces, municipalities, and intercommunal utility companies.\nThe number of Dutch-speaking Flemish people in the Capital Region is estimated to be between 11% and 15% (official figures do not exist as there is no language census and no official subnationality). According to a survey conducted by the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve and published in June 2006, 51% of respondents from Brussels claimed to be bilingual, even if they do not have Dutch as their first language. They are governed by the Brussels Region for economics affairs and by the Flemish Community for educational and cultural issues.\nAs mentioned above, Flemish institutions such as the Flemish Parliament and Government, represent the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region. The region and the community thus \"de facto\" share the same parliament and the same government. All these institutions are based in Brussels. Nevertheless, both types of subdivisions (the Community and the Region) still exist legally and the distinction between both is important for the people living in Brussels. Members of the Flemish Parliament who were elected in the Brussels Region cannot vote on affairs belonging to the competences of the Flemish Region.\nThe official language for all Flemish institutions is Dutch. French enjoys a limited official recognition in a dozen municipalities along the borders with French-speaking Wallonia, and a large recognition in the bilingual Brussels Region. French is widely known in Flanders, with 59% claiming to know French according to a survey conducted by UCLouvain in Louvain-la-Neuve and published in June 2006.\nPolitics.\nHistorically, the political parties reflected the pillarisation (\"verzuiling\") in Flemish society. The traditional political parties of the three pillars are Christian-Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V), the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open Vld) and the Socialist Party \u2013 Differently (sp.a).\nHowever, during the last half century, many new political parties were founded in Flanders. One of the first was the nationalist People's Union, of which the right nationalist Flemish Block (now Flemish Interest) split off, and which later dissolved into the now-defunct Spirit or Social Liberal Party, moderate nationalism rather left of the spectrum, on the one hand, and the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), more conservative but independentist, on the other hand. Other parties are the leftist alternative/ecological Green party; the short-lived anarchistic libertarian spark ROSSEM and more recently the conservative-right liberal List Dedecker, founded by Jean-Marie Dedecker, and the socialist Workers' Party.\nParticularly the Flemish Block/Flemish Interest has seen electoral success roughly around the turn of the century, and the New Flemish Alliance during the last few elections, even becoming the largest party in the 2010 federal elections.\nFlemish independence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFor some inhabitants, Flanders is more than just a geographical area or the federal institutions (Flemish Community and Region). Supporters of the Flemish Movement even call it a nation and pursue Flemish independence, but most people (approximately 75%) living in Flanders say they are proud to be Belgian and opposed to the dissolution of Belgium. 20% is even \"very proud\", while some 25% are not proud and 8% is \"very not proud\". Mostly students claim to be proud of their nationality, with 90% of them saying so. Of the people older than 55, 31% claim to be proud of being a Belgian. Particular opposition to secession comes from women, people employed in services, the highest social classes and people from big families. Strongest of all opposing the notion are housekeepers\u2014both housewives and house husbands.\nIn 2012, the Flemish government drafted a \"Charter for Flanders\" (\"Handvest voor Vlaanderen\") of which the first article says \"Vlaanderen is een deelstaat van de federale Staat Belgi\u00eb en maakt deel uit van de Europese Unie.\" (\"Flanders is a component state of the federal State of Belgium and is part of the European Union\"). In 2025, Prime Minister De Wever expressed his desire to reunite with The Netherlands, calling the Belgian separation \"a disaster\".\nGeography.\nFlanders shares its borders with Wallonia in the south, Brussels being an enclave within the Flemish Region. The rest of the border is shared with the Netherlands (Zeelandic Flanders in Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg) in the north and east, and with France (French Flanders in Hauts-de-France) and the North Sea in the west. Voeren is an exclave of Flanders between Wallonia and the Netherlands, while Baarle-Hertog in Flanders forms a complicated series of enclaves and exclaves with Baarle-Nassau in the Netherlands. Germany, although bordering Wallonia and close to Voeren in Limburg, does not share a border with Flanders. The German-speaking Community of Belgium, also close to Voeren, does not border Flanders either. (The commune of Plombi\u00e8res, majority French speaking, lies between them.)\nFlanders is a highly urbanised area, lying completely within the Blue Banana. Antwerp, Ghent, Bruges and Leuven are the largest cities of the Flemish Region. Antwerp has a population of more than 500,000 citizens and is the largest city, Ghent has a population of 250,000 citizens, followed by Bruges with 120,000 citizens and Leuven counts almost 100,000 citizens.\nBrussels is a part of Flanders as far as community matters are concerned, but does not belong to the Flemish Region.\nFlanders has two main geographical regions: the coastal Yser basin plain in the north-west and a central plain. The first consists mainly of sand dunes and clayey alluvial soils in the polders. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by dikes or, a little further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. With similar soils along the lowermost Scheldt basin starts the central plain, a smooth, slowly rising fertile area irrigated by many waterways that reaches an average height of about above sea level with wide valleys of its rivers upstream as well as the Campine region to the east having sandy soils at altitudes around thirty metres. Near its southern edges close to Wallonia one can find slightly rougher land, richer in calcium, with low hills reaching up to and small valleys, and at the eastern border with the Netherlands, in the Meuse basin, there are marl caves (\"mergelgrotten\"). Its exclave around Voeren between the Dutch border and Wallonia's Li\u00e8ge Province attains a maximum altitude of above sea level.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe present-day Flemish Region covers and is divided into five provinces, 22 arrondissements and 285 cities or municipalities.\nThe province of Flemish Brabant is the most recently created, being formed in 1995 after the splitting of the province of Brabant on a linguistic basis.\nMost municipalities are made up of several former municipalities, now called \"deelgemeenten\". The largest municipality (both in terms of population and area) is Antwerp, having more than half a million inhabitants. Its nine \"deelgemeenten\" have a special status and are called districts, which have an elected council and a college. While any municipality with more than 100,000 inhabitants can establish districts, only Antwerp did this so far. The smallest municipality (also both in terms of population and area) is Herstappe (Limburg).\nThe Flemish Community covers both the Flemish Region and, together with the French Community, the Brussels-Capital Region. Brussels, an enclave within the province of Flemish Brabant, is not divided into any province nor is it part of any. It coincides with the Arrondissement of Brussels-Capital and includes 19 municipalities.\nThe Flemish Government has its own local institutions in the Brussels-Capital Region, being the \"Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie\" (VGC), and its municipal antennae (\"Gemeenschapscentra\", community centres for the Flemish community in Brussels). These institutions are independent from the educational, cultural and social institutions that depend directly on the Flemish Government. They exert, among others, all those cultural competences that outside Brussels fall under the provinces.\nClimate.\nThe climate is maritime temperate, with significant precipitation in all seasons (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"Cfb\"; the average temperature is in January, and in July; the average precipitation is in January, and in July).\nEconomy.\nTotal gross regional product (GRP) of Flanders in 2021 was \u20ac296 billion (excluding Brussels). Per capita GDP at purchasing power parity was 20% above the EU average. Flemish productivity per capita is about 13% higher than that in Wallonia, and wages are about 7% higher than in Wallonia.\nFlanders was one of the first continental European areas to undergo the Industrial Revolution, in the 19th century. Initially, the modernization relied heavily on food processing and textile. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846\u201350). After World War II, Antwerp and Ghent experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries. Flanders also attracted a large majority of foreign investments in Belgium. The 1973 and 1979 oil crises sent the economy into a recession. The steel industry remained in relatively good shape. In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of Belgium continued to shift further to Flanders and is now concentrated in the populous Flemish Diamond area. Nowadays, the Flemish economy is mainly service-oriented.\nBelgium is a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, which evolved into the present-day European Union. In 1999, the euro, the single European currency, was introduced in Flanders. It replaced the Belgian franc in 2002.\nThe Flemish economy is strongly export-oriented, in particular of high value-added goods. The main imports are food products, machinery, rough diamonds, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, clothing and accessories, and textiles. The main exports are automobiles, food and food products, iron and steel, finished diamonds, textiles, plastics, petroleum products, and non-ferrous metals. Since 1922, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market within a customs and currency union\u2014the Belgium\u2013Luxembourg Economic Union. Its main trading partners are Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States, and Spain.\nAntwerp is the number one diamond market in the world, diamond exports account for roughly 1/10 of Belgian exports. The Antwerp-based BASF plant is the largest BASF base outside Germany, and accounts on its own for about 2% of Belgian exports. Other industrial and service activities in Antwerp include car manufacturing, telecommunications, and photographic products.\nFlanders is home to several science and technology institutes, such as IMEC, VITO, Flanders DC, and Flanders Make.\nInfrastructure.\nFlanders has developed an extensive transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways and highways. The Port of Antwerp is the second-largest in Europe, after Rotterdam. Other ports are Bruges-Zeebrugge, Ghent and Ostend, of which Zeebrugge and Ostend are located at the Belgian coast.\nWhereas railways are managed by the federal National Railway Company of Belgium, other public transport (De Lijn) and roads are managed by the Flemish region.\nThe main airport is Brussels Airport, the only other civilian airport with scheduled services in Flanders is Antwerp International Airport, but there are two other ones with cargo or charter flights: Ostend-Bruges International Airport and Kortrijk-Wevelgem International Airport, both in West Flanders.\nDemographics.\nThe highest population density is found in the area circumscribed by the Brussels-Antwerp-Ghent-Leuven agglomerations that surround Mechelen and is known as the Flemish Diamond, in other important urban centres as Bruges, Roeselare and Kortrijk to the west, and notable centres Turnhout and Hasselt to the east. On 1 January 2015, the Flemish Region had a population of 6,444,127 and about 20% of the 1,175,173 people in the Brussels Region are also considered Flemish.\nReligion.\nThe Belgian constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the various governments in general respect this right in practice. Since independence, Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong freethought movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics, since the 20th century in Flanders mainly via the Christian trade union ACV and the Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&amp;V). According to the \"2001 Survey and Study of Religion\", about 47 percent of the Belgian population identify themselves as belonging to the Catholic Church, while Islam is the second-largest religion at 3.5 percent. A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered more religious than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious, and 36% believed that God created the world.\nJews have been present in Flanders for a long time, in particular in Antwerp. More recently, Muslims have immigrated to Flanders, now forming the largest minority religion with about 3.9% in the Flemish Region and 25% in Brussels. The largest Muslim group is Moroccan in origin, while the second-largest is Turkish in origin.\nEducation.\nEducation is compulsory from the ages of six to 18, but most Flemings continue to study until around 23. Among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 1999, Flanders had the third-highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in postsecondary education. Flanders also scores very high in international comparative studies on education. Its secondary school students consistently rank among the top three for mathematics and science. However, the success is not evenly spread: ethnic minority youth score consistently lower, and the difference is larger than in most comparable countries.\nMirroring the historical political conflicts between the secular and Catholic segments of the population, the Flemish educational system is split into a secular branch controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, and a subsidised religious\u2014mostly Catholic\u2014branch. For the subsidised schools, the main costs such as the teacher's wages and building maintenance completely borne by the Flemish government. Subsidised schools are also free to determine their own teaching and examination methods, but in exchange, they must be able to prove that certain minimal terms are achieved by keeping records of the given lessons and exams. It should however be noted that\u2014at least for the Catholic schools\u2014the religious authorities have very limited power over these schools, neither do the schools have a lot of power on their own. Instead, the Catholic schools are a member of the Catholic umbrella organisation VSKO. The VSKO determines most practicalities for schools, like the advised schedules per study field. However, there's freedom of education in Flanders, which doesn't only mean that every pupil can choose his/her preferred school, but also that every organisation can found a school, and even be subsidised when abiding the different rules. This resulted also in some smaller school systems follow 'methodical pedagogies' (e.g. Steiner, Montessori, or Freinet) or serve the Jewish and Protestant minorities.\nDuring the school year 2003\u20132004, 68.30% of the total population of children between the ages of six and 18 went to subsidized private schools (both religious schools or 'methodical pedagogies' schools).\nThe big freedom given to schools results in a constant competition to be the \"best\" school. The schools get certain reputations amongst parents and employers. So it's important for schools to be the best school since the subsidies depend on the number of pupils. This competition has been pinpointed as one of the main reasons for the high overall quality of the Flemish education. However, the importance of a school's reputation also makes schools more eager to expel pupils that don't perform well. Resulting in the ethnic differences and the well-known waterfall system: pupils start high in the perceived hierarchy, and then drop towards more professional oriented directions or \"easier\" schools when they can't handle the pressure any longer.\nHealthcare.\nHealthcare is a federal matter, but the Flemish Government is responsible for care, health education and preventive care.\nCulture.\nLanguage and literature.\nThe standard language in Flanders is Dutch; spelling and grammar are regulated by a single authority, the Dutch Language Union (\"Nederlandse Taalunie\"), comprising a committee of ministers of the Flemish and Dutch governments, their advisory council of appointed experts, a controlling commission of 22 parliamentarians, and a secretariate. The term Flemish can be applied to the Dutch spoken in Flanders; it shows many regional and local variations.\nThe earliest example of literature in non-standardized dialects in the current area of Flanders is Hendrik van Veldeke's \"Eneas Romance\", the first courtly romance in a Germanic language (12th century). With a writer of Hendrik Conscience's stature, Flemish literature rose ahead of French literature in Belgium's early history. Guido Gezelle not only explicitly referred to his writings as Flemish but used it in many of his poems, and strongly defended it:\nOriginal \n&lt;poem&gt;Gij zegt dat 't vlaamsch te niet zal gaan:\n't en zal!\ndat 't waalsch gezwets zal boven slaan:\n't en zal!\nDat hopen, dat begeren wij:\ndat zeggen en dat zweren wij:\nzoo lange als wij ons weren, wij:\n't en zal, 't en zal,\n't en zal!&lt;/poem&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;You say Flemish will fade away:\nIt shan't!\nthat Walloon twaddle will have its way:\nIt shan't!\nThis we hope, for this we hanker:\nthis we say and this we vow:\nas long as we fight back, we:\nIt shan't, It shan't,\nIt shan't!&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe distinction between Dutch and Flemish literature, often perceived politically, is also made on intrinsic grounds by some experts such as Kris Humbeeck, professor of literature at the University of Antwerp. Nevertheless, most Dutch-language literature read (and appreciated to varying degrees) in Flanders is the same as that in the Netherlands.\nInfluential Flemish writers include Ernest Claes, Stijn Streuvels and Felix Timmermans. Their novels mostly describe rural life in Flanders in the 19th century and at beginning of the 20th. Widely read by the older generations, they are considered somewhat old-fashioned by present-day critics. Some famous Flemish writers of the early 20th century wrote in French, including Nobel Prize winners (1911) Maurice Maeterlinck and Emile Verhaeren. They were followed by a younger generation, including Paul van Ostaijen and Gaston Burssens, who \"activated\" the Flemish Movement. Still widely read and translated into other languages (including English) are the novels of authors such as Willem Elsschot, Louis Paul Boon and Hugo Claus. The recent crop of writers includes the novelists Tom Lanoye and Herman Brusselmans, and poets such as the married couple Herman de Coninck and Kristien Hemmerechts.\nLanguages.\nAt the creation of the Belgian state, French was the only official language. Historically Flanders was a Dutch-speaking region. For a long period, French was used as a second language and, like elsewhere in Europe, commonly spoken among the aristocracy. There is still a French-speaking minority in Flanders, especially in the municipalities with language facilities, along the language border and the Brussels periphery (Vlaamse Rand), though many of them are French-speakers that migrated to Flanders in recent decades.\nIn French Flanders, French is the only official language and now the native language of the majority of the population, but there is still a minority of Dutch-speakers living there. French is also the primary language in the officially bilingual Brussels Capital Region (see Francization of Brussels).\nMany Flemings are also able to speak French, children in Flanders generally get their first French lessons in the 5th primary year (normally around 10 years). But the current lack of French outside the educational context makes it hard to maintain a decent level of French. As such, the proficiency of French is declining. Flemish pupils are also obligated to follow English lessons as their third language. Normally from the second secondary year (around 14 years old), but the ubiquity of English in movies, music, IT and even advertisements makes it easier to learn and maintain the English language.\nMedia.\nThe public radio and television broadcaster in Flanders is VRT, which operates the TV channels VRT 1, VRT Canvas, Ketnet, and (together with the Netherlands) BVN. Flemish provinces each have up to two TV channels as well. Commercial television broadcasters include vtm and Vier (VT4). Popular TV series are for example \"Thuis\" and \"F.C. De Kampioenen\".\nThe five most successful Flemish films were \"Loft\" (2008; 1,186,071 visitors), \"Koko Flanel\" (1990; 1,082,000 tickets sold), \"Hector\" (1987; 933,000 tickets sold), \"Daens\" (1993; 848,000 tickets sold) and \"De Zaak Alzheimer\" (2003; 750,000 tickets sold). The first and last ones were directed by Erik Van Looy, and an American remake is being made of both of them, respectively \"The Loft\" (2012) and \"The Memory of a Killer\". The other three ones were directed by Stijn Coninx.\nNewspapers are grouped under three main publishers: De Persgroep with , the most popular newspaper in Flanders, \"De Morgen\" and \"De Tijd\". Then Corelio with \"De Gentenaar\", the oldest extant Flemish newspaper, and . Lastly, Concentra publishes and \"Het Belang van Limburg\".\nMagazines include \"Knack\" and \"HUMO\".\nSports.\nAssociation football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in both parts of Belgium, together with cycling, tennis, swimming and judo.\nIn cycling, the Tour of Flanders is considered one of the five \"Monuments\". Other \"Flanders Classics\" races include \"Dwars door Vlaanderen\" and Gent\u2013Wevelgem. Eddy Merckx is widely regarded as the greatest cyclist of all time, with five victories in the Tour de France and numerous other cycling records. His hour speed record (set in 1972) stood for 12 years.\nJean-Marie Pfaff, a former Belgian goalkeeper, is considered one of the greatest in the history of football (soccer).\nKim Clijsters (as well as the French-speaking Belgian Justine Henin) was Player of the Year twice in the Women's Tennis Association as she was ranked the number one female tennis player.\nKim Gevaert and Tia Hellebaut are notable track and field stars from Flanders.\nThe 1920 Summer Olympics were held in Antwerp. Jacques Rogge was president of the International Olympic Committee from 2001 to 2013.\nThe Flemish government agency for sports is Bloso.\nMusic.\nFlanders is known for its music festivals, like the annual Rock Werchter, Tomorrowland and Pukkelpop. The Gentse Feesten is another very large yearly event.\nThe best-selling Flemish group or artist is the (Flemish-Dutch) group 2 Unlimited, followed by (Italian-born) Rocco Granata, Technotronic, Helmut Lotti and Vaya Con Dios.\nThe weekly charts of best-selling singles is the Ultratop 50. \"Kvraagetaan\" by the Fixkes holds the current record for longest time at No. 1 on the chart.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10880", "revid": "50536116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10880", "title": "Plurality voting", "text": "Type of electoral system\nPlurality voting is an electoral system in which the candidates in an electoral district who poll more than any other (that is, receive a plurality or relative majority) are elected.\nUnder single-winner plurality voting, and in systems based on single-member districts, plurality voting is called single member [district] plurality (SMP), which is occasionally known as \"first-past-the-post\". In plurality voting the leading candidate, whether or not they have a majority of votes, is elected. Under all but a few niche election systems, the most-popular are elected. But under systems that use ranked votes, vote tallies change and are compared at various times during the vote count process. Where votes are transferred, the system is not generally referred to as a plurality system.\nThere are several versions of plurality voting for multi-member district. The system that elects multiple winners at once with the plurality rule and where each voter casts as many X votes as the number of seats in a multi-seat district is referred to as plurality block voting. A semi-proportional system that elects multiple winners elected at once with the plurality rule and where each voter casts more than one vote but fewer than the number of seats to fill in a multi-seat district is known as limited voting. A semi-proportional system that elects multiple winners elected at once with the plurality rule and where each voter casts just one vote in a multi-seat district is known as single non-transferable voting.\nPlurality voting is widely used throughout the English-speaking world as a result of its spread by the British Empire, including in most of the United States. Outside of the English-speaking world, it is less popular than its close relatives in the runoff family of methods. Overall, more countries in the world use a form of proportional representation than use plurality or a form of runoff.\nPlurality voting procedures.\nSingle-winner and single-member systems.\nIn single-winner plurality voting, each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate, and the winner of the election is the candidate who represents a plurality of voters or, in other words, received more votes than any other candidate. In an election for a single seat, such as for president in a presidential system, voters may vote for one candidate from a list of the candidates who are competing, and the winner is whichever candidate receives the highest number of votes. Compare plurality voting to a \"majority\" system, the two-round system, where usually the top two candidates in the first ballot progress to the second round, also called the runoff. A runoff is by default not held, if a candidate already received an absolute majority in the first ballot (more than half of votes), and in the second ballot, where there are only two candidates, one of the candidates will (except for a tie) receive a majority. Under plurality rules, the candidates are not at any point in the election required to have majority support.\nIn an election for a legislative body with single-member seats, each voter in a geographically defined electoral district may vote for one candidate from a list of the candidates who are competing to represent that district. Under the plurality system, the winner of the election then becomes the representative of the whole electoral district and serves with representatives of other electoral districts. That makes plurality voting among the simplest of all electoral systems for voters and vote counting officials; however, the drawing of district boundary lines can be contentious in the plurality system (see gerrymandering). The system is also independent of parties; the party with the most votes overall may not win the most seats overall (electoral inversion). Note that issues arising from single-member districts are still in place with majority voting systems, like the two-round system and instant-runoff voting too.\nThe same principle used in single-winner plurality voting (electing the candidate with the most votes) is also used in approval voting, however with very different effects, as voters can choose to support as many or few candidates as they choose, not just one. For this reason, approval voting is usually distinguished from plurality voting, while technically being a sub-type of it.\nMulti-winner systems.\nMulti-member plurality elections are only slightly more complicated. Where \"n\" is the number of seats in the district, the \"n\" candidates who get more votes than the others are elected; the winners are the \"n\" candidates with the largest number of votes. The rules may allow the voter to vote for one candidate, for a number of candidates more than one but less than \"n\", for as many as \"n\" candidates, or some other number.\nWhen voters may vote for only one candidate, it is called the single non-transferable vote. While seemingly most similar to single-winner plurality voting, in effect it is a semi-proportional system allowing for mixed representation in one district, and representation of both majority parties and electoral minorities within a district.\nWhen voters can vote for one or more candidates, but in total less than the number of winners, it is called limited voting.\nThe multi-winner version considered to be the extension of the single-winner version to multi-winner cases is plurality block voting. Here voters may vote for as many candidates as there are seats to fill, which means usually candidates from the largest party will fill all the seats in the district.\nThe party-list version of plurality voting in multi-member districts is called party block voting. Here the party receiving a plurality of votes wins all of the seats available.\nBallot types.\nGenerally, plurality ballots can be categorized into two forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot in which the name of a candidate(s) is written in by hand. A more structured ballot will list all the candidates and allow a mark to be made next to the name of a single candidate (or more than one, in some cases); however, a structured ballot can also include space for a write-in candidate.\nExamples.\nSingle-winner.\nThis is a general example for single-winner plurality voting, using population percentages taken from one state for illustrative purposes.\nSuppose Tennessee is holding an election on the location of its capital. The population is split between four cities, and all the voters want the capital to be as close to them as possible. The options are:\nIf each voter in each city naively selects one city on the ballot (Memphis voters select Memphis, Nashville voters select Nashville, and so on), Memphis will be selected, as it has the most votes 42%. The system does not require that the winner have a majority, only a plurality. Memphis wins because it has the most votes even though 58% of the voters in the example preferred Memphis least. The opposite result would occur in instant-runoff, where Knoxville (the city furthest to the east, and the \"second-worst\" choice) would accumulate a majority from vote transfers from voter who initially voted for Chattanooga and Nashville. Nashville is the majority-preferred winner, and as a result would be elected by any Condorcet method.\nMulti-winner.\nCandidates are running in a 3-member district of 10 000 voters.\nUnder non-transferable (and non-cumulative) plurality voting, each voter may cast no more than one vote for a single candidate, even if they have multiple votes to cast.\nParty A has about 35% support among the electorate (with one particularly well-liked candidate), Party B around 25% (with two well-liked candidates) and the remaining voters primarily support independent candidates, but mostly lean towards party B if they have to choose between the two parties. All voters vote sincerely; there is no tactical voting. (Percentage of votes under MNTV and Limited Voting is the percentage of voters who voted for the candidate, not the percentage of votes cast.)\nUnder all three versions of multi-winner plurality voting, the three most popular candidates according to voters' first preferences are elected, regardless of party affiliation, but with three different results.\nIssues.\nIn all plurality systems.\nWasted votes.\nWasted votes are those cast for candidates or parties who did not get elected. Some number of wasted votes by this definition is practically unavoidable, but plurality systems suffer from large numbers of wasted votes. For example, in the UK general election of 2005, 52% of votes were cast for losing candidates and 18% were excess votes, a total of 70% wasted votes. That is perhaps the most fundamental criticism of the single-member plurality system, since at least half the votes are always wasted in a district, either as being placed on un-elected candidates or being surplus to what could be needed to win.\nSMP is in practice similar in plurality block voting. They both operate under the \"winner-takes-all\" principle, which means that the party of the losing candidates in each district receive no representation, regardless of the number of votes they receive. Even the single non-transferable vote can result in very inefficient results if many candidates with small support compete or the most-popular candidates receive a large excess of votes. This is because like other plurality systems, SNTV does not transfer loser and surplus votes.\nAnother way to count wasted votes, is to see the ones that may play no part in determining the outcome. Under plurality voting for example, usually only votes for the top two candidates can be seen as really competing for the position, with only one possible to win; votes placed on other candidates are almost certain not to be used to elect anyone and therefore wasted. Sometimes not even two candidate are seen as being competitive. Due to having a history of repeatedly electing candidates of a certain party, many districts are known to have safe seats. On such, a candidate or party has a near 100% chance that they win the seats. Supporters of others sometimes do not even bother to vote knowing of the odds that face their candidate.\nAlternative electoral systems, such as proportional representation, attempt to ensure that almost all of the votes are effective in influencing the result and electing a representative, which minimizes vote wastage. Such systems decreases disproportionality in election results and are also credited for increasing voter turnout.\nTactical voting.\nTo a much greater extent than many other electoral methods, plurality electoral systems encourage tactical voting techniques like \"compromising\". Voters are under pressure to vote for one of the two candidates most likely to win, even if their true preference is neither of them; because a vote for any other candidate is unlikely to lead to the preferred candidate being elected. In single-member plurality, this will instead reduce support for one of the two major candidates whom the voter might prefer to the other. Electors who prefer not to waste their vote by voting for a candidate with a very low chance of winning their constituency vote for their lesser preferred candidate who has a higher chance of winning. The minority party will then simply take votes away from one of the major parties, which could change the outcome and gain nothing for the voters. Any other party will typically need to build up its votes and credibility over a series of elections before it is seen as electable.\nIn the Tennessee example, if all the voters for Chattanooga and Knoxville had instead voted for Nashville, Nashville would have won (with 58% of the vote). That would have only been the third choice for those voters, but voting for their respective first choices (their own cities) actually results in their fourth choice (Memphis) being elected.\nThe difficulty is sometimes summed up in an extreme form, as \"All votes for anyone other than the second place are votes for the winner\". That is because by voting for other candidates, voters have denied those votes to the second-place candidate, who could have won had they received them. It is often claimed by United States Democrats that Democrat Al Gore lost the 2000 Presidential Election to Republican George W. Bush because some voters on the left voted for Ralph Nader of the Green Party, who, exit polls indicated, would have preferred Gore at 45% to Bush at 27%, with the rest not voting in Nader's absence.\nThat thinking is illustrated by elections in Puerto Rico and its three principal voter groups: the Independentistas (pro-independence), the Populares (pro-commonwealth), and the Estadistas (pro-statehood). Historically, there has been a tendency for Independentista voters to elect Popular candidates and policies. This results in more Popular victories even though the Estadistas have the most voters on the island. It is so widely recognised that the Puerto Ricans sometimes call the Independentistas who vote for the Populares \"melons\" in reference to the party colours, because the fruit is green on the outside but red on the inside.\nSuch tactical voting can cause significant perturbation to the system:\nProponents of other single-winner electoral systems argue that their proposals would reduce the need for tactical voting and reduce the spoiler effect. Other systems include the commonly used two-round system of runoffs and instant-runoff voting, along with less-tested and perhaps less-understood systems such as approval voting, score voting and Condorcet methods.\nTactical voting is when a voter decides to vote in a way that does not represent their true preference or choice, motivated by an intent to influence election outcomes. Strategic behaviour by voters can and does influence the outcome of voting in different plurality voting systems. Strategic behaviour is when a voter casts their vote for a different party or alternative district/constituency/riding in order to induce, in their opinion, a better outcome. An example of this is when a person really likes party A but votes for party B because they do not like party C or D or because they believe that party A has little to no chance of winning. This can cause the outcome of very close votes to be swayed for the wrong reason. This might have had an impact on the 2000 United States election that was essentially decided by fewer than 600 votes, with the winner being President Bush. When voters behave in a strategic way and expect others to do the same, they end up voting for one of the two leading candidates, making the Condorcet alternative more likely to be elected. The prevalence of strategic voting in an election makes it difficult to evaluate the true political state of the population, as their true political ideologies are not reflected in their votes.\nSpoiler effect.\nThe spoiler effect is especially severe in plurality voting, where candidates with similar ideologies are forced to split the vote with each other. One spoiler candidate's presence in the election draws votes from a major candidate with similar politics, which causes a strong opponent of both or several to win. Even extremely small parties with very little first-preference support can therefore affect the outcome of an election under plurality voting.\nManipulation charges.\nThe presence of spoilers often gives rise to suspicions that manipulation of the slate has taken place. The spoiler may have received incentives to run. A spoiler may also drop out at the last moment, which induces charges that such an act was intended from the beginning. Voters who are uninformed do not have a comparable opportunity to manipulate their votes as voters who understand all opposing sides, understand the pros and cons of voting for each party.\nGerrymandering.\nBecause plurality voting permits a high level of wasted votes, an election under plurality voting is easily gerrymandered unless safeguards are in place. In gerrymandering, a party in power deliberately manipulates constituency boundaries to increase the number of seats that it wins unfairly.\nIn brief, if a governing party G wishes to reduce the seats that will be won by opposition party O in the next election, it can create a number of constituencies in each of which O has an overwhelming majority of votes. O will win these seats, but many of its voters will waste their votes. Then, the rest of the constituencies are designed to have small majorities for G. Few G votes are wasted, and G will win many seats by small margins. As a result of the gerrymander, O's seats have cost it more votes than G's seats.\nEfficiency gap: The \"efficiency gap\" measures gerrymandering and has been scrutinized in the Supreme Court of the United States. The efficiency gap is the difference between the two parties' wasted votes, divided by the total number of votes.\nIn some plurality systems.\nFewer political parties.\nDuverger's law is a theory that constituencies that use plurality voting will eventually become a two-party system after enough time. The two dominating parties regularly alternate in power and easily win constituencies due to the structure of plurality voting systems. This puts smaller parties who struggle to meet the threshold of votes at a disadvantage, and inhibits growth.\nPlurality voting tends to reduce the number of political parties to a greater extent than most other methods do, making it more likely that a single party will hold a majority of legislative seats. (In the United Kingdom, 22 out of 27 general elections since 1922 have produced a single-party majority government or, in the case of the National Governments, a parliament from which such a single-party government could have been drawn.)\nPlurality voting's tendency toward fewer parties and more-frequent majorities of one party can also produce a government that may not consider as wide a range of perspectives and concerns. It is entirely possible that a voter finds all major parties to have similar views on issues, and that a voter does not have a meaningful way of expressing a dissenting opinion through their vote.\nAs fewer choices are offered to voters, voters may vote for a candidate although they disagree with them because they disagree even more with their opponents. That will make candidates less closely reflect the viewpoints of those who vote for them.\nFurthermore, one-party rule is more likely to lead to radical changes in government policy even though the changes are favoured only by a plurality or a bare majority of the voters, but a multi-party system usually requires more consensus to make dramatic changes in policy.\nVoter turnout.\nPolitical apathy can be prevalent in plurality voting systems. Studies suggest that plurality voting system fails to incentivize citizens to vote, which results in very low voter turnouts. Under this system, many people feel that voting is an empty ritual that has no influence on the composition of legislature. Voters are not assured that the number of seats that political parties are accorded will reflect the popular vote, which disincentivizes them from voting and sends the message that their votes are not valued, and participation in elections does not seem necessary.\nIssues specific to particular countries.\nSolomon Islands.\nIn August 2008, Sir Peter Kenilorea commented on what he perceived as the flaws of plurality voting in the Solomon Islands:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"An... underlying cause of political instability and poor governance, in my opinion, is our electoral system and its related problems. It has been identified by a number of academics and practitioners that the First Past the Post system is such that a Member elected to Parliament is sometimes elected by a small percentage of voters where there are many candidates in a particular constituency. I believe that this system is part of the reason why voters ignore political parties and why candidates try an appeal to voters' material desires and relationships instead of political parties... Moreover, this system creates a political environment where a Member is elected by a relatively small number of voters with the effect that this Member is then expected to ignore his party's philosophy and instead look after that core base of voters in terms of their material needs. Another relevant factor that I see in relation to the electoral system is the proven fact that it is rather conducive, and thus has not prevented, corrupt elections practices such as ballot buying.\"\u2014\u200a\nArguments for plurality.\nSimplicity and familiarity.\nPlurality voting is generally considered one of the simplest methods and of the most widely known. Because of its widespread use, in situations where people become voters, it will not be a new concept for most and may even be expected. Other systems may specifically need to be explained to the voters and may be perceived as more complicated.\nWidespread familiarity with the system does not imply widespread familiarity with the effects. Voters may not be aware of the issues in plurality voting, therefore they may vote sincerely even in situations where voting theory would suggest they should vote tactically, thereby voting against their rational interests.\nAnother counter-argument is that plurality voting is partially considered simple because of its familiarity, which in turn results from its prevalence. Such argument is made by proponents of another plurality-based system, approval voting, where unlike usual plurality voting, voters may vote for any number of candidates. If approval voting is default, plurality voting (where voters only cast one otherwise fixed number of votes) would be seen at least equally unfamiliar to voters.\nEase of balloting.\nUnder plurality voting, ballots use simple marks instead of ranking or scoring, which can make especially paper-based ballots simpler. However, non-plurality systems such as closed list PR may also use just as simple ballots.\nIn cases without ballots, such as open voting by raised hands, for example, there are simpler methods that do not require checking for people who voted more than they are allowed to, for example, approval voting.\nEase of counting.\nWith plurality voting, counting and summing up votes is generally an easy process, and this may be done on a precinct level and then summed up for a total with the same results. Some alternative methods, such as instant-runoff-voting do not work this way and either counting has to take place centrally, or complete (non-aggregated) results from precincts need to be submitted to the central authority for results.\nArguments for single-member plurality.\nCommon arguments for specifically the single-winner variant of plurality voting are constituency representation (which all other single-winner systems provide to the same degree) and governmental stability (which is dependent on other factors as well). These arguments can be made for some multi-member versions and plurality voting in general too.\nVoting system attributes and comparison to non-plurality systems.\nAttributes and criteria.\nMajority criterion: Will a candidate always win who is ranked as the unique favorite by a majority of voters?\n Does the outcome never change if non-winning candidates similar to an existing candidate are added? There are three different phenomena which could cause a method to fail this criterion:\n; Spoilers\n Candidates which decrease the chance of any of the similar or clone candidates winning, also known as a spoiler effect.\n; Teams\n Sets of similar candidates whose mere presence helps the chances of any of them winning.\n; Crowds\n Additional candidates who affect the outcome of an election without either helping or harming the chances of their factional group, but instead affecting another group.\nNo favorite betrayal: Can voters be sure that they do not need to rank any other candidate above their favorite in order to obtain a result they prefer?\nComparison to non-plurality systems.\nPlurality voting is often contrasted with (absolute) majority voting where variant of runoff voting (multi-round voting) are also classified. However, in formal social choice theory, the term majority voting has a different definition, and runoff voting methods could also be classified under plurality. \nInternational examples.\nPlurality voting is used for local and/or national elections in 43 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations. It is particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and India.\nGeneral elections in the United Kingdom.\nThe United Kingdom, like the United States and Canada, uses single-member districts as the base for national elections. Each electoral district (constituency) chooses one member of parliament, the candidate who gets the most votes, whether or not they get at least 50% of the votes cast (\"first past the post\"). In 1992, for example, a Liberal Democrat in Scotland won a seat (Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber) with just 26% of the votes. The system of single-member districts with plurality winners tends to produce two large political parties. In countries with proportional representation there is not such a great incentive to vote for a large party, which contributes to multi-party systems.\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland use plurality voting for UK general elections but versions of proportional representation for elections to their own assemblies and parliaments. All of the UK used one form or another of proportional representation for European Parliament elections.\nThe countries that inherited the British majoritarian system tend toward two large parties: one left and the other right, such as the U.S. Democrats and Republicans. Canada is an exception, with three major political parties consisting of the New Democratic Party, which is to the left; the Conservative Party, which is to the right; and the Liberal Party, which is slightly off-centre but to the left. A fourth party that no longer has major party status is the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party, which is territorial and runs only in Quebec. New Zealand once used the British system, which yielded two large parties as well. It also left many New Zealanders unhappy because other viewpoints were ignored, which made the New Zealand Parliament in 1993 adopt a new electoral law modelled on Germany's system of proportional representation (PR) with a partial selection by constituencies. New Zealand soon developed a more complex party system.\nAfter the 2015 UK general election, there were calls from UKIP for a switch to the use of proportional representation after it received 3,881,129 votes that produced only one MP. The Green Party was similarly underrepresented, which contrasted greatly with the SNP, a Scottish separatist party that received only 1,454,436 votes but won 56 seats because of more geographically concentrated support.\nThe United Kingdom continues to use plurality voting for general elections, and for local government elections in England and Wales. Changes to the UK system have been proposed, and alternatives were examined by the Jenkins Commission in the late 1990s. After the formation of a new coalition government in 2010, it was announced as part of the coalition agreement that a referendum would be held on switching to the alternative vote system. However the alternative vote system was rejected 2\u20131 by British voters in a referendum held on 5 May 2011.\nOutside the United Kingdom.\nCanada also uses plurality voting for national and provincial elections. In May 2005 the Canadian province of British Columbia had a referendum on abolishing single-member district plurality in favour of multi-member districts with the Single Transferable Vote system after the Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform made a recommendation for the reform. The referendum obtained 57% of the vote, but failed to meet the 60% requirement for passing. A second referendum was held in May 2009, this time the province's voters defeated the change with 39% voting in favour.\nAn October 2007 referendum in the Canadian province of Ontario on adopting a Mixed Member Proportional system, also requiring 60% approval, failed with only 36.9% voting in favour. British Columbia again called a referendum on the issue in 2018 which was defeated by 62% voting to keep current system.\nNorthern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand are notable examples of countries within the UK, or with previous links to it, that use other electoral systems (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales use plurality voting in United Kingdom general elections, however).\nNations which have undergone democratic reforms since 1990 but have not adopted plurality voting include South Africa, almost all of the former Eastern bloc nations, Russia, and Afghanistan.\nList of countries.\nCountries that use plurality voting to elect the lower or only house of their legislature include: (Some of these may be undemocratic systems where there is effectively only one candidate allowed anyway.)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nhttp:// \u2013 Proportional Representation Society of Australia"}

{"id": "10883", "revid": "42445653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10883", "title": "Free trade area", "text": "Regional trade agreement\nA free trade area is the region encompassing a trade bloc whose member countries have signed a free trade agreement (FTA). Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers, import quotas and tariffs, and to increase trade of goods and services with each other. If natural persons are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free trade agreement, it would also be considered an open border. It can be considered the second stage of economic integration.\nCustoms unions are a special type of free trade area. All such areas have internal arrangements which parties conclude in order to liberalize and facilitate trade among themselves. The crucial difference between customs unions and free trade areas is their approach to third parties. While a customs union requires all parties to establish and maintain identical external tariffs with regard to trade with non-parties, parties to a free trade area are not subject to this requirement. Instead, they may establish and maintain whatever tariff regime applying to imports from non-parties as deemed necessary. In a free trade area without harmonized external tariffs, to eliminate the risk of trade deflection, parties will adopt a system of preferential rules of origin.\nThe term \"free trade area\" was originally meant by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) to include only trade in goods. An agreement with a similar purpose, i.e., to enhance liberalization of trade in services, is named under Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) as an \"economic integration agreement\". However, in practice, the term is now widely used to refer to agreements covering not only goods but also services and even investment.\nLegal aspects of free trade areas.\nThe formation of free trade areas is considered an exception to the most favored nation (MFN) principle in the World Trade Organization (WTO) because the preferences that parties to a free trade area exclusively grant each other go beyond their accession commitments. Although Article XXIV of the GATT allows WTO members to establish free trade areas or to adopt interim agreements necessary for the establishment thereof, there are several conditions with respect to free trade areas, or interim agreements leading to the formation of free trade areas.\nFirstly, duties and other regulations maintained in each of the signatory parties to a free trade area, which are applicable at the time such free trade area is formed, to the trade with non-parties to such free trade area shall not be higher or more restrictive than the corresponding duties and other regulations existing in the same signatory parties prior to the formation of the free trade area. In other words, the establishment of a free trade area to grant preferential treatment among its member is legitimate under WTO law, but the parties to a free trade area are not permitted to treat non-parties less favorably than before the area was established. A second requirement stipulated by Article XXIV is that tariffs and other barriers to trade must be eliminated to substantially all the trade within the free trade area.\nFree trade agreements forming free trade areas generally lie outside the realm of the multilateral trading system. However, WTO members must notify to the Secretariat when they conclude new free trade agreements and in principle the texts of free trade agreements are subject to review under the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements. Although a dispute arising within free trade areas is not subject to litigation at the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, \"there is no guarantee that WTO panels will abide by them and decline to exercise jurisdiction in a given case\".\nEconomic aspects of free trade areas.\nTrade diversion and trade creation\nIn general, \"trade diversion\" means that a free trade area would divert trade away from more efficient suppliers outside the area towards less efficient ones within the areas. Whereas, \"trade creation\" implies that a free trade area creates trade which may not have otherwise existed. In all cases trade creation will raise a country's national welfare.\nBoth trade creation and trade diversion are crucial effects found upon the establishment of a free trade area. Trade creation will cause consumption to shift from a high-cost producer to a low-cost one, and trade will thus expand. In contrast, trade diversion will lead to trade shifting from a lower-cost producer outside the area to a higher-cost one inside the area. Such a shift will not benefit consumers within the free trade area as they are deprived the opportunity to purchase cheaper imported goods. However, economists find that trade diversion does not always harm aggregate national welfare: it can even improve aggregate national welfare if the volume of diverted trade is small.\nFree trade areas as public goods\nEconomists have made attempts to evaluate the extent to which free trade areas can be considered public goods. They firstly address one key element of free trade areas, which is the system of embedded tribunals which act as arbitrators in international trade disputes. This system as a force of clarification for existing statutes and international economic policies is affirmed within the trade treaties.\nThe second way in which free trade areas are considered public goods is tied to the evolving trend of them becoming \"deeper\". The depth of a free trade area refers to the added types of structural policies that it covers. While older trade deals are deemed \"shallower\" as they cover fewer areas (such as tariffs and quotas), more recently concluded agreements address a number of other fields, from services to e-commerce and data localization. Since transactions among parties to a free trade area are relatively cheaper as compared to those with non-parties, free trade areas are conventionally found to be excludable. Now that deep trade deals will enhance regulatory harmonization and increase trade flows with non-parties, thus reduce the excludability of FTA benefits, new generation free trade areas are obtaining essential characteristics of public goods.\nQualifying for preferences under a free trade area.\nUnlike a customs union, parties to a free trade area do not maintain common external tariffs, which means they apply different customs duties, as well as other policies with respect to non-members. This feature creates the possibility of non-parties may free riding preferences under a free trade area by penetrating the market with the lowest external tariffs. Such risk necessitates the introduction of rules to determine originating goods eligible for preferences under a free trade area, a need that does not arise upon the formation of a customs union. Basically, there is a requirement for a minimum extent of processing that results in \"substantial transformation\" to the goods so that they can be considered originating. By defining which goods are originating in the PTA, preferential rules of origin distinguish between originating and non-originating goods: only the former will be entitled to preferential tariffs scheduled by the free trade area, the latter must pay MFN import duties.\nIt is noted that in qualifying for origin criteria, there is a differential treatment between inputs originating within and outside a free trade area. Normally inputs originating in one FTA party will be considered as originating in the other party if they are incorporated in the manufacturing process in that other party. Sometimes, production costs arising in one party is also considered as that arising in another party. In preferential rules of origin, such differential treatment is normally provided for in the cumulation or accumulation provision. Such clause further explains the trade creation and trade diversion effects of a free trade area mentioned above, because a party to a free trade area has the incentive to use inputs originating in another party so that their products may qualify for originating status.\nDatabases on free trade areas.\nSince there are hundreds of free trade areas currently in force and being negotiated (about 800 according to ITC's http://, counting also non-reciprocal trade arrangements), it is important for businesses and policy-makers to keep track of their status. There are a number of depositories of free trade agreements available either at national, regional or international levels. Some significant ones include the database on Latin American free trade agreements constructed by the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI), the database maintained by the Asian Regional Integration Center (ARIC) providing information agreements of Asian countries, and the portal on the European Union's free trade negotiations and agreements.\nAt the international level, there are two important free access databases developed by international organizations for policy-makers and businesses:\nWTO's http://\nAs WTO members are obliged to notify to the Secretariat their free trade agreements, this database is constructed based on the most official source of information on free trade agreements (referred to as regional trade agreements in the WTO language). The database allows users to seek information on trade agreements notified to the WTO by country or by topic (goods, services or goods and services). This database provides users with an updated list of all agreements in force, however, those not notified to the WTO may be missing. It also displays reports, tables and graphs containing statistics on these agreements, and particularly preferential tariff analysis.\nITC's https://\nThe Market Access Map was developed by the International Trade Centre (ITC) with the objectives to facilitate businesses, governments and researchers in market access issues. The database, visible via the online tool Market Access Map, includes information on tariff and non-tariff barriers in all active trade agreements, not limited to those officially notified to the WTO. It also documents data on non-preferential trade agreements (for instance, Generalized System of Preferences schemes). Up until 2019, Market Access Map has provided downloadable links to texts agreements and their rules of origin. The new version of Market Access Map forthcoming this year will provide direct web links to relevant agreement pages and connect itself to other ITC's tools, particularly the http://. It is expected to become a versatile tool which assists enterprises in understanding free trade agreements and qualifying for origin requirements under these agreements.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven, such as an air fryer.\nFrench fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are typically salted and may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other sauces. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine, loaded fries or chili cheese fries, and are occasionally made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. \nPreparation.\nThe standard method for cooking french fries is deep frying, which submerges them in a hot fat, typically oil.\nThe potatoes are prepared by first cutting them (peeled or unpeeled) into even strips, which are then wiped off or soaked in cold water to remove the surface starch, and thoroughly dried. They may then be fried in one or two stages. Chefs generally agree that the \"two-bath\" technique produces better results. Potatoes fresh out of the ground can have too high a water content resulting in soggy fries, so preference is for those that have been stored for a while.\nIn the two-stage or two-bath method, the first bath, sometimes called blanching, is in hot fat (around 160\u00a0\u00b0C/320\u00a0\u00b0F) to cook the fries through. This step can be done in advance. Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190\u00a0\u00b0C/375\u00a0\u00b0F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in a colander or on a cloth to drain, then served. The exact times of the two baths depend on the size of the fries. For example, for 2\u20133\u00a0mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.\nSince the 1960s, most french fries in the US have been produced from frozen Russet potatoes which have been blanched or at least air-dried industrially. The usual fat for making french fries is vegetable oil. In the past, beef suet was recommended as superior, with vegetable shortening as an alternative. McDonald's used a mixture of 93% beef tallow and 7% cottonseed oil until 1990, when they changed to vegetable oil with beef flavouring. Horse fat was standard in northern France and Belgium until recently, and is recommended by some chefs.\nChemical and physical changes.\nFrench fries are fried in a two-step process: the first time is to cook the starch throughout the entire cut at low heat, and the second time is to create the golden crispy exterior of the fry at a higher temperature. This is necessary because if the potato cuts are only fried once, the temperature would either be too hot, causing only the exterior to be cooked and not the inside, or not hot enough where the entire fry is cooked, but its crispy exterior will not develop. Although the potato cuts may be baked or steamed as a preparation method, this section will only focus on french fries made using frying oil. During the initial frying process (approximately 150\u00a0\u00b0C), water on the surface of the cuts evaporates off the surface and the water inside the cuts gets absorbed by the starch granules, causing them to swell and produce the fluffy interior of the fry.\nThe starch granules are able to retain the water and expand due to gelatinisation. The water and heat break the glycosidic linkages between amylopectin and amylose strands, allowing a new gel matrix to form via hydrogen bonds which aid in water retention. The moisture that gets trapped within the gel matrix is responsible for the fluffy interior of the fry. The gelatinised starch molecules move towards the surface of the fries \"forming a thick layer of gelatinised starch\" and this layer of pre-gelatinised starch becomes the crisp exterior after the potato cuts are fried for a second time. During the second frying process (approximately 180\u00a0\u00b0C), the remaining water on the surface of the cuts evaporates and the gelatinised starch molecules that collected towards the potato surface are cooked again, forming the crisp exterior. The golden-brown colour of the fry will develop when the amino acids and glucose on the exterior participate in a Maillard browning reaction.\nName and etymology.\nIn the United States and most of Canada, the term \"french fries\", sometimes capitalised as \"French fries\", or shortened to \"fries\", refers to all dishes of fried elongated pieces of potatoes. in shape and size may have names such as \"curly fries\", \"shoestring fries\", etc.\nIn Great Britain, Australia, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand, the term \"chips\" is generally used, being a popular dish in most Commonwealth countries. However, the term \"french fries\" or \"skinny fries\" is used for thinly cut fried potatoes which are different from the more traditional thick cut \"chips\".\nIn the US or Canada, these more thickly-cut \"chips\" might be called \"steak fries\", depending on the shape, while the word \"chips\" is more often used in North America to refer to \"potato chips\", commonly known in the UK, Ireland and South Africa as \"crisps\". In Australia and New Zealand, \"chips\" are often referred to as \"hot chips\" to distinguish them from \"potato chips\", although the type of 'chip' is often implied through context.\nThomas Jefferson had \"potatoes served in the French manner\" at a White House dinner in 1802. The expression \"french fried potatoes\" first occurred in print in English in the 1856 work \"Cookery for Maids of All Work\" by Eliza Warren: \"French Fried Potatoes. \u2013 Cut new potatoes in thin slices, put them in boiling fat, and a little salt; fry both sides of a light golden brown colour; drain.\" This account referred to thin, shallow-fried slices of potato. It is not clear where or when the now familiar deep-fried batons or fingers of potato were first prepared. In the early 20th century, the term \"french fried\" was being used in the sense of \"deep-fried\" for foods like onion rings or chicken.\nOne story about the name \"french fries\" claims that when the American Expeditionary Forces arrived in Belgium during World War I, they assumed that chips were a French dish because French was spoken in the Belgian Army. But the name existed long before that in English, and the popularity of the term did not increase for decades after 1917. The term was in use in the United States as early as 1886. An 1899 item in \"Good Housekeeping\" specifically references \"Kitchen Economy in France\": \"The perfection of French fries is due chiefly to the fact that plenty of fat is used.\"\nOrigin.\nChile.\nThe oldest documents where a fried potato is mentioned are from Chile in 1629 in the city of Nacimiento, extracted from \"Happy Captivity\", written in 1673 by Chilean Francisco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Pineda, where he narrates his experiences as a captive war soldier in 1629 at the hands of Mapuche warriors. In the text, he mentioned eating \"papas fritas\" (fried potatoes) in 1629 and women \"sent fried and stewed potatoes\" to the chiefs. The exact shape is unclear, likely wide slices or cubes fried in lamb or guanaco tallow which was customary. However, the cane shape originates from Europe.\nSpain.\nFrench fries in their current form may have been invented in Spain, the first European country in which the potato appeared from the New World colonies. Professor Paul Ilegems, curator of the Frietmuseum in Bruges, Belgium, believes that Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila of Spain cooked the first french fries, and refers also to the tradition of frying in Mediterranean cuisine as evidence. \nBelgian\u2013French dispute.\nThe Belgians and French have an ongoing dispute about where fries were invented.\nThe Belgian food historian Pierre Leclercq has traced the history of the french fry and asserts that \"it is clear that fries are of French origin\". They became an emblematic Parisian dish in the 19th century. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Krieger, a Bavarian musician, learned to cook fries at a roaster on rue Montmartre in Paris in 1842, and took the recipe to Belgium in 1844, where he created his business Fritz and sold \"la pomme de terre frite \u00e0 l'instar de Paris\" (\"Paris-style fried potatoes\"). The modern style of fries born in Paris around 1855 is different from the domestic fried potato that existed in the 18th century.\nFrom the Belgian standpoint, the popularity of the term \"french fries\" is explained as \"French gastronomic hegemony\" into which the cuisine of Belgium was assimilated, because of a lack of understanding coupled with a shared language and geographic proximity of the countries. The Belgian journalist Jo G\u00e9rard claimed that a 1781 family manuscript recounts that potatoes were deep-fried prior to 1680 in the Meuse valley, as a substitute for frying fish when the rivers were frozen. G\u00e9rard never produced the manuscript that supports this claim, and \"the historical value of this story is open to question\". In any case, it is unrelated to the later history of the french fry, as the potato did not arrive in the region until around 1735; furthermore, given 18th-century economic conditions: \"it is absolutely unthinkable that a peasant could have dedicated large quantities of fat for cooking potatoes. At most they were saut\u00e9ed in a pan\".\nGlobal use.\nBelgium.\nFries are very popular in Belgium, where they are known as (in Flemish) or (in Belgian French), and the Netherlands, where among the working classes they are known as \"patat\" in the north and, in the south, \"friet(en)\". In Belgium, fries are sold in shops called (French), / (Flemish), (Dutch in The Netherlands) or / (German). They are served with a large variety of Belgian sauces and eaten either on their own or with other snacks. Traditionally fries are served in a (French), // (Dutch/Flemish), or (German), a white cardboard cone, then wrapped in paper, with a spoonful of sauce (often mayonnaise) on top.\nFrance.\nIn France and other French-speaking countries, fried potatoes are formally , but more commonly (\"fried apples\"), , or simply . The words (\"needle-ettes\") or (\"matchsticks\") are used when the french fries are very small and thin. One enduring origin story holds that french fries were invented by street vendors on the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris in 1789, just before the outbreak of the French Revolution. However, a reference exists in France from 1775 to \"a few pieces of fried potato\" and to \"fried potatoes\". Eating potatoes for sustenance was promoted in France by Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, but he did not mention \"fried\" potatoes in particular. A note in a manuscript in U.S. president Thomas Jefferson's hand (circa 1801\u20131809) mentions \"Pommes de terre frites \u00e0 cru, en petites tranches\" (\"Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small slices\"). The recipe almost certainly comes from his French chef, Honor\u00e9 Julien. \nThe thick-cut fries are called or simply (about ); thinner variants are (matchstick potatoes; about ), and (potato straws; ). are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries.\nGermany.\nFrench fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words , or only or (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words). Often served with ketchup or mayonnaise, they are popular as a side dish in restaurants, or as a street-food snack purchased at an (snack stand). Since the 1950s, \"currywurst\" has become a widely-popular dish that is commonly offered with fries. Currywurst is a sausage (often bratwurst or bockwurst) in a spiced ketchup-based sauce, dusted with curry powder and served with fries.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe standard deep-fried cut potatoes in the United Kingdom are called chips, and are cut into pieces typically between thick. They are occasionally made from unpeeled potatoes (skins showing). British \"chips\" are not the same thing as potato chips (an American term); those are called \"crisps\" in the UK and some other countries. In the UK, chips are part of the popular, and now international, fast food dish fish and chips, as well as many other dishes. In the UK, the name chips are not the same as French fries: chips are more thickly cut than French fries, and they can be cooked once or multiple times at different temperatures. From 1813 on, recipes for deep-fried cut potatoes occur in popular cookbooks. By the late 1850s, at least one cookbook refers to \"French Fried Potatoes\".\nThe first commercially available chips in the UK were sold by Mrs 'Granny' Duce in one of the West Riding towns in 1854. A blue plaque in Oldham marks the origin of the fish-and-chip shop, and thus the start of the fast food industry in Britain. In Scotland, chips were first sold in Dundee: \"in the 1870s, that glory of British gastronomy \u2013 the chip \u2013 was first sold by Belgian immigrant Edward De Gernier in the city's Greenmarket\". In Ireland the first chip shop was \"opened by Giuseppe Cervi\", an Italian immigrant, \"who arrived there in the 1880s\". It was estimated in 2011 that in the UK, 80% of households bought frozen chips each year. Although chips were a popular dish in most Commonwealth countries, the \"thin style\" French fries have been popularised worldwide in large part by the large American fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.\nNetherlands.\n\" or just \" (French), \"\"frieten\" (a word used in Flanders and the southern provinces of the Netherlands) or \"patat\"\" (used in the north and central parts of the Netherlands) became a national snack. Fries also come in the form of a common Dutch street food, known as \"Patatje Oorlog\", translated to as \"war fries\". It consists of fries dressed with mayonnaise, a peanut-based satay sauce and garnished with diced raw onions along with a variety of other optional ingredients.\nCanada.\nNew Brunswick.\nThe town of Florenceville-Bristol, New Brunswick in Canada, headquarters of McCain Foods, calls itself \"the French fry capital of the world\" and also hosts a museum about potatoes called Potato World. McCain Foods is the world's largest manufacturer of frozen french fries and other potato specialities. Canada is also responsible for providing 22% of China's french fries.\nQuebec.\nFrench fries are the main ingredient in the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois dish known as \"poutine\", a dish consisting of fried potatoes covered with cheese curds and brown gravy. Poutine has a growing number of variations, but it is generally considered to have been developed in rural Qu\u00e9bec sometime in the 1950s, although precisely where in the province it first appeared is a matter of contention.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the J. R. Simplot Company is credited with successfully commercialising french fries in frozen form during the 1940s. Subsequently, in 1967, Ray Kroc of McDonald's contracted the Simplot company to supply them with frozen fries, replacing fresh-cut potatoes. In 2004, 29% of the United States' potato crop was used to make frozen fries; 90% consumed by the food services sector and 10% by retail. The United States supplies China with most of their french fries, as 70% of China's french fries are imported. Pre-made french fries have been available for home cooking since the 1960s, having been pre-fried (or sometimes baked), frozen and placed in a sealed plastic bag. Some fast-food chains dip the fries in a sugar solution or a starch batter, to alter the appearance or texture. French fries are one of the most popular dishes in the United States, commonly being served as a side dish to main dishes and in fast food restaurants. The average American eats around of french fries a year.\nSpain.\nIn Spain, fried potatoes are called \"patatas fritas\" or \"papas fritas\". Another common form, involving larger irregular cuts, is \"patatas bravas\". The potatoes are cut into big chunks, partially boiled and then fried. They are usually seasoned with a spicy tomato sauce. Fries are a common side dish in Latin American cuisine or part of larger preparations such as the salchipapas in Peru or chorrillana in Chile.\nSouth Africa.\nWhilst eating 'regular' crispy french fries is common in South Africa, a regional favourite, particularly in Cape Town, is a soft soggy version doused in white vinegar called \"slap-chips\" (pronounced \"\"slup-chips\" in English or \"slaptjips\"\" in Afrikaans). These chips are typically thicker and fried at a lower temperature for a longer period of time than regular french fries. Slap-chips are an important component of a Gatsby sandwich, also a common Cape Town delicacy. Slap-chips are also commonly served with deep fried fish which are also served with the same white vinegar.\nJapan.\n is a standard fast-food side dish in Japan. Inspired by Japanese cuisine, okonomiyaki fries are served with a topping of unagi sauce, mayonnaise, katsuobushi, nori seasoning (furikake) and stir-fried cabbage.\nVariants.\nFrench fries come in multiple variations and toppings. Some examples include:\nAccompaniments.\nFries tend to be served with a variety of accompaniments, such as salt and vinegar (malt, balsamic or white), pepper, Cajun seasoning, grated cheese, melted cheese, mushy peas, heated curry sauce, curry ketchup, hot sauce, relish, mustard, mayonnaise, bearnaise sauce, tartar sauce, chili, tzatziki, feta cheese, garlic sauce, fry sauce, butter, sour cream, ranch dressing, barbecue sauce, gravy, honey, aioli, brown sauce, ketchup, lemon juice, piccalilli, pickled cucumber, pickled gherkins, pickled onions or pickled eggs. In Australia, a popular flavouring added to chips is chicken salt.\nNutrition.\nFrench fries primarily contain carbohydrates (mostly in the form of starch) and protein from the potato, and fat absorbed during the deep-frying process. Salt, which contains sodium, is almost always applied as a surface seasoning. For example, a large serving of french fries at McDonald's in the United States is 154 grams and includes 350\u00a0mg of sodium. The 510 calories come from 66\u00a0g of carbohydrates, 24\u00a0g of fat and 7\u00a0g of protein.\nA number of experts have criticised french fries for being very unhealthy. According to Jonathan Bonnet in a \"Time\" magazine article, \"fries are nutritionally unrecognizable from a spud\" because they \"involve frying, salting, and removing one of the healthiest parts of the potato: the skin, where many of the nutrients and fiber are found.\" Kristin Kirkpatrick calls french fries \"an extremely starchy vegetable dipped in a fryer that then loads on the unhealthy fat, and what you have left is a food that has no nutritional redeeming value in it at all.\" David Katz states that \"French fries are often the super-fatty side dish to a burger\u2014and both are often used as vehicles for things like sugar-laced ketchup and fatty mayo.\" Eric Morrissette, spokesperson for Health Canada, states that people should limit their intake of french fries, but eating them occasionally is not likely to be a health concern.\nFrying french fries in beef tallow, lard, or other animal fats adds saturated fat to them. Replacing animal fats with tropical vegetable oils, such as palm oil, simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. For many years partially hydrogenated vegetable oils were used as a means of avoiding cholesterol and reducing saturated fatty acid content, but in time the trans fat content of these oils was perceived as contributing to cardiovascular disease. Starting in 2008, many restaurant chains and manufacturers of pre-cooked frozen french fries for home reheating phased out trans-fat\u2013containing vegetable oils.\nFrench fries contain some of the highest levels of acrylamides of any foodstuff, and experts have raised concerns about the effects of acrylamides on human health. According to the American Cancer Society, it is not clear whether acrylamide consumption affects people's risk of getting cancer. A meta-analysis indicated that dietary acrylamide is not related to the risk of most common cancers, but could not exclude a modest association for kidney, endometrial or ovarian cancers. A lower-fat method for producing a french-fry\u2013like product is to coat \"frenched\" or wedge potatoes in oil and spices/flavouring before baking them. The temperature will be lower compared to deep frying, which reduces acrylamide formation.\nIn April 2023, researchers from China suggested a possible link between the consumption of fried food and mental health problems. According to the study, those who frequently consume fried food, especially potatoes, have an increased risk of depression and anxiety, by 7% and 12% respectively, compared to those who do not. The connection was particularly prominent among younger males. However, the causal relationship is not conclusive. The results are still preliminary, and the researchers are uncertain whether consuming fried foods causes mental health problems or individuals with symptoms of anxiety and depression tend to opt for fried foods.\nLegal issues.\nIn June 2004, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the advisement of a federal district judge from Beaumont, Texas, classified batter-coated french fries as a vegetable under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. This was primarily for trade reasons; french fries do not meet the standard to be listed as a processed food. This classification, referred to as the \"French fry rule\", was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit case \"Fleming Companies, Inc. v. USDA\".\nEnvironmental impact.\nA 2022 study estimated the environmental impact of 57,000 food products in the UK and Ireland, finding that french fries have a lower impact on the environment than many other foods.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10886", "revid": "44167217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10886", "title": "Field hockey", "text": "Team sport played with sticks and a spherical ball\nField hockey, or simply hockey in Asia, Europe and Oceania, is a fast-paced team sport in which two teams of eleven players (ten field players and one goalkeeper) use curved sticks to maneuver a small, hard hockey ball towards the rival team's shooting circle and then into the goal. The team with the most goals at the end of play wins the match. \nMatches are played on grass, watered turf, or artificial turf, although grass has become increasingly rare as a playing surface. Indoor hockey is usually played on a synthetic hard court or hardwood sports flooring, and beach field hockey is played on sand.\nThe stick has evolved significantly over the game's history in its composition and shape. Wooden sticks, though once standard, have become increasingly uncommon as technological advancements have made synthetic materials cheaper. Today, sticks are typically made of a combination of carbon fibre, fibreglass, and aramid, in varying proportions. At the elite level, sticks with a very high carbon content are near universally preferred. The stick has two sides; one rounded and one flat; only the flat face of the stick is allowed to progress the ball. If the ball is \"played\" with the rounded part of the stick (i.e., stopped or hit), it will result in a penalty, though accidental touches are not an offence as long as they do not materially affect play. Goalkeepers often have a different design of stick; they also cannot play the ball with the round side of their stick. Goalkeepers are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body when inside their shooting circle. No other player is allowed to touch the ball except with their stick, though a player's hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick.\nThe modern game was developed at public schools in 19th-century England and it is now played globally. The governing body is the International Hockey Federation (FIH), called the in French. Men and women are represented internationally in competitions including the Olympic Games, World Cup, FIH Pro League, Junior World Cup and in past also World League, Champions Trophy. Many countries run extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organizing the Hockey Rules Board and developing the sport's rules.\nThe sport is known simply as \"hockey\" in many countries. In Sweden and Finland, the term ' and ' respectively are used, translating to \"ground\" hockey in opposition to the more standard ice hockey variant. A popular variant is indoor field hockey, which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey.\nHistory.\nAccording to the International Hockey Federation (FIH), \"the roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity\". There are historical records which suggest early forms of hockey were played in Egypt and Persia c.\u20092000 BC, and in Ethiopia c.\u20091000 BC. Later evidence suggest that the ancient Greeks, Romans and Aztecs all played hockey-like games. In Ancient Egypt, there is a depiction of two figures playing with sticks and ball in the Beni Hasan tomb of Khety, an administrator of Dynasty XI.\nIn Ancient Greece, there is a similar image dated c.\u2009510 BC, which may have been called () because it was played with a horn (, in Ancient Greek) and a ball. Researchers disagree over how to interpret this image. It could have been a team or one-on-one activity (the depiction shows two active players, and other figures who may be team-mates awaiting a face-off, or non-players waiting for their turn at play). Billiards historians Stein and Rubino believe it was among the games ancestral to lawn-and-field games like hockey and ground billiards, and near-identical depictions appear in later European illuminated manuscripts and other works of the 14th through 17th centuries, showing contemporary courtly and clerical life.\nIn East Asia, a similar game was entertained, using a carved wooden stick and ball, before 300 BC. In Inner Mongolia, China, the Daur people have for about 1,000 years been playing \"beikou\", a game with some similarities to field hockey. A similar field hockey or ground billiards variant, called \"suigan\", was played in China during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644, post-dating the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty). A game similar to field hockey was played in the 17th century in Punjab state in India under name ( refers to the woolen ball, and to the stick).\nIn South America, most specifically in Chile, the local natives of the 16th century used to play a game called \"chueca\", which also shares common elements with hockey.\nIn Northern Europe, the games of hurling (Ireland) and ' (Iceland), both team ball games involving sticks to drive a ball to the opponents' goal, date at least as far back as the Early Middle Ages. By the 12th century, a team ball game called ' or \"\", akin to a chaotic and sometimes long-distance version of hockey or rugby football (depending on whether sticks were used in a particular local variant), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes. Throughout the Middle Ages to the Early Modern era, such games often involved the local clergy or secular aristocracy, and in some periods were limited to them by various anti-gaming edicts, or even banned altogether. Stein and Rubino, among others, ultimately trace aspects of these games both to rituals in antiquity involving orbs and sceptres (on the aristocratic and clerical side), and to ancient military training exercises (on the popular side); polo (essentially hockey on horseback) was devised by the Ancient Persians for cavalry training, based on the local proto-hockey foot game of the region.\nThe word \"hockey\" itself has no clear origin. One belief is that it was recorded in 1363 when Edward III of England issued the proclamation: \"Moreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\". The belief is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games \"Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, &amp; Bacularem: &amp; ad Canibucam &amp; Gallorum Pugnam\". The word is the Latin for 'stick', so the reference would appear to be to a game played with sticks. The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word \"hockey\" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, and the word \"hockey\" remains of unknown origin.\nThe modern game developed at public schools in 19th-century England. It is now played globally, particularly in parts of Western Europe, South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States, primarily New England and the mid-Atlantic states. The term \"field hockey\" is used primarily in Canada and the United States where \"hockey\" more often refers to ice hockey. In Sweden, the term is used, and to some degree in Norway, where the game is governed by Norges Bandyforbund.\nThe first known club was formed in 1849 at Blackheath in south-east London, but the modern rules grew out of a version played by Middlesex cricket clubs as a winter activity. Teddington Hockey Club formed the modern game by introducing the striking circle and changing the ball to a sphere from a rubber cube. The Hockey Association was founded in 1876. It lasted just six years, before being revived by nine founding members. The first international competition took place in 1895 (Ireland 3, Wales 0), and the International Rules Board was founded in 1900.\nField hockey was played at the Summer Olympics in 1908 and 1920. It was dropped in 1924, leading to the foundation of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH) as an international governing body by seven continental European nations; and hockey was reinstated as an Olympic game in 1928. Men's hockey united under the FIH in 1970.\nThe two oldest trophies are the Irish Senior Cup, which dates back to 1894, and the Irish Junior Cup, a second XI-only competition instituted in 1895.\nIn India, the Beighton Cup and the Aga Khan tournament commenced within ten years. Entering the Olympics in 1928, India won all five games without conceding a goal, and won from 1932 until 1956, and then in 1964 and 1980. Pakistan won Olympic gold in men's hockey in 1960, 1968, and 1984. All but three of Pakistan's 11 Olympic medals so far have been in field hockey, including three gold, three silver, and two bronze medals.\nIn the early 1970s, artificial turf began to be used. Synthetic pitches changed most aspects of field hockey, gaining speed. New tactics and techniques such as the Indian dribble developed, followed by new rules to take account. The switch to synthetic surfaces ended Indian and Pakistani domination because artificial turf was too expensive in developing countries. Since the 1970s, Australia, the Netherlands, and Germany have dominated at the Olympics and World Cup stages.\nWomen's field hockey was first played at British universities and schools. The first club, the Molesey Ladies, was founded in 1887. The first national association was the Irish Ladies Hockey Union in 1894, and though rebuffed by the Hockey Association, women's field hockey grew rapidly around the world. This led to the International Federation of Women's Hockey Association (IFWHA) in 1927, though this did not include many continental European countries where women played as sections of men's associations and were affiliated to the FIH. The IFWHA held conferences every three years, and tournaments associated with these were the primary IFWHA competitions. These tournaments were non-competitive until 1975.\nBy the early 1970s, there were 22 associations with women's sections in the FIH and 36 associations in the IFWHA. Discussions started about a common rule book. The FIH introduced competitive tournaments in 1974, forcing the acceptance of the principle of competitive field hockey by the IFWHA in 1973. It took until 1982 for the two bodies to merge, but this allowed the introduction of women's field hockey to the Olympic games from 1980 where, as in the men's game, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia have been consistently strong. Argentina has emerged as a team to be reckoned with since 2000, winning the world championship in 2002 and 2010 and medals at the last three Olympics.\nIn the United States, field hockey is played predominantly by girls and women. There are few field hockey clubs, most play taking place between high school or college sides. The sport was largely introduced in the U.S. by Constance Applebee, starting with a tour of Seven Sisters colleges in 1901 and continuing through Applebee's 24-year tenure as athletic director of Bryn Mawr College. The strength of college field hockey reflects the impact of Title IX, which mandated that colleges should fund men's and women's games programmes comparably. Hockey has been predominantly played on the East Coast, specifically the Mid-Atlantic in states such as New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. In recent years, it has become increasingly played on the West Coast and in the Midwest.\nIn other countries, participation is fairly evenly balanced between men and women. For example, in the 2008\u201309 season, England Hockey reported 2,488 registered men's teams, 1,969 women's teams, 1,042 boys' teams, 966 girls' teams and 274 mixed teams. In 2006, the Irish Hockey Association reported that the gender split among its players was approximately 65% female and 35% male. In its 2008 census, Hockey Australia reported 40,534 male club players and 41,542 female.\nField of play.\nMost hockey field dimensions were originally fixed using whole numbers of imperial measures. Metric measurements are now the official dimensions as laid down by the International Hockey Federation (FIH) in the \"Rules of Hockey\".\nThe pitch is a rectangular field. At each end is a goal high and wide, as well as lines across the field from each end-line (generally referred to as the 23-metre lines or the 25-yard lines) and in the center of the field. A spot in diameter, called the penalty spot or stroke mark, is placed with its centre from the centre of each goal. The shooting circle, most commonly known as 'the D' due to its shape, is from the base line.\nField hockey goals are made of two upright posts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar, with a net positioned to catch the ball when it passes through the goalposts. The goalposts and crossbar must be white and rectangular in shape, and should be wide and deep.\nField hockey goals also include sideboards and a backboard, which stand from the ground. The backboard runs the full width of the goal, while the sideboards are deep.\nPlaying surface.\nHistorically the game developed on natural grass turf. In the early 1970s, synthetic grass fields began to be used for hockey, with the first Olympic Games on this surface being held at Montreal in 1976. Synthetic pitches are now mandatory for all international tournaments and for most national competitions. While hockey is still played on traditional grass fields at some local levels and lesser national divisions, it has been replaced by synthetic surfaces almost everywhere in the western world. There are three main types of artificial hockey surface:\nSince the 1970s, sand-based pitches have been favoured as they dramatically speed up the game. However, in recent years there has been a massive increase in the number of \"water-based\" artificial turfs. Water-based synthetic turfs enable the ball to be transferred more quickly than on sand-based surfaces. It is this characteristic that has made them the surface of choice for international and national league competitions. Water-based surfaces are also less abrasive than sand-based surfaces and reduce the level of injury to players when they come into contact with the surface. Following the 2018 FIH Congress it was decided that new surfaces being laid should be of a hybrid variety which require less watering. This is due to the negative ecological effects of the high water requirements of water-based synthetic fields. It has also been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent countries who could afford these new pitches.\nRules and play.\nOverview.\nThe game is played between two teams of eleven; 10 field players and one goal keeper are permitted to be on the pitch at any one time. The remaining players may be substituted in any combination. There is an unlimited number of times a team can sub in and out. Substitutions are permitted at any point in the game, apart from between the award and end of a penalty corner; two exceptions to this rule is for injury or suspension of the defending goalkeeper, which is not allowed when playing with a field keep, or a player can exit the field, but you must wait until after the penalty corner is complete. Play is not stopped for a substitution (except of a goalkeeper), the players leave and rejoin the match simultaneously at the half-way line.\nPlayers are permitted to play the ball with the flat of the 'face side' and with the edges of the head and handle of the field hockey stick with the exception that, for reasons of safety, the ball may not be struck 'hard' with a forehand edge stroke, because of the difficulty of controlling the height and direction of the ball from that stroke.\nThe flat side is always on the \"natural\" side for a right-handed person swinging the stick at the ball from right to left. Left-handed sticks are rare, as International Hockey Federation rules forbid their use in a game. To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of the stick to the ball by 'reversing' the stick head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180\u00b0 (while a reverse edge hit would turn the stick head through approximately 90\u00b0 from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of the stick head).\nEdge hitting of the ball underwent a two-year \"experimental period\", twice the usual length of an \"experimental trial\" and is still a matter of some controversy within the game. Ric Charlesworth, the former Australian coach, has been a strong critic of the unrestricted use of the reverse edge hit. The 'hard' forehand edge hit was banned after similar concerns were expressed about the ability of players to direct the ball accurately, but the reverse edge hit does appear to be more predictable and controllable than its counterpart. This type of hit is now more commonly referred to as the \"forehand sweep\" where the ball is hit with the flat side or \"natural\" side of the stick and not the rounded edge.\nOther rules include; no foot-to-ball contact, no use of hands, no obstructing other players, no high back swing, no hacking, and no third party. If a player is dribbling the ball and either loses control and kicks the ball or another player interferes that player is not permitted to gain control and continue dribbling. The rules do not allow the person who kicked the ball to gain advantage from the kick, so the ball will automatically be passed on to the opposing team. Conversely, if no advantage is gained from kicking the ball, play should continue. Players may not obstruct another's chance of hitting the ball in any way. No shoving/using your body/stick to prevent advancement in the other team. Penalty for this is the opposing team receives the ball and if the problem continues, the player can be carded. While a player is taking a free hit or starting a corner the back swing of their hit cannot be too high for this is considered dangerous. Finally there may not be three players touching the ball at one time. Two players from opposing teams can battle for the ball, however if another player interferes it is considered third party and the ball automatically goes to the team who only had one player involved in the third party.\nThe game.\nA match ordinarily consists of two periods of 35 minutes and a halftime interval of 5 minutes. Other periods and interval may be agreed by both teams except as specified in regulations for particular competitions. Since 2014, some international games have four 15-minute quarters with 2 minutes break between each quarter and 5 minutes break between quarter two and three. At the 2018 Commonwealth Games, held on the Gold Coast in Brisbane, the hockey games for both men and women were played in four 15-minute quarters.\nIn December 2018, the FIH announced rule changes that would make 15-minute quarters universal from January 2019. England Hockey confirmed that while no changes would be made to the domestic game mid-season, the new rules would be implemented at the start of the 2019\u201320 season. However, in July 2019 England Hockey announced that 17.5-minute quarters would only be implemented in elite domestic club games.\nThe game begins with a pass back from the centre-forward usually to the centre-half back from the halfway line. The opposing team cannot try to tackle this play until the ball has been pushed back. The team consists of eleven players, usually aligned as follows: goalkeeper, right fullback, left fullback, three half-backs and five forwards who are right wing, right inner, centre forward, left inner and left wing. These positions can change and adapt throughout the course of the game depending on the attacking and defensive style of the opposition.\nPositions.\nWhen hockey positions are discussed, notions of fluidity are very common. Each team can be fielded with a maximum of 11 players and will typically arrange themselves into forwards, midfielders, and defenders with players frequently moving between these lines with the flow of play. Each team may also play with:\nFormations.\nAs hockey has a very dynamic style of play, it is difficult to simplify positions to the static formations which are common in association football. Although positions will typically be categorised as either fullback, halfback, midfield/inner or striker, it is important for players to have an understanding of every position on the field. For example, it is not uncommon to see a halfback overlap and end up in either attacking position, with the midfield and strikers being responsible for re-adjusting to fill the space they left. Movement between lines like this is particularly common across all positions.\nThis fluid Australian culture of hockey has been responsible for developing an international trend towards players occupying spaces on the field, not having assigned positions. Although they may have particular spaces on the field which they are more comfortable and effective as players, they are responsible for occupying the space nearest them. This fluid approach to hockey and player movement has made it easy for teams to transition between formations such as: \"3 at the back\", \"5 midfields\", \"2 at the front\", and more.\nGoalkeepers.\nWhen the ball is inside the circle, they are defending and they have their stick in their hand, goalkeepers wearing full protective equipment are permitted to use their stick, feet, kickers or leg guards to propel the ball and to use their stick, feet, kickers, leg guards or any other part of their body to stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. Similarly, field players are permitted to use their stick. They are not allowed to use their feet and legs to propel the ball, stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. However, neither goalkeepers, or players with goalkeeping privileges are permitted to conduct themselves in a manner which is dangerous to other players by taking advantage of the protective equipment they wear.\nNeither goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges may lie on the ball, however, they are permitted to use arms, hands and any other part of their body to push the ball away. Lying on the ball deliberately will result in a penalty stroke, whereas if an umpire deems a goalkeeper has lain on the ball accidentally (e.g. it gets stuck in their protective equipment), a penalty corner is awarded.\n\"* The action above is permitted only as part of a goal saving action or to move the ball away from the possibility of a goal scoring action by opponents. It does not permit a goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges to propel the ball forcefully with arms, hands or body so that it travels a long distance\"\nWhen the ball is outside the circle they are defending, goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges are only permitted to play the ball with their stick. Further, a goalkeeper, or player with goalkeeping privileges who is wearing a helmet, must not take part in the match outside the 23m area they are defending, except when taking a penalty stroke. A goalkeeper must wear protective headgear at all times, except when taking a penalty stroke.\nGeneral play.\nFor the purposes of the rules, all players on the team in possession of the ball are attackers, and those on the team without the ball are defenders, yet throughout the game being played you are always \"defending\" your goal and \"attacking\" the opposite goal.\nThe match is officiated by two field umpires. Each umpire generally controls the half of the field and the shooting circle to their right, divided roughly diagonally, but they will often defer to the other's judgement when uncertainties arise. These umpires are often assisted by a technical bench including a timekeeper and record keeper at international and high level domestic games.\nPrior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or whether to start with the ball. Since 2017 the game consists of four periods of 15 minutes with a 2-minute break after every period, and a 15-minute intermission at half time before changing ends. At the start of each period, as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field. All players must start in their defensive half (apart from the player making the pass), but the ball may be played in any direction along the floor. Each team starts with the ball in one half, and the team that conceded the goal has possession for the restart. Teams trade sides at halftime.\nField players may only play the ball with the face of the stick. If the back side of the stick is used, it is a penalty and the other team will get the ball back. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or the other person's stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalised if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body to push a defender out of the way.\nField players may not play the ball with their feet, but if the ball accidentally hits the feet, and the player gains no benefit from the contact, then the contact is not penalised. Although there has been a change in the wording of this rule from 1 January 2007, the current FIH umpires' briefing instructs umpires not to change the way they interpret this rule.\nObstruction typically occurs in three circumstances\u00a0\u2013 when a defender comes between the player with possession and the ball in order to prevent them tackling; when a defender's stick comes between the attacker's stick and the ball or makes contact with the attacker's stick or body; and also when blocking the opposition's attempt to tackle a teammate with the ball (called \"third party obstruction\").\nWhen the ball passes completely over the sidelines (on the sideline is still in), it is returned to play with a sideline hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. The ball must be placed on the sideline, with the hit taken from as near the place the ball went out of play as possible. If it crosses the back line after last touched by an attacker, a hit is awarded. A 15\u00a0m hit is also awarded for offences committed by the attacking side within 15\u00a0m of the end of the pitch they are attacking.\nSet plays.\nSet plays are often utilised for specific situations such as a penalty corner or free hit. For instance, many teams have penalty corner variations that they can use to beat the defensive team. The coach may have plays that sends the ball between two defenders and lets the player attack the opposing team's goal. There are no set plays unless your team has them.\nFree hits.\nFree hits are awarded when offences are committed outside the scoring circles (the term 'free hit' is standard usage but the ball need not be hit). The ball may be hit, pushed or lifted in any direction by the team offended against. The ball can be lifted from a free hit but not by hitting, the ball must be flicked or scooped to lift from a free hit. (In previous versions of the rules, hits in the area outside the circle in open play have been permitted but lifting one direction from a free hit was prohibited). Opponents must move from the ball when a free hit is awarded. A free hit must be taken from within playing distance of the place of the offence for which it was awarded and the ball must be stationary when the free hit is taken.\nAs mentioned above, a 15\u00a0m hit is awarded if an attacking player commits a foul forward of that line, or if the ball passes over the back line off an attacker. These free hits are taken in-line with where the foul was committed (taking a line parallel with the sideline between where the offence was committed, or the ball went out of play). When an attacking free hit is awarded within 5\u00a0m of the circle everyone including the person taking the penalty must be five meters from the circle and everyone apart from the person taking the free hit must be five meters away from the ball. When taking an attacking free hit, the ball may not be hit straight into the circle if the hitting player is within their attacking 23-meter area (25-yard area). It has to travel 5 meters before going in.\n2009 experimental changes.\nIn February 2009 the FIH introduced, as a \"Mandatory Experiment\" for international competition, an updated version of the free-hit rule. The changes allows a player taking a free hit to pass the ball to themselves. Importantly, this is not a \"play on\" situation, but to the untrained eye it may appear to be. The player must play the ball any distance in two separate motions, before continuing as if it were a play-on situation. They may raise an aerial or overhead immediately as the second action, or any other stroke permitted by the rules of field hockey. At high-school level, this is called a self pass and was adopted in Pennsylvania in 2010 as a legal technique for putting the ball in play.\nAlso, all players (from both teams) must be at least 5\u00a0m from any free hit awarded to the attack within the 23\u00a0m area. The ball may not travel directly into the circle from a free hit to the attack within the 23 m area without first being touched by another player or being dribbled at least 5 m by a player making a \"self-pass\". These experimental rules apply to all free-hit situations, including sideline and corner hits. National associations may also choose to introduce these rules for their domestic competitions.\nLong corner.\nA free hit from the 23-metre line \u2013 called a long corner \u2013 is awarded to the attacking team if the ball goes over the back-line after last being touched by a defender, provided they do not play it over the back-line deliberately, in which case a penalty corner is awarded. This free hit is played by the attacking team from a spot on the 23-metre line, in line with where the ball went out of play. All the parameters of an attacking free hit within the attacking quarter of the playing surface apply.\nPenalty corner.\nThe short or penalty corner is awarded: \nShort corners begin with five defenders (usually including the keeper) positioned behind the back line and the ball placed at least 10 yards from the nearest goal post. All other players in the defending team must be beyond the centre line, that is not in their 'own' half of the pitch, until the ball is in play. Attacking players begin the play standing outside the scoring circle, except for one attacker who starts the corner by playing the ball from a mark 10\u00a0m either side of the goal (the circle has a 14.63\u00a0m radius). This player puts the ball into play by pushing or hitting the ball to the other attackers outside the circle; the ball must pass outside the circle and then put back into the circle before the attackers may make a shot at the goal from which a goal can be scored. FIH rules do not forbid a shot at goal before the ball leaves the circle after being 'inserted', nor is a shot at the goal from outside the circle prohibited, but a goal cannot be scored at all if the ball has not gone out of the circle and cannot be scored from a shot from outside the circle if it is not again played by an attacking player before it enters the goal.\nFor safety reasons, the first shot of a penalty corner must not exceed 460\u00a0mm high (the height of the \"backboard\" of the goal) at the point it crosses the goal line if it is hit. However, if the ball is deemed to be below backboard height, the ball can be subsequently deflected above this height by another player (defender or attacker), providing that this deflection does not lead to danger. The \"Slap\" stroke (a sweeping motion towards the ball, where the stick is kept on or close to the ground when striking the ball) is classed as a hit, and so the first shot at goal must be below backboard height for this type of shot also.\nIf the first shot at goal in a short corner situation is a push, flick or scoop, in particular the \"drag flick\" (which has become popular at international and national league standards), the shot is permitted to rise above the height of the backboard, as long as the shot is not deemed dangerous to any opponent. This form of shooting was developed because it is not height restricted in the same way as the first hit shot at the goal and players with good technique are able to drag-flick with as much power as many others can hit a ball.\nPenalty stroke.\nA penalty stroke is awarded when a defender commits a foul in the circle (accidental or otherwise) that prevents a probable goal or commits a deliberate foul in the circle or if defenders repeatedly run from the back line too early at a penalty corner. The penalty stroke is taken by a single attacker in the circle, against the goalkeeper, from a spot 6.4\u00a0m from goal. The ball is played only once at goal by the attacker using a push, flick or scoop stroke. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with a 15 m hit to the defenders. When a goal is scored, play is restarted in the normal way.\nDangerous play and raised balls.\nAccording to the Rules of Hockey 2015 issued by the FIH there are only two criteria for a dangerously played ball. The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent (what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment). The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally, if somewhat inconsistently, applied throughout the game and in all parts of the pitch: it is that a ball lifted above knee height and at an opponent who is within 5m of the ball is certainly dangerous.\nThe velocity of the ball is not mentioned in the rules concerning a dangerously played ball. A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalised, this is at the umpire's discretion. A jab tackle, for example, might accidentally lift the ball above knee height into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be, in the opinion of the umpire, dangerous play. In the same way a high-velocity hit at very close range into an opponent, but below knee height, could be considered to be dangerous or reckless play in the view of the umpire, especially when safer alternatives are open to the striker of the ball.\nA ball that has been lifted high so that it will fall among close opponents may be deemed to be potentially dangerous and play may be stopped for that reason. A lifted ball that is falling to a player in clear space may be made potentially dangerous by the actions of an opponent closing to within 5m of the receiver before the ball has been controlled to ground\u00a0\u2013 a rule which is often only loosely applied; the distance allowed is often only what might be described as playing distance, 2\u20133\u00a0m, and opponents tend to be permitted to close on the ball as soon as the receiver plays it: these unofficial variations are often based on the umpire's perception of the skill of the players i.e. on the level of the game, in order to maintain game flow, which umpires are in general in both Rules and Briefing instructed to do, by not penalising when it is unnecessary to do so; this is also a matter at the umpire's discretion.\nThe term \"falling ball\" is important in what may be termed encroaching offences. It is generally only considered an offence to encroach on an opponent receiving a lifted ball that has been lifted to above head height (although the height is not specified in rule) and is falling. So, for example, a lifted shot at the goal which is still rising as it crosses the goal line (or would have been rising as it crossed the goal line) can be legitimately followed up by any of the attacking team looking for a rebound.\nIn general even potentially dangerous play is not penalised if an opponent is not disadvantaged by it or, obviously, not injured by it so that he cannot continue. A personal penalty, that is a caution or a suspension, rather than a team penalty, such as a free ball or a penalty corner, may be (many would say should be or even must be, but again this is at the umpire's discretion) issued to the guilty party after an advantage allowed by the umpire has been played out in any situation where an offence has occurred, including dangerous play (but once advantage has been allowed the umpire cannot then call play back and award a team penalty).\nIt is not an offence to lift the ball over an opponent's stick (or body on the ground), provided that it is done with consideration for the safety of the opponent and not dangerously. For example, a skilful attacker may lift the ball over a defender's stick or prone body and run past them, however if the attacker lifts the ball into or at the defender's body, this would almost certainly be regarded as dangerous.\nIt is not against the rules to bounce the ball on the stick and even to run with it while doing so, as long as that does not lead to a potentially dangerous conflict with an opponent who is attempting to make a tackle. For example, two players trying to play at the ball in the air at the same time, would probably be considered a dangerous situation and it is likely that the player who first put the ball up or who was so 'carrying' it would be penalised.\nDangerous play rules also apply to the usage of the stick when approaching the ball, making a stroke at it (replacing what was at one time referred to as the \"sticks\" rule, which once forbade the raising of any part of the stick above the shoulder during any play. This last restriction has been removed but the stick should still not be used in a way that endangers an opponent) or attempting to tackle, (fouls relating to tripping, impeding and obstruction). The use of the stick to strike an opponent will usually be much more severely dealt with by the umpires than offences such as barging, impeding and obstruction with the body, although these are also dealt with firmly, especially when these fouls are intentional.\nWarnings and suspensions.\nHockey uses a three-tier penalty card system of warnings and suspensions:\nIf a coach is sent off, depending on local rules, a player may have to leave the field for the remaining length of the match.\nIn addition to their colours, field hockey penalty cards are often shaped differently, so they can be recognised easily. Green cards are normally triangular, yellow cards rectangular and red cards circular.\nUnlike football, a player may receive more than one green or yellow card. However, they cannot receive the same card for the same offence (for example two yellows for dangerous play), and the second must always be a more serious card. In the case of a second yellow card for a different breach of the rules (for example a yellow for deliberate foot, and a second later in the game for dangerous play) the temporary suspension would be expected to be of considerably longer duration than the first. However, local playing conditions may mandate that cards are awarded only progressively, and not allow any second awards.\nUmpires, if the free hit would have been in the attacking 23\u00a0m area, may upgrade the free hit to a penalty corner for dissent or other misconduct after the free hit has been awarded.\nScoring.\nThe teams' object is to play the ball into their attacking circle and, from there, hit, push or flick the ball into the goal, scoring a goal. The team with more goals after 60 minutes wins the game. The playing time may be shortened, particularly when younger players are involved, or for some tournament play. If the game is played in a countdown clock, like ice hockey, a goal can only count if the ball completely crosses the goal line and into the goal \"before\" time expires, not when the ball leaves the stick in the act of shooting.\nIf the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time, or there is a penalty shoot-out, depending on the format of the competition. In many competitions (such as regular club competition, or in pool games in FIH international tournaments such as the Olympics or the World Cup), a tied result stands and the overall competition standings are adjusted accordingly. Since March 2013, when tie breaking is required, the official FIH Tournament Regulations mandate to no longer have extra time and go directly into a penalty shoot-out when a classification match ends in a tie. However, many associations follow the previous procedure consisting of two periods of 7.5 minutes of \"golden goal\" extra time during which the game ends as soon as one team scores.\nThere are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league or tournament rules. In American college play, a seven-a-side overtime period consists of a 10-minute golden goal period with seven players for each team. If the scores remain equal, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses five players to dribble from the line down to the circle against the opposing goalkeeper. The player has eight seconds to score against the goalkeeper while keeping the ball in bounds. The game ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one-on-one) or time expires. If the tie still persists, more rounds are played until one team has scored.\nRule change procedure.\nThe FIH implemented a two-year rules cycle with the 2007\u201308 edition of the rules, with the intention that the rules be reviewed on a biennial basis. The 2009 rulebook was officially released in early March 2009 (effective 1 May 2009), however the FIH published the major changes in February. The current rule book is effective from 1 January 2024.\nLocal rules.\nThere are sometimes minor variations in rules from competition to competition; for instance, the duration of matches is often varied for junior competitions or for carnivals. Different national associations also have slightly differing rules on player equipment.\nThe new Euro Hockey League and the Olympics has made major alterations to the rules to aid television viewers, such as splitting the game into four-quarters, and to try to improve player behavior, such as a two-minute suspension for green cards\u2014the latter was also used in the 2010 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. In the United States, the NCAA has its own rules for inter-collegiate competitions; high school associations similarly play to different rules, usually using the rules published by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). This article assumes FIH rules unless otherwise stated. USA Field Hockey produces an annual summary of the differences.\nIn the United States, the games at the junior high level consist of four 12-minute periods, while the high-school level consists of four 15-minute periods. Many private American schools play 12-minute quarters, and some have adopted FIH rules rather than NFHS rules.\nPlayers are required to wear mouth guards and shin guards in order to play the game. Also, there is a newer rule requiring certain types of sticks be used. In recent years, the NFHS rules have moved closer to FIH, but in 2011 a new rule requiring protective eyewear was introduced for the 2011 Fall season. Further clarification of NFHS's rule requiring protective eyewear states, \"effective 1 January 2019, all eye protection shall be permanently labeled with the current ASTM 2713 standard for field hockey\". Metal 'cage style' goggles favored by US high school lacrosse and permitted in high school field hockey is prohibited under FIH rules.\nEquipment.\nField hockey stick.\nEach player carries a hockey stick that normally measures between ; shorter or longer sticks are available. The length of the stick is based on the player's individual height: the top of the stick usually comes to the player's hip, and taller players typically have longer sticks. Goalkeepers can use either a specialised stick, or an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, to give it more surface area to block the ball.\nSticks were traditionally made of wood, but are now often made also with fibreglass, kevlar or carbon fibre composites. Metal is forbidden from use in field hockey sticks, due to the risk of injury from sharp edges if the stick were to break. The stick has a rounded handle, has a J-shaped hook at the bottom, and is flattened on the left side (when looking down the handle with the hook facing upwards). All sticks must be right-handed; left-handed ones are prohibited.\nThere was traditionally a slight curve (called the bow, or rake) from the top to bottom of the face side of the stick and another on the 'heel' edge to the top of the handle (usually made according to the angle at which the handle part was inserted into the splice of the head part of the stick), which assisted in the positioning of the stick head in relation to the ball and made striking the ball easier and more accurate.\nThe hook at the bottom of the stick was only recently the tight curve (Indian style) that we have nowadays. The older 'English' sticks had a longer bend, making it very hard to use the stick on the reverse. For this reason players now use the tight curved sticks.\nThe handle makes up about the top third of the stick. It is wrapped in a grip similar to that used on tennis racket. The grip may be made of a variety of materials, including chamois leather, which improves grip in the wet and gives the stick a softer touch and different weighting it wrapped over a preexisting grip.\nIt was recently discovered that increasing the depth of the face bow made it easier to get high speeds from the dragflick and made the stroke easier to execute. At first, after this feature was introduced, the Hockey Rules Board placed a limit of 50\u00a0mm on the maximum depth of bow over the length of the stick but experience quickly demonstrated this to be excessive. New rules now limit this curve to under 25\u00a0mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked.\nField hockey ball.\nStandard field hockey balls are hard spherical balls, made of solid plastic (sometimes over a cork core), and are usually white, although they can be any colour as long as they contrast with the playing surface. The balls have a diameter of and a mass of . The ball is often covered with indentations to reduce aquaplaning that can cause an inconsistent ball speed on wet surfaces.\nUniforms.\nInternational Hockey Federation rules for women are written so players may choose between shorts, skorts, or skirts if they have the same design and color across the team. A previous requirement was for women to wear skirts during play.\nGoalkeeping equipment.\nThe 2007 rulebook saw major changes regarding goalkeepers. A fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guards and kickers, and like all players, they must carry a stick. Goalkeepers may use either a field player's stick or a specialised goalkeeping stick provided always the stick is of legal dimensions. Usually field hockey goalkeepers also wear extensive additional protective equipment including chest guards, padded shorts, heavily padded hand protectors, groin protectors, neck protectors and arm guards. A goalie may not cross the 23\u00a0m line, the sole exception to this being if the goalkeeper is to take a penalty stroke at the other end of the field, when the clock is stopped. The goalkeeper can also remove their helmet for this action. While goalkeepers are allowed to use their feet and hands to clear the ball, like field players they may only use the one side of their stick. Slide tackling is permitted as long as it is with the intention of clearing the ball, not aimed at a player.\nIt is now also even possible for teams to have a full eleven outfield players and no goalkeeper at all. No player may wear a helmet or other goalkeeping equipment, neither will any player be able to play the ball with any other part of the body than with their stick. This may be used to offer a tactical advantage, for example, if a team is trailing with only a short time to play, or to allow for play to commence if no goalkeeper or kit is available.\nTactics.\nThe basic tactic in field hockey, as in association football and many other team games, is to outnumber the opponent in a particular area of the field at a moment in time. When in possession of the ball this temporary numerical superiority can be used to pass the ball around opponents so that they cannot effect a tackle because they cannot get within playing reach of the ball and to further use this numerical advantage to gain time and create clear space for making scoring shots on the opponent's goal. When not in possession of the ball numerical superiority is used to isolate and channel an opponent in possession and 'mark out' any passing options so that an interception or a tackle may be made to gain possession. Highly skillful players can sometimes get the better of more than one opponent and retain the ball and successfully pass or shoot but this tends to use more energy than quick early passing.\nEvery player has a role depending on their relationship to the ball if the team communicates throughout the play of the game. There will be players on the ball (offensively \u2013 ball carriers; defensively \u2013 pressure, support players, and movement players.\nThe main methods by which the ball is moved around the field by players are a) passing b) pushing the ball and running with it controlled to the front or right of the body and c) \"dribbling\"; where the player controls the ball with the stick and moves in various directions with it to elude opponents. To make a pass the ball may be propelled with a pushing stroke, where the player uses their wrists to push the stick head through the ball while the stick head is in contact with it; the \"flick\" or \"scoop\", similar to the push but with an additional arm and leg and rotational actions to lift the ball off the ground; and the \"hit\", where a swing at ball is taken and contact with it is often made very forcefully, causing the ball to be propelled at velocities in excess of . In order to produce a powerful hit, usually for travel over long distances or shooting at the goal, the stick is raised higher and swung with maximum power at the ball, a stroke sometimes known as a \"drive\".\nTackles are made by placing the stick into the path of the ball or playing the stick head or shaft directly at the ball. To increase the effectiveness of the tackle, players will often place the entire stick close to the ground horizontally, thus representing a wider barrier. To avoid the tackle, the ball carrier will either pass the ball to a teammate using any of the push, flick, or hit strokes, or attempt to maneuver or \"drag\" the ball around the tackle, trying to deceive the tackler.\nIn recent years, the penalty corner has gained importance as a goal scoring opportunity. Particularly with the technical development of the drag flick. Tactics at penalty corners to set up time for a shot with a drag flick or a hit shot at the goal involve various complex plays, including multiple passes before deflections towards the goal is made but the most common method of shooting is the direct flick or hit at the goal.\nAt the highest level, field hockey is a fast moving, highly skilled game, with players using fast moves with the stick, quick accurate passing, and hard hits, in attempts to keep possession and move the ball towards the goal. Tackling with physical contact and otherwise physically obstructing players is not permitted. Some of the tactics used resemble football (soccer), but with greater ball speed.\nWith the 2009 changes to the rules regarding free hits in the attacking 23\u00a0m area, the common tactic of hitting the ball hard into the circle was forbidden. Although at higher levels this was considered tactically risky and low-percentage at creating scoring opportunities, it was used with some effect to 'win' penalty corners by forcing the ball onto a defender's foot or to deflect high (and dangerously) off a defender's stick. The FIH felt it was a dangerous practice that could easily lead to raised deflections and injuries in the circle, which is often crowded at a free-hit situation, and outlawed it.\nInternational competition.\nThe two most significant field hockey tournaments are the Olympic Games tournament and the Hockey World Cup, both of which are held every four years. Additionally, the men's and women's Pro League are held each year for the nine top-ranked teams.\nOf the men's teams, Pakistan has won the Hockey World Cup four times, more times than any other side. India has won gold at the Summer Olympics eight times, including in six successive Olympiads. As for the female teams, the Netherlands has won the Hockey World Cup the most times, with six titles. At the Olympics, Australia and the Netherlands have both won three Olympic tournaments.\nIndia and Pakistan dominated men's hockey until the early 1980s, winning eight Olympic golds and three of the first five world cups, respectively. Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and Spain have ascended since the late 1980s, as grass playing surfaces were replaced with artificial turf. Other notable men's nations include Argentina, England (who combine with other British \"Home Nations\" to form the Great Britain side at Olympic events) and South Korea.\nThe Netherlands, Australia and Argentina are the most successful national teams among women. The Netherlands was the predominant women's team before field hockey was added to Olympic events. In the early 1990s, Australia emerged as the strongest women's country, though retirement of a number of players has weakened the team somewhat. Argentina improved its play in the 2000s, heading IFH rankings in 2003, 2010 and 2013. Other prominent women's teams are Germany, Great Britain, China, South Korea and India. Four nations have won Olympic gold medals in both men's and women's hockey: Germany, Netherlands, Australia and Great Britain.\nAs of August\u00a02025[ [update]] the Dutch lead both men's and women's team FIH world rankings.\nThis is a list of the major international field hockey tournaments, in chronological order. Tournaments included are:\nDefunct tournaments:\nOther international tournaments include:\nVariants.\nIndoor field hockey.\nA popular variant of field hockey is indoor hockey, which is 6-a-side (5-a-side during 2014\u20132015) using a field which is reduced to approximately . Although many of the rules remain the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: players may not raise the ball unless shooting at goal, players may not hit the ball, instead using pushes to transfer it, and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers, from which the ball will rebound and remain in play. In addition, the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than an outdoor one.\nHockey5s.\nAs the name suggests, Hockey5s is a hockey variant which features five players on each team (including a goalkeeper). The field of play is 55\u00a0m long and 41.70\u00a0m wide\u2014this is approximately half the size of a regular pitch. Few additional markings are needed as there is no penalty circle nor penalty corners; shots can be taken from anywhere on the pitch. Penalty strokes are replaced by a \"challenge\" which is like the one-on-one method used in a penalty shoot-out. The duration of the match is three 12-minute periods with an interval of two minutes between periods; golden goal periods are multiple 5-minute periods. The rules are simpler and it is intended that the game is faster, creating more shots on goal with less play in midfield, and more attractive to spectators.\nAn Asian qualification tournament for two places at the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was the first time an FIH event used the Hockey5s format. Hockey5s was also used for the Pacific Games in 2015 and at the African Youth Games in 2018.\nIn 2022, the FIH staged its first senior international Hockey5s event, with a men's and women's event being held in Lausanne. The FIH Men's Hockey5s World Cup and FIH Women's Hockey5s World Cup are set to debut in 2024.\nBeach hockey.\nIHF created a beach version with larger ball to be played on sand.\nReferences.\nNOTE: Many of the sources here are suspect and may be unreliable.

{"id": "10890", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10890", "title": "Fundamental interaction", "text": "Most basic type of physical force\nIn physics, the fundamental interactions or fundamental forces are interactions in nature that appear not to be reducible to more basic interactions. There are four fundamental interactions known to exist: gravity, electromagnetism, weak interaction, and strong interaction. The gravitational and electromagnetic interactions produce long-range forces whose effects can be seen directly in everyday life. The strong and weak interactions produce forces at subatomic scales and govern nuclear interactions inside atoms. Some scientists hypothesize that a fifth force might exist, but these hypotheses remain speculative. \nEach of the known fundamental interactions can be described mathematically as a \"field\". The gravitational interaction is attributed to the curvature of spacetime, described by Einstein's general theory of relativity. The other three are discrete quantum fields, and their interactions are mediated by elementary particles described by the Standard Model of particle physics.\nWithin the Standard Model, the strong interaction is carried by a particle called the gluon and is responsible for quarks binding together to form hadrons, such as protons and neutrons. As a residual effect, it creates the nuclear force that binds the latter particles to form atomic nuclei. The weak interaction is carried by particles called W and Z bosons, and also acts on the nucleus of atoms, mediating radioactive decay. The electromagnetic force, carried by the photon, creates electric and magnetic fields, which are responsible for the attraction between orbital electrons and atomic nuclei which holds atoms together, as well as chemical bonding and electromagnetic waves, including visible light, and forms the basis for electrical technology. Although the electromagnetic force is far stronger than gravity, it tends to cancel itself out within large objects, so over large (astronomical) distances gravity tends to be the dominant force, and is responsible for holding together the large scale structures in the universe, such as planets, stars, and galaxies. The historical success of models that show relationships between fundamental interactions have led to efforts to go beyond the Standard Model and combine all four forces in to a theory of everything.\nHistory.\nClassical theory.\nIn his 1687 theory, Isaac Newton postulated space as an infinite and unalterable physical structure existing before, within, and around all objects while their states and relations unfold at a constant pace everywhere, thus absolute space and time. Inferring that all objects bearing mass approach at a constant rate, but collide by impact proportional to their masses, Newton inferred that matter exhibits an attractive force. His law of universal gravitation implied there to be instant interaction among all objects. As conventionally interpreted, Newton's theory of motion modelled a \"central force\" without a communicating medium. Thus Newton's theory violated the tradition, going back to Descartes, that there should be no action at a distance. Conversely, during the 1820s, when explaining magnetism, Michael Faraday inferred a \"field\" filling space and transmitting that force. Faraday conjectured that ultimately, all forces unified into one.\nIn 1873, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism as effects of an electromagnetic field whose third consequence was light, travelling at constant speed in vacuum. If his electromagnetic field theory held true in all inertial frames of reference, this would contradict Newton's theory of motion, which relied on Galilean relativity. If, instead, his field theory only applied to reference frames at rest relative to a mechanical luminiferous aether\u2014presumed to fill all space whether within matter or in vacuum and to manifest the electromagnetic field\u2014then it could be reconciled with Galilean relativity and Newton's laws. (However, such a \"Maxwell aether\" was later disproven; Newton's laws did, in fact, have to be replaced.)\nStandard Model.\nThe Standard Model of particle physics was developed throughout the latter half of the 20th century. In the Standard Model, the electromagnetic, strong, and weak interactions associate with elementary particles, whose behaviours are modelled in quantum mechanics (QM). For predictive success with QM's probabilistic outcomes, particle physics conventionally models QM events across a field set to special relativity, altogether relativistic quantum field theory (QFT). Force particles, called gauge bosons\u2014\"force carriers\" or \"messenger particles\" of underlying fields\u2014interact with matter particles, called fermions. \nEveryday matter is atoms, composed of three fermion types: up-quarks and down-quarks constituting, as well as electrons orbiting, the atom's nucleus. Atoms interact, form molecules, and manifest further properties through electromagnetic interactions among their electrons absorbing and emitting photons, the electromagnetic field's force carrier, which if unimpeded traverse potentially infinite distance. Electromagnetism's QFT is quantum electrodynamics (QED).\nThe force carriers of the weak interaction are the massive W and Z bosons. Electroweak theory (EWT) covers both electromagnetism and the weak interaction. At the high temperatures shortly after the Big Bang, the weak interaction, the electromagnetic interaction, and the Higgs boson were originally mixed components of a different set of ancient pre-symmetry-breaking fields. As the early universe cooled, these fields split into the long-range electromagnetic interaction, the short-range weak interaction, and the Higgs boson. In the Higgs mechanism, the Higgs field manifests Higgs bosons that interact with some quantum particles in a way that endows those particles with mass. The strong interaction, whose force carrier is the gluon, traversing minuscule distance among quarks, is modeled in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). EWT, QCD, and the Higgs mechanism comprise particle physics' Standard Model (SM). Predictions are usually made using calculational approximation methods, although such perturbation theory is inadequate to model some experimental observations (for instance bound states and solitons). Still, physicists widely accept the Standard Model as science's most experimentally confirmed theory.\nOverview of the fundamental interactions.\nIn the conceptual model of fundamental interactions, matter consists of fermions, which carry properties called charges and spin \u00b1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 (intrinsic angular momentum \u00b1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;\"\u0127\"\u20442, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant). They attract or repel each other by exchanging bosons.\nThe interaction of any pair of fermions in perturbation theory can then be modelled thus:\n Two fermions go in \u2192 \"interaction\" by boson exchange \u2192 two changed fermions go out.\nThe exchange of bosons always carries energy and momentum between the fermions, thereby changing their speed and direction. The exchange may also transport a charge between the fermions, changing the charges of the fermions in the process (e.g., turn them from one type of fermion to another). Since bosons carry one unit of angular momentum, the fermion's spin direction will flip from +&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 to \u2212&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 (or vice versa) during such an exchange (in units of the reduced Planck constant). Since such interactions result in a change in momentum, they can give rise to classical Newtonian forces. In quantum mechanics, physicists often use the terms \"force\" and \"interaction\" interchangeably; for example, the weak interaction is sometimes referred to as the \"weak force\".\nAccording to the present understanding, there are four fundamental interactions or forces: gravitation, electromagnetism, the weak interaction, and the strong interaction. Their magnitude and behaviour vary greatly, as described in the table below. Modern physics attempts to explain every observed physical phenomenon by these fundamental interactions.\nThe fundamental interactions can be compared using dimensionless coupling constants that characterize the intensity or \"strength\" of the interactions.\nThe modern (perturbative) quantum mechanical view of the fundamental forces other than gravity is that particles of matter (fermions) do not directly interact with each other, but rather carry a charge, and exchange virtual particles (gauge bosons), which are the interaction carriers or force mediators. For example, photons mediate the interaction of electric charges, and gluons mediate the interaction of color charges. The full theory includes perturbations beyond simply fermions exchanging bosons; these additional perturbations can involve bosons that exchange fermions, as well as the creation or destruction of particles: see Feynman diagrams for examples.\nInteractions.\nGravity.\n\"Gravitation\" is the weakest of the four interactions at the atomic scale, where electromagnetic interactions dominate.\nGravitation is the most important of the four fundamental forces for astronomical objects over astronomical distances for two reasons. First, gravitation has an infinite effective range, like electromagnetism but unlike the strong and weak interactions. Second, gravity always attracts and never repels; in contrast, astronomical bodies tend toward a near-neutral net electric charge, such that the attraction to one type of charge and the repulsion from the opposite charge mostly cancel each other out.\nEven though electromagnetism is far stronger than gravitation, electrostatic attraction is not relevant for large celestial bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies, simply because such bodies contain equal numbers of protons and electrons and so have a net electric charge of zero. Nothing \"cancels\" gravity, since it is only attractive, unlike electric forces which can be attractive or repulsive. On the other hand, all objects having mass are subject to the gravitational force, which only attracts. Therefore, only gravitation matters on the large-scale structure of the universe.\nThe long range of gravitation makes it responsible for such large-scale phenomena as the structure of galaxies and black holes and, being only attractive, it slows down the expansion of the universe. Gravitation also explains astronomical phenomena on more modest scales, such as planetary orbits, as well as everyday experience: objects fall; heavy objects act as if they were glued to the ground, and animals can only jump so high.\nGravitation was the first interaction to be described mathematically. In ancient times, Aristotle hypothesized that objects of different masses fall at different rates. During the Scientific Revolution, Galileo Galilei experimentally determined that this hypothesis was wrong under certain circumstances\u2014neglecting the friction due to air resistance and buoyancy forces if an atmosphere is present (e.g. the case of a dropped air-filled balloon vs a water-filled balloon), all objects accelerate toward the Earth at the same rate. Isaac Newton's law of Universal Gravitation (1687) was a good approximation of the behaviour of gravitation. Present-day understanding of gravitation stems from Einstein's General Theory of Relativity of 1915, a more accurate (especially for cosmological masses and distances) description of gravitation in terms of the geometry of spacetime.\nMerging general relativity and quantum mechanics (or quantum field theory) into a more general theory of quantum gravity is an area of active research. It is hypothesized that gravitation is mediated by a massless spin-2 particle called the graviton.\nAlthough general relativity has been experimentally confirmed (at least for weak fields, i.e. not black holes) on all but the smallest scales, there are alternatives to general relativity. These theories must reduce to general relativity in some limit, and the focus of observational work is to establish limits on what deviations from general relativity are possible.\nProposed extra dimensions could explain why the gravity force is so weak.\nElectroweak interaction.\nElectromagnetism and weak interaction appear to be very different at everyday low energies. They can be modeled using two different theories. However, above unification energy, on the order of 100 GeV, they would merge into a single electroweak force.\nThe electroweak theory is very important for modern cosmology, particularly on how the universe evolved. This is because shortly after the Big Bang, when the temperature was still above approximately 1015\u00a0K, the electromagnetic force and the weak force were still merged as a combined electroweak force.\nFor contributions to the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979.\nElectromagnetism.\nElectromagnetism is the force that acts between electrically charged particles. This phenomenon includes the electrostatic force acting between charged particles at rest, and the combined effect of electric and magnetic forces acting between charged particles moving relative to each other.\nElectromagnetism has an infinite range, as gravity does, but is vastly stronger. It is the force that binds electrons to atoms, and it holds molecules together. It is responsible for everyday phenomena like light, magnets, electricity, and friction. Electromagnetism fundamentally determines all macroscopic, and many atomic-level, properties of the chemical elements.\nIn a four kilogram (~1 gallon) jug of water, there is\nformula_1\nof total electron charge. Thus, if we place two such jugs a meter apart, the electrons in one of the jugs repel those in the other jug with a force of\nformula_2\nThis force is many times larger than the weight of the planet Earth. The atomic nuclei in one jug also repel those in the other with the same force. However, these repulsive forces are canceled by the attraction of the electrons in jug A with the nuclei in jug B and the attraction of the nuclei in jug A with the electrons in jug B, resulting in no net force. Electromagnetic forces are tremendously stronger than gravity, but tend to cancel out so that for astronomical-scale bodies, gravity dominates.\nElectrical and magnetic phenomena have been observed since ancient times, but it was only in the 19th century James Clerk Maxwell discovered that electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the same fundamental interaction. By 1864, Maxwell's equations had rigorously quantified this unified interaction. Maxwell's theory, restated using vector calculus, is the classical theory of electromagnetism, suitable for most technological purposes.\nThe constant speed of light in vacuum (customarily denoted with a lowercase letter \"c\") can be derived from Maxwell's equations, which are consistent with the theory of special relativity. Albert Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity, however, which follows from the observation that the speed of light is constant no matter how fast the observer is moving, showed that the theoretical result implied by Maxwell's equations has profound implications far beyond electromagnetism on the very nature of time and space.\nIn another work that departed from classical electro-magnetism, Einstein also explained the photoelectric effect by utilizing Max Planck's discovery that light was transmitted in 'quanta' of specific energy content based on the frequency, which we now call photons. Starting around 1927, Paul Dirac combined quantum mechanics with the relativistic theory of electromagnetism. Further work in the 1940s, by Richard Feynman, Freeman Dyson, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, completed this theory, which is now called quantum electrodynamics, the revised theory of electromagnetism. Quantum electrodynamics and quantum mechanics provide a theoretical basis for electromagnetic behavior such as quantum tunneling, in which a certain percentage of electrically charged particles move in ways that would be impossible under the classical electromagnetic theory, that is necessary for everyday electronic devices such as transistors to function.\nWeak interaction.\nThe \"weak interaction\" or \"weak nuclear force\" is responsible for some nuclear phenomena such as beta decay. Electromagnetism and the weak force are now understood to be two aspects of a unified electroweak interaction \u2014 this discovery was the first step toward the unified theory known as the Standard Model. In the theory of the electroweak interaction, the carriers of the weak force are the massive gauge bosons called the W and Z bosons. The weak interaction is the only known interaction that does not conserve parity; it is left\u2013right asymmetric. The weak interaction even violates CP symmetry but does conserve CPT.\nStrong interaction.\nThe \"strong interaction\", or \"strong nuclear force\", is the most complicated interaction, mainly because of the way it varies with distance. The nuclear force is powerfully attractive between nucleons at distances of about 1 femtometre (fm, or 10\u221215 metres), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5 fm. At distances less than 0.7 fm, the nuclear force becomes repulsive. This repulsive component is responsible for the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows.\nAfter the nucleus was discovered in 1908, it was clear that a new force, today known as the nuclear force, was needed to overcome the electrostatic repulsion, a manifestation of electromagnetism, of the positively charged protons. Otherwise, the nucleus could not exist. Moreover, the force had to be strong enough to squeeze the protons into a volume whose diameter is about 10\u221215 m, much smaller than that of the entire atom. From the short range of this force, Hideki Yukawa predicted that it was associated with a massive force particle, whose mass is approximately 100 MeV.\nThe 1947 discovery of the pion ushered in the modern era of particle physics. Hundreds of hadrons were discovered from the 1940s to 1960s, and an extremely complicated theory of hadrons as strongly interacting particles was developed. Most notably:\nWhile each of these approaches offered insights, no approach led directly to a fundamental theory.\nMurray Gell-Mann along with George Zweig first proposed fractionally charged quarks in 1961. Throughout the 1960s, different authors considered theories similar to the modern fundamental theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as simple models for the interactions of quarks. The first to hypothesize the gluons of QCD were Moo-Young Han and Yoichiro Nambu, who introduced the quark color charge. Han and Nambu hypothesized that it might be associated with a force-carrying field. At that time, however, it was difficult to see how such a model could permanently confine quarks. Han and Nambu also assigned each quark color an integer electrical charge, so that the quarks were fractionally charged only on average, and they did not expect the quarks in their model to be permanently confined.\nIn 1971, Murray Gell-Mann and Harald Fritzsch proposed that the Han/Nambu color gauge field was the correct theory of the short-distance interactions of fractionally charged quarks. A little later, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, and David Politzer discovered that this theory had the property of asymptotic freedom, allowing them to make contact with experimental evidence. They concluded that QCD was the complete theory of the strong interactions, correct at all distance scales. The discovery of asymptotic freedom led most physicists to accept QCD since it became clear that even the long-distance properties of the strong interactions could be consistent with experiment if the quarks are permanently confined: the strong force increases indefinitely with distance, trapping quarks inside the hadrons.\nAssuming that quarks are confined, Mikhail Shifman, Arkady Vainshtein and Valentine Zakharov were able to compute the properties of many low-lying hadrons directly from QCD, with only a few extra parameters to describe the vacuum. In 1980, Kenneth G. Wilson published computer calculations based on the first principles of QCD, establishing, to a level of confidence tantamount to certainty, that QCD will confine quarks. Since then, QCD has been the established theory of strong interactions.\nQCD is a theory of fractionally charged quarks interacting by means of 8 bosonic particles called gluons. The gluons also interact with each other, not just with the quarks, and at long distances the lines of force collimate into strings, loosely modeled by a linear potential, a constant attractive force. In this way, the mathematical theory of QCD not only explains how quarks interact over short distances but also the string-like behavior, discovered by Chew and Frautschi, which they manifest over longer distances.\nHiggs interaction.\nConventionally, the Higgs interaction is not counted among the four fundamental forces.\nNonetheless, although not a gauge interaction nor generated by any diffeomorphism symmetry, the Higgs field's cubic Yukawa coupling produces a weakly attractive fifth interaction. After spontaneous symmetry breaking via the Higgs mechanism, Yukawa terms remain of the form\n formula_3,\nwith Yukawa coupling formula_4, particle mass formula_5 (in eV), and Higgs vacuum expectation value . Hence coupled particles can exchange a virtual Higgs boson, yielding classical potentials of the form\n formula_6,\nwith Higgs mass . Because the reduced Compton wavelength of the Higgs boson is so small (, comparable to the W and Z bosons), this potential has an effective range of a few attometers. Between two electrons, it begins roughly 1011 times weaker than the weak interaction, and grows exponentially weaker at non-zero distances.\nUnification.\nThe fundamental forces may become unified into a single force at very high energies and on a minuscule scale, the Planck scale. Particle accelerators cannot produce the enormous energies required to experimentally probe this regime. The weak and electromagnetic forces have already been unified with the electroweak theory of Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, for which they received the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. \nNumerous theoretical efforts have been made to systematize the existing four fundamental interactions on the model of electroweak unification.\nGrand Unified Theories (GUTs) are proposals to show that each of the three fundamental interactions described by the Standard Model is a different manifestation of a single interaction with symmetries that break down and create separate interactions below some extremely high level of energy. GUTs are also expected to predict some of the relationships between constants of nature that the Standard Model treats as unrelated and gauge coupling unification for the relative strengths of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. (GUT). Some attempts at GUTs hypothesize \"shadow\" particles, such that every known matter particle associates with an undiscovered force particle, and vice versa, altogether supersymmetry (SUSY). Other theorists seek to quantize the gravitational field by the modelling behaviour of its hypothetical force carrier, the graviton and achieve quantum gravity (QG). One approach to QG is loop quantum gravity (LQG). Still other theorists seek both QG and GUT within one framework, reducing all four fundamental interactions to a Theory of Everything (ToE). The most prevalent aim at a ToE is string theory, although to model matter particles, it added SUSY to force particles\u2014and so, strictly speaking, became superstring theory. Multiple, seemingly disparate superstring theories were unified on a backbone, M-theory. Theories beyond the Standard Model remain highly speculative, lacking great experimental support.\nA so-called theory of everything, which would integrate GUTs with a quantum gravity theory, faces a greater barrier because no quantum gravity theory (e.g., string theory, loop quantum gravity, and twistor theory) has secured wide acceptance. Some theories look for a graviton to complete the Standard Model list of force-carrying particles, while others, like loop quantum gravity, emphasize the possibility that time-space itself may have a quantum aspect to it.\nBeyond the Standard Model.\nSome theories beyond the Standard Model include a hypothetical fifth force, and the search for such a force is an ongoing line of experimental physics research. In supersymmetric theories, some particles, known as moduli, acquire their masses only through supersymmetry breaking effects and can mediate new forces. Another reason to look for new forces is the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (also known as dark energy), creating a need to explain a nonzero cosmological constant and possibly other modifications of general relativity. Fifth forces have also been suggested to explain phenomena such as CP violations, dark matter, and dark flow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is enclosed in a square or nearly square plastic shell lined with fabric to help remove dust from the spinning disk. Floppy disks store digital data, which can be read or written when inserted into a floppy disk drive (FDD) connected to or built into a computer or other device. The three most popular formats of floppy disks (and their drives) are the 8-inch, 5\u00bc-inch, and 3\u00bd-inch versions.\nThe first floppy disks, invented and made by IBM in 1971, had a disk diameter of . Subsequently, the 5\u00bc-inch (130 mm) and then the 3\u00bd-inch (90 mm) became a ubiquitous form of data storage and transfer into the first years of the 21st century. By the end of the 1980s, 5\u00bc-inch disks had been superseded by 3\u00bd-inch disks. During this time, PCs frequently came equipped with drives of both sizes. By the mid-1990s, 5\u00bc-inch drives had virtually disappeared, as the 3\u00bd-inch disk became the predominant floppy disk. The advantages of the 3\u00bd-inch disk were its higher capacity, its smaller physical size, and its rigid case which provided better protection from dirt and other environmental risks.\nFloppy disks were so common in late 20th-century culture that many electronic and software programs continue to use save icons that look like floppy disks well into the 21st century, as a form of skeuomorphic design. While floppy disk drives still have some limited uses, especially with legacy industrial computer equipment, they have been superseded by data storage methods with much greater data storage capacity and data transfer speed, such as USB flash drives, memory cards, optical discs, and storage available through local computer networks and cloud storage.\nCategories.\nIndustry observers categorize floppy disks and floppy disk drives according to size and capacity with four major categories being 8-inch, 5\u00bc-inch, 3\u00bd-inch and high-capacity floppy disks and floppy disk drives.\nThere were in addition variant products that did not fit these categories. The distinguishing characteristic between the high-capacity products and their lower capacity brethren, frequently categorized as standard floppies was the use of servomechanisms to increase the number of tracks and thereby increase capacity.\nThe four categories each represented generations, from the beginning each generation had substantially greater market success from the previous and it ultimately succeeded the previous one, but the high-capacity floppy generation although having some success was never as successful as the prior 3\u00bd-inch generation and become essentially obsolete by 2011\nWhile the original IBM 8-inch disk was actually so defined, the other sizes are defined in the metric system, their usual names being but rough approximations.\nDifferent sizes of floppy disks are mechanically incompatible, and disks can fit only one size of drive. Drive assemblies with both 3\u00bd-inch and 5\u00bc-inch slots were available during the transition period between the sizes, but they contained two separate drive mechanisms. In addition, there are many subtle, usually software-driven incompatibilities between the two. 5\u00bc-inch disks formatted for use with Apple II computers would be unreadable and treated as unformatted on a Commodore, As computer platforms began to form, attempts were made at interchangeability. Apple's later 1.44 MB high-density 3\u00bd-inch drives (marketed as the SuperDrive) could read, write, and format IBM PC\u2013compatible floppy disks. However, few IBM-compatible computers were able to read or write Apple-formatted floppy disks. The limitation was due not to the 3\u00bd-inch drive mechanism itself, but to the disk controller and its lack of support for Apple's GCR (Group Coded Recording) encoding used on 400 kB and 800 kB Macintosh disks.\n8-inch, 5\u00bc-inch and 3\u00bd-inch drives were manufactured in a variety of sizes, most to fit standardized drive bays. Alongside the common disk sizes were non-classical sizes for specialized systems.\nHistory.\n8-inch.\nThe first commercial floppy disks, developed in the late 1960s, were in diameter; they became commercially available in 1971 as a component of IBM products and both drives and disks were then sold separately starting in 1972 by Memorex and others. These disks and associated drives were produced and improved upon by IBM and other companies such as Memorex, Shugart Associates, and Burroughs Corporation. The term \"floppy disk\" appeared in print as early as 1970, and although IBM announced its first media as the \"Type 1 Diskette\" in 1973, the industry continued to use the terms \"floppy disk\" or \"floppy\".\nFloppy disks of the first standard are 8 inches in diameter, protected by a flexible plastic jacket. It was a read-only device used by IBM as a way of loading microcode. Read/write floppy disks and their drives became available in 1972, but it was IBM's 1973 introduction of the 3740 data entry system that began the establishment of floppy disks, called by IBM the \"Diskette 1\", as an industry standard for information interchange. Diskettes formatted for this system stored 242,944 bytes. Early microcomputers used for engineering, business, or word processing often used one or more 8-inch disk drives for removable storage; the CP/M operating system was developed for microcomputers with 8-inch drives.\nThe family of 8-inch disks and drives increased over time and later versions could store up to 1.2\u00a0MB; many microcomputer applications did not need that much capacity on one disk, so a smaller size disk with lower-cost media and drives was feasible. The 5\u00bc-inch drive succeeded the 8-inch size in many applications, and developed to the same storage capacity as the larger 8-inch size, using higher-density media and recording techniques.\n5\u00bc-inch.\nIn 1976, Shugart Associates introduced the 5\u00bc-inch floppy disk drive. By 1978, there were more than ten manufacturers producing such drives. There were competing floppy disk formats, with hard- and soft-sector versions and encoding schemes such as differential Manchester encoding (DM), modified frequency modulation (MFM), M2FM and group coded recording (GCR). The 5\u00bc-inch format displaced the 8-inch one for most uses, and the hard-sectored disk format disappeared. The most common capacity of the 5\u00bc-inch format in DOS-based PCs was 360\u00a0KB (368,640 bytes) for the Double-Sided Double-Density (DSDD) format using MFM encoding.\nIn 1984, IBM introduced with its PC/AT the 1.2\u00a0MB (1,228,800 bytes) dual-sided 5\u00bc-inch floppy disk, but it never became very popular. IBM started using the 720\u00a0KB double density 3\u00bd-inch microfloppy disk on its Convertible laptop computer in 1986 and the 1.44\u00a0MB (1,474,560 bytes) high-density version with the IBM Personal System/2 (PS/2) line in 1987. These disk drives could be added to older PC models. In 1988, Y-E Data introduced a drive for 2.88\u00a0MB Double-Sided Extended-Density (DSED) diskettes which was used by IBM in its top-of-the-line PS/2 and some RS/6000 models and in the second-generation NeXTcube and NeXTstation; however, this format had limited market success due to lack of standards and movement to 1.44 MB drives.\nThroughout the early 1980s, limits of the 5\u00bc-inch format became clear. Originally designed to be more practical than the 8-inch format, it was becoming considered too large; as the quality of recording media grew, data could be stored in a smaller area. Several solutions were developed, with drives at 2-, 2\u00bd-, 3-, 3\u00bc-, 3\u00bd- and 4-inches (and Sony's disk) offered by various companies. They all had several advantages over the old format, including a rigid case with a sliding metal (or later, sometimes plastic) shutter over the head slot, which helped protect the delicate magnetic medium from dust and damage, and a sliding write protection tab, which was far more convenient than the adhesive tabs used with earlier disks. The established market for the 5\u00bc-inch format made it difficult for these mutually incompatible new formats to gain significant market share. A variant on the Sony design, introduced in 1983 by many manufacturers, was then rapidly adopted. By 1988, the 3\u00bd-inch was outselling the 5\u00bc-inch.\nThe head gap of an 80\u2011track high-density (1.2\u00a0MB in the MFM format) 5\u00bc\u2011inch drive (a.k.a. \"mini diskette\", \"Mini disk\", or \"Minifloppy\") is smaller than that of a 40\u2011track double-density (360\u00a0KB if double-sided) drive but can also format, read and write 40\u2011track disks provided the controller supports double stepping or has a switch to do so. A blank 40\u2011track disk formatted and written on an 80\u2011track drive can be taken to its native drive without problems, and a disk formatted on a 40\u2011track drive can be used on an 80\u2011track drive. Disks written on a 40\u2011track drive and then updated on an 80 track drive become unreadable on any 40\u2011track drives due to track width incompatibility.\nSingle-sided disks were coated on both sides. The reason usually given for the higher price was that double sided disks were certified error-free on both sides of the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.\n3\u00bd-inch.\nIn the early 1980s, many manufacturers introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats. A consortium of 21 companies eventually settled on a 3\u00bd-inch design known as the \"Micro diskette\", \"Micro disk\", or \"Micro floppy\", similar to a Sony design but improved to support both single-sided and double-sided media, with formatted capacities generally of 360\u00a0KB and 720\u00a0KB respectively. Single-sided drives of the consortium design first shipped in 1983, and double-sided in 1984. The double-sided, high-density 1.44\u00a0MB (actually 1440\u00a0KiB = 1.41\u00a0MiB or 1.47 MB) disk drive, which would become the most popular, first shipped in 1986. The first Macintosh computers used single-sided 3\u00bd-inch floppy disks, but with 400\u00a0KB formatted capacity. These were followed in 1986 by double-sided 800\u00a0KB floppies. The higher capacity was achieved at the same recording density by varying the disk-rotation speed with head position so that the linear speed of the disk was closer to constant. Later Macs could also read and write 1.44\u00a0MB HD disks in PC format with fixed rotation speed. Higher capacities were similarly achieved by Acorn's RISC OS (800\u00a0KB for DD, 1,600\u00a0KB for HD) and AmigaOS (880\u00a0KB for DD, 1,760\u00a0KB for HD).\nMost 3\u00bd-inch disks have a rectangular hole in one corner which, if obstructed, write-enables the disk. A sliding detented piece can be moved to block or reveal the part of the rectangular hole that is sensed by the drive. The HD 1.44 MB disks have a second, unobstructed hole in the opposite corner that identifies them as being of that capacity.\nIn IBM-compatible PCs, higher-density 3\u00bd-inch floppy drives can read lower-density media, but writing and formatting across densities has reliability issues and was not officially supported by manufacturers. Writing at different densities than those at which disks were intended, sometimes by altering the density detection hole, was possible but not supported by manufacturers. A hole on one side of a 3\u00bd-inch disk can be altered to make some disk drives and operating systems treat the disk as one of higher or lower density, for bidirectional compatibility or economic reasons. Some computers, such as the PS/2 and Acorn Archimedes, ignored these holes altogether.\nGenerally, the term floppy disk persisted, even though later style floppy disks have a rigid case around an internal floppy disk.\nHigh-capacity.\nA number of attempts were made by various companies to introduce newer floppy-disk formats, frequently characterized as a \"super floppy,\" with many based on the standard 3\u00bd-inch physical form while offering much higher capacity. Many of these products provide the ability to read and write standard DD and HD disks. None of these ever reached the point where it could be assumed that every current PC would have one, and they were later largely replaced first by optical disc burners and then by flash storage. \nIn 1990, an attempt was made to standardize details for a 20MB 3\u00bd-inch format floppy. At the time, \"three different technologies that are not interchangeable\" existed. One major goal was that the to-be-developed standard drive be backward compatible: that it be able to read 720 KB and 1.44 MB floppies.\nVariants.\nOther smaller floppy sizes were proposed, especially for portable or pocket-sized devices that needed a smaller storage device.\nNone of these sizes achieved much market success.\nObsolescence.\nIn the mid-1990s, mechanically incompatible higher-density floppy disks were introduced, like the Iomega Zip disk. Adoption was limited by the competition between proprietary formats and the need to buy expensive drives for computers where the disks would be used. In some cases, failure in market penetration was exacerbated by the release of higher-capacity versions of the drive and media being not backward-compatible with the original drives, dividing the users between new and old adopters. Consumers were wary of making costly investments into unproven and rapidly changing technologies, so none of the technologies became the established standard.\nApple introduced the iMac G3 in 1998 with a CD-ROM drive but no floppy drive; this made USB-connected floppy drives popular accessories, as the iMac came without any writable removable media device.\nRecordable CDs were touted as an alternative, because of the greater capacity, compatibility with existing CD-ROM drives, and\u2014with the advent of re-writeable CDs and packet writing\u2014a similar reusability as floppy disks. However, CD-R/RWs remained mostly an archival medium, not a medium for exchanging data or editing files on the medium itself, because there was no common standard for packet writing which allowed for small updates. Other formats, such as magneto-optical discs, had the flexibility of floppy disks combined with greater capacity, but remained niche due to costs. High-capacity backward compatible floppy technologies became popular for a while and were sold as an option or even included in standard PCs, but in the long run, their use was limited to professionals and enthusiasts.\nFlash-based USB thumb drives finally provided a practical and popular replacement that supported traditional file systems and all common usage scenarios of floppy disks. As opposed to other solutions, no new drive type or special software was required that impeded adoption, since all that was necessary was an already common USB port.\nUsage in the 21st century.\nIn 2002, most manufacturers still provided floppy disk drives as standard equipment to meet user demand for file transfer and an emergency boot device, as well as for the general secure feeling of having the familiar device. By this time, the retail cost of a floppy drive had fallen to around $20 (), so there was little financial incentive to omit the device from a system. Subsequently, enabled by the widespread support for USB flash drives and BIOS boot, manufacturers and retailers progressively reduced the availability of floppy disk drives as standard equipment. In February 2003, Dell, one of the leading personal computer vendors, announced that floppy drives would no longer be pre-installed on Dell Dimension home computers, although they were still available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket OEM add-on. By January 2007, only 2% of computers sold in stores contained built-in floppy disk drives.\nFloppy disks are used for emergency boots in aging systems lacking support for other bootable media and for BIOS updates, since most BIOS and firmware programs can still be executed from bootable floppy disks. If BIOS updates fail or become corrupt, floppy drives can sometimes be used to perform a recovery. The music and theatre industries still use equipment requiring standard floppy disks (e.g. synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, sequencers, and lighting consoles). Industrial automation equipment such as programmable machinery and industrial robots may not have a USB interface; data and programs are then loaded from disks, damageable in industrial environments. This equipment may not be replaced due to cost or requirement for continuous availability; existing software emulation and virtualization do not solve this problem because a customized operating system is used that has no drivers for USB devices. Hardware floppy disk emulators can be made to interface floppy-disk controllers to a USB port that can be used for flash drives.\nIn May 2016, the United States Government Accountability Office released a report that covered the need to upgrade or replace legacy computer systems within federal agencies. According to this document, old IBM Series/1 minicomputers running on 8-inch floppy disks are still used to coordinate \"the operational functions of the United States' nuclear forces\". The government planned to update some of the technology by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. The update was completed in June 2019.\nUse in Japan's government ended in 2024.\nWindows 10 and Windows 11 no longer come with drivers for floppy disk drives (both internal and external). However, they will still support them with a separate device driver provided by Microsoft.\nThe British Airways Boeing 747-400 fleet, up to its retirement in 2020, used 3\u00bd-inch floppy disks to load avionics software.\nSony, who had been in the floppy disk business since 1983, ended domestic sales of all six 3\u00bd-inch floppy disk models as of March 2011. This has been viewed by some as the end of the floppy disk. While production of new floppy disk media has ceased, sales and uses of this media from inventories is expected to continue until at least 2026.\nStructure.\n8-inch and 5\u00bc-inch disks.\nThe 8-inch and 5\u00bc-inch floppy disks contain a magnetically coated round plastic medium with a large circular hole in the center for a drive's spindle. The medium is contained in a square plastic cover that has a small oblong opening in both sides to allow the drive's heads to read and write data and a large hole in the center to allow the magnetic medium to spin by rotating it from its middle hole.\nInside the cover are two layers of fabric with the magnetic medium sandwiched in the middle. The fabric is designed to reduce friction between the medium and the outer cover, and catch particles of debris abraded off the disk to keep them from accumulating on the heads. The cover is usually a one-part sheet, double-folded with flaps glued or spot-welded together.\nA small notch on the side of the disk identifies whether it is writable, as detected by a mechanical switch or photoelectric sensor. In the 8-inch disk, the notch being covered or not present enables writing, while in the 5\u00bc-inch disk, the notch being present and uncovered enables writing. Tape may be used over the notch to change the mode of the disk. Punch devices were sold to convert read-only 5\u00bc\" disks to writable ones, and also to enable writing on the unused side of single-sided disks for computers with single-sided drives. The latter worked because single- and double-sided disks typically contained essentially identical actual magnetic media, for manufacturing efficiency. Disks whose obverse and reverse sides were thus used separately in single-sided drives were known as flippy disks. Disk notching 5\u00bc\" floppies for PCs was generally only required where users wanted to overwrite original 5\u00bc\" disks of store-bought software, which somewhat commonly shipped with no notch present.\nAnother LED/photo-transistor pair located near the center of the disk detects the \"index hole\" once per rotation in the magnetic disk. Detection occurs whenever the drive's sensor, the holes in the correctly inserted floppy's plastic envelope and a single hole in the rotating floppy disk medium line up. This mechanism is used to detect the angular start of each track, and whether or not the disk is rotating at the correct speed. Early 8\u2011inch and 5\u00bc\u2011inch disks also had holes for each sector in the enclosed magnetic medium, in addition to the index hole, with the same radial distance from the center, for alignment with the same envelope hole. These were termed \"hard sectored\" disks. Later \"soft-sectored\" disks have only one index hole in the medium, and sector position is determined by the disk controller or low-level software from patterns marking the start of a sector. Generally, the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks, with only the disks and controllers differing. Some operating systems using soft sectors, such as Apple DOS, do not use the index hole, and the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor; this was mainly a hardware cost-saving measure.\n3\u00bd-inch disk.\nThe core of the 3\u00bd-inch disk is the same as the other two disks, but the front has only a label and a small opening for reading and writing data, protected by the shutter\u2014a spring-loaded metal or plastic cover, pushed to the side on entry into the drive. Rather than having a hole in the center, it has a metal hub which mates to the spindle of the drive. \nTypical 3\u00bd-inch disk magnetic coating materials are:\nTwo holes at the bottom left and right indicate whether the disk is write-protected and whether it is high-density; these holes are spaced as far apart as the holes in punched A4 paper, allowing write-protected high-density floppy disks to be clipped into international standard (ISO 838) ring binders\nOne of the chief usability problems of the floppy disk is its vulnerability; even inside a closed plastic housing, the disk medium is highly sensitive to dust, condensation and temperature extremes. As with all magnetic storage, it is vulnerable to magnetic fields. Blank disks have been distributed with an extensive set of warnings, cautioning the user not to expose it to dangerous conditions. Rough treatment or removing the disk from the drive while the magnetic media is still spinning is likely to cause damage to the disk, drive head, or stored data. On the other hand, the 3\u00bd\u2011inch floppy disk has been lauded for its mechanical usability by human\u2013computer interaction expert Donald Norman:\nHigh-capacity disks.\nThe main technological change for the higher-capacity formats was the addition of tracking information on the disk surface to allow the read/write heads to be positioned more accurately. Most earlier generations of floppy disks have no such information, so the drives use open loop positioning by a stepper motor in order to position their heads over the desired track. For good interoperability of disks among drives, this requires precise alignment of the drive heads to a reference standard, somewhat similar to the alignment required to get the best performance out of an audio tape deck. The newer systems generally use position information on the surfaces of the disk to find the tracks, allowing the track width to be greatly reduced.\nThe following summarizes specific structural differences in the several high-capacity FDs with more details contained in linked articles:\nThe Floptical drive can read from and write 720 KB and 1.44 MB 3\u00bd-inch disks and uses infra-red LED to position the heads over marks in the disk surface to achieve a capacity of 21 MB on its high-capacity floppy disks. The drives are attached to the system using the SCSI interface instead of the usual floppy controller interface. It is considered to be the first actual super floppy. and its technology was licensed to a number of companies, who introduced compatible devices as well as even larger-capacity formats. The most popular of these, by far, was the LS-120.\nThe Brier Flextra BR3020 announced at 21.4\u00a0MB could read and write 720 KB and 1.44 MB 3\u00bd-inch disks.\n Physically both the media and cartridge were slightly larger but similar to other 3\u00bd-inch media and cartridges. A linear actuator positioned flying heads over high-capacity media that started at 100 MB and grew to 700 MB. It was offered in a variety of interfaces including PATA.\nLS, for LASER-servo, uses a LED to generate light that allows the drive to align its heads on high capacity FD media, initially at 120 MB and subsequently at 240 MB. The drive read and write 3\u00bd-inch 1,440 KB floppy disks, and some versions of the drive can write 32 MB onto a 3\u00bd-inch 1,440 kB disk albeit not to reliably. It was offered in a variety of interfaces including PATA.\n Structurally similar to the Floptical and initially at 150MB, it was removed from the market and subsequently reintroduced at 200\u00a0MB\n Structurally similar to the Floptical it provides 144 MB of storage and is capable reading and writing 720 KB and 1.44 MB 3\u00bd-inch disks.\nVariants.\nIn addition to the four generations of floppy disks and drives covered in this article there were various other floppy disks (and drives) offered, some were failed attempts to establish a standard for a generation while others were for special applications.\nOperation.\nA spindle motor in the drive rotates the magnetic medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write heads radially along the surface of the disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5\u00bc-inch) or disk insertion was complete (3\u00bd-inch). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller, which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.\nFormatting.\nA blank unformatted diskette has a coating of magnetic oxide with no magnetic order to the particles. During formatting, the magnetizations of the particles are aligned forming tracks, each broken up into sectors, enabling the controller to properly read and write data. The tracks are concentric rings around the center, with spaces between tracks where no data is written; gaps with padding bytes are provided between the sectors and at the end of the track to allow for slight speed variations in the disk drive, and to permit better interoperability with disk drives connected to other similar systems. Each sector of data has a header that identifies the sector location on the disk. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is written into the sector headers and at the end of the user data so that the disk controller can detect potential errors.\nSome errors are soft and can be resolved by re-trying the read operation; other errors are permanent and will signal a failure to the operating system if multiple attempts to read the data still fail\nInsertion and ejection.\nAfter a disk is inserted, a catch or lever mechanism engages to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle clamping hub, and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media\nIn some 5\u00bc-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal\nNewer 5\u00bc-inch drives and all 3\u00bd-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button\nOn Macintosh computers with built-in 3\u00bd-inch disk drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation. The X68000 has soft-eject 5\u00bc-inch drives. Some late-generation IBM PS/2 machines have soft-eject 3\u00bd-inch disk drives as well for which PC DOS 5.02 and higher includes an codice_1 command.\nFinding track zero.\nBefore a disk can be accessed, the drive needs to synchronize its head position with the disk tracks. In either case, the head is moved so that it is approaching track zero position of the disk. When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero, the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned. Drives without a sensor such as the Apple II mechanism attempt to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero, knowing that once this motion is complete, the head will be positioned over track zero. This physical striking is responsible for drive clicking during the boot and when disk errors occurred and track zero synchronization was attempted.\nFinding sectors.\nAll 8-inch and some 5\u00bc-inch drives use methods to locate sectors, known as either hard sectors or soft sectors, with the small hole in the jacket, off to the side of the spindle hole, used for timing reference. A light beam sensor detects when a punched hole in the disk is visible through the hole in the jacket. For a soft-sectored disk, there is only a single hole, which is used to locate the first sector of each track. For a hard-sectored disk, there are many holes, one for each sector row, plus an additional hole in a half-sector position, that is used to indicate sector zero.\nThe Apple II computer system is notable in that it does not have an index-hole sensor and ignores the presence of hard or soft sectoring. Instead, it uses special repeating data synchronization patterns written to the disk between each sector, to assist the computer in finding and synchronizing with the data in each track.\nMost 3\u00bd-inch drives use a constant speed drive motor and contain the same number of sectors across all tracks. This is sometimes referred to as constant angular velocity. In order to fit more data onto a disk, some 3\u00bd-inch drives (notably the Macintosh External 400K and 800K drives) instead use constant linear velocity, which uses a variable-speed drive motor that spins more slowly as the head moves away from the center of the disk, maintaining the same speed of the head(s) relative to the surface(s) of the disk. This allows more sectors to be written to the longer middle and outer tracks as the track length increases.\nHistorical sequence of floppy disk formats.\nFloppy disk size is often referred to in inches, even in countries using metric and though the size is defined in metric. The ANSI specification of 3\u00bd-inch disks is entitled in part \"90 mm (3.5-inch)\" though 90\u00a0mm is closer to 3.54\u00a0inches. Formatted capacities are generally set in terms of kilobytes and megabytes.\nData is generally written to floppy disks in sectors (angular blocks) and tracks (concentric rings at a constant radius). For example, the HD format of 3\u00bd-inch floppy disks uses 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track, 80 tracks per side and two sides, for a total of 1,474,560 bytes per disk. Some disk controllers can vary these parameters at the user's request, increasing storage on the disk, although they may not be able to be read on machines with other controllers. For example, Microsoft applications were often distributed on 3\u00bd-inch 1.68 MB DMF disks formatted with 21 sectors instead of 18; they could still be recognized by a standard controller. Constant linear velocity was generally not used on floppy disks, so most computer systems used constant angular velocity (CAV) format, with the disk spinning at a constant speed and the sectors holding the same amount of information on each track regardless of radial location. A notable exception was Apple, which implemented CLV in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400 KB of storage per side and an extra 80 KB on a double-sided disk.\nBecause the sectors have constant angular size, the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more near the disk's center. A more space-efficient technique would be to increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk, from 18 to 30 for instance, thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector; an example is zone bit recording. Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400\u00a0KB of storage per side and an extra 80\u00a0KB on a double-sided disk. This higher capacity came with a disadvantage: the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry, meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers. Apple eventually reverted to constant angular velocity on HD floppy disks with their later machines, still unique to Apple as they supported the older variable-speed formats.\nDisk formatting is usually done by a utility program supplied by the computer OS manufacturer; generally, it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as \"bad sectors\") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time-consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk does not include the sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity (for example, 2\u00a0MB for a standard 3\u00bd-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. DMF was introduced permitting 1.68\u00a0MB to fit onto an otherwise standard 3\u00bd-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.\nMixtures of decimal prefixes and binary sector sizes require care to properly calculate total capacity. For example, 1.44 MB 3\u00bd-inch HD disks have the \"M\" prefix peculiar to their context, coming from their capacity of 2,880 512-byte sectors (1,440 KiB), consistent with neither a decimal megabyte nor a binary mebibyte (MiB). Hence, these disks hold 1.47 MB or 1.41 MiB. Usable data capacity is a function of the disk format used, which in turn is determined by the FDD controller and its settings. Differences between such formats can result in capacities ranging from approximately 1,300 to 1,760 KiB (1.80 MB) on a standard 3\u00bd-inch high-density floppy (and up to nearly 2 MB with utilities such as 2M/2MGUI). The highest capacity techniques require much tighter matching of drive head geometry between drives, something not always possible and unreliable. For example, the LS-240 drive supports a 32 MB capacity on standard 3\u00bd-inch HD disks, but this is a write-once technique, and requires its own drive.\nThe raw maximum transfer rate of 3\u00bd-inch ED floppy drives (2.88 MB) is nominally 1,000 kilobits/s, or approximately 83% that of single-speed CD-ROM (71% of audio CD). This represents the speed of raw data bits moving under the read head; however, the effective speed is somewhat less due to space used for headers, gaps and other format fields and can be even further reduced by delays to seek between tracks.\nAdoption and usage.\nFloppy disks became commonplace during the 1980s and 1990s in their use with personal computers to distribute software, transfer data, and create backups. Before hard disks became affordable to the general population, floppy disks were often used to store a computer's operating system (OS). Most home computers from that time have an elementary OS and BASIC stored in read-only memory (ROM), with the option of loading a more advanced OS from a floppy disk.\nBy the early 1990s, the increasing software size meant large packages like Windows or Adobe Photoshop required a dozen disks or more. In 1996, there were an estimated five billion standard floppy disks in use.\nAn attempt to enhance the existing 3\u00bd-inch designs was the SuperDisk in the late 1990s, using very narrow data tracks and a high precision head guidance mechanism with a capacity of 120 MB and backward-compatibility with standard 3\u00bd-inch floppies; a format war briefly occurred between SuperDisk and other high-density floppy-disk products, although ultimately recordable CDs/DVDs, solid-state flash storage, and eventually cloud-based online storage would render all these removable disk formats obsolete. External USB-based floppy disk drives are still available, and many modern systems provide firmware support for booting from such drives.\nLegacy.\nFor more than two decades, the floppy disk was the primary external writable storage device used. Most computing environments before the 1990s were non-networked, and floppy disks were the primary means to transfer data between computers, a method known informally as sneakernet. Unlike hard disks, floppy disks were handled and seen; even a novice user could identify a floppy disk. Because of these factors, a picture of a 3\u00bd-inch floppy disk became an interface metaphor for saving data. As of 2024[ [update]], the floppy disk symbol is still used by software on user-interface elements related to saving files even though physical floppy disks are largely obsolete. Examples of such software include LibreOffice, Microsoft Paint, and WordPad.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of three primary disciplines: foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e, and sabre (also spelled \"saber\"), each with its own blade and set of rules. Most competitive fencers specialise in one of these disciplines. The modern sport gained prominence near the end of the 19th century, evolving from historical European swordsmanship. The Italian school altered the historical European martial art of classical fencing, and the French school later refined that system. Scoring points in a fencing competition is done by making contact with the opponent with one's sword.\nThe 1904 Olympic Games featured a fourth discipline of fencing known as singlestick, but it was dropped after that year and is not a part of modern fencing. Competitive fencing was one of the first sports to be featured in the Olympics and, along with athletics, cycling, swimming, and gymnastics, has been featured in every modern Olympics.\nCompetitive fencing.\nGoverning body.\nFencing is governed by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale d'Escrime (FIE), headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland. The FIE is composed of 155 national federations, each of which is recognised by its state Olympic Committee as the sole representative of Olympic-style fencing in that country.\nRules.\nThe FIE maintains the current rules used by major international events, including world cups, world championships and the Olympic Games. The FIE handles proposals to change the rules at an annual congress.\nBout scoring and duration.\nIn fencing, each bout (i.e. a match between two individuals or teams) is decided by either reaching a set number of hits or outscoring the opponent within a specified time limit, depending on the format of the competition.\nIndividual matches.\nPool bouts: In pool rounds, each bout is fenced to 5 hits or a single period of 3 minutes. If neither fencer has reached 5 hits when time expires, the bout ends and the higher-scoring fencer is declared the winner. If the score is tied, a tie is recorded. At the end of each bout, the number of hits scored by both fencers is also recorded.\nDirect elimination bouts: In the knockout stage, each bout continues until one fencer scores 15 hits, or until the 9-minute total fencing time (split into three 3-minute periods) expires. A 1-minute break separates each period. The clock is paused whenever the action stops, such as after a valid hit. If the score is tied at the end of the third period, a 1-minute sudden-death overtime period is fenced. The first valid hit decides the winner; if no hit is scored, the fencer with priority (determined by a draw) wins.\nTeam matches.\nEach team usually fields three fencers (plus a substitute). A match consists of nine consecutive bouts, with every fencer on one team facing each fencer on the opposing team in a preset rotation. Scoring is cumulative, generally progressing in increments of up to five hits per bout, until one team reaches 45 hits or time expires. If tied at the end of the final bout, a 1-minute sudden-death period is fenced; the first valid hit wins, or if no hit is scored, the team with priority (decided by a draw) wins.\nUniversities and schools.\nUniversity students compete internationally at the World University Games. The United States holds two national-level university tournaments (the NCAA championship and the USACFC National Championships). The BUCS holds fencing tournaments in the United Kingdom. Many universities in Ontario, Canada have fencing teams that participate in an annual inter-university competition called the OUA Finals.\nNational fencing organisations have set up programmes to encourage more students to fence. Examples include the Regional Youth Circuit program in the US and the Leon Paul Youth Development series in the UK.\nThe UK hosts two national competitions in which schools compete against each other directly: the Public Schools Fencing Championship, a competition only open to Independent Schools, and the Scottish Secondary Schools Championships, open to all secondary schools in Scotland. It contains both teams and individual events and is highly anticipated. Schools organise matches directly against one another and school age pupils can compete individually in the British Youth Championships.\nIn recent years, attempts have been made to introduce fencing to a wider and younger audience, by using foam and plastic swords, which require much less protective equipment. This makes it much less expensive to provide classes, and thus easier to take fencing to a wider range of schools than traditionally has been the case. There is even a competition series in Scotland \u2013 the Plastic-and-Foam Fencing FunLeague \u2013 specifically for Primary and early Secondary school-age children using this equipment.\nHistory.\nFencing traces its roots to the development of swordsmanship for duels and self-defence. Described as \"high-speed chess\", each bout begins and ends with a salute. Good sportsmanship and honor are stressed at every level of training and competition.\nThe oldest surviving treatise on western fencing is the Royal Armouries Ms. I.33, also known as the Tower manuscript, written c.\u20091300 in present-day Germany, which discusses the usage of the arming sword together with the buckler. It was followed by a number of treatises, primarily from Germany and Italy, with the oldest surviving Italian treatise being \"Fior di Battaglia\" by Fiore dei Liberi, written c.\u20091400. However, because they were written for the context of a knightly duel with a primary focus on archaic weapons such as the arming sword, longsword, or poleaxe, these older treatises do not really stand in continuity with modern fencing.\nFrom the 16th century onward, the Italian school of fencing would be dominated by the Bolognese or Dardi-School of fencing, named after its founder, Filippo Dardi, a Bolognese fencing master and Professor of Geometry at the University of Bologna. Unlike the previous traditions, the Bolognese school would primarily focus on the sidesword being either used alone or in combination with a buckler, a cape, a parrying dagger, or dual-wielded with another sidesword, though some Bolognese masters, such as Achille Marozzo, would still cover the usage of the two-handed greatsword or spadone.\u00a0The Bolognese school would eventually spread outside of Italy and lay the foundation for modern fencing, eclipsing both older Italian and German traditions. This was partially due to the German schools' focus on archaic weapons such as the longsword, but also due to a general decline in fencing within Germany.\nThe mechanics of modern fencing originated in the 18th century in an Italian school of fencing of the Renaissance, and under their influence, were improved by the French school of fencing. The Spanish school of fencing stagnated and was replaced by the Italian and French schools.\nDevelopment into a sport.\nThe shift towards fencing as a sport rather than as military training happened from the mid-18th century, and was led by Domenico Angelo, who established a fencing academy, Angelo's School of Arms, in Carlisle House, Soho, London in 1763. There, he taught the aristocracy the fashionable art of swordsmanship. His school was run by three generations of his family and dominated the art of European fencing for almost a century.\nHe established the essential rules of posture and footwork that still govern modern sport fencing, although his attacking and parrying methods were still much different from current practice. Although he intended to prepare his students for real combat, he was the first fencing master to emphasise the health and sporting benefits of fencing more than its use as a killing art, particularly in his influential book \"L'\u00c9cole des armes\" (\"The School of Fencing\"), published in 1763.\nBasic conventions were collated and set down during the 1880s by the French fencing master Camille Pr\u00e9vost. It was during this time that many officially recognised fencing associations began to appear in different parts of the world, such as the Amateur Fencers League of America was founded in 1891, the Amateur Fencing Association of Great Britain in 1902, and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019Escrime et Salles d\u2019Armes de France in 1906.\nThe first regularised fencing competition was held at the inaugural Grand Military Tournament and Assault at Arms in 1880, held at the Royal Agricultural Hall, in Islington in June. The Tournament featured a series of competitions between army officers and soldiers. Each bout was fought for five hits and the foils were pointed with black to aid the judges. The Amateur Gymnastic &amp; Fencing Association drew up an official set of fencing regulations in 1896.\nFencing was part of the Olympic Games in the summer of 1896. Sabre events have been held at every Summer Olympics; foil events have been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908; \u00e9p\u00e9e events have been held at every Summer Olympics except in the summer of 1896 because of unknown reasons.\nStarting with \u00e9p\u00e9e in 1933, side judges were replaced by the Laurent-Pagan electrical scoring apparatus, with an audible tone and a red or green light indicating when a touch landed. Foil was automated in 1956, sabre in 1988. The scoring box reduced the bias in judging, and permitted more accurate scoring of faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back and flank than before.\nWeapons.\nEach of the three weapons in fencing has its own rules and strategies.\nFoil.\nThe foil is a light thrusting weapon with a maximum weight of 500 grams. The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs. The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs. As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). Touches that land outside the target area (called an \"off-target touch\" and signalled by a distinct color on the scoring apparatus) stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be awarded to either fencer at the end of a phrase. If both fencers land touches within 300 ms (\u00b1 25 ms tolerance) to register two lights on the machine, the referee uses the rules of \"right of way\" to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a valid hit, in which case no touch is awarded. If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.\n\u00c9p\u00e9e.\nThe \u00e9p\u00e9e is a thrusting weapon like the foil, but heavier, with a maximum total weight of 775 grams. In \u00e9p\u00e9e, the entire body is a valid target. The \u00e9p\u00e9e features a large, bell-shaped hand guard that extends to protect the entire hand and wrist. Like foil, hits must be with the tip and not the sides of the blade. Hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). As the entire body is a valid target, there is no concept of an off-target touch. Unlike foil and sabre, \u00e9p\u00e9e does not use \"right of way\", hence simultaneous hits score for both fencers. However, if the score is tied in a match at the last point and a double touch is scored, the point is null and void.\nSabre.\nThe sabre is a cutting and thrusting weapon that targets the body above the waist. Specifically, the target comprises any part of the body above a horizontal line drawn between the top of the hip bones and then horizontally round the fencer's trunk. Sabre is the newest weapon to be used. Like the foil, the maximum legal weight of a sabre is 500 grams. The hand guard on the sabre extends from hilt to the point at which the blade connects to the pommel. This guard is generally turned outwards during sport to protect the sword arm from touches. Hits with the entire blade or point are valid. As in foil, touches that land outside the target area are not scored. However, unlike foil, these \"off-target\" touches do not stop the action, and the fencing continues. In the case of both fencers landing a scoring touch, the referee determines which fencer receives the point for the action, according to the rules of the \"right of way\".\nEquipment.\nProtective clothing.\nMost personal protective equipment for fencing is made of tough cotton or nylon. Kevlar was added to top level uniform pieces (jacket, breeches, underarm protector, lam\u00e9, and the bib of the mask) following the death of Vladimir Smirnov at the 1982 World Championships in Rome. However, Kevlar is degraded by both ultraviolet light and chlorine, which can complicate cleaning.\nOther ballistic fabrics, such as Dyneema, have been developed that resist puncture, and which do not degrade the way that Kevlar does. FIE rules state that tournament wear must be made of fabric that resists a force of , and that the mask bib must resist twice that amount.\nThe complete fencing kit includes:\nThe jacket is form-fitting, and has a strap (\"croissard\") that passes between the legs. A small gorget of folded fabric is sewn in around the collar to prevent an opponent's blade from slipping under the mask and along the jacket upwards towards the neck. Fencing instructors often wear more resistant kit, as additional protection from the frequent hits an instructor endures.\nA plastron is an underarm protector worn underneath the jacket. It provides double protection on the side of the sword arm and upper arm. There is no seam under the arm, which would line up with the jacket seam and provide a weak spot.\nThe sword hand is protected by a glove with a gauntlet that prevents blades from going up the sleeve and causing injury. The glove also improves grip.\nBreeches or knickers are short trousers that end just below the knee. The breeches are required to have 10\u00a0cm of overlap with the jacket. Most are equipped with suspenders (braces).\nFencing socks are long enough to cover the knee and feature padded reinforcement at the shin level to protect the part from hits.\nFencing shoes have flat soles, and are reinforced on the inside of the back foot, and in the heel for the front foot. The reinforcement prevents wear from lunging and protect the foot from hits (used in \u00e9p\u00e9e fencing).\nThe fencing mask has a bib that protects the neck. The mask should support on the metal mesh and of penetration resistance on the bib. FIE regulations dictate that masks must withstand on the mesh and on the bib. Some modern masks have a see-through visor in the front of the mask. These have been used at high level competitions (World Championships etc.), however, they are currently banned in foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e by the FIE, following a 2009 incident in which a visor was pierced during the European Junior Championship competition. There are foil, sabre, and three-weapon masks.\nA chest protector, made of plastic, is worn by female fencers and, sometimes, by males. Fencing instructors also wear them, as they are hit far more often during training than their students. In foil fencing, the hard surface of a chest protector decreases the likelihood that a hit registers.\nA lam\u00e9 is a layer of electrically conductive material worn over the fencing jacket in foil and sabre fencing. The lam\u00e9 covers the entire target area, and makes the registration of the hits by the scoring box possible. In \u00e9p\u00e9e fencing the lam\u00e9 is unnecessary, since the target area spans the competitor's entire body. In sabre fencing, the lam\u00e9's sleeves end in a straight line across the wrist; in foil fencing, the lam\u00e9 is sleeveless. A body cord is necessary to register scoring. It attaches to the weapon and runs inside the jacket sleeve, then down the back and goes out to plug into the scoring box. In sabre and foil fencing, the body cord connects to the lam\u00e9 as well in order to create a circuit to the scoring box.\nTraditionally, the fencer's uniform is white, while an instructor's uniform is black. This may be due to the occasional pre-electric practice of covering the point of the weapon in dye, soot, or coloured chalk in order to make it easier for the referee to determine the placing of the touches. As this is no longer a factor in the electric era, the FIE rules have been relaxed to allow coloured uniforms (save black). The guidelines also limit the permitted size and positioning of sponsorship logos.\nGrips.\nSome pistol grips used by foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e fencers \nElectric equipment.\nA set of electric fencing equipment is required to participate in electric fencing. Electric equipment in fencing varies depending on the weapon with which it is used in accordance. The main component of a set of electric equipment is the body cord. The body cord serves as the connection between a fencer and a reel of wire that is part of a system for electrically detecting that the weapon has touched the opponent. There are two types: one for \u00e9p\u00e9e, and one for foil and sabre.\n\u00c9p\u00e9e body cords consist of two sets of three prongs each connected by a wire. One set plugs into the fencer's weapon, with the other connecting to the reel. Foil and sabre body cords have only two prongs (or a twist-lock bayonet connector) on the weapon side, with the third wire connecting instead to the fencer's lam\u00e9. The need in foil and sabre to distinguish between on and off-target touches requires a wired connection to the valid target area.\nA body cord consists of three wires known as the A, B, and C lines. At the reel connector (and both connectors for \u00c9p\u00e9e cords) The B pin is in the middle, the A pin is 1.5\u00a0cm to one side of B, and the C pin is 2\u00a0cm to the other side of B. This asymmetrical arrangement ensures that the cord cannot be plugged in the wrong way around.\nIn foil, the A line is connected to the lam\u00e9 and the B line runs up a wire to the tip of the weapon. The B line is normally connected to the C line through the tip. When the tip is depressed, the circuit is broken and one of three things can happen:\nIn \u00c9p\u00e9e, the A and B lines run up separate wires to the tip (there is no lam\u00e9). When the tip is depressed, it connects the A and B lines, resulting in a valid touch. However, if the tip is touching the opponents weapon (their C line) or the grounded strip, nothing happens when it is depressed, as the current is redirected to the C line. Grounded strips are particularly important in \u00c9p\u00e9e, as without one, a touch to the floor registers as a valid touch (rather than off-target as in Foil).\nIn Sabre, similarly to Foil, the A line is connected to the lam\u00e9, but both the B and C lines are connected to the body of the weapon. Any contact between one's B/C line (either one, as they are always connected) and the opponent's A line (their lam\u00e9) results in a valid touch. There is no need for grounded strips in Sabre, as hitting something other than the opponent's lame does not register.\nIn a professional fencing competition, a complete set of electric equipment is needed.\nA complete set of foil electric equipment includes:\nThe electric equipment of sabre is very similar to that of foil. In addition, equipment used in sabre includes:\n\u00c9p\u00e9e fencers lack a lam\u00e9, conductive bib, and head cord due to their target area. Also, their body cords are constructed differently as described above. However, they possess all of the other components of a foil fencer's equipment.\nTechniques.\nTechniques or movements in fencing can be divided into two categories: offensive and defensive. Some techniques can fall into both categories (e.g. the beat). Certain techniques are used offensively, with the purpose of landing a hit on one's opponent while holding the right of way (foil and sabre). Others are used defensively, to protect against a hit or obtain the right of way.\nThe attacks and defences may be performed in countless combinations of feet and hand actions. For example, fencer A attacks the arm of fencer B, drawing a high outside parry; fencer B then follows the parry with a high line riposte. Fencer A, expecting that, then makes his own parry by pivoting his blade under fencer B's weapon (from straight out to more or less straight down), putting fencer B's tip off target and fencer A now scoring against the low line by angulating the hand upwards.\nOther variants.\nOther variants include wheelchair fencing for those with disabilities, chair fencing, \"one-hit \u00e9p\u00e9e\" (one of the five events which constitute modern pentathlon) and the various types of non-Olympic competitive fencing. Chair fencing is similar to wheelchair fencing, but for the able bodied. The opponents set up opposing chairs and fence while seated; all the usual rules of fencing are applied. An example of the latter is the American Fencing League (distinct from the United States Fencing Association): the format of competitions is different and the right of way rules are interpreted in a different way. In a number of countries, school and university matches deviate slightly from the FIE format. A variant of the sport using toy lightsabers earned national attention when ESPN2 acquired the rights to a selection of matches and included it as part of its \"ESPN8: The Ocho\" programming block in August 2018.\nTwo handed fencing refers to a type of fencing where a buckler or dagger is used to parry attacks.\nIn popular culture.\nOne of the most notable films related to fencing is the 2015 Finnish-Estonian-German film \"The Fencer\", directed by Klaus H\u00e4r\u00f6, which is loosely based on the life of Endel Nelis, an accomplished Estonian fencer and coach. The film was nominated for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category.\nIn 2017, the first issue of the \"Fence\" comic book series, which follows a fictional team of young fencers, was published by the US-based Boom! Studios.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It defines free software as software that grants users the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software. The term \"free\" is used in the sense of \"free speech\", not \"free of charge\".\nThe earliest known publication of the definition appeared in the February 1986 edition of the now-discontinued \"GNU's Bulletin\" published by the FSF. Since 1996, the official version of the document has been maintained in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. As of \u00a02025[ [update]], the definition had seen 27 major revisions since it was originally published online and it had been translated into 65 languages. The FSF also publishes a list of licenses that meet this definition.\nThe Four Essential Freedoms.\nThe definition published by the FSF in 1986 originally listed two key points:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The word \"free\" in our name does not refer to price; it refers to freedom. First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you. Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to you.\nIn 1996, when the GNU Project website was launched, the definition was expanded to include \"three levels of freedom\", explicitly adding the freedom to study the software (which had been implied in the original). Stallman later discouraged describing them as \"levels,\" noting that all freedoms are equally essential.\nA fourth freedom was later introduced to explicitly affirm the user's right to run the program. Because it was seen as more fundamental than the others, it was placed first. Since the existing freedoms were numbered one through three, this new one was designated \"freedom zero\". Such zero-based numbering, where counting begins at zero, is also a common convention in computer programming.\nThe modern definition states that a program is free software if it grants users the following four essential freedoms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). \nFreedoms 1 and 3 require source code to be available, as studying and modifying software without source code is impractical.\nLater definitions.\nIn July 1997, Bruce Perens published the Debian Free Software Guidelines. A definition based on the DFSG was later adopted by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) under the name \"The Open Source Definition\".\nComparison with the Open Source Definition.\nDespite philosophical differences between the free software movement and the open-source movement, the FSF's definition of free software and the OSI's definition of open-source software describe largely overlapping sets of licenses, with only a few minor differences. While emphasizing these philosophical distinctions, the FSF states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The term \"open source\" software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software. It is not exactly the same class of software: they accept some licences that we consider too restrictive, and there are free software licences they have not accepted. However, the differences in extension of the category are small: nearly all free software is open source, and nearly all open source software is free.\u2014\u200a\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is also considered one of the developers of nuclear magnetic resonance.\nEducation.\nBloch was born on 23 October 1905 in Zurich, Switzerland, to Jewish parents, Gustav Bloch and Agnes Mayer. Gustav was financially unable to attend university and worked as a wholesale grain dealer in Zurich. Gustav moved to Zurich from Moravia in 1890 to become a Swiss citizen. Their first child was a girl born in 1902, while Felix was born three years later.\nBloch entered public elementary school at the age of six and is said to have been teased, in part because he \"spoke Swiss German with a somewhat different accent than most members of the class\". He received support from his older sister during much of this time, but she died at the age of 12, devastating Felix, who is said to have lived a \"depressed and isolated life\" in the following years. Bloch learned to play the piano by the age of 8 and was drawn to arithmetic for its \"clarity and beauty\". Bloch graduated from elementary school at twelve and enrolled in the Cantonal Gymnasium in Zurich for secondary school in 1918. He was placed on a six-year curriculum here to prepare him for university. He continued his curriculum through 1924, even through his study of engineering and physics in other schools, though it was limited to mathematics and languages after the first three years.\nAfter these first three years at the Gymnasium, at the age of 15, Bloch began to study at the ETH Zurich. Although he initially studied engineering, he soon changed to physics. During this time, he attended lectures and seminars given by Peter Debye and Hermann Weyl at the ETH Zurich and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger at the neighboring University of Zurich. A fellow student in these seminars was John von Neumann. \nBloch graduated in 1927, and was encouraged by Debye to go to the University of Leipzig to study under Werner Heisenberg. Bloch became Heisenberg's first graduate student, and gained his doctorate in 1928. His doctoral thesis established the quantum theory of solids, using waves to describe electrons in periodic lattices.\nCareer and research.\nBloch remained in European academia, working on superconductivity with Wolfgang Pauli in Zurich; with Hans Kramers and Adriaan Fokker in the Netherlands; with Heisenberg on ferromagnetism, where he developed a description of boundaries between magnetic domains, now known as Bloch walls, and theoretically proposed a concept of spin waves, excitations of magnetic structure; with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, where he worked on a theoretical description of the stopping of charged particles traveling through matter; and with Enrico Fermi in Rome. \nIn 1932, Bloch returned to Leipzig to assume a position as \"Privatdozent\" (lecturer). In 1933, immediately after Adolf Hitler came to power, Bloch left Germany out of fear of anti-Jewish persecution, returning to Zurich before traveling to Paris to lecture at the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9.\nIn 1934, the chairman of Stanford Physics invited Bloch to join the faculty. Bloch accepted the offer and emigrated to the United States. In the fall of 1938, Bloch began working with the 37 inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley, to determine the magnetic moment of the neutron. Bloch went on to become the first professor of theoretical physics at Stanford. In 1939, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\nDuring World War II, Bloch briefly worked on the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos. Disliking the military atmosphere of the laboratory and uninterested in the theoretical work there, Bloch left to join the radar project at Harvard University.\nAfter the war, he concentrated on investigations into nuclear induction and nuclear magnetic resonance, which are the underlying principles of MRI. In 1946, he proposed the Bloch equations, which determine the time evolution of nuclear magnetization. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1948. Along with Edward Purcell, Bloch was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952 for his work on nuclear magnetic induction.\nWhen CERN was being set up in the early 1950s, its founders were searching for someone of stature and international prestige to head the fledgling international laboratory, and in 1954 Professor Bloch became CERN's first director-general, at the time when construction was getting under way on the present Meyrin site and plans for the first machines were being drawn up. After leaving CERN, he returned to Stanford University, where he in 1961 was made Max Stein Professor of Physics.\nIn 1964, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.\nFamily.\nOn 14 March 1940, Bloch married Lore Clara Misch (1911\u20131996), a fellow physicist working on X-ray crystallography, whom he had met at an American Physical Society meeting. They had four children, twins George Jacob Bloch and Daniel Arthur Bloch (born 15 January 1941), son Frank Samuel Bloch (born 16 January 1945), and daughter Ruth Hedy Bloch (born 15 September 1949).\nBloch died on 10 September 1983 in Zurich at the age of 77.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is not to be confused with a \"fuguing tune\", which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American (i.e. shape note or \"Sacred Harp\") music and West Gallery music. A fugue usually has three main sections: an exposition, a development, and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue's tonic key. Fugues can also have episodes, which are parts of the fugue where new material often based on the subject is heard; a stretto (plural stretti), when the fugue's subject overlaps itself in different voices, or a recapitulation. A popular compositional technique in the Baroque era, the fugue was fundamental in showing mastery of harmony and tonality as it presented counterpoint.\nIn the Middle Ages, the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style; however, by the Renaissance, it had come to denote specifically imitative works. Since the 17th century, the term \"fugue\" has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint.\nMost fugues open with a short main theme, called the subject, which then sounds successively in each voice. When each voice has completed its entry of the subject, the \"exposition\" is complete. This is often followed by a connecting passage, or \"episode\", developed from previously heard material; further \"entries\" of the subject are then heard in related keys. Episodes (if applicable) and entries are usually alternated until the final entry of the subject, at which point the music has returned to the opening key, or tonic, which is often followed by a coda. Because of the composer's prerogative to decide most structural elements, the fugue is closer to a style of composition rather than a structural form.\nThe form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions, such as imitative ricercars, capriccios, canzonas, and fantasias. The Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach (1685\u20131750), well known for his fugues, shaped his own works after those of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (1562\u20131621), Johann Jakob Froberger (1616\u20131667), Johann Pachelbel (1653\u20131706), Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583\u20131643), Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 1637\u20131707) and others. With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period, the fugue's central role waned, eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a more prominent position. Nevertheless, composers continued to write and study fugues; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756\u20131791) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770\u20131827), as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich (1906\u20131975) and Paul Hindemith (1895\u20131963).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe English term \"fugue\" originated in the 16th century and is derived from the French word \"fugue\" or the Italian \"fuga\". This in turn comes from the Latin \"fuga\", which is itself related to both \"fugere\" (\"to flee\") and \"fugare\" (\"to chase\"). The adjectival form is \"fugal\". Variants include \"fughetta\" (\"a small fugue\") and \"fugato\" (a passage in fugal style within another work that is not a fugue).\nMusical outline.\nA fugue begins with the \"exposition\" and is written according to certain rules. The composer has more freedom once the exposition ends, though a logical key structure is usually followed. Further entries of the subject will occur throughout the fugue, repeating the accompanying material at the same time, and often accompanying key changes. The various entries may or may not be separated by \"episodes\" or occur in \"stretto\".\n\nExposition.\nA fugue begins with the exposition of its subject in one of the voices alone in the tonic key. After the statement of the subject, a second voice enters and states the subject with the subject transposed to another key (almost always the dominant or subdominant, with the latter being less common), which is known as the \"answer\". To enable a natural harmonic progression, the answer may also be altered slightly (usually by changing one or a few notes near the beginning). When the answer is an exact transposition of the subject into the new key, the answer is classified as a \"real answer\"; alternatively, if the intervals of the subject are altered in any way, the answer is a \"tonal answer\".\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\new PianoStaff \u00ab\n \\new Staff \\fixed c' {\n \\key g \\minor\n R1 Example of a tonal answer in J.S. Bach's Fugue No. 16 in G minor, BWV 861, from the \"Well-Tempered Clavier\", Book 1. The first note of the subject, D (in red), is a prominent dominant note, demanding that the first note of the answer (in blue) sound as the tonic, G.\nWhen the subject begins with a prominent dominant note, or when there is a prominent dominant note very close to the beginning of the subject, a tonal answer is usually necessary. To prevent an undermining of the fugue's key, this note is transposed up a fourth to the tonic rather than up a fifth to the supertonic. For the same reason, it is possible for the answer of such a subject to be in the subdominant key.\nDuring the answer, the voice in which the subject was previously heard accompanies with new material. If this new material is reused in later statements of the subject, it is called a \"countersubject\"; if this accompanying material is only heard once, it is simply referred to as \"free counterpoint\".\nThe countersubject is written in invertible counterpoint at the octave or fifteenth (two octaves). The distinction is made between the use of free counterpoint and regular countersubjects accompanying the fugue subject/answer, because in order for it to be heard accompanying the subject in more than one instance, the countersubject must be capable of sounding correctly when played above or below the subject, and must be conceived, therefore, in invertible (double) counterpoint.\nIn tonal music, invertible contrapuntal lines must be written according to certain rules, because several intervallic combinations, while acceptable in one orientation, are not permissible when inverted. As an example, perfect fifths are contrapuntally acceptable, while the inversion of a perfect fifth results in a perfect fourth, which, unlike the perfect fifth, is considered a dissonance, requiring proper preparation and resolution. The countersubject, if sounding at the same time as the answer, is transposed to the pitch of the answer. Each voice then responds with its own subject or answer, and further countersubjects or free counterpoint may be heard.\nIt is customary in the exposition to alternate entrances of the subject (S) with entrances of the answer (A). However, this order is occasionally varied. For example, the exposition from J.S. Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" Fugue No. 1 in C Major, BWV 846 uses a SAAS (subject-answer-answer-subject) exposition. A brief codetta is often heard connecting the various statements of the subject and answer, smoothly connecting each and often facilitating the modulation between the tonic and the key of the answer. The codetta, like other parts of the exposition, may be reused throughout the remainder of the fugue.\nThe first answer must occur as soon after the initial statement of the subject as possible; therefore, the first codetta is often absent or very short. In the example shown above of J.S. Bach's Fugue No. 16 in G minor, BWV 861, the first codetta is absent. The subject concludes on the quarter note (or crotchet) B\u266d of the third beat of the second bar, which harmonizes the opening G of the tonal answer. The later codettas may be considerably longer, and often serve to develop the material heard in the subject/answer and countersubject and possibly introduce ideas heard in the second countersubject or free counterpoint that follows. They may also be present to delay, and therefore heighten the impact of, the reentry of the subject in another voice. Finally, they may be modulatory passages to return the fugue to the tonic.\nThe exposition usually concludes when all voices have given a statement of the subject or answer. In some fugues, especially those with an odd number of voices, the exposition will end with a redundant entry, or an extra presentation of the theme in a voice which has already entered. Furthermore, the entry of one of the voices may not be heard until considerably later. For example, in J.S. Bach's Fugue in C minor for Organ, BWV 549, the subject entrance in the lowest voice (played by the organ pedals), is not heard until near the end of the fugue.\nEpisode.\nFurther entries of the subject may follow the initial exposition either immediately or separated by episodes. Episodic material is always modulatory and is usually based upon some musical idea heard in the exposition. Each episode has the primary function of transitioning into a new key for the next entry of the subject, and may also provide release from the strictness of form required by the exposition. Andr\u00e9 Gedalge, a teacher of Maurice Ravel, stated that the episode of the fugue is generally based on a series of imitations of the subject that have been fragmented.\nDevelopment.\nFurther entries of the subject, or middle entries, occur throughout the fugue. The development must state the subject or answer at least once in its entirety, and may also be heard in combination with any countersubjects from the exposition, new countersubjects, free counterpoint, or any of these in combination. It is uncommon for the subject to enter alone in a single voice in the middle entries; rather, it is usually heard with at least one of the countersubjects and/or other free contrapuntal accompaniments.\nMiddle entries tend to occur at keys other than the tonic. These are often closely related keys such as the relative dominant and subdominant, although the key structure of fugues varies greatly. In the fugues of J.S. Bach, the first middle entry occurs most often in the relative major or minor of the work's overall key, and is followed by an entry in the dominant of the relative major or minor when the fugue's subject requires a tonal answer. In the fugues of earlier composers (notably Buxtehude and Pachelbel), middle entries in keys other than the tonic and dominant tend to be the exception, and non-modulation the norm. One famous example of such non-modulating fugue occurs in Buxtehude's Praeludium (Fugue and Chaconne) in C, BuxWV 137.\nWhen there is no entrance of the subject and answer material, the composer can develop the subject by altering it. This is called a \"counter-exposition\", which often uses the \"inversion\" of the subject, although the term is sometimes used synonymously with middle entry and may also describe the exposition of completely new subjects, such as those encountered in double fugues. In any of the entries within a fugue, the subject may be altered by inversion, retrograde (where the subject is heard back-to-front), diminution (the reduction of the subject's rhythmic values by a certain factor), augmentation (the enlargement of the subject's rhythmic values by a certain factor), or any combination thereof.\nExample and analysis.\nThe excerpt below, bars 7\u201312 of J.S. Bach's Fugue No. 2 in C minor, BWV 847, from \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", Book 1 illustrates the application of most of the characteristics described above. The fugue is for keyboard and in three voices, with regular countersubjects. This excerpt opens at last entry of the exposition: the subject is sounding in the bass, the first countersubject in the treble, while the middle-voice is stating a second version of the second countersubject, which concludes with the characteristic rhythm of the subject, and is always used together with the first version of the second countersubject.\nFollowing this, an episode modulates from the tonic to the relative major by means of sequence, in the form of an accompanied canon at the fourth. Arrival in E\u266d major is marked by a quasi perfect cadence across the bar line, from the last quarter note beat of the first bar to the first beat of the second bar in the second system, and the first middle entry. Here, Bach has altered the second countersubject to accommodate the change of mode.\nFalse entries.\nAt any point in the fugue there may be \"false entries\" of the subject, which include the start of the subject but are not completed. False entries are often abbreviated to the head of the subject, and anticipate the \"true\" entry of the subject, heightening the impact of the subject proper.\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\layout {\n \\context {\n \\Voice\n \\consists \"Horizontal_bracket_engraver\"\n \\override TextScript.font-size = -2\n\\new PianoStaff \u00ab\n \\new Staff \\fixed c' {\n \\key c \\minor\n {\n bes8 g'16 f' g'8 b c' d'16 ees' f'4~ Example of a false answer in J.S. Bach's Fugue No. 2 in C minor, BWV 847, from the \"Well-Tempered Clavier\", Book 1. This passage is bars 6/7, at the end of the codetta before the first entry of the third voice, the bass, in the exposition. The false entry occurs in the alto, and consists of the head of the subject only, marked in red. It anticipates the true entry of the subject, marked in blue, by one quarter note.\nCounter-exposition.\nThe counter-exposition is a second exposition. However, there are only two entries, and the entries occur in reverse order. The counter-exposition in a fugue is separated from the exposition by an episode and is in the same key as the original exposition.\nStretto.\nSometimes counter-expositions or the middle entries take place in \"stretto,\" whereby one voice responds with the subject/answer before the first voice has completed its entry of the subject/answer, usually increasing the intensity of the music.\nOnly one entry of the subject must be heard in its completion in a \"stretto\". However, a \"stretto\" in which the subject/answer is heard in completion in all voices is known as \"stretto maestrale\" or \"grand stretto\". \"Strettos\" may also occur by inversion, augmentation and diminution. A fugue in which the opening exposition takes place in \"stretto\" form is known as a \"close fugue\" or \"stretto fugue\" (see for example, the \"Gratias agimus tibi\" and \"\" choruses from J.S. Bach's Mass in B minor).\nFinal entries and coda.\nThe closing section of a fugue often includes one or two counter-expositions, and possibly a stretto, in the tonic; sometimes over a tonic or dominant pedal note. Any material that follows the final entry of the subject is considered to be the final coda and is normally cadential.\nTypes.\nSimple fugue.\nA simple fugue has only one subject, and does not utilize invertible counterpoint.\nDouble (triple, quadruple) fugue.\nA double fugue has two subjects that are often developed simultaneously. Similarly, a triple fugue has three subjects. There are two kinds of double (triple) fugue: (a) a fugue in which the second (third) subject is (are) presented simultaneously with the subject in the exposition (e.g. as in Kyrie Eleison of Mozart's Requiem in D minor or the fugue of Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582), and (b) a fugue in which all subjects have their own expositions at some point, and they are not combined until later (see for example, the three-subject Fugue No. 14 in F\u266f minor from Bach's \"Well-Tempered Clavier\" Book 2, or more famously, Bach's \"St. Anne\" Fugue in E\u266d major, BWV 552, a triple fugue for organ.)\nCounter-fugue.\nA counter-fugue is a fugue in which the first answer is presented as the subject in inversion (upside down), and the inverted subject continues to feature prominently throughout the fugue. Examples include \"Contrapunctus V\" through \"Contrapunctus VII\", from Bach's \"The Art of Fugue\". During the Baroque period, counter-fugues were sometimes called by the Latin name \"fuga contraria\". German composer Johann Mattheson coined the term \"gegenfuge\" to refer to a counter-fugue construct in his \"Der vollkommene Capellmeister\" (1739), and some German-language texts use that name to refer to a counter-fugue.\nPermutation fugue.\nPermutation fugue describes a type of composition (or technique of composition) in which elements of fugue and strict canon are combined. Each voice enters in succession with the subject, each entry alternating between tonic and dominant, and each voice, having stated the initial subject, continues by stating two or more themes (or countersubjects), which must be conceived in correct invertible counterpoint. (In other words, the subject and countersubjects must be capable of being played both above and below all the other themes without creating any unacceptable dissonances.) Each voice takes this pattern and states all the subjects/themes in the same order (and repeats the material when all the themes have been stated, sometimes after a rest).\nThere is usually very little non-structural/thematic material. During the course of a permutation fugue, it is quite uncommon, actually, for every single possible voice-combination (or \"permutation\") of the themes to be heard. This limitation exists in consequence of sheer proportionality: the more voices in a fugue, the greater the number of possible permutations. In consequence, composers exercise editorial judgment as to the most musical of permutations and processes leading thereto. One example of permutation fugue can be seen in the eighth and final chorus of J.S. Bach's cantata, \"Himmelsk\u00f6nig, sei willkommen\", BWV 182.\nPermutation fugues differ from conventional fugue in that there are no connecting episodes, nor statement of the themes in related keys. So for example, the fugue of Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582 is not purely a permutation fugue, as it does have episodes between permutation expositions. Invertible counterpoint is essential to permutation fugues but is not found in simple fugues.\nFughetta.\nA fughetta is a short fugue that has the same characteristics as a fugue. Often the contrapuntal writing is not strict, and the setting less formal. See for example, variation 24 of Beethoven's \"Diabelli Variations\" Op. 120.\nMirror fugue.\nA mirror fugue is a fugue, or rather two fugues, one of which is the mirror image of the other. It is as though a mirror were placed above or below an existing fugue, producing inversions of each interval in each part, as well as inverting the position of the parts within the texture, so that, for example, the topmost part in one fugue is inverted to produce the lowest part in the other. This is well demonstrated by the two four-part fugues of Contrapunctus 12 in \"The Art of Fugue\".\nThe two three-part fugues of Contrapunctus 13 exhibit a similar relationship to each other, but this cannot strictly be called a mirror fugue, since the position of each inverted part is not itself inverted in the texture, SAB becoming not BAS, but BSA.\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nThe term \"fuga\" was used as far back as the Middle Ages, but was initially used to refer to any kind of imitative counterpoint, including canons, which are now thought of as distinct from fugues. Prior to the 16th century, fugue was originally a genre. It was not until the 16th century that fugal technique as it is understood today began to be seen in pieces, both instrumental and vocal. Fugal writing is found in works such as fantasias, ricercares and canzonas.\n\"Fugue\" as a theoretical term first occurred in 1330 when Jacobus of Liege wrote about the \"fuga\" in his \"Speculum musicae\". The fugue arose from the technique of \"imitation\", where the same musical material was repeated starting on a different note.\nGioseffo Zarlino, a composer, author, and theorist in the Renaissance, was one of the first to distinguish between the two types of imitative counterpoint: fugues and canons (which he called imitations). Originally, this was to aid improvisation, but by the 1550s, it was considered a technique of composition. The composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (1525?\u20131594) wrote masses using modal counterpoint and imitation, and fugal writing became the basis for writing motets as well. Palestrina's imitative motets differed from fugues in that each phrase of the text had a different subject which was introduced and worked out separately, whereas a fugue continued working with the same subject or subjects throughout the entire length of the piece.\nBaroque era.\nIt was in the Baroque period that the writing of fugues became central to composition, in part as a demonstration of compositional expertise. Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Johann Jakob Froberger and Dieterich Buxtehude all wrote fugues.\nFugues were incorporated into a variety of musical genres, and are found in most of George Frideric Handel's oratorios. Keyboard suites from this time often conclude with a fugal gigue. Domenico Scarlatti has only a few fugues among his corpus of over 500 harpsichord sonatas. The French overture featured a quick fugal section after a slow introduction. The second movement of a sonata da chiesa, as written by Arcangelo Corelli and others, was usually fugal.\nThe Baroque period also saw a rise in the importance of music theory. Some fugues during the Baroque period were pieces designed to teach contrapuntal technique to students. The most influential text was Johann Joseph Fux's \"Gradus Ad Parnassum\" (\"Steps to Parnassus\"), which appeared in 1725. This work laid out the terms of \"species\" of counterpoint, and offered a series of exercises to learn fugue writing. Fux's work was largely based on the practice of Palestrina's modal fugues. Mozart studied from this book, and it remained influential into the nineteenth century. Haydn, for example, taught counterpoint from his own summary of Fux and thought of it as the basis for formal structure.\nBach's most famous fugues are those for the harpsichord in \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", which many composers and theorists look at as the greatest model of fugue. \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" comprises two volumes written in different times of Bach's life, each comprising 24 prelude and fugue pairs, one for each major and minor key. Bach is also known for his organ fugues, which are usually preceded by a prelude or toccata. \"The Art of Fugue\", BWV 1080, is a collection of fugues (and four canons) on a single theme that is gradually transformed as the cycle progresses. Bach also wrote smaller single fugues and put fugal sections or movements into many of his more general works. J.S. Bach's influence extended forward through his son C.P.E. Bach and through the theorist Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg (1718\u20131795) whose \"Abhandlung von der Fuge\" (\"Treatise on the fugue\", 1753) was largely based on J.S. Bach's work.\nClassical era.\nDuring the Classical era, the fugue was no longer a central or even fully natural mode of musical composition. Nevertheless, both Haydn and Mozart had periods of their careers in which they in some sense \"rediscovered\" fugal writing and used it frequently in their work.\nHaydn.\nJoseph Haydn was the leader of fugal composition and technique in the Classical era. Haydn's most famous fugues can be found in his \"Sun\" Quartets (op. 20, 1772), of which three have fugal finales. This was a practice that Haydn repeated only once later in his quartet-writing career, with the finale of his String Quartet, Op. 50 No. 4 (1787). Some of the earliest examples of Haydn's use of counterpoint, however, are in three symphonies (No. 3, No. 13, and No. 40) that date from 1762 to 1763. The earliest fugues, in both the symphonies and in the Baryton trios, exhibit the influence of Joseph Fux's treatise on counterpoint, \"Gradus ad Parnassum\" (1725), which Haydn studied carefully.\nHaydn's second fugal period occurred after he heard, and was greatly inspired by, the oratorios of Handel during his visits to London (1791\u20131793, 1794\u20131795). Haydn then studied Handel's techniques and incorporated Handelian fugal writing into the choruses of his mature oratorios \"The Creation\" and \"The Seasons,\" as well as several of his later symphonies, including No. 88, No. 95, and No. 101; and the late string quartets, Opus 71 no. 3 and (especially) Opus 76 no. 6.\nMozart.\nThe young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart studied counterpoint with Padre Martini in Bologna. Under the employment of Archbishop Colloredo and the musical influence of his predecessors and colleagues such as Johann Ernst Eberlin, Anton Cajetan Adlgasser, Michael Haydn, as well as his own father, Leopold Mozart at the Salzburg Cathedral, the young Mozart composed ambitious fugues and contrapuntal passages in Catholic choral works such as Mass in C minor, K. 139 \"Waisenhaus\" (1768), Mass in C major, K. 66 \"Dominicus\" (1769), Mass in C major, K. 167 \"in honorem Sanctissimae Trinitatis\" (1773), Mass in C major, K. 262 \"Missa longa\" (1775), Mass in C major, K. 337 \"Solemnis\" (1780), various litanies, and vespers. Leopold admonished his son openly in 1777 that he not forget to make public demonstration of his abilities in \"fugue, canon, and contrapunctus\".\nLater in life, the major impetus to fugal writing for Mozart was the influence of Baron Gottfried van Swieten in Vienna around 1782. Van Swieten, during diplomatic service in Berlin, had taken the opportunity to collect as many manuscripts by Bach and Handel as he could, and he invited Mozart to study his collection and encouraged him to transcribe various works for other combinations of instruments. Mozart was evidently fascinated by these works and wrote a set of five transcriptions for string quartet, K. 405 (1782), of fugues from Bach's \"Well-Tempered Clavier\", introducing them with preludes of his own.\nIn a letter to his sister Nannerl Mozart, dated in Vienna on 20 April 1782, Mozart recognizes that he had not written anything in this form, but moved by his wife's interest, he composed one piece, which is sent with the letter. He begs her not to let anybody see the fugue and manifests the hope to write five more and then present them to Baron van Swieten. Regarding the piece, he said \"I have taken particular care to write \"andante maestoso\" upon it, so that it should not be played fast \u2013 for if a fugue is not played slowly the ear cannot clearly distinguish the new subject as it is introduced and the effect is missed\". Mozart then set to writing fugues on his own, mimicking the Baroque style. These included a fugue in C minor, K. 426, for two pianos (1783). Later, Mozart incorporated fugal writing into his opera \"Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\" and the finale of his Symphony No. 41.\nThe parts of the Requiem he completed also contain several fugues (most notably the Kyrie, and the three fugues in the Domine Jesu; he also left behind a sketch for an Amen fugue which, some believe, would have come at the end of the Sequentia).\nBeethoven.\nLudwig van Beethoven was familiar with fugal writing from childhood, as an important part of his training was playing from \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\". During his early career in Vienna, Beethoven attracted notice for his performance of these fugues. There are fugal sections in Beethoven's early piano sonatas, and fugal writing is to be found in the second and fourth movements of the \"Eroica Symphony\" (1805). Beethoven incorporated fugues in his sonatas, and reshaped the episode's purpose and compositional technique for later generations of composers.\nNevertheless, fugues did not take on a truly central role in Beethoven's work until his late period. The finale of Beethoven's \"Hammerklavier\" Sonata contains a fugue, which was practically unperformed until the late 19th century, due to its tremendous technical difficulty and length. The last movement of his Cello Sonata, Op. 102 No. 2 is a fugue, and there are fugal passages in the last movements of his Piano Sonatas in A major, Op. 101 and A\u266d major Op. 110. According to Charles Rosen, \"With the finale of 110, Beethoven re-conceived the significance of the most traditional elements of fugue writing.\"\nFugal passages are also found in the \"Missa Solemnis\" and all movements of the Ninth Symphony, except the third. A massive, dissonant fugue forms the finale of his String Quartet, Op. 130 (1825); the latter was later published separately as Op. 133, the \"Gro\u00dfe Fuge\" (\"Great Fugue\"). Glenn Gould said that \"...the Grosse Fugue is not only the greatest work Beethoven ever composed but just about the most astonishing piece in musical literature.\" However, it is the fugue that opens Beethoven's String Quartet in C\u266f minor, Op. 131 that several commentators regard as one of the composer's greatest achievements. Joseph Kerman (1966, p.\u00a0330) calls it \"this most moving of all fugues\". J. W. N. Sullivan (1927, p.\u00a0235) hears it as \"the most superhuman piece of music that Beethoven has ever written.\" Philip Radcliffe (1965, p.\u00a0149) says \"[a] bare description of its formal outline can give but little idea of the extraordinary profundity of this fugue .\"\nRomantic era.\nBy the beginning of the Romantic era, fugue writing had become specifically attached to the norms and styles of the Baroque. Felix Mendelssohn wrote many fugues inspired by his study of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.\nJohannes Brahms' \"Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel\", Op. 24, is a work for solo piano written in 1861. It consists of a set of twenty-five variations and a concluding fugue, all based on a theme from George Frideric Handel's \"Harpsichord Suite No. 1 in B\u266d major\", HWV 434.\nFranz Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor (1853) contains a powerful fugue, demanding incisive virtuosity from its player:\nRichard Wagner included several fugues in his opera \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\". Giuseppe Verdi included a whimsical example at the end of his opera \"Falstaff\" and his setting of the Requiem Mass contained two (originally three) choral fugues. Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler also included them in their respective symphonies. The exposition of the finale of Bruckner's Symphony No. 5 begins with a fugal exposition. The exposition ends with a chorale, the melody of which is then used as a second fugal exposition at the beginning of the development. The recapitulation features both fugal subjects concurrently. The finale of Mahler's Symphony No. 5 features a \"fugue-like\" passage early in the movement, though this is not actually an example of a fugue.\n20th century.\nTwentieth-century composers brought fugue back to its position of prominence, realizing its uses in full instrumental works, its importance in development and introductory sections, and the developmental capabilities of fugal composition. Arnold Schoenberg's \"Pierrot lunaire\" contains a movement 'Der Mondfleck' that has been described as \"... two simultaneous canons change into reverse while a three-part fugue moves straight ahead... without question the greatest and most complex contrapuntal achievement of our age.\"\nThe second movement of Maurice Ravel's piano suite \"Le Tombeau de Couperin\" (1917) is a fugue that Roy Howat (200, p.\u00a088) describes as having \"a subtle glint of jazz\". \nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's \"Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta\" (1936) opens with a slow fugue that Pierre Boulez (1986, pp.\u00a0346\u201347) regards as \"certainly the finest and most characteristic example of Bart\u00f3k's subtle style... probably the most \"timeless\" of all Bart\u00f3k's works \u2013 a fugue that unfolds like a fan to a point of maximum intensity and then closes, returning to the mysterious atmosphere of the opening.\" The second movement of Bart\u00f3k's Sonata for Solo Violin is a fugue, and the first movement of his Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion contains a fugato.\n\"Schwanda the Bagpiper\" (Czech: \u0160vanda dud\u00e1k), written in 1926, an opera in two acts (five scenes), with music by Jarom\u00edr Weinberger, includes a \"Polka\" followed by a powerful \"Fugue\" based on the Polka theme.\nErnst Toch composed a strict fugue for speakers, the \"Geographical Fugue\".\nIgor Stravinsky also incorporated fugues into his works, including the \"Symphony of Psalms\" and the \"Dumbarton Oaks\" concerto. Stravinsky recognized the compositional techniques of Bach, and in the second movement of his \"Symphony of Psalms\" (1930), he lays out a fugue that is much like that of the Baroque era. It employs a double fugue with two distinct subjects, the first beginning in C and the second in E\u266d. Techniques such as stretto, sequencing, and the use of subject incipits are frequently heard in the movement.\nDmitri Shostakovich's 24 Preludes and Fugues is the composer's homage to Bach's two volumes of \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\". In the first movement of his Fourth Symphony, starting at rehearsal mark 63, is a gigantic fugue in which the 20-bar subject (and tonal answer) consist entirely of semiquavers, played at the speed of quaver = 168.\nOlivier Messiaen, writing about his \"Vingt regards sur l'enfant-J\u00e9sus\" (1944) wrote of the sixth piece of that collection, \"Par Lui tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait\" (\"By Him were all things made\"): &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It expresses the Creation of All Things: space, time, stars, planets\u00a0\u2013 and the Countenance (or rather, the Thought) of God behind the flames and the seething\u00a0\u2013 impossible even to speak of it, I have not attempted to describe it ... Instead, I have sheltered behind the form of the Fugue. Bach's \"Art of Fugue\" and the fugue from Beethoven's Opus 106 (the \"Hammerklavier sonata\") have nothing to do with the academic fugue. Like those great models, this one is an anti-scholastic fugue.\nGy\u00f6rgy Ligeti wrote a five-part double fugue for his \"Requiem\"'s second movement, the Kyrie, in which each part (SMATB) is subdivided in four-voice \"bundles\" that make a canon. The melodic material in this fugue is totally chromatic, with melismatic (running) parts overlaid onto skipping intervals, and use of polyrhythm (multiple simultaneous subdivisions of the measure), blurring everything both harmonically and rhythmically so as to create an aural aggregate, thus highlighting the theoretical/aesthetic question of the next section as to whether fugue is a form or a texture. According to Tom Service, in this work, Ligeti\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;takes the logic of the fugal idea and creates something that's meticulously built on precise contrapuntal principles of imitation and fugality, but he expands them into a different region of musical experience. Ligeti doesn't want us to hear individual entries of the subject or any subject, or to allow us access to the labyrinth through listening in to individual lines\u2026 He creates instead a vastly dense texture of voices in his choir and orchestra, a huge stratified slab of terrifying visionary power. Yet this is music that's made with a fine craft and detail of a Swiss clock maker. Ligeti's so-called 'micro-polyphony': the many voicedness of small intervals at small distances in time from one another is a kind of conjuring trick. At the micro level of the individual lines, and there are dozens and dozens of them in this music...there's an astonishing detail and finesse, but the overall macro effect is a huge overwhelming and singular experience.\nBenjamin Britten used a fugue in the final part of \"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\" (1946). The Henry Purcell theme is triumphantly cited at the end, making it a choral fugue.\nCanadian pianist and musical thinker Glenn Gould composed \"So You Want to Write a Fugue?\", a full-scale fugue set to a text that cleverly explicates its own musical form.\nOutside of classical music.\nFugues (or fughettas/fugatos) have been incorporated into genres outside Western classical music. Several examples exist within jazz, such as \"Bach goes to Town\", composed by the Welsh composer Alec Templeton and recorded by Benny Goodman in 1938, and \"Concorde\" composed by John Lewis and recorded by the Modern Jazz Quartet in 1955.\nIn \"Fugue for Tinhorns\" from the Broadway musical \"Guys and Dolls\", written by Frank Loesser, the characters Nicely-Nicely, Benny, and Rusty sing simultaneously about hot tips they each have in an upcoming horse race. In \"West Side Story\", the dance sequence following the song \"Cool\" is structured as a fugue. Interestingly, Leonard Bernstein quotes Beethoven's monumental \"Gro\u00dfe Fuge\" and employs Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, all in the context of a jazz-infused Broadway show stopper.\nA few examples also exist within progressive rock, such as the central movement of \"The Endless Enigma\" by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and \"On Reflection\" by Gentle Giant. On their EP of the same name, Vulfpeck has a composition called \"Fugue State\", which incorporates a fugue-like section between Theo Katzman (guitar), Joe Dart (bass), and Woody Goss (Wurlitzer keyboard).\nThe composer Matyas Seiber included an atonal or twelve-tone fugue, for flute trumpet and string quartet, in his score for the 1953 film \"Graham Sutherland\". The jazz composer and film composer, Michel Legrand, includes a fugue as the climax of his score (a classical theme with variations, and fugue) for Joseph Losey's 1972 film \"The Go-Between\" as well as several times in his score for Jacques Demy's 1970 film \"Peau d'\u00e2ne\". John Williams includes a fugue in his score for the 1990 film, \"Home Alone\", at the point where Kevin, accidentally left at home by his family, and realizing he is about to be attacked by a pair of bumbling burglars, begins to plan his elaborate defenses. Another fugue occurs at a similar point in the 1992 sequel film, \"\".\nDiscussion.\nMusical form or texture.\nA widespread view of the fugue is that it is not a musical form but rather a technique of composition.\nThe Austrian musicologist Erwin Ratz argues that the formal organization of a fugue involves not only the arrangement of its theme and episodes, but also its harmonic structure. In particular, the exposition and coda tend to emphasize the tonic key, whereas the episodes usually explore more distant tonalities. Ratz stressed, however, that this is the core, underlying form (\"Urform\") of the fugue, from which individual fugues may deviate.\nAlthough certain related keys are more commonly explored in fugal development, the overall structure of a fugue does not limit its harmonic structure. For example, a fugue may not even explore the dominant, one of the most closely related keys to the tonic. J.S. Bach's Fugue in B\u266d major from Book 1 of \"The Well Tempered Clavier\" explores the relative minor, the supertonic and the subdominant. This is unlike later forms such as the sonata, which clearly prescribes which keys are explored (typically the tonic and dominant in an ABA form). Then, many modern fugues dispense with traditional tonal harmonic scaffolding altogether, and either use serial (pitch-oriented) rules, or (as the Kyrie/Christe in Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's \"Requiem\", Witold Lutos\u0142awski works), use panchromatic, or even denser, harmonic spectra.\nPerceptions and aesthetics.\nThe fugue is the most complex of contrapuntal forms. In Ratz's words, \"fugal technique significantly burdens the shaping of musical ideas, and it was given only to the greatest geniuses, such as Bach and Beethoven, to breathe life into such an unwieldy form and make it the bearer of the highest thoughts.\" In presenting Bach's fugues as among the greatest of contrapuntal works, Peter Kivy points out that \"counterpoint itself, since time out of mind, has been associated in the thinking of musicians with the profound and the serious\" and argues that \"there seems to be some rational justification for their doing so.\"\nThis is related to the idea that restrictions create freedom for the composer, by directing their efforts. He also points out that fugal writing has its roots in improvisation, and was, during the Renaissance, practiced as an improvisatory art. Writing in 1555, Nicola Vicentino, for example, suggests that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the composer, having completed the initial imitative entrances, take the passage which has served as accompaniment to the theme and make it the basis for new imitative treatment, so that \"he will always have material with which to compose without having to stop and reflect\". This formulation of the basic rule for fugal improvisation anticipates later sixteenth-century discussions which deal with the improvisational technique at the keyboard more extensively.\nThe composer Arnold Schoenberg summarized fugal form as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fugue is a composition with maximum self-sufficiency of content. The more such self-sufficiency is manifest in the form of unity of material, the more all the shapes stem from one basic idea \u2014 that is to say, from a single theme and the way it is treated \u2014 the more artful it is. In its highest form, which may perhaps be a merely theoretical construction, nothing would claim a place in a fugue unless it were derived, at least indirectly, from the theme. To this extent \u2014 and also in many other ways\u2014 it also employs the principle of variation in the formulation of two or more forms of the theme (Dux and Comes), as also in the production of countersubjects and material for the episodes. But the theme\u2019s everchanging \u2018way of accompanying\u2019 \u2014 through other parts, through transposition of invertible combinations, through the various types of canon, and also through harmonic re-interpretation \u2014 all this, too, is best regarded as variation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In some cases, individuals may assume a new identity and be unable to recall personal information from before the onset of symptoms. It is classified as a mental and behavioral disorder and is variously categorized as a dissociative disorder, a conversion disorder, or a somatic symptom disorder. According to the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5), dissociative fugue is a subset of dissociative amnesia.\nRecovery from a fugue state typically results in the restoration of prior memories, and additional treatment is generally unnecessary. Episodes are not considered dissociative fugue if attributable to psychotropic substances, physical trauma, general medical conditions, or disorders such as dissociative identity disorder, delirium, or dementia. Dissociative fugue is often triggered by prolonged traumatic experiences and is most frequently associated with individuals who experienced childhood sexual abuse, during which they developed dissociative amnesia to suppress memories of the abuse.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSymptoms of dissociative fugue include mild confusion during the episode and, following recovery, possible feelings of depression, grief, shame, discomfort, or post-fugue anger. A key feature of the condition is the loss of one's identity.\nDiagnosis.\nBefore dissociative fugue can be diagnosed, either dissociative amnesia or dissociative identity disorder must be diagnosed. The only difference between dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and dissociative \"fugue\" is that the person affected by the latter travels or wanders. This traveling or wandering is typically associated with the amnesia-induced identity or the person's physical surroundings.\nSometimes dissociative fugue cannot be diagnosed until the patient returns to their pre-fugue identity and is distressed to find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances, sometimes with awareness of \"lost time\". The diagnosis is usually made retroactively when a doctor reviews the history and collects information that documents the circumstances before the patient left home, the travel itself, and the establishment of an alternative life.\nFunctional amnesia can also be situation-specific, varying from all forms and variations of trauma or generally violent experiences, with the person experiencing severe memory loss for a particular trauma. Committing homicide, experiencing or committing a violent crime such as rape or torture, experiencing combat violence, attempting suicide, and being in automobile accidents and natural disasters have all induced cases of situation-specific amnesia. In these unusual cases, care must be exercised in interpreting cases of dissociative amnesia when there are compelling motives to feign memory deficits for legal or financial reasons. However, although some fraction of dissociative amnesia cases can be explained in this fashion, it is generally acknowledged that true cases are not uncommon. Both global and situationally specific amnesia are often distinguished from the organic amnesic syndrome, in that the capacity to store new memories and experiences remains intact. Given the very delicate and oftentimes dramatic nature of memory loss in such cases, there usually is a concerted effort to help the person recover their identity and history. This will sometimes allow the subject to recover spontaneously, when particular cues are encountered.\nDefinition.\nThe cause of the fugue state is related to dissociative amnesia (code 300.12 of the DSM-IV codes), which has several other subtypes: selective amnesia, generalized amnesia, continuous amnesia, and systematized amnesia, in addition to the subtype \"dissociative fugue\".\nUnlike retrograde amnesia (which is popularly referred to simply as \"amnesia\", the state where someone forgets events before brain damage), dissociative amnesia is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, DSM-IV codes 291.1 &amp; 292.83) or a neurological or other general medical condition (e.g., amnestic disorder due to a head trauma, DSM-IV Code 294.0). It is a complex neuropsychological process.\nAs the person experiencing a dissociative fugue may have recently experienced the reappearance of an event or person representing an earlier trauma, the emergence of an armoring or defensive personality seems to be for some, a logical defense strategy in the situation.\nTherefore, the terminology \"fugue state\" may carry a slight linguistic distinction from \"dissociative fugue\", the former implying a greater degree of \"motion\". For the purposes of this article, then, a \"fugue state\" occurs while one is \"acting out\" a \"dissociative fugue\".\nThe \"DSM-IV\u200a\" defines \"dissociative fugue\" as:\nThe \"Merck Manual\u200a\" defines \"dissociative fugue\" as:\n One or more episodes of amnesia in which the inability to recall some or all of one's past and either the loss of one's identity or the formation of a new identity occur with sudden, unexpected, purposeful travel away from home.\nIn support of this definition, the \"Merck Manual\u200a\" further defines dissociative amnesia as:\n An inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.\nPrognosis.\nThe DSM-IV-TR states that the fugue may have a duration from days to months, and recovery is usually rapid. However, some cases may be refractory and resist treatment. An individual usually has only one episode.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In mechanics, force makes ideas like 'pushing' or 'pulling' mathematically precise. Because the magnitude and direction of a force are both important, force is a vector quantity (force vector). The SI unit of force is the newton (N), and force is often represented by the symbol F.\nForce plays an important role in classical mechanics. The concept of force is central to all three of Newton's laws of motion. Types of forces often encountered in classical mechanics include elastic, frictional, contact or \"normal\" forces, and gravitational. The rotational version of force is torque, which produces changes in the rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal mechanical stress. In the case of multiple forces, if the net force on an extended body is zero the body is in equilibrium.\nIn modern physics, which includes relativity and quantum mechanics, the laws governing motion are revised to rely on fundamental interactions as the ultimate origin of force. However, the understanding of force provided by classical mechanics is useful for practical purposes.\nDevelopment of the concept.\nPhilosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part, this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved for over two hundred years.\nBy the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia. With modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational. High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.\nPre-Newtonian concepts.\nSince antiquity the concept of force has been recognized as integral to the functioning of each of the simple machines. The mechanical advantage given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.\nAristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, were in their natural place when on the ground, and that they stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. An archer causes the arrow to move at the start of the flight, and it then sails through the air even though no discernible efficient cause acts upon it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation requires a continuous medium such as air to sustain the motion.\nThough Aristotelian physics was criticized as early as the 6th century, its shortcomings would not be corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei, who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus. Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force, for example friction. Galileo's idea that force is needed to change motion rather than to sustain it, further improved upon by Isaac Beeckman, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and Pierre Gassendi, became a key principle of Newtonian physics.\nIn the early 17th century, before Newton's \"Principia\", the term \"force\" () was applied to many physical and non-physical phenomena, e.g., for an acceleration of a point. The product of a point mass and the square of its velocity was named (live force) by Leibniz. The modern concept of force corresponds to Newton's (accelerating force).\nNewtonian mechanics.\nSir Isaac Newton described the motion of all objects using the concepts of inertia and force. In 1687, Newton published his magnum opus, \"Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\". In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that have dominated the way forces are described in physics to this day. The precise ways in which Newton's laws are expressed have evolved in step with new mathematical approaches.\nFirst law.\nNewton's first law of motion states that the natural behavior of an object at rest is to continue being at rest, and the natural behavior of an object moving at constant speed in a straight line is to continue moving at that constant speed along that straight line. The latter follows from the former because of the principle that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, i.e., all observers who do not feel themselves to be in motion. An observer moving in tandem with an object will see it as being at rest. So, its natural behavior will be to remain at rest with respect to that observer, which means that an observer who sees it moving at constant speed in a straight line will see it continuing to do so.\nSecond law.\nAccording to the first law, motion at constant speed in a straight line does not need a cause. It is \"change\" in motion that requires a cause, and Newton's second law gives the quantitative relationship between force and change of motion.\nNewton's second law states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time. If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.\nA modern statement of Newton's second law is a vector equation:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the momentum of the system, and formula_3 is the net (vector sum) force.399 If a body is in equilibrium, there is zero \"net\" force by definition (balanced forces may be present nevertheless). In contrast, the second law states that if there is an \"unbalanced\" force acting on an object it will result in the object's momentum changing over time.\nIn common engineering applications the mass in a system remains constant allowing as simple algebraic form for the second law. By the definition of momentum,\nformula_4\nwhere \"m\" is the mass and formula_5 is the velocity. If Newton's second law is applied to a system of constant mass, \"m\" may be moved outside the derivative operator. The equation then becomes\nformula_6\nBy substituting the definition of acceleration, the algebraic version of Newton's second law is derived:\nformula_7\nThird law.\nWhenever one body exerts a force on another, the latter simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. In vector form, if formula_8 is the force of body 1 on body 2 and formula_9 that of body 2 on body 1, then\nformula_10\nThis law is sometimes referred to as the \"action-reaction law\", with formula_11 called the \"action\" and formula_12 the \"reaction\".\nNewton's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are \"interactions\" between different bodies. and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.\nIn a system composed of object 1 and object 2, the net force on the system due to their mutual interactions is zero:\nformula_13\nMore generally, in a closed system of particles, all internal forces are balanced. The particles may accelerate with respect to each other but the center of mass of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on the system, it will make the center of mass accelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.\nCombining Newton's second and third laws, it is possible to show that the linear momentum of a system is conserved in any closed system. In a system of two particles, if formula_14 is the momentum of object 1 and formula_15 the momentum of object 2, then\nformula_16\nUsing similar arguments, this can be generalized to a system with an arbitrary number of particles. In general, as long as all forces are due to the interaction of objects with mass, it is possible to define a system such that net momentum is never lost nor gained.ch.12\nDefining \"force\".\nSome textbooks use Newton's second law as a \"definition\" of force. However, for the equation formula_17 for a constant mass formula_18 to then have any predictive content, it must be combined with further information. Moreover, inferring that a force is present because a body is accelerating is only valid in an inertial frame of reference. The question of which aspects of Newton's laws to take as definitions and which to regard as holding physical content has been answered in various ways, which ultimately do not affect how the theory is used in practice. Notable physicists, philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include Ernst Mach and Walter Noll.\nCombining forces.\nForces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"vector quantities\". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous.\nHistorically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act on a point particle, the resulting force, the \"resultant\" (also called the \"net force\"), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action.ch.12\nFree-body diagrams can be used as a convenient way to keep track of forces acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that graphical vector addition can be done to determine the net force.\nAs well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right angles to the other two.ch.12\nEquilibrium.\nWhen all the forces that act upon an object are balanced, then the object is said to be in a state of equilibrium. Hence, equilibrium occurs when the resultant force acting on a point particle is zero (that is, the vector sum of all forces is zero). When dealing with an extended body, it is also necessary that the net torque be zero. A body is in \"static equilibrium\" with respect to a frame of reference if it at rest and not accelerating, whereas a body in \"dynamic equilibrium\" is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, i.e., moving but not accelerating. What one observer sees as static equilibrium, another can see as dynamic equilibrium and vice versa.\nStatic.\nStatic equilibrium was understood well before the invention of classical mechanics. Objects that are not accelerating have zero net force acting on them.\nThe simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object on a level surface is pulled (attracted) downward toward the center of the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.\nPushing against an object that rests on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force \"exactly\" balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.\nA static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances. For example, an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the \"spring reaction force\", which equals the object's weight. Using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); Archimedes' principle for buoyancy; Archimedes' analysis of the lever; Boyle's law for gas pressure; and Hooke's law for springs. These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his three laws of motion.ch.12\nDynamic.\nDynamic equilibrium was first described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic. Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an \"absolute rest frame\" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. When this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.\nMoreover, any object traveling at a constant velocity must be subject to zero net force (resultant force). This is the definition of dynamic equilibrium: when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant velocity. A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. When kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.ch.12\nExamples of forces in classical mechanics.\nSome forces are consequences of the fundamental ones. In such situations, idealized models can be used to gain physical insight. For example, each solid object is considered a rigid body.\nGravitational force or Gravity.\nWhat we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton. Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as formula_19 and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth. This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of formula_18 will experience a force:\nformula_21\nFor an object in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, the force of gravity is opposed by the reaction forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.ch.12\nNewton's contribution to gravitational theory was to unify the motions of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. He proposed a law of gravity that could account for the celestial motions that had been described earlier using Kepler's laws of planetary motion.\nNewton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances. In particular, Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law. Further, Newton realized that the acceleration of a body due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the other attracting body. Combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass (formula_22) and the radius (formula_23) of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration:\nformula_24\nwhere formula_25 is the distance between the two objects' centers of mass and formula_26 is the unit vector pointed in the direction away from the center of the first object toward the center of the second object.\nThis formula was powerful enough to stand as the basis for all subsequent descriptions of motion within the Solar System until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies on a planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.\nElectromagnetic.\nThe electrostatic force was first described in 1784 by Coulomb as a force that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the electrostatic force were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent of the mass of the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle. Coulomb's law unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.\nSubsequent mathematicians and physicists found the construct of the \"electric field\" to be useful for determining the electrostatic force on an electric charge at any point in space. The electric field was based on using a hypothetical \"test charge\" anywhere in space and then using Coulomb's law to determine the electrostatic force. Thus the electric field anywhere in space is defined as\nformula_27\nwhere formula_28 is the magnitude of the hypothetical test charge. Similarly, the idea of the \"magnetic field\" was introduced to express how magnets can influence one another at a distance. The Lorentz force law gives the force upon a body with charge formula_28 due to electric and magnetic fields:\nformula_30\nwhere formula_3 is the electromagnetic force, formula_32 is the electric field at the body's location, formula_33 is the magnetic field, and formula_5 is the velocity of the particle. The magnetic contribution to the Lorentz force is the cross product of the velocity vector with the magnetic field.\nThe origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs. These \"Maxwell's equations\" fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges, and the interactions of the fields themselves. This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be \"self-generating\" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light. This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nNormal.\nWhen objects are in contact, the force directly between them is called the normal force, the component of the total force in the system exerted normal to the interface between the objects. The normal force is closely related to Newton's third law. The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.ch.12\nFriction.\nFriction is a force that opposes relative motion of two bodies. At the macroscopic scale, the frictional force is directly related to the normal force at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: static friction and kinetic friction.\nThe static friction force (formula_35) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface up to the limit specified by the coefficient of static friction (formula_36) multiplied by the normal force (formula_37). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality:\nformula_38\nThe kinetic friction force (formula_39) is typically independent of both the forces applied and the movement of the object. Thus, the magnitude of the force equals:\nformula_40\nwhere formula_41 is the coefficient of kinetic friction. The coefficient of kinetic friction is normally less than the coefficient of static friction.\nTension.\nTension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and do not stretch. They can be combined with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action\u2013reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a configuration that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. Such machines allow a mechanical advantage for a corresponding increase in the length of displaced string needed to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.ch.12\nSpring.\nA simple elastic force acts to return a spring to its natural length. An ideal spring is taken to be massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and infinitely stretchable. Such springs exert forces that push when contracted, or pull when extended, in proportion to the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. This linear relationship was described by Robert Hooke in 1676, for whom Hooke's law is named. If formula_42 is the displacement, the force exerted by an ideal spring equals:\nformula_43\nwhere formula_44 is the spring constant (or force constant), which is particular to the spring. The minus sign accounts for the tendency of the force to act in opposition to the applied load.ch.12\nCentripetal.\nFor an object in uniform circular motion, the net force acting on the object equals:\nformula_45\nwhere formula_18 is the mass of the object, formula_47 is the velocity of the object and formula_25 is the distance to the center of the circular path and formula_49 is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the net force felt by the object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. More generally, the net force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.ch.12\nContinuum mechanics.\nNewton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects. In real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object. For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow, contract, expand, or otherwise change shape, the theories of continuum mechanics describe the way forces affect the material. For example, in extended fluids, differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows:\nformula_50\nwhere formula_51 is the volume of the object in the fluid and formula_52 is the scalar function that describes the pressure at all locations in space. Pressure gradients and differentials result in the buoyant force for fluids suspended in gravitational fields, winds in atmospheric science, and the lift associated with aerodynamics and flight.ch.12\nA specific instance of such a force that is associated with dynamic pressure is fluid resistance: a body force that resists the motion of an object through a fluid due to viscosity. For so-called \"Stokes' drag\" the force is approximately proportional to the velocity, but opposite in direction:\nformula_53\nwhere:\nMore formally, forces in continuum mechanics are fully described by a stress tensor with terms that are roughly defined as\nformula_56\nwhere formula_57 is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress tensor is being calculated. This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the matrix diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including also tensile stresses and compressions.\nFictitious.\nThere are forces that are frame dependent, meaning that they appear due to the adoption of non-Newtonian (that is, non-inertial) reference frames. Such forces include the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force. These forces are considered fictitious because they do not exist in frames of reference that are not accelerating.ch.12 Because these forces are not genuine they are also referred to as \"pseudo forces\".\nIn general relativity, gravity becomes a fictitious force that arises in situations where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry.\nConcepts derived from force.\nRotation and torque.\nForces that cause extended objects to rotate are associated with torques. Mathematically, the torque of a force formula_3 is defined relative to an arbitrary reference point as the cross product:\nformula_59\nwhere formula_60 is the position vector of the force application point relative to the reference point.\nTorque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position, angular velocity for velocity, and angular momentum for momentum. As a consequence of Newton's first law of motion, there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque. Likewise, Newton's second law of motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body:\nformula_61\nwhere\nThis provides a definition for the moment of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including precession and nutation.\nEquivalently, the differential form of Newton's second law provides an alternative definition of torque:\nformula_64\nwhere formula_65 is the angular momentum of the particle.\nNewton's third law of motion requires that all objects exerting torques themselves experience equal and opposite torques, and therefore also directly implies the conservation of angular momentum for closed systems that experience rotations and revolutions through the action of internal torques.\nYank.\nThe yank is defined as the rate of change of force\nformula_66\nThe term is used in biomechanical analysis, athletic assessment and robotic control. The second (\"tug\"), third (\"snatch\"), fourth (\"shake\"), and higher derivatives are rarely used.\nKinematic integrals.\nForces can be used to define a number of physical concepts by integrating with respect to kinematic variables. For example, integrating with respect to time gives the definition of impulse:\nformula_67\nwhich by Newton's second law must be equivalent to the change in momentum (yielding the Impulse momentum theorem).\nSimilarly, integrating with respect to position gives a definition for the work done by a force:\nformula_68\nwhich is equivalent to changes in kinetic energy (yielding the work energy theorem).\nPower \"P\" is the rate of change d\"W\"/d\"t\" of the work \"W\", as the trajectory is extended by a position change formula_69 in a time interval d\"t\":\nformula_70\nso\nformula_71\nwith formula_72 the velocity.\nPotential energy.\nInstead of a force, often the mathematically related concept of a potential energy field is used. For instance, the gravitational force acting upon an object can be seen as the action of the gravitational field that is present at the object's location. Restating mathematically the definition of energy (via the definition of work), a potential scalar field formula_73 is defined as that field whose gradient is equal and opposite to the force produced at every point:\nformula_74\nForces can be classified as conservative or nonconservative. Conservative forces are equivalent to the gradient of a potential while nonconservative forces are not.ch.12\nConservation.\nA conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.ch.12\nConservative forces include gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the spring force. Each of these forces has models that are dependent on a position often given as a radial vector formula_60 emanating from spherically symmetric potentials. Examples of this follow:\nFor gravity:\nformula_76\nwhere formula_77 is the gravitational constant, and formula_78 is the mass of object \"n\".\nFor electrostatic forces:\nformula_79\nwhere formula_80 is electric permittivity of free space, and formula_81 is the electric charge of object \"n\".\nFor spring forces:\nformula_82\nwhere formula_44 is the spring constant.ch.12\nFor certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to a simple gradient of potentials. This is often due a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, static friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. For any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.ch.12\nThe connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.ch.12\nUnits.\nThe SI unit of force is the newton (symbol N), which is the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared, or kg\u00b7m\u00b7s\u22122.The corresponding CGS unit is the dyne, the force required to accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared, or g\u00b7cm\u00b7s\u22122. A newton is thus equal to 100,000\u00a0dynes.\nThe gravitational foot-pound-second English unit of force is the pound-force (lbf), defined as the force exerted by gravity on a pound-mass in the standard gravitational field of 9.80665\u00a0m\u00b7s\u22122. The pound-force provides an alternative unit of mass: one slug is the mass that will accelerate by one foot per second squared when acted on by one pound-force. An alternative unit of force in a different foot\u2013pound\u2013second system, the absolute fps system, is the poundal, defined as the force required to accelerate a one-pound mass at a rate of one foot per second squared.\nThe pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1\u00a0m\u00b7s\u22122 when subjected to a force of 1\u00a0kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated, sometimes used for expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque.\n See also \"Ton-force\".\nRevisions of the force concept.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, new physical ideas emerged to explain experimental results in astronomical and submicroscopic realms. As discussed below, relativity alters the definition of momentum and quantum mechanics reuses the concept of \"force\" in microscopic contexts where Newton's laws do not apply directly.\nSpecial theory of relativity.\nIn the special theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent (as can be seen by calculating the work required to accelerate an object). When an object's velocity increases, so does its energy and hence its mass equivalent (inertia). It thus requires more force to accelerate it the same amount than it did at a lower velocity. Newton's second law,\nformula_84\nremains valid because it is a mathematical definition. But for momentum to be conserved at relativistic relative velocity, formula_47, momentum must be redefined as:\nformula_86\nwhere formula_87 is the rest mass and formula_88 the speed of light.\nThe expression relating force and acceleration for a particle with constant non-zero rest mass formula_18 moving in the formula_90 direction at velocity formula_47 is:\nformula_92\nwhere\nformula_93\nis called the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor increases steeply as the relative velocity approaches the speed of light. Consequently, the greater and greater force must be applied to produce the same acceleration at extreme velocity. The relative velocity cannot reach formula_88.\u00a715\u20138\nIf formula_47 is very small compared to formula_88, then formula_97 is very close to 1 and\nformula_98\nis a close approximation. Even for use in relativity, one can restore the form of\nformula_99\nthrough the use of four-vectors. This relation is correct in relativity when formula_100 is the four-force, formula_18 is the invariant mass, and formula_102 is the four-acceleration.\nThe \"general\" theory of relativity incorporates a more radical departure from the Newtonian way of thinking about force, specifically gravitational force. This reimagining of the nature of gravity is described more fully below.\nQuantum mechanics.\nQuantum mechanics is a theory of physics originally developed in order to understand microscopic phenomena: behavior at the scale of molecules, atoms or subatomic particles. Generally and loosely speaking, the smaller a system is, the more an adequate mathematical model will require understanding quantum effects. The conceptual underpinning of quantum physics is different from that of classical physics. Instead of thinking about quantities like position, momentum, and energy as properties that an object \"has\", one considers what result might \"appear\" when a measurement of a chosen type is performed. Quantum mechanics allows the physicist to calculate the probability that a chosen measurement will elicit a particular result. The expectation value for a measurement is the average of the possible results it might yield, weighted by their probabilities of occurrence.\nIn quantum mechanics, interactions are typically described in terms of energy rather than force. The Ehrenfest theorem provides a connection between quantum expectation values and the classical concept of force, a connection that is necessarily inexact, as quantum physics is fundamentally different from classical. In quantum physics, the Born rule is used to calculate the expectation values of a position measurement or a momentum measurement. These expectation values will generally change over time; that is, depending on the time at which (for example) a position measurement is performed, the probabilities for its different possible outcomes will vary. The Ehrenfest theorem says, roughly speaking, that the equations describing how these expectation values change over time have a form reminiscent of Newton's second law, with a force defined as the negative derivative of the potential energy. However, the more pronounced quantum effects are in a given situation, the more difficult it is to derive meaningful conclusions from this resemblance.\nQuantum mechanics also introduces two new constraints that interact with forces at the submicroscopic scale and which are especially important for atoms. Despite the strong attraction of the nucleus, the uncertainty principle limits the minimum extent of an electron probability distribution and the Pauli exclusion principle prevents electrons from sharing the same probability distribution. This gives rise to an emergent pressure known as degeneracy pressure. The dynamic equilibrium between the degeneracy pressure and the attractive electromagnetic force give atoms, molecules, liquids, and solids stability.\nQuantum field theory.\nIn modern particle physics, forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be \"fundamental interactions\".\nWhile sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe them through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex. The utility of Feynman diagrams is that other types of physical phenomena that are part of the general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and antineutrino, an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the weak nuclear force.\nFundamental interactions.\nAll of the known forces of the universe are classified into four fundamental interactions. The strong and the weak forces act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions operating within quantum mechanics, including the constraints introduced by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Pauli exclusion principle. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between atoms of two surfaces. The forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are also the result of electromagnetic forces. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.\nThe fundamental theories for forces developed from the unification of different ideas. For example, Newton's universal theory of gravitation showed that the force responsible for objects falling near the surface of the Earth is also the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the Moon) and around the Sun (the planets). Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This Standard Model of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation.\nGravitational.\nNewton's law of gravitation is an example of \"action at a distance\": one body, like the Sun, exerts an influence upon any other body, like the Earth, no matter how far apart they are. Moreover, this action at a distance is \"instantaneous.\" According to Newton's theory, the one body shifting position changes the gravitational pulls felt by all other bodies, all at the same instant of time. Albert Einstein recognized that this was inconsistent with special relativity and its prediction that influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light. So, he sought a new theory of gravitation that would be relativistically consistent. Mercury's orbit did not match that predicted by Newton's law of gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of an undiscovered planet (Vulcan) that could explain the discrepancies. When Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) he focused on Mercury's problematic orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy. This was the first time that Newton's theory of gravity had been shown to be inexact.\nSince then, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved spacetime \u2013 defined as the shortest spacetime path between two spacetime events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of spacetime can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in spacetime is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the \"ballistic trajectory\" of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its spacetime trajectory is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as \"gravitational force\".\nElectromagnetic.\nMaxwell's equations and the set of techniques built around them adequately describe a wide range of physics involving force in electricity and magnetism. This classical theory already includes relativity effects. Understanding quantized electromagnetic interactions between elementary particles requires quantum electrodynamics (QED). In QED, photons are fundamental exchange particles, describing all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.\nStrong nuclear.\nThere are two \"nuclear forces\", which today are usually described as interactions that take place in quantum theories of particle physics. The strong nuclear force is the force responsible for the structural integrity of atomic nuclei, and gains its name from its ability to overpower the electromagnetic repulsion between protons.\nThe strong force is today understood to represent the interactions between quarks and gluons as detailed by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The strong force is the fundamental force mediated by gluons, acting upon quarks, antiquarks, and the gluons themselves. The strong force only acts \"directly\" upon elementary particles. A residual is observed between hadrons (notably, the nucleons in atomic nuclei), known as the nuclear force. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons that form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, the classical transmitters of the nuclear force. The failure of many searches for free quarks has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called color confinement.232\nWeak nuclear.\nUnique among the fundamental interactions, the weak nuclear force creates no bound states. The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons. Since the weak force is mediated by two types of bosons, it can be divided into two types of interaction or \"vertices\" \u2014 charged current, involving the electrically charged W+ and W\u2212 bosons, and neutral current, involving electrically neutral Z0 bosons. The most familiar effect of weak interaction is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity. This is a type of charged-current interaction. The word \"weak\" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately . Such temperatures occurred in the plasma collisions in the early moments of the Big Bang.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This project was named \"Super-Foonly\", and was developed by a team led by Phil Petit, Jack Holloway, and Dave Poole. The name itself came from FOO NLI, an error message emitted by a PDP-10 assembler at SAIL meaning \"FOO is Not a Legal Identifier\". In 1974, DARPA cut the funding, and a large part of the team went to DEC to develop the \"PDP-10 model KL10\", based on the Super-Foonly.\nBut Dave Poole, with Phil Petit and Jack Holloway, preferred to found the Foonly Company in 1976, to try to build a series of computers based on the Super-Foonly.\nDuring the early 1980s, after the construction of the first and only F1, Foonly built and sold some low cost DEC PDP-10 compatible machines: the F2, F4, F4B and F5.\nIn 1983, after the cancellation of the DEC Jupiter project, Foonly tried to propose a new F1, but it was eclipsed by Systems Concepts and their Mars project.

The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reactions regardless of the rest of the molecule's composition. This enables systematic prediction of chemical reactions and behavior of chemical compounds and the design of chemical synthesis. The reactivity of a functional group can be modified by other functional groups nearby. Functional group interconversion can be used in retrosynthetic analysis to plan organic synthesis.\nA functional group is a group of atoms in a molecule with distinctive chemical properties, regardless of the other atoms in the molecule. The atoms in a functional group are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. For repeating units of polymers, functional groups attach to their nonpolar core of carbon atoms and thus add chemical character to carbon chains. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion. Functional groups binding to a central atom in a coordination complex are called \"ligands\". Complexation and solvation are also caused by specific interactions of functional groups. In the common rule of thumb \"like dissolves like\", it is the shared or mutually well-interacting functional groups which give rise to solubility. For example, sugar dissolves in water because both share the hydroxyl functional group () and hydroxyls interact strongly with each other. Plus, when functional groups are more electronegative than atoms they attach to, the functional groups will become polar, and the otherwise nonpolar molecules containing these functional groups become polar and so become soluble in some aqueous environment.\nCombining the names of functional groups with the names of the parent alkanes generates what is termed a systematic nomenclature for naming organic compounds. In traditional nomenclature, the first carbon atom after the carbon that attaches to the functional group is called the alpha carbon; the second, beta carbon, the third, gamma carbon, etc. If there is another functional group at a carbon, it may be named with the Greek letter, e.g., the gamma-amine in gamma-aminobutyric acid is on the third carbon of the carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid group. IUPAC conventions call for numeric labeling of the position, e.g. 4-aminobutanoic acid. In traditional names various qualifiers are used to label isomers, for example, isopropanol (IUPAC name: propan-2-ol) is an isomer of n-propanol (propan-1-ol). The term moiety has some overlap with the term \"functional group\". However, a moiety is an entire \"half\" of a molecule, which can be not only a single functional group, but also a larger unit consisting of multiple functional groups. For example, an \"aryl moiety\" may be any group containing an aromatic ring, regardless of how many functional groups the said aryl has.\nTable of common functional groups.\nThe following is a list of common functional groups. In the formulas, the symbols R and R' usually denote an attached hydrogen, or a hydrocarbon side chain of any length, but may sometimes refer to any group of atoms.\nHydrocarbons.\nHydrocarbons are a class of molecule that is defined by functional groups called hydrocarbyls that contain only carbon and hydrogen, but vary in the number and order of double bonds. Each one differs in type (and scope) of reactivity.\nThere are also a large number of branched or ring alkanes that have specific names, e.g., tert-butyl, bornyl, cyclohexyl, etc. There are several functional groups that contain an alkene such as vinyl group, allyl group, or acrylic group. Hydrocarbons may form charged structures: positively charged carbocations or negative carbanions. Carbocations are often named \"-um\". Examples are tropylium and triphenylmethyl cations and the cyclopentadienyl anion.\nGroups containing halogens.\nHaloalkanes are a class of molecule that is defined by a carbon\u2013halogen bond. This bond can be relatively weak (in the case of an iodoalkane) or quite stable (as in the case of a fluoroalkane). In general, with the exception of fluorinated compounds, haloalkanes readily undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions or elimination reactions. The substitution on the carbon, the acidity of an adjacent proton, the solvent conditions, etc. all can influence the outcome of the reactivity.\nGroups containing oxygen.\nCompounds that contain C\u2013O bonds each possess differing reactivity based upon the location and hybridization of the C\u2013O bond, owing to the electron-withdrawing effect of sp-hybridized oxygen (carbonyl groups) and the donating effects of sp2-hybridized oxygen (alcohol groups).\nGroups containing nitrogen.\nCompounds that contain nitrogen in this category may contain C-O bonds, such as in the case of amides.\nGroups containing sulfur.\nCompounds that contain sulfur exhibit unique chemistry due to sulfur's ability to form more bonds than oxygen, its lighter analogue on the periodic table. Substitutive nomenclature (marked as prefix in table) is preferred over functional class nomenclature (marked as suffix in table) for sulfides, disulfides, sulfoxides and sulfones.\nGroups containing phosphorus.\nCompounds that contain phosphorus exhibit unique chemistry due to the ability of phosphorus to form more bonds than nitrogen, its lighter analogue on the periodic table.\nGroups containing boron.\nCompounds containing boron exhibit unique chemistry due to their having partially filled octets and therefore acting as Lewis acids.\nGroups containing metals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;note 1 Fluorine is too electronegative to be bonded to magnesium; it becomes an ionic salt instead.\nNames of radicals or moieties.\nThese names are used to refer to the moieties themselves or to radical species, and also to form the names of halides and substituents in larger molecules.\nWhen the parent hydrocarbon is unsaturated, the suffix (\"-yl\", \"-ylidene\", or \"-ylidyne\") replaces \"-ane\" (e.g. \"ethane\" becomes \"ethyl\"); otherwise, the suffix replaces only the final \"-e\" (e.g. \"ethyne\" becomes \"ethynyl\").\nWhen used to refer to moieties, multiple single bonds differ from a single multiple bond. For example, a methylene bridge (methanediyl) has two single bonds, whereas a methylidene group (methylidene) has one double bond. Suffixes can be combined, as in methylidyne (triple bond) vs. methylylidene (single bond and double bond) vs. methanetriyl (three double bonds).\nThere are some retained names, such as methylene for methanediyl, 1,x-phenylene for phenyl-1,x-diyl (where x is 2, 3, or 4), carbyne for methylidyne, and trityl for triphenylmethyl.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many fractals appear similar at various scales, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. This exhibition of similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales is called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge, the shape is called affine self-similar. Fractal geometry relates to the mathematical branch of measure theory by their Hausdorff dimension.\nOne way that fractals are different from finite geometric figures is how they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a filled polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the conventional dimension of the filled polygon). Likewise, if the radius of a filled sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the conventional dimension of the filled sphere). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an integer and is in general greater than its conventional dimension. This power is called the fractal dimension of the geometric object, to distinguish it from the conventional dimension (which is formally called the topological dimension).\nAnalytically, many fractals are nowhere differentiable. An infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line \u2013 although it is still topologically 1-dimensional, its fractal dimension indicates that it locally fills space more efficiently than an ordinary line.\nStarting in the 17th century with notions of recursion, fractals have moved through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment to the study of continuous but not differentiable functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of Bernard Bolzano, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass, and on to the coining of the word \"fractal\" in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century.\nThere is some disagreement among mathematicians about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as \"beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals.\" More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot defined \"fractal\" as follows: \"A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension.\" Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to this: \"A fractal is a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.\" Still later, Mandelbrot proposed \"to use \"fractal\" without a pedantic definition, to use \"fractal dimension\" as a generic term applicable to \"all\" the variants\".\nThe consensus among mathematicians is that theoretical fractals are infinitely self-similar iterated and detailed mathematical constructs, of which many examples have been formulated and studied. Fractals are not limited to geometric patterns, but can also describe processes in time. Fractal patterns with various degrees of self-similarity have been rendered or studied in visual, physical, and aural media and found in nature, technology, art, and architecture. Fractals are of particular relevance in the field of chaos theory because they show up in the geometric depictions of most chaotic processes (typically either as attractors or as boundaries between basins of attraction).\nEtymology.\nThe term \"fractal\" was coined by the mathematician Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin , meaning \"broken\" or \"fractured\", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional dimensions to geometric patterns in nature.\nIntroduction.\nThe word \"fractal\" often has different connotations for mathematicians and the general public, where the public is more likely to be familiar with fractal art than the mathematical concept. The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally, even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with a little mathematical background.\nThe feature of \"self-similarity\", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over. Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the infinite regress in parallel mirrors or the homunculus, the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head ...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.\nThis idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without much mathematical background: Having a fractal dimension greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric shapes are usually perceived. A straight line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be one-dimensional; if such a figure is rep-tiled into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, then there are always three equal pieces. A solid square is understood to be two-dimensional; if such a figure is rep-tiled into pieces each scaled down by a factor of 1/3 in both dimensions, there are a total of 32 = 9 pieces.\nWe see that for ordinary self-similar objects, being n-dimensional means that when it is rep-tiled into pieces each scaled down by a scale-factor of 1/\"r\", there are a total of \"r\"\"n\" pieces. Now, consider the Koch curve. It can be rep-tiled into four sub-copies, each scaled down by a scale-factor of 1/3. So, strictly by analogy, we can consider the \"dimension\" of the Koch curve as being the unique real number \"D\" that satisfies 3\"D\" = 4. This number is called the \"fractal dimension\" of the Koch curve; it is not the conventionally perceived dimension of a curve. In general, a key property of fractals is that the fractal dimension differs from the \"conventionally understood\" dimension (formally called the topological dimension).\nThis also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are \"nowhere differentiable\". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways. To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of measuring with a tape measure. But in measuring an infinitely \"wiggly\" fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the jagged pattern would always re-appear, at arbitrarily small scales, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve. The result is that one must need infinite tape to perfectly cover the entire curve, i.e. the snowflake has an infinite perimeter.\nHistory.\nThe history of fractals traces a path from chiefly theoretical studies to modern applications in computer graphics, with several notable people contributing canonical fractal forms along the way. \nA common theme in traditional African architecture is the use of fractal scaling, whereby small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.\nAccording to Pickover, the mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz pondered recursive self-similarity (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the straight line was self-similar in this sense).\nIn his writings, Leibniz used the term \"fractional exponents\", but lamented that \"Geometry\" did not yet know of them. Indeed, according to various historical accounts, after that point few mathematicians tackled the issues and the work of those who did remained obscured largely because of resistance to such unfamiliar emerging concepts, which were sometimes referred to as mathematical \"monsters\". Thus, it was not until two centuries had passed that on July 18, 1872 Karl Weierstrass presented the first definition of a function with a graph that would today be considered a fractal, having the non-intuitive property of being everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable at the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences.\nIn addition, the quotient difference becomes arbitrarily large as the summation index increases. Not long after that, in 1883, Georg Cantor, who attended lectures by Weierstrass, published examples of subsets of the real line known as Cantor sets, which had unusual properties and are now recognized as fractals. Also in the last part of that century, Felix Klein and Henri Poincar\u00e9 introduced a category of fractal that has come to be called \"self-inverse\" fractals.\nOne of the next milestones came in 1904, when Helge von Koch, extending ideas of Poincar\u00e9 and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand-drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the Koch snowflake. Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski constructed his famous triangle then, one year later, his carpet. By 1918, two French mathematicians, Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia, though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what is now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping complex numbers and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about attractors and repellors (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important in the study of fractals.\nVery shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, Felix Hausdorff expanded the definition of \"dimension\", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have non-integer dimensions. The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by Paul L\u00e9vy, who, in his 1938 paper \"Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole\", described a new fractal curve, the L\u00e9vy C curve.\nDifferent researchers have postulated that without the aid of modern computer graphics, early investigators were limited to what they could depict in manual drawings, so lacked the means to visualize the beauty and appreciate some of the implications of many of the patterns they had discovered (the Julia set, for instance, could only be visualized through a few iterations as very simple drawings). That changed, however, in the 1960s, when Benoit Mandelbrot started writing about self-similarity in papers such as \"How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension\", which built on earlier work by Lewis Fry Richardson.\nIn 1975, Mandelbrot solidified hundreds of years of thought and mathematical development in coining the word \"fractal\" and illustrated his mathematical definition with striking computer-constructed visualizations. These images, such as of his canonical Mandelbrot set, captured the popular imagination; many of them were based on recursion, leading to the popular meaning of the term \"fractal\".\nIn 1980, Loren Carpenter gave a presentation at the SIGGRAPH where he introduced his software for generating and rendering fractally generated landscapes.\nDefinition and characteristics.\nOne often cited description that Mandelbrot published to describe geometric fractals is \"a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole\"; this is generally helpful but limited. Authors disagree on the exact definition of \"fractal\", but most usually elaborate on the basic ideas of self-similarity and the unusual relationship fractals have with the space they are embedded in.\nOne point agreed on is that fractal patterns are characterized by fractal dimensions, but whereas these numbers quantify complexity (i.e., changing detail with changing scale), they neither uniquely describe nor specify details of how to construct particular fractal patterns. In 1975 when Mandelbrot coined the word \"fractal\", he did so to denote an object whose Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension is greater than its topological dimension. However, this requirement is not met by space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve.\nBecause of the trouble involved in finding one definition for fractals, some argue that fractals should not be strictly defined at all. According to Falconer, fractals should be only generally characterized by a gestalt of the following features;\n* Exact self-similarity: identical at all scales, such as the Koch snowflake\n* Quasi self-similarity: approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the Mandelbrot set's satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.\n* Statistical self-similarity: repeats a pattern stochastically so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., randomly generated fractals like the well-known example of the coastline of Britain for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines fractals like the Koch snowflake.\n* Qualitative self-similarity: as in a time series\n* Multifractal scaling: characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule\nAs a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, and is easily described in Euclidean language without a need for recursion.\nWhen Mandelbrot introduced the term fractal, he excluded magnification range as a defining characteristic in order to accommodate physical fractals with more limited ranges than their mathematical counterparts.\nCommon techniques for generating fractals.\nImages of fractals can be created by fractal generating programs. Because of the butterfly effect, a small change in a single variable can have an unpredictable outcome.\nApplications.\nSimulated fractals.\nFractal patterns have been modeled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or natural phenomena with fractal features. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for fractal analysis. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed elsewhere. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being \"fractals\" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display artifacts which are not characteristics of true fractals.\nModeled fractals may be sounds, digital images, electrochemical patterns, circadian rhythms, etc.\nFractal patterns have been reconstructed in physical 3-dimensional space and virtually, often called \"in silico\" modeling. Models of fractals are generally created using fractal-generating software that implements techniques such as those outlined above. As one illustration, trees, ferns, cells of the nervous system, blood and lung vasculature, and other branching patterns in nature can be modeled on a computer by using recursive algorithms and L-systems techniques.\nThe recursive nature of some patterns is obvious in certain examples\u2014a branch from a tree or a frond from a fern is a miniature replica of the whole: not identical, but similar in nature. Similarly, random fractals have been used to describe/create many highly irregular real-world objects, such as coastlines and mountains. A limitation of modeling fractals is that resemblance of a fractal model to a natural phenomenon does not prove that the phenomenon being modeled is formed by a process similar to the modeling algorithms.\nNatural phenomena with fractal features.\nApproximate fractals found in nature display self-similarity over extended, but finite, scale ranges. The connection between fractals and leaves, for instance, is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees. Phenomena known to have fractal features include: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFractals in cell biology.\nFractals often appear in the realm of living organisms where they arise through branching processes and other complex pattern formation. Richard Taylor and co-workers have shown that the dendritic branches of neurons form fractal patterns. Ian Wong and co-workers have shown that migrating cells can form fractals by clustering and branching. Nerve cells function through processes at the cell surface, with phenomena that are enhanced by largely increasing the surface to volume ratio. As a consequence nerve cells often are found to form into fractal patterns. These processes are crucial in cell physiology and different pathologies.\nMultiple subcellular structures also are found to assemble into fractals. Diego Krapf has shown that through branching processes the actin filaments in human cells assemble into fractal patterns. Similarly Matthias Weiss showed that the endoplasmic reticulum displays fractal features. The current understanding is that fractals are ubiquitous in cell biology, from proteins, to organelles, to whole cells.\nIn creative works.\nFractal expressionism is used to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.\nSince 1999 numerous scientific groups have performed fractal analysis on over 50 paintings created by Jackson Pollock by pouring paint directly onto horizontal canvasses, see for example. In 2015, fractal analysis was used to achieve a 93% success rate in distinguishing real from imitation Pollocks. A 2024 study used an artificial intelligence technique based on fractals to achieve a 99% success rate.\nDecalcomania, a technique used by artists such as Max Ernst, can produce fractal-like patterns. It involves pressing paint between two surfaces and pulling them apart.\nCyberneticist Ron Eglash has suggested that fractal geometry and mathematics are prevalent in African art, games, divination, trade, and architecture. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles. Hokky Situngkir also suggested the similar properties in Indonesian traditional art, batik, and ornaments found in traditional houses.\nEthnomathematician Ron Eglash has discussed the planned layout of Benin city using fractals as the basis, not only in the city itself and the villages but even in the rooms of houses. He commented that \"When Europeans first came to Africa, they considered the architecture very disorganised and thus primitive. It never occurred to them that the Africans might have been using a form of mathematics that they hadn't even discovered yet.\"\nIn a 1996 interview with Michael Silverblatt, David Foster Wallace explained that the structure of the first draft of \"Infinite Jest\" he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch was inspired by fractals, specifically the Sierpinski triangle (a.k.a. Sierpinski gasket), but that the edited novel is \"more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket\".\nSome works by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, such as Circle Limit III, contain shapes repeated to infinity that become smaller and smaller as they get near to the edges, in a pattern that would always look the same if zoomed in.\nBiophilic fractals are patterns designed to induce the health and well-being benefits associated with exposure to nature's scenery. These include stress-reduction and enhanced cognitive capacity. Designers and architects incorporate biophilic fractals into the built environment to counter the fact that people spend 92% of their time indoors and away from nature's scenery. The Fractal Chapel designed by INNOCAD architecture in the state hospital in Graz, Austria, is a prominent example and recipient of the 2025 IIDA (International Interior Design Association) Best of Competition Award.\nPhysiological responses: Fractal Fluency.\nFractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature's fractal scenery, people's visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people's eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a 'comfort zone' so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Jackson Pollock's fractal paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature's fractals and mathematical fractals. This shows that fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency by providing motivation for artists, such as Pollock, to use Fractal Expressionism in their art to appeal to people.\nHumans appear to be especially well-adapted to processing fractal patterns with fractal dimension between 1.3 and 1.5. When humans view fractal patterns with fractal dimensions in this range, these fractals reduce physiological stress and boost cognitive abilities.\nApplications in technology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They have zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, are substances which cannot resist any shear force applied to them.\nIntroduction.\nAlthough the term \"fluid\" generally includes both the liquid and gas phases, its definition varies among branches of science. Definitions of \"solid\" vary as well, and depending on field, some substances can have both fluid and solid properties. Non-Newtonian fluids like Silly Putty appear to behave similar to a solid when a sudden force is applied. Substances with a very high viscosity such as pitch appear to behave like a solid (see pitch drop experiment) as well. In particle physics, the concept is extended to include fluidic matters other than liquids or gases. A fluid in medicine or biology refers to any liquid constituent of the body (body fluid), whereas \"liquid\" is not used in this sense. Sometimes liquids given for fluid replacement, either by drinking or by injection, are also called fluids (e.g. \"drink plenty of fluids\"). In hydraulics, fluid is a term which refers to liquids with certain properties, and is broader than (hydraulic) oils.\nPhysics.\nFluids display properties such as:\nThese properties are typically a function of their inability to support a shear stress in static equilibrium. By contrast, solids respond to shear either with a spring-like restoring force\u2014meaning that deformations are reversible\u2014or they require a certain initial stress before they deform (see plasticity).\nSolids respond with restoring forces to both shear stresses and to normal stresses, both compressive and tensile. By contrast, ideal fluids only respond with restoring forces to normal stresses, called pressure: fluids can be subjected both to compressive stress\u2014corresponding to positive pressure\u2014and to tensile stress, corresponding to negative pressure. Solids and liquids both have tensile strengths, which when exceeded in solids creates irreversible deformation and fracture, and in liquids cause the onset of cavitation. \nBoth solids and liquids have free surfaces, which cost some amount of free energy to form. In the case of solids, the amount of free energy to form a given unit of surface area is called surface energy, whereas for liquids the same quantity is called surface tension. In response to surface tension, the ability of liquids to flow results in behaviour differing from that of solids, though at equilibrium both tend to minimise their surface energy: liquids tend to form rounded droplets, whereas pure solids tend to form crystals. Gases, lacking free surfaces, freely diffuse.\nModelling.\nIn a solid, shear stress is a function of strain, but in a fluid, shear stress is a function of strain rate. A consequence of this behavior is Pascal's law which describes the role of pressure in characterizing a fluid's state. \nThe behavior of fluids can be described by the Navier\u2013Stokes equations\u2014a set of partial differential equations which are based on:\nThe study of fluids is fluid mechanics, which is subdivided into fluid dynamics and fluid statics depending on whether the fluid is in motion.\nClassification.\nDepending on the relationship between shear stress and the rate of strain and its derivatives, fluids can be characterized as one of the following:\nNewtonian fluids follow Newton's law of viscosity and may be called viscous fluids.\nFluids may be classified by their compressibility:\nNewtonian and incompressible fluids do not actually exist, but are assumed to be for theoretical settlement. Virtual fluids that completely ignore the effects of viscosity and compressibility are called perfect fluids.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The purpose of a FAQ is generally to provide information on frequent questions or concerns; however, the format is a useful means of organizing information, and text consisting of questions and their answers may thus be called a FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually \"frequently\" asked.\nSince the acronym \"FAQ\" originated in textual media, its pronunciation varies. FAQ can be pronounced as an initialism, \"F-A-Q\", or as an acronym, \"FAQ\". Web designers often label a single list of questions as a \"FAQ\", such as on Google Search, while using \"FAQs\" to denote multiple lists of questions such as on United States Treasury sites. Use of \"FAQ\" to refer to a single frequently asked question, in and of itself, is less common.\nOrigins.\nWhile the name may be recent, the FAQ format itself is quite old. For example, Matthew Hopkins wrote \"The Discovery of Witches\" in 1648 as a list of questions and answers, introduced as \"Certaine Queries answered ...\". Many old catechisms are in a question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) format. \"Summa Theologica\", written by Thomas Aquinas in the second half of the 13th century, is a series of common questions about Christianity to which he wrote a series of replies.\nOn the Internet.\nThe \"FAQ\" is an Internet textual tradition originating from the technical limitations of early mailing lists from NASA in the early 1980s. The first FAQ developed over several pre-Web years, starting from 1982 when storage was expensive. On ARPANET's SPACE mailing list, the presumption was that new users would download archived past messages through FTP. In practice this rarely happened, and the users tended to post questions to the mailing list instead of searching its archives. Repeating the \"right\" answers became tedious, and went against developing netiquette. A series of different measures were set up by loosely affiliated groups of computer system administrators, from regularly posted messages to netlib-like query email daemons. The acronym \"FAQ\" was developed between 1982 and 1985 by Eugene Miya of NASA for the SPACE mailing list.\nThe format was then picked up on other mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups.\nPosting frequency changed to monthly, and finally weekly and daily across a variety of mailing lists and newsgroups.\nThe first person to post a weekly FAQ was Jef Poskanzer to the Usenet net.graphics / comp.graphics newsgroups.\nEugene Miya experimented with the first daily FAQ.\nModern developments.\nNon-traditional FAQs.\nIn some cases, informative documents not in the traditional FAQ style have also been described as FAQs, particularly the video game FAQ, which is often a detailed description of gameplay, including tips, secrets, and beginning-to-end guidance. Rarely are videogame FAQs in a question-and-answer format, although they may contain a short section of questions and answers.\nOver time, the accumulated FAQs across all Usenet newsgroups sparked the creation of the \"*.answers\" moderated newsgroups such as comp.answers, misc.answers and sci.answers for crossposting and collecting FAQ across respective comp.*, misc.*, sci.* newsgroups.\nIn web design.\nThe FAQ has become an important component of websites, either as a stand-alone page or as a website section with multiple subpages per question or topic. Embedded links to FAQ pages have become commonplace in website navigation bars, bodies, or footers. The FAQ page is an important consideration in web design, in order to achieve several goals of customer service and search engine optimization (SEO), including\nCriticism.\nSome content providers discourage the use of FAQs in place of restructuring content under logical headings.

Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted . Many writers begin the sequence with 0 and 1, although some authors start it from 1 and 1 and some (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins\n 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... (sequence in the OEIS)\nThe Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics as early as 200\u00a0BC in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths. They are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, who introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics in his 1202 book .\nFibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated to their study, the \"Fibonacci Quarterly\". Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and distributed systems. They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, and the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts, though they do not occur in all species.\nFibonacci numbers are also strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the n-th Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases. Fibonacci numbers are also closely related to Lucas numbers, which obey the same recurrence relation and with the Fibonacci numbers form a complementary pair of Lucas sequences.\nDefinition.\nThe Fibonacci numbers may be defined by the recurrence relation\nformula_1\nand\nformula_2\nfor \"n\" &gt; 1.\nUnder some older definitions, the value formula_3 is omitted, so that the sequence starts with formula_4 and the recurrence formula_5 is valid for \"n\" &gt; 2. \nThe first 20 Fibonacci numbers \"Fn\" are:\nThe Fibonacci sequence can be extended to negative integer indices by following the same recurrence relation in the negative direction (sequence in the OEIS): &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; for \"n\" &lt; 0. Nearly all properties of Fibonacci numbers do not depend upon whether the indices are positive or negative. The values for positive and negative indices obey the relation:\nformula_6\nHistory.\nIndia.\nThe Fibonacci sequence appears in Indian mathematics, in connection with Sanskrit prosody. In the Sanskrit poetic tradition, there was interest in enumerating all patterns of long (L) syllables of 2 units duration, juxtaposed with short (S) syllables of 1 unit duration. Counting the different patterns of successive L and S with a given total duration results in the Fibonacci numbers: the number of patterns of duration m units is \"F\"\"m\"+1.\nKnowledge of the Fibonacci sequence was expressed as early as Pingala (c.\u00a0450\u00a0BC\u2013200\u00a0BC). Singh cites Pingala's cryptic formula \"misrau cha\" (\"the two are mixed\") and scholars who interpret it in context as saying that the number of patterns for m beats (\"F\"\"m\"+1) is obtained by adding one [S] to the \"F\"\"m\" cases and one [L] to the \"F\"\"m\"\u22121 cases. Bharata Muni also expresses knowledge of the sequence in the \"Natya Shastra\" (c.\u00a0100\u00a0BC\u2013c.\u00a0350\u00a0AD).\nHowever, the clearest exposition of the sequence arises in the work of Virahanka (c.\u00a0700\u00a0AD), whose own work is lost, but is available in a quotation by Gopala (c.\u00a01135):\nVariations of two earlier meters [is the variation]\u00a0... For example, for [a meter of length] four, variations of meters of two [and] three being mixed, five happens. [works out examples 8, 13, 21]\u00a0... In this way, the process should be followed in all \"m\u0101tr\u0101-v\u1e5bttas\" [prosodic combinations].\nHemachandra (c.\u00a01150) is credited with knowledge of the sequence as well, writing that \"the sum of the last and the one before the last is the number\u00a0... of the next m\u0101tr\u0101-v\u1e5btta.\"\nEurope.\nThe Fibonacci sequence first appears in the book (\"The Book of Calculation\", 1202) by Fibonacci, where it is used to calculate the growth of rabbit populations. Fibonacci considers the growth of an idealized (biologically unrealistic) rabbit population, assuming that: a newly born breeding pair of rabbits are put in a field; each breeding pair mates at the age of one month, and at the end of their second month they always produce another pair of rabbits; and rabbits never die, but continue breeding forever. Fibonacci posed the rabbit math problem: how many pairs will there be in one year?\nAt the end of the n-th month, the number of pairs of rabbits is equal to the number of mature pairs (that is, the number of pairs in month \"n\" \u2013 2) plus the number of pairs alive last month (month \"n\" \u2013 1). The number in the n-th month is the n-th Fibonacci number.\nThe name \"Fibonacci sequence\" was first used by the 19th-century number theorist \u00c9douard Lucas.\nRelation to the golden ratio.\nClosed-form expression.\nLike every sequence defined by a homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients, the Fibonacci numbers have a closed-form expression. It has become known as Binet's formula, named after French mathematician Jacques Philippe Marie Binet, though it was already known by Abraham de Moivre and Daniel Bernoulli:\nformula_7\nwhere &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is the golden ratio and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is its conjugate,\nformula_8\nThe numbers &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are the two solutions of the quadratic equation &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, that is, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, and thus they satisfy the identities &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nSince formula_9, Binet's formula can also be written as\nformula_10\nTo see the relation between the sequence and these constants, note that formula_11 and formula_12 are also roots of formula_13 so the powers of formula_11 and formula_12 satisfy the Fibonacci recurrence. In other words,\nformula_16\nIt follows that for any values a and b, the sequence defined by\nformula_17\nsatisfies the same recurrence. If a and b are chosen so that \"U\"0 = 0 and \"U\"1 = 1 then the resulting sequence \"U\"\"n\" must be the Fibonacci sequence. This is the same as requiring a and b satisfy the system of equations:\nformula_18\nwhich has solution\nformula_19\nproducing the required formula.\nTaking the starting values \"U\"0 and \"U\"1 to be arbitrary constants and solving the system of equations gives the general solution\nformula_20\nIn particular, choosing \"a\" = 1 makes the n-th element of the sequence closely approximate the n-th power of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; for large enough values of n. This arises when \"U\"0 = 2 and \"U\"1 = 1, which produces the sequence of Lucas numbers.\nComputation by rounding.\nSince\nformula_21 for all \"n\" \u2265 0, the number \"F\"\"n\" is the closest integer to formula_22. Therefore, it can be found by rounding, using the nearest integer function:\nformula_23\nIn fact, the rounding error quickly becomes very small as n grows, being less than 0.1 for \"n\" \u2265 4, and less than 0.01 for \"n\" \u2265 8. This formula is easily inverted to find an index of a Fibonacci number F:\nformula_24\nInstead using the floor function gives the largest index of a Fibonacci number that is not greater than F:\nformula_25\nwhere formula_26, formula_27, and formula_28.\nMagnitude.\nSince \"Fn\" is asymptotic to formula_29, the number of digits in \"F\"\"n\" is asymptotic to formula_30. As a consequence, for every integer \"d\" &gt; 1 there are either 4 or 5 Fibonacci numbers with d decimal digits.\nMore generally, in the base b representation, the number of digits in \"F\"\"n\" is asymptotic to formula_31\nLimit of consecutive quotients.\nJohannes Kepler observed that the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges. He wrote that \"as 5 is to 8 so is 8 to 13, practically, and as 8 is to 13, so is 13 to 21 almost\", and concluded that these ratios approach the golden ratio &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;:\nformula_32\nThis convergence holds regardless of the starting values formula_33 and formula_34, unless formula_35. This can be verified using Binet's formula. For example, the initial values 3 and 2 generate the sequence 3, 2, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81, 131, 212, 343, 555, ...\u2009. The ratio of consecutive elements in this sequence shows the same convergence towards the golden ratio.\nIn general, formula_36, because the ratios between consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches formula_11.\nDecomposition of powers.\nSince the golden ratio satisfies the equation\nformula_38\nthis expression can be used to decompose higher powers formula_39 as a linear function of lower powers, which in turn can be decomposed all the way down to a linear combination of formula_11 and 1. The resulting recurrence relationships yield Fibonacci numbers as the linear coefficients:\nformula_41\nThis equation can be proved by induction on \"n\" \u2265 1:\nformula_42\nFor formula_43, it is also the case that formula_44 and it is also the case that\nformula_45\nThese expressions are also true for \"n\" &lt; 1 if the Fibonacci sequence \"Fn\" is extended to negative integers using the Fibonacci rule formula_46\nIdentification.\nBinet's formula provides a proof that a positive integer x is a Fibonacci number if and only if at least one of formula_47 or formula_48 is a perfect square. This is because Binet's formula, which can be written as formula_49, can be multiplied by formula_50 and solved as a quadratic equation in formula_39 via the quadratic formula:\nformula_52\nComparing this to formula_53, it follows that\n formula_54\nIn particular, the left-hand side is a perfect square.\nMatrix form.\nA 2-dimensional system of linear difference equations that describes the Fibonacci sequence is\nformula_55\nalternatively denoted\nformula_56\nwhich yields formula_57. The eigenvalues of the matrix A are formula_58 and formula_59 corresponding to the respective eigenvectors\nformula_60\nAs the initial value is\nformula_61\nit follows that the nth element is\nformula_62\nFrom this, the nth element in the Fibonacci series may be read off directly as a closed-form expression:\nformula_63\nEquivalently, the same computation may be performed by diagonalization of A through use of its eigendecomposition:\nformula_64\nwhere\nformula_65\nThe closed-form expression for the nth element in the Fibonacci series is therefore given by\nformula_66\nwhich again yields\nformula_67\nThe matrix A has a determinant of \u22121, and thus it is a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 unimodular matrix.\nThis property can be understood in terms of the continued fraction representation for the golden ratio \u03c6:\nformula_68\nThe convergents of the continued fraction for \u03c6 are ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers: \"\u03c6\"\"n\" = \"F\"\"n\"+1 / \"F\"\"n\" is the n-th convergent, and the (\"n\"\u2009+\u20091)-st convergent can be found from the recurrence relation \"\u03c6\"\"n\"+1 = 1 + 1 / \"\u03c6\"\"n\". The matrix formed from successive convergents of any continued fraction has a determinant of +1 or \u22121. The matrix representation gives the following closed-form expression for the Fibonacci numbers:\nformula_69\nFor a given n, this matrix can be computed in \"O\"(log \"n\") arithmetic operations, using the exponentiation by squaring method.\nTaking the determinant of both sides of this equation yields Cassini's identity,\nformula_70\nMoreover, since A\"n\"A\"m\" \n A\"n\"+\"m\" for any square matrix A, the following identities can be derived (they are obtained from two different coefficients of the matrix product, and one may easily deduce the second one from the first one by changing n into \"n\" + 1),\nformula_71\nIn particular, with \"m\" = \"n\",\nformula_72\nThese last two identities provide a way to compute Fibonacci numbers recursively in \"O\"(log \"n\") arithmetic operations. This matches the time for computing the n-th Fibonacci number from the closed-form matrix formula, but with fewer redundant steps if one avoids recomputing an already computed Fibonacci number (recursion with memoization).\nCombinatorial identities.\nCombinatorial proofs.\nMost identities involving Fibonacci numbers can be proved using combinatorial arguments using the fact that formula_73 can be interpreted as the number of (possibly empty) sequences of\u00a01s and\u00a02s whose sum is formula_74. This can be taken as the definition of formula_73 with the conventions formula_3, meaning no such sequence exists whose sum is\u00a0\u22121, and formula_77, meaning the empty sequence \"adds up\" to 0. In the following, formula_78 is the cardinality of a set:\n formula_79\n formula_80\n formula_81\n formula_82\n formula_83\n formula_84\nIn this manner the recurrence relation\nformula_85\nmay be understood by dividing the formula_73 sequences into two non-overlapping sets where all sequences either begin with 1 or 2:\nformula_87\nExcluding the first element, the remaining terms in each sequence sum to formula_88 or formula_89 and the cardinality of each set is formula_90 or formula_91 giving a total of formula_92 sequences, showing this is equal to formula_73.\nIn a similar manner it may be shown that the sum of the first Fibonacci numbers up to the n-th is equal to the (\"n\" + 2)-th Fibonacci number minus\u00a01. In symbols:\nformula_94\nThis may be seen by dividing all sequences summing to formula_95 based on the location of the first 2. Specifically, each set consists of those sequences that start formula_96 until the last two sets formula_97 each with cardinality 1.\nFollowing the same logic as before, by summing the cardinality of each set we see that\n formula_98\n... where the last two terms have the value formula_77. From this it follows that formula_100.\nA similar argument, grouping the sums by the position of the first\u00a01 rather than the first\u00a02 gives two more identities:\nformula_101\nand\nformula_102\nIn words, the sum of the first Fibonacci numbers with odd index up to formula_103 is the (2\"n\")-th Fibonacci number, and the sum of the first Fibonacci numbers with even index up to formula_104 is the (2\"n\" + 1)-th Fibonacci number minus\u00a01.\nA different trick may be used to prove\nformula_105\nor in words, the sum of the squares of the first Fibonacci numbers up to formula_73 is the product of the n-th and (\"n\" + 1)-th Fibonacci numbers. To see this, begin with a Fibonacci rectangle of size formula_107 and decompose it into squares of size formula_108; from this the identity follows by comparing areas:\nInduction proofs.\nFibonacci identities often can be easily proved using mathematical induction.\nFor example, reconsider\nformula_109\nAdding formula_110 to both sides gives\n formula_111\nand so we have the formula for formula_95\nformula_113\nSimilarly, add formula_114 to both sides of\nformula_105\nto give\nformula_116\nformula_117\nBinet formula proofs.\nThe Binet formula is\nformula_118\nThis can be used to prove Fibonacci identities.\nFor example, to prove that formula_119\nnote that the left hand side multiplied by formula_120 becomes\nformula_121\nas required, using the facts formula_122 and formula_123 to simplify the equations.\nOther identities.\nNumerous other identities can be derived using various methods. Here are some of them:\nCassini's and Catalan's identities.\nCassini's identity states that\nformula_124\nCatalan's identity is a generalization:\nformula_125\nd'Ocagne's identity.\nformula_126\nformula_127\nwhere \"L\"\"n\" is the n-th Lucas number. The last is an identity for doubling n; other identities of this type are\nformula_128\nby Cassini's identity.\nformula_129\nformula_130\nformula_131\nThese can be found experimentally using lattice reduction, and are useful in setting up the special number field sieve to factorize a Fibonacci number.\nMore generally,\nformula_132\nor alternatively\nformula_133\nPutting \"k\" = 2 in this formula, one gets again the formulas of the end of above section Matrix form.\nGenerating function.\nThe ordinary generating function of the Fibonacci sequence is the power series\nformula_134\nThis series is convergent for any complex number formula_135 satisfying formula_136 and its sum has a simple closed form:\nformula_137\nThis can be proved by multiplying by formula_138:\nformula_139\nwhere all terms involving formula_140 for formula_141 cancel out because of the defining Fibonacci recurrence relation.\nThe partial fraction decomposition is given by\nformula_142\nwhere formula_143 is the golden ratio and formula_144 is its conjugate.\nUsing formula_135 equal to any of 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, etc. lays out the first Fibonacci numbers in the decimal expansion of formula_146. For example, formula_147\nReciprocal sums.\nInfinite sums over reciprocal Fibonacci numbers can sometimes be evaluated in terms of theta functions. For example, the sum of every odd-indexed reciprocal Fibonacci number can be written as\nformula_148\nand the sum of squared reciprocal Fibonacci numbers as\nformula_149\nand there is a \"nested\" sum of squared Fibonacci numbers giving the reciprocal of the golden ratio,\nformula_150\nThe sum of all even-indexed reciprocal Fibonacci numbers is\nformula_151\nwith the Lambert series formula_152 since formula_153\nSo the reciprocal Fibonacci constant is\nformula_154\nMoreover, this number has been proved irrational by Richard Andr\u00e9-Jeannin.\nMillin's series gives the identity\nformula_155\nwhich follows from the closed form for its partial sums as N tends to infinity:\nformula_156\nPrimes and divisibility.\nDivisibility properties.\nEvery third number of the sequence is even (a multiple of formula_157) and, more generally, every k-th number of the sequence is a multiple of \"Fk\". Thus the Fibonacci sequence is an example of a divisibility sequence. In fact, the Fibonacci sequence satisfies the stronger divisibility property\nformula_158\nwhere gcd is the greatest common divisor function. (This relation is different if a different indexing convention is used, such as the one that starts the sequence with &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.)\nIn particular, any three consecutive Fibonacci numbers are pairwise coprime because both formula_159 and formula_160. That is,\n formula_161\nfor every n.\nEvery prime number p divides a Fibonacci number that can be determined by the value of p modulo\u00a05. If p is congruent to 1 or 4 modulo 5, then p divides \"F\"\"p\"\u22121, and if p is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5, then, p divides \"F\"\"p\"+1. The remaining case is that \"p\" = 5, and in this case p divides \"Fp\".\nformula_162\nThese cases can be combined into a single, non-piecewise formula, using the Legendre symbol:\nformula_163\nPrimality testing.\nThe above formula can be used as a primality test in the sense that if\nformula_164\nwhere the Legendre symbol has been replaced by the Jacobi symbol, then this is evidence that n is a prime, and if it fails to hold, then n is definitely not a prime. If n is composite and satisfies the formula, then n is a \"Fibonacci pseudoprime\". When m is large\u00a0\u2013 say a 500-bit number\u00a0\u2013 then we can calculate \"F\"\"m\" (mod \"n\") efficiently using the matrix form. Thus\nformula_165\nHere the matrix power \"A\"\"m\" is calculated using modular exponentiation, which can be adapted to matrices.\nFibonacci primes.\nA \"Fibonacci prime\" is a Fibonacci number that is prime. The first few are:\n 2, 3, 5, 13, 89, 233, 1597, 28657, 514229, ...\nFibonacci primes with thousands of digits have been found, but it is not known whether there are infinitely many.\n\"F\"\"kn\" is divisible by \"F\"\"n\", so, apart from \"F\"4 = 3, any Fibonacci prime must have a prime index. As there are arbitrarily long runs of composite numbers, there are therefore also arbitrarily long runs of composite Fibonacci numbers.\nNo Fibonacci number greater than \"F\"6 = 8 is one greater or one less than a prime number.\nThe only nontrivial square Fibonacci number is 144. Attila Peth\u0151 proved in 2001 that there is only a finite number of perfect power Fibonacci numbers. In 2006, Y. Bugeaud, M. Mignotte, and S. Siksek proved that 8 and 144 are the only such non-trivial perfect powers.\n1, 3, 21, and 55 are the only triangular Fibonacci numbers, which was conjectured by Vern Hoggatt and proved by Luo Ming.\nNo Fibonacci number can be a perfect number. More generally, no Fibonacci number other than 1 can be multiply perfect, and no ratio of two Fibonacci numbers can be perfect.\nPrime divisors.\nWith the exceptions of 1, 8 and 144 (\"F\"1 = \"F\"2, \"F\"6 and \"F\"12) every Fibonacci number has a prime factor that is not a factor of any smaller Fibonacci number (Carmichael's theorem). As a result, 8 and 144 (\"F\"6 and \"F\"12) are the only Fibonacci numbers that are the product of other Fibonacci numbers.\nThe divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by a prime p is related to the Legendre symbol formula_166 which is evaluated as follows:\nformula_167\nIf p is a prime number then\nformula_168\nFor example,\nformula_169\nIt is not known whether there exists a prime p such that\nformula_170\nSuch primes (if there are any) would be called Wall\u2013Sun\u2013Sun primes.\nAlso, if \"p\" \u2260 5 is an odd prime number then:\nformula_171\nExample 1. \"p\" = 7, in this case \"p\" \u2261 3 (mod 4) and we have:\nformula_172\nformula_173\nformula_174\nExample 2. \"p\" = 11, in this case \"p\" \u2261 3 (mod 4) and we have:\nformula_175\nformula_176\nformula_177\nExample 3. \"p\" = 13, in this case \"p\" \u2261 1 (mod 4) and we have:\nformula_178\nformula_179\nformula_180\nExample 4. \"p\" = 29, in this case \"p\" \u2261 1 (mod 4) and we have:\nformula_181\nformula_182\nformula_183\nFor odd n, all odd prime divisors of \"F\"\"n\" are congruent to 1 modulo 4, implying that all odd divisors of \"F\"\"n\" (as the products of odd prime divisors) are congruent to 1 modulo 4.\nFor example,\nformula_184\nAll known factors of Fibonacci numbers \"F\"(\"i\") for all \"i\" &lt; 50000 are collected at the relevant repositories.\nPeriodicity modulo \"n\".\nIf the members of the Fibonacci sequence are taken mod\u00a0n, the resulting sequence is periodic with period at most\u00a06\"n\". The lengths of the periods for various n form the so-called Pisano periods. Determining a general formula for the Pisano periods is an open problem, which includes as a subproblem a special instance of the problem of finding the multiplicative order of a modular integer or of an element in a finite field. However, for any particular n, the Pisano period may be found as an instance of cycle detection.\nGeneralizations.\nThe Fibonacci sequence is one of the simplest and earliest known sequences defined by a recurrence relation, and specifically by a linear difference equation. All these sequences may be viewed as generalizations of the Fibonacci sequence. In particular, Binet's formula may be generalized to any sequence that is a solution of a homogeneous linear difference equation with constant coefficients.\nSome specific examples that are close, in some sense, to the Fibonacci sequence include:\nApplications.\nMathematics.\nThe Fibonacci numbers occur as the sums of binomial coefficients in the \"shallow\" diagonals of Pascal's triangle:\nformula_185\nThis can be proved by expanding the generating function\nformula_186\nand collecting like terms of formula_187.\nTo see how the formula is used, we can arrange the sums by the number of terms present:\nwhich is formula_188, where we are choosing the positions of k twos from \"n\"\u2212\"k\"\u22121 terms.\nThese numbers also give the solution to certain enumerative problems, the most common of which is that of counting the number of ways of writing a given number n as an ordered sum of 1s and 2s (called compositions); there are \"F\"\"n\"+1 ways to do this (equivalently, it's also the number of domino tilings of the formula_189 rectangle). For example, there are \"F\"5+1 = \"F\"6 = 8 ways one can climb a staircase of 5 steps, taking one or two steps at a time:\nThe figure shows that 8 can be decomposed into 5 (the number of ways to climb 4 steps, followed by a single-step) plus 3 (the number of ways to climb 3 steps, followed by a double-step). The same reasoning is applied recursively until a single step, of which there is only one way to climb.\nThe Fibonacci numbers can be found in different ways among the set of binary strings, or equivalently, among the subsets of a given set.\nNature.\nFibonacci sequences appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruitlets of a pineapple, the flowering of artichoke, the leaves of the spiral aloe (Aloe polyphylla), the arrangement of a pine cone, and the family tree of honeybees. Kepler pointed out the presence of the Fibonacci sequence in nature, using it to explain the (golden ratio-related) pentagonal form of some flowers. Field daisies most often have petals in counts of Fibonacci numbers. In 1830, Karl Friedrich Schimper and Alexander Braun discovered that the parastichies (spiral phyllotaxis) of plants were frequently expressed as fractions involving Fibonacci numbers.\nPrzemys\u0142aw Prusinkiewicz advanced the idea that real instances can in part be understood as the expression of certain algebraic constraints on free groups, specifically as certain Lindenmayer grammars.\nA model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by Helmut Vogel in 1979. This has the form\nformula_191\nwhere n is the index number of the floret and c is a constant scaling factor; the florets thus lie on Fermat's spiral. The divergence angle, approximately 137.51\u00b0, is the golden angle, dividing the circle in the golden ratio. Because this ratio is irrational, no floret has a neighbor at exactly the same angle from the center, so the florets pack efficiently. Because the rational approximations to the golden ratio are of the form \"F\"(\u2009\"j\"):\"F\"(\u2009\"j\" + 1), the nearest neighbors of floret number n are those at \"n\" \u00b1 \"F\"(\u2009\"j\") for some index j, which depends on r, the distance from the center. Sunflowers and similar flowers most commonly have spirals of florets in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions in the amount of adjacent Fibonacci numbers, typically counted by the outermost range of radii.\nFibonacci numbers also appear in the ancestral pedigrees of bees (which are haplodiploids), according to the following rules:\nThus, a male bee always has one parent, and a female bee has two. If one traces the pedigree of any male bee (1 bee), he has 1 parent (1 bee), 2 grandparents, 3 great-grandparents, 5 great-great-grandparents, and so on. This sequence of numbers of parents is the Fibonacci sequence. The number of ancestors at each level, \"F\"\"n\", is the number of female ancestors, which is \"F\"\"n\"\u22121, plus the number of male ancestors, which is \"F\"\"n\"\u22122. This is under the unrealistic assumption that the ancestors at each level are otherwise unrelated.\nIt has similarly been noticed that the number of possible ancestors on the human X chromosome inheritance line at a given ancestral generation also follows the Fibonacci sequence. A male individual has an X chromosome, which he received from his mother, and a Y chromosome, which he received from his father. The male counts as the \"origin\" of his own X chromosome (formula_159), and at his parents' generation, his X chromosome came from a single parent . The male's mother received one X chromosome from her mother (the son's maternal grandmother), and one from her father (the son's maternal grandfather), so two grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome . The maternal grandfather received his X chromosome from his mother, and the maternal grandmother received X chromosomes from both of her parents, so three great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome . Five great-great-grandparents contributed to the male descendant's X chromosome , etc. (This assumes that all ancestors of a given descendant are independent, but if any genealogy is traced far enough back in time, ancestors begin to appear on multiple lines of the genealogy, until eventually a population founder appears on all lines of the genealogy.)\nReferences.\nExplanatory footnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located south-southeast of the centre of Paris. Fontainebleau is a sub-prefecture of the Seine-et-Marne department, and it is the seat of the \"arrondissement\" of Fontainebleau. The commune has the largest land area in the \u00cele-de-France region; it is the only one to cover a larger area than Paris itself. The commune is closest to Seine-et-Marne Prefecture Melun.\nFontainebleau, together with the neighbouring commune of Avon and three other smaller communes, form an urban area of 36,724 inhabitants (2018). This urban area is a satellite of Paris.\nFontainebleau is renowned for the large and scenic Forest of Fontainebleau, a favourite weekend getaway for Parisians, as well as for the historic Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau, which once belonged to the kings of France. It is also the home of INSEAD, one of the world's most elite business schools.\nInhabitants of Fontainebleau are called \"Bellifontains\".\nHistory.\nName.\nAccording to the official chateau history, \"Fontainebleau\" took its name in the 16th century from the \"Fontaine Belle-Eau\", a natural fresh water spring located in the English garden not far from the chateau. The name means \"Spring of beautiful water\". In the 19th century the spring was rebuilt to flow into an octagonal stone basin.\nBefore the 16th century, Fontainebleau was recorded in the Latinised forms \"Fons Bleaudi\", \"Fons Bliaudi\", and \"Fons Blaadi\" in the 12th and 13th centuries, and as \"Fontem blahaud\" in 1137. In the 17th century it was also sometimes called by the fanciful Latin \"Fons Bellaqueus\". This the origin of the name \"Bellifontains\" sometimes used for residents.\nA popular legend says that the spring and forest took their names from a favourite hunting dog of King Louis IX named \"Blaud\" or \"Blau\". According to the legend, during a hunt the dog became separated from the King, who finally found him by the spring.\nAccording to another source, the name comes from the medieval compound noun of \"fontaine\", meaning spring and fountain, and \"blitwald\", consisting of the Germanic personal name Blit and the Germanic word for forest.\nOrigins.\nThis hamlet was endowed with a royal hunting lodge and a chapel by Louis VII in the middle of the twelfth century. A century later, Louis IX, also called Saint Louis, who held Fontainebleau in high esteem and referred to it as \"his wilderness\", had a country house and a hospital constructed there.\nPhilip the Fair was born there in 1268 and died there in 1314. In all, thirty-four sovereigns, from Louis VI, the Fat, (1081\u20131137) to Napoleon III (1808\u20131873), spent time at Fontainebleau.\nThe connection between the town of Fontainebleau and the French monarchy was reinforced with the transformation of the royal country house into a true royal palace, the Palace of Fontainebleau. This was accomplished by the great builder-king, Francis I (1494\u20131547), who, in the largest of his many construction projects, reconstructed, expanded, and transformed the royal ch\u00e2teau at Fontainebleau into a residence that became his favourite, as well as the residence of his mistress, Anne, duchess of \u00c9tampes.\nEarly modern period.\nFrom the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, every monarch, from Francis I to Louis XV, made important renovations at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including demolitions, reconstructions, additions, and embellishments of various descriptions, all of which endowed it with a character that is a bit heterogeneous, but harmonious nonetheless.\nOn 18 October 1685, Louis XIV signed the \"Edict of Fontainebleau\" there. Also known as the \"Revocation of the Edict of Nantes\", this royal fiat reversed the permission granted to the Huguenots in 1598 to worship publicly in specified locations and hold certain other privileges. The result was that a large number of Protestants were forced to convert to the Catholic faith, killed, or forced into exile, mainly in the Low Countries, Prussia and in England.\nThe 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau, a secret agreement between France and Spain concerning the Louisiana territory in North America, was concluded here. Also, preliminary negotiations, held before the 1763 Treaty of Paris was signed, ending the Seven Years' War, were at Fontainebleau.\nDuring the French Revolution, Fontainebleau was temporarily renamed Fontaine-la-Montagne, meaning \"Fountain by the Mountain\". (The mountain referred to is the series of rocky formations located in the forest of Fontainebleau.)\nModern period.\nOn 29 October 1807, Manuel Godoy, chancellor to the Spanish king, Charles IV and Napoleon signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau, which authorized the passage of French troops through Spanish territories so that they might invade Portugal.\nOn 20 June 1812, Pope Pius VII arrived at the ch\u00e2teau of Fontainebleau, after a secret transfer from Savona, accompanied by his personal physician, Balthazard Claraz. In poor health, the Pope was the prisoner of Napoleon, and he remained in his genteel prison at Fontainebleau for nineteen months. From June 1812 until 23 January 1814, the Pope never left his apartments.\nOn 20 April 1814, Napoleon Bonaparte, shortly before his first abdication, bid farewell to the Old Guard, the renowned \"grognards\" (grumblers) who had served with him since his first campaigns, in the \"White Horse Courtyard\" (la cour du Cheval Blanc) at the Palace of Fontainebleau. (The courtyard has since been renamed the \"Courtyard of Goodbyes\".) According to contemporary sources, the occasion was very moving. The 1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau stripped Napoleon of his powers (but not his title as Emperor of the French) and sent him into exile on Elba.\nUntil the 19th century, Fontainebleau was a village and a suburb of Avon. Later, it developed as an independent residential city.\nFor the 1924 Summer Olympics, the town played host to the riding portion of the modern pentathlon event. This event took place near a golf course.\nIn July and August 1946, the town hosted the Franco-Vietnamese Conference, intended to find a solution to the long-contested struggle for Vietnam's independence from France, but the conference ended in failure.\nFontainebleau also hosted the general staff of the Allied Forces in Central Europe (Allied Forces Center or AFCENT) and the land forces command (LANDCENT); the air forces command (AIRCENT) was located nearby at Camp Guynemer. These facilities were in place from the inception of NATO until France's partial withdrawal from NATO in 1967 when the United States returned those bases to French control. NATO moved AFCENT to Brunssum in the Netherlands and AIRCENT to Ramstein in West Germany. (The Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, also known as SHAPE, was located at Rocquencourt, west of Paris, quite a distance from Fontainebleau).\nIn 2008, the men's World Championship of Real Tennis (Jeu de Paume) was held in the tennis court of the Chateau. The real tennis World Championship is the oldest in sport and Fontainebleau has one of only two active courts in France.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTourism.\nFontainebleau is a popular tourist destination; each year, 300,000 people visit the palace and more than 13 million people visit the forest.\nForest of Fontainebleau.\nThe forest of Fontainebleau surrounds the town and dozens of nearby villages. It is protected by France's \"Office National des For\u00eats\", and it is recognised as a French national park. It is managed in order that its wild plants and trees, such as the rare service tree of Fontainebleau, and its populations of birds, mammals, and butterflies, can be conserved. It is a former royal hunting park often visited by hikers and horse riders. The forest is also well regarded for bouldering and is particularly popular among climbers, as it is the biggest developed area of that kind in the world.\nRoyal Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau.\nThe Royal Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau is a large palace where the kings of France took their ease. It is also the site where the French royal court, from 1528 onwards, entertained the body of new ideas that became known as the Renaissance.\nINSEAD.\nThe European (and historic) campus of the INSEAD business school is located at the edge of Fontainebleau, by the Lycee Francois Couperin. INSEAD students live in local accommodations around the Fontainebleau area, and especially in the surrounding towns.\nTransport.\nFontainebleau is served by stations on the Transilien Line R: Fontainebleau\u2013Avon, Fontainebleau-For\u00eat and Thomery. Trains run from Paris to Montereau and Montargis. Fontainebleau\u2013Avon station, the closest to the centre of Fontainebleau, is located in Avon near its boundary with the commune of Fontainebleau.\nFrom 1896 to 1953, Fontainebleau and its surrounding area were served by the Fontainebleau tramway.\nFontainebleau is served by several bus lines of the : lines 1, 3, 4, 8, 20, 21, 23, 43, 45, 112, 202, 208, 210 of the Fontainebleau \u2013 Avon bus network and lines 7A, 7B, 34 of the .\nHospital.\nFontainebleau has a campus of the Centre hospitalier Sud Seine et Marne.\nTwinning.\nFontainebleau is twinned with the following cities:\nSee also.\nBibliography.\nhttps://\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In military conflict, the role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the battlespace. Domination of the airspace above a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft to engage in tactical and strategic bombing of enemy targets, and helps prevent the enemy from doing the same.\nThe key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and maneuverability relative to the target aircraft. The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air superiority hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters.\nMany modern fighter aircraft also have secondary capabilities such as ground attack and some types, such as fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized while still filling the main air superiority role, and these include the interceptor and, historically, the heavy fighter and night fighter.\nHistory.\nSince World War I, achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare.\nFighters continued to be developed throughout World War I, to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance over the battlefield. Early fighters were very small and lightly armed by later standards, and most were biplanes built with a wooden frame covered with fabric, and a maximum airspeed of about . A successful German biplane, the Albatross, however, was built with a plywood shell, rather than fabric, which created a stronger, faster airplane. As control of the airspace over armies became increasingly important, all of the major powers developed fighters to support their military operations. Between the wars, wood was largely replaced in part or whole by metal tubing, and finally aluminum stressed skin structures (monocoque) began to predominate.\nBy World War II, most fighters were all-metal monoplanes armed with batteries of machine guns or cannons and some were capable of speeds approaching . Most fighters up to this point had one engine, but a number of twin-engine fighters were built; however they were found to be outmatched against single-engine fighters and were relegated to other tasks, such as night fighters equipped with radar sets.\nBy the end of the war, turbojet engines were replacing piston engines as the means of propulsion, further increasing aircraft speed. Since the weight of the turbojet engine was far less than a piston engine, having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used, depending on requirements. This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape, and G-suits to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers.\nWings were made thinner and swept back to reduce transonic drag, which required new manufacturing methods to obtain sufficient strength. Skins were no longer sheet metal riveted to a structure, but milled from large slabs of alloy. The sound barrier was broken, and after a few false starts due to required changes in controls, speeds quickly reached Mach 2, past which aircraft cannot maneuver sufficiently to avoid attack.\nIn the 1950s, radar homing missiles were developed, giving fighters the ability to engage aircraft from any aspect (front, sides, or rear), in bad weather, and at longer range.\nAir-to-air missiles largely replaced guns and rockets in the early 1960s since both were believed unusable at the speeds being attained, however the Vietnam War showed that guns still had a role to play, and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannon (typically between in caliber) in addition to missiles. Most modern combat aircraft can carry at least a pair of air-to-air missiles.\nIn the 1970s, turbofans replaced turbojets, improving fuel economy enough that the last piston engine support aircraft could be replaced with jets, making multi-role combat aircraft possible. Honeycomb structures began to replace milled structures, and the first composite components began to appear on components subjected to little stress.\nWith the steady improvements in computers, defensive systems have become increasingly efficient. To counter this, stealth technologies have been pursued by the United States, Russia, India and China. The first step was to find ways to reduce the aircraft's reflectivity to radar waves by burying the engines, eliminating sharp corners and diverting any reflections away from the radar sets of opposing forces. Various materials were found to absorb the energy from radar waves, and were incorporated into special finishes that have since found widespread application. Composite structures have become widespread, including major structural components, and have helped to counterbalance the steady increases in aircraft weight\u2014most modern fighters are larger and heavier than World War II medium bombers.\nBecause of the importance of air superiority, since the early days of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers, and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces.\nThe global combat aircraft market was worth $45.75\u00a0billion in 2017 and is projected by Frost &amp; Sullivan at $47.2\u00a0billion in 2026: 35% modernization programs and 65% aircraft purchases, dominated by the Lockheed Martin F-35 with 3,000 deliveries over 20 years.\nClassification.\nA fighter aircraft is primarily designed for air-to-air combat. A given type may be designed for specific combat conditions, and in some cases for additional roles such as air-to-ground fighting. Historically the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force referred to them as \"scouts\" until the early 1920s, while the U.S. Army called them \"pursuit\" aircraft until the late 1940s (using the designation P, as in Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and Bell P-63 Kingcobra). The UK changed to calling them fighters in the 1920s, while the US Army did so in the 1940s. A short-range fighter designed to defend against incoming enemy aircraft is known as an interceptor.\nRecognized classes of fighter include:\nOf these, the Fighter-bomber, reconnaissance fighter and strike fighter classes are dual-role, possessing qualities of the fighter alongside some other battlefield role. Some fighter designs may be developed in variants performing other roles entirely, such as ground attack or unarmed reconnaissance. This may be for political or national security reasons, for advertising purposes, or other reasons.\nThe Sopwith Camel and other \"fighting scouts\" of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work. In World War II, the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers, and types such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive as aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack. Several aircraft, such as the F-111 and F-117, have received fighter designations though they had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons. The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the U.S. Navy, but it was canceled. This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for \"attack\" or \"strike\" operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries. Versatile multi role fighter-bombers such as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types.\nSome of the most expensive fighters such as the US Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and Russian Sukhoi Su-27 were employed as all-weather interceptors as well as air superiority fighter aircraft, while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers. An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target (or intercept) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate.\nAs a part of military nomenclature, a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use, along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft. The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries. In the English-speaking world, \"F\" is often now used to indicate a fighter (e.g. Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II or Supermarine Spitfire F.22), though \"P\" used to be used in the US for pursuit (e.g. Curtiss P-40 Warhawk), a translation of the French \"C\" (Dewoitine D.520 C.1) for \"Chasseur\" while in Russia \"I\" was used for \"Istrebitel\", or exterminator (Polikarpov I-16).\nAir superiority fighter.\nAs fighter types have proliferated, the air superiority fighter emerged as a specific role at the pinnacle of speed, maneuverability, and air-to-air weapon systems \u2013 able to hold its own against all other fighters and establish its dominance in the skies above the battlefield.\nInterceptor.\nThe interceptor is a fighter designed specifically to intercept and engage approaching enemy aircraft. There are two general classes of interceptor: relatively lightweight aircraft in the point-defence role, built for fast reaction, high performance and with a short range, and heavier aircraft with more comprehensive avionics and designed to fly at night or in all weathers and to operate over longer ranges. Originating during World War I, by 1929 this class of fighters had become known as the interceptor.\nNight and all-weather fighters.\nThe equipment necessary for daytime flight is inadequate when flying at night or in poor visibility. The night fighter was developed during World War I with additional equipment to aid the pilot in flying straight, navigating and finding the target. From modified variants of the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c in 1915, the night fighter has evolved into the highly capable all-weather fighter.\nStrategic fighters.\nThe strategic fighter is a fast, heavily armed and long-range type, able to act as an escort fighter protecting bombers, to carry out offensive sorties of its own as a penetration fighter and maintain standing patrols at significant distance from its home base.\nBombers are vulnerable due to their low speed, large size and poor maneuvrability. The escort fighter was developed during World War II to come between the bombers and enemy attackers as a protective shield. The primary requirement was for long range, with several heavy fighters given the role. However they too proved unwieldy and vulnerable, so as the war progressed techniques such as drop tanks were developed to extend the range of more nimble conventional fighters.\nThe penetration fighter is typically also fitted for the ground-attack role, and so is able to defend itself while conducting attack sorties.\nPiston engine fighters.\n1914\u20131918: World War I.\nThe word \"fighter\" was first used to describe a two-seat aircraft carrying a machine gun (mounted on a pedestal) and its operator as well as the pilot. Although the term was coined in the United Kingdom, the first examples were the French Voisin pushers beginning in 1910, and a Voisin III would be the first to shoot down another aircraft, on 5 October 1914.\nHowever at the outbreak of World War I, front-line aircraft were mostly unarmed and used almost exclusively for reconnaissance. On 15 August 1914, Miodrag Tomi\u0107 encountered an enemy airplane while on a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary which fired at his aircraft with a revolver, so Tomi\u0107 fired back. It was believed to be the first exchange of fire between aircraft. Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed.\nAnother type of military aircraft formed the basis for an effective \"fighter\" in the modern sense of the word. It was based on small fast aircraft developed before the war for air racing such with the Gordon Bennett Cup and Schneider Trophy. The military scout airplane was not expected to carry serious armament, but rather to rely on speed to \"scout\" a location, and return quickly to report, making it a flying horse. British scout aircraft, in this sense, included the Sopwith Tabloid and Bristol Scout. The French and the Germans didn't have an equivalent as they used two seaters for reconnaissance, such as the Morane-Saulnier L, but would later modify pre-war racing aircraft into armed single seaters. It was quickly found that these were of little use since the pilot couldn't record what he saw while also flying, while military leaders usually ignored what the pilots reported.\nAttempts were made with handheld weapons such as pistols and rifles and even light machine guns, but these were ineffective and cumbersome. The next advance came with the fixed forward-firing machine gun, so that the pilot pointed the entire aircraft at the target and fired the gun, instead of relying on a second gunner. Roland Garros bolted metal deflector plates to the propeller so that it would not shoot itself out of the sky and a number of Morane-Saulnier Ns were modified. The technique proved effective, however the deflected bullets were still highly dangerous.\nSoon after the commencement of the war, pilots armed themselves with pistols, carbines, grenades, and an assortment of improvised weapons. Many of these proved ineffective as the pilot had to fly his airplane while attempting to aim a handheld weapon and make a difficult deflection shot. The first step in finding a real solution was to mount the weapon on the aircraft, but the propeller remained a problem since the best direction to shoot is straight ahead. Numerous solutions were tried. A second crew member behind the pilot could aim and fire a swivel-mounted machine gun at enemy airplanes; however, this limited the area of coverage chiefly to the rear hemisphere, and effective coordination of the pilot's maneuvering with the gunner's aiming was difficult. This option was chiefly employed as a defensive measure on two-seater reconnaissance aircraft from 1915 on. Both the SPAD S.A and the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9 added a second crewman ahead of the engine in a pod but this was both hazardous to the second crewman and limited performance. The Sopwith L.R.T.Tr. similarly added a pod on the top wing with no better luck.\nAn alternative was to build a \"pusher\" scout such as the Airco DH.2, with the propeller mounted behind the pilot. The main drawback was that the high drag of a pusher type's tail structure made it slower than a similar \"tractor\" aircraft.\nA better solution for a single seat scout was to mount the machine gun (rifles and pistols having been dispensed with) to fire forwards but outside the propeller arc. Wing guns were tried but the unreliable weapons available required frequent clearing of jammed rounds and misfires and remained impractical until after the war. Mounting the machine gun over the top wing worked well and was used long after the ideal solution was found. The Nieuport 11 of 1916 used this system with considerable success, however, this placement made aiming and reloading difficult but would continue to be used throughout the war as the weapons used were lighter and had a higher rate of fire than synchronized weapons. The British Foster mounting and several French mountings were specifically designed for this kind of application, fitted with either the Hotchkiss or Lewis Machine gun, which due to their design were unsuitable for synchronizing. The need to arm a tractor scout with a forward-firing gun whose bullets passed through the propeller arc was evident even before the outbreak of war and inventors in both France and Germany devised mechanisms that could time the firing of the individual rounds to avoid hitting the propeller blades. Franz Schneider, a Swiss engineer, had patented such a device in Germany in 1913, but his original work was not followed up. French aircraft designer Raymond Saulnier patented a practical device in April 1914, but trials were unsuccessful because of the propensity of the machine gun employed to hang fire due to unreliable ammunition. In December 1914, French aviator Roland Garros asked Saulnier to install his synchronization gear on Garros' Morane-Saulnier Type L parasol monoplane. Unfortunately the gas-operated Hotchkiss machine gun he was provided had an erratic rate of fire and it was impossible to synchronize it with the propeller. As an interim measure, the propeller blades were fitted with metal wedges to protect them from ricochets. Garros' modified monoplane first flew in March 1915 and he began combat operations soon after. Garros scored three victories in three weeks before he himself was downed on 18 April and his airplane, along with its synchronization gear and propeller was captured by the Germans. Meanwhile, the synchronization gear (called the \"Stangensteuerung\" in German, for \"pushrod control system\") devised by the engineers of Anthony Fokker's firm was the first system to enter service. It would usher in what the British called the \"Fokker scourge\" and a period of air superiority for the German forces, making the Fokker \"Eindecker\" monoplane a feared name over the Western Front, despite its being an adaptation of an obsolete pre-war French Morane-Saulnier racing airplane, with poor flight characteristics and a by now mediocre performance. The first \"Eindecker\" victory came on 1 July 1915, when \"Leutnant\" Kurt Wintgens, of Feldflieger Abteilung 6 on the Western Front, downed a Morane-Saulnier Type L. His was one of five Fokker M.5K/MG prototypes for the \"Eindecker\", and was armed with a synchronized aviation version of the Parabellum MG14 machine gun. The success of the \"Eindecker\" kicked off a competitive cycle of improvement among the combatants, both sides striving to build ever more capable single-seat fighters. The Albatros D.I and Sopwith Pup of 1916 set the classic pattern followed by fighters for about twenty years. Most were biplanes and only rarely monoplanes or triplanes. The strong box structure of the biplane provided a rigid wing that allowed the accurate control essential for dogfighting. They had a single operator, who flew the aircraft and also controlled its armament. They were armed with one or two Maxim or Vickers machine guns, which were easier to synchronize than other types, firing through the propeller arc. Gun breeches were in front of the pilot, with obvious implications in case of accidents, but jams could be cleared in flight, while aiming was simplified.\nThe use of metal aircraft structures was pioneered before World War I by Breguet but would find its biggest proponent in Anthony Fokker, who used chrome-molybdenum steel tubing for the fuselage structure of all his fighter designs, while the innovative German engineer Hugo Junkers developed two all-metal, single-seat fighter monoplane designs with cantilever wings: the strictly experimental Junkers J 2 private-venture aircraft, made with steel, and some forty examples of the Junkers D.I, made with corrugated duralumin, all based on his experience in creating the pioneering Junkers J 1 all-metal airframe technology demonstration aircraft of late 1915. While Fokker would pursue steel tube fuselages with wooden wings until the late 1930s, and Junkers would focus on corrugated sheet metal, Dornier was the first to build a fighter (the Dornier-Zeppelin D.I) made with pre-stressed sheet aluminum and having cantilevered wings, a form that would replace all others in the 1930s. As collective combat experience grew, the more successful pilots such as Oswald Boelcke, Max Immelmann, and Edward Mannock developed innovative tactical formations and maneuvers to enhance their air units' combat effectiveness.\nAllied and\u00a0\u2013 before 1918\u00a0\u2013 German pilots of World War I were not equipped with parachutes, so in-flight fires or structural failures were often fatal. Parachutes were well-developed by 1918 having previously been used by balloonists, and were adopted by the German flying services during the course of that year. The well-known Manfred von Richthofen, the \"Red Baron\", was wearing one when he was killed, but the allied command continued to oppose their use on various grounds.\nIn April 1917, during a brief period of German aerial supremacy a British pilot's average life expectancy was calculated to average 93 flying hours, or about three weeks of active service. More than 50,000 airmen from both sides died during the war.\n1919\u20131938: Inter-war period.\nFighter development stagnated between the wars, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, where budgets were small. In France, Italy and Russia, where large budgets continued to allow major development, both monoplanes and all metal structures were common. By the end of the 1920s, however, those countries overspent themselves and were overtaken in the 1930s by those powers that hadn't been spending heavily, namely the British, the Americans, the Spanish (in the Spanish civil war) and the Germans.\nGiven limited budgets, air forces were conservative in aircraft design, and biplanes remained popular with pilots for their agility, and remained in service long after they ceased to be competitive. Designs such as the Gloster Gladiator, Fiat CR.42 Falco, and Polikarpov I-15 were common even in the late 1930s, and many were still in service as late as 1942. Up until the mid-1930s, the majority of fighters in the US, the UK, Italy and Russia remained fabric-covered biplanes.\nFighter armament eventually began to be mounted inside the wings, outside the arc of the propeller, though most designs retained two synchronized machine guns directly ahead of the pilot, where they were more accurate (that being the strongest part of the structure, reducing the vibration to which the guns were subjected). Shooting with this traditional arrangement was also easier because the guns shot directly ahead in the direction of the aircraft's flight, up to the limit of the guns range; unlike wing-mounted guns which to be effective required to be harmonised, that is, preset to shoot at an angle by ground crews so that their bullets would converge on a target area a set distance ahead of the fighter. Rifle-caliber calibre guns remained the norm, with larger weapons either being too heavy and cumbersome or deemed unnecessary against such lightly built aircraft. It was not considered unreasonable to use World War I-style armament to counter enemy fighters as there was insufficient air-to-air combat during most of the period to disprove this notion.\nThe rotary engine, popular during World War I, quickly disappeared, its development having reached the point where rotational forces prevented more fuel and air from being delivered to the cylinders, which limited horsepower. They were replaced chiefly by the stationary radial engine though major advances led to inline engines gaining ground with several exceptional engines\u2014including the V-12 Curtiss D-12. Aircraft engines increased in power several-fold over the period, going from a typical in the Fokker D.VII of 1918 to in the Curtiss P-36 of 1936. The debate between the sleek in-line engines versus the more reliable radial models continued, with naval air forces preferring the radial engines, and land-based forces often choosing inlines. Radial designs did not require a separate (and vulnerable) radiator, but had increased drag. Inline engines often had a better power-to-weight ratio.\nSome air forces experimented with \"heavy fighters\" (called \"destroyers\" by the Germans). These were larger, usually twin-engined aircraft, sometimes adaptations of light or medium bomber types. Such designs typically had greater internal fuel capacity (thus longer range) and heavier armament than their single-engine counterparts. In combat, they proved vulnerable to more agile single-engine fighters.\nThe primary driver of fighter innovation, right up to the period of rapid re-armament in the late 1930s, were not military budgets, but civilian aircraft racing. Aircraft designed for these races introduced innovations like streamlining and more powerful engines that would find their way into the fighters of World War II. The most significant of these was the Schneider Trophy races, where competition grew so fierce, only national governments could afford to enter.\nAt the very end of the inter-war period in Europe came the Spanish Civil War. This was just the opportunity the German Luftwaffe, Italian Regia Aeronautica, and the Soviet Union's Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily needed to test their latest aircraft. Each party sent numerous aircraft types to support their sides in the conflict. In the dogfights over Spain, the latest Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters did well, as did the Soviet Polikarpov I-16. The later German design was earlier in its design cycle, and had more room for development and the lessons learned led to greatly improved models in World War II. The Russians failed to keep up and despite newer models coming into service, I-16s remaining the most common Soviet front-line fighter into 1942 despite being outclassed by the improved Bf 109s in World War II. For their part, the Italians developed several monoplanes such as the Fiat G.50 Freccia, but being short on funds, were forced to continue operating obsolete Fiat CR.42 Falco biplanes.\nFrom the early 1930s the Japanese were at war against both the Chinese Nationalists and the Russians in China, and used the experience to improve both training and aircraft, replacing biplanes with modern cantilever monoplanes and creating a cadre of exceptional pilots. In the United Kingdom, at the behest of Neville Chamberlain (more famous for his 'peace in our time' speech), the entire British aviation industry was retooled, allowing it to change quickly from fabric covered metal framed biplanes to cantilever stressed skin monoplanes in time for the war with Germany, a process that France attempted to emulate, but too late to counter the German invasion. The period of improving the same biplane design over and over was now coming to an end, and the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire started to supplant the Gloster Gladiator and Hawker Fury biplanes but many biplanes remained in front-line service well past the start of World War II. While not a combatant in Spain, they too absorbed many of the lessons in time to use them.\nThe Spanish Civil War also provided an opportunity for updating fighter tactics. One of the innovations was the development of the \"finger-four\" formation by the German pilot Werner M\u00f6lders. Each fighter squadron (German: \"Staffel\") was divided into several flights (\"Schw\u00e4rme\") of four aircraft. Each \"Schwarm\" was divided into two \"Rotten\", which was a pair of aircraft. Each \"Rotte\" was composed of a leader and a wingman. This flexible formation allowed the pilots to maintain greater situational awareness, and the two \"Rotten\" could split up at any time and attack on their own. The finger-four would be widely adopted as the fundamental tactical formation during World War Two, including by the British and later the Americans.\n1939\u20131945: World War II.\nWorld War II featured fighter combat on a larger scale than any other conflict to date. German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel noted the effect of airpower: \"Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage...\" Throughout the war, fighters performed their conventional role in establishing air superiority through combat with other fighters and through bomber interception, and also often performed roles such as tactical air support and reconnaissance.\nFighter design varied widely among combatants. The Japanese and Italians favored lightly armed and armored but highly maneuverable designs such as the Japanese Nakajima Ki-27, Nakajima Ki-43 and Mitsubishi A6M Zero and the Italian Fiat G.50 Freccia and Macchi MC.200. In contrast, designers in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States believed that the increased speed of fighter aircraft would create \"g\"-forces unbearable to pilots who attempted maneuvering dogfights typical of the First World War, and their fighters were instead optimized for speed and firepower. In practice, while light, highly maneuverable aircraft did possess some advantages in fighter-versus-fighter combat, those could usually be overcome by sound tactical doctrine, and the design approach of the Italians and Japanese made their fighters ill-suited as interceptors or attack aircraft.\nEuropean theater.\nDuring the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France, Luftwaffe fighters\u2014primarily the Messerschmitt Bf 109\u2014held air superiority, and the Luftwaffe played a major role in German victories in these campaigns. During the Battle of Britain, however, British Hurricanes and Spitfires proved roughly equal to Luftwaffe fighters. Additionally Britain's radar-based Dowding system directing fighters onto German attacks and the advantages of fighting above Britain's home territory allowed the RAF to deny Germany air superiority, saving the UK from possible German invasion and dealing the Axis a major defeat early in the Second World War. On the Eastern Front, Soviet fighter forces were overwhelmed during the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa. This was a result of the tactical surprise at the outset of the campaign, the leadership vacuum within the Soviet military left by the Great Purge, and the general inferiority of Soviet designs at the time, such as the obsolescent Polikarpov I-15 biplane and the I-16. More modern Soviet designs, including the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Yakolev Yak-1, had not yet arrived in numbers and in any case were still inferior to the Messerschmitt Bf 109. As a result, during the early months of these campaigns, Axis air forces destroyed large numbers of Red Air Force aircraft on the ground and in one-sided dogfights. In the later stages on the Eastern Front, Soviet training and leadership improved, as did their equipment. By 1942 Soviet designs such as the Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 had performance comparable to the German Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Also, significant numbers of British, and later U.S., fighter aircraft were supplied to aid the Soviet war effort as part of Lend-Lease, with the Bell P-39 Airacobra proving particularly effective in the lower-altitude combat typical of the Eastern Front. The Soviets were also helped indirectly by the American and British bombing campaigns, which forced the Luftwaffe to shift many of its fighters away from the Eastern Front in defense against these raids. The Soviets increasingly were able to challenge the Luftwaffe, and while the Luftwaffe maintained a qualitative edge over the Red Air Force for much of the war, the increasing numbers and efficacy of the Soviet Air Force were critical to the Red Army's efforts at turning back and eventually annihilating the Wehrmacht.\nMeanwhile, air combat on the Western Front had a much different character. Much of this combat focused on the strategic bombing campaigns of the RAF and the USAAF against German industry intended to wear down the Luftwaffe. Axis fighter aircraft focused on defending against Allied bombers while Allied fighters' main role was as bomber escorts. The RAF raided German cities at night, and both sides developed radar-equipped night fighters for these battles. The Americans, in contrast, flew daylight bombing raids into Germany delivering the Combined Bomber Offensive. Unescorted Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, however, proved unable to fend off German interceptors (primarily Bf 109s and Fw 190s). With the later arrival of long range fighters, particularly the North American P-51 Mustang, American fighters were able to escort far into Germany on daylight raids and by ranging ahead attrited the Luftwaffe to establish control of the skies over Western Europe.\nBy the time of Operation Overlord in June 1944, the Allies had gained near complete air superiority over the Western Front. This cleared the way both for intensified strategic bombing of German cities and industries, and for the tactical bombing of battlefield targets. With the Luftwaffe largely cleared from the skies, Allied fighters increasingly served as ground attack aircraft.\nAllied fighters, by gaining air superiority over the European battlefield, played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of the Axis, which \"Reichmarshal\" Hermann G\u00f6ring, commander of the German Luftwaffe summed up when he said: \"When I saw Mustangs over Berlin, I knew the jig was up.\"\nPacific theater.\nMajor air combat during the war in the Pacific began with the entry of the Western Allies following Japan's attack against Pearl Harbor. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service primarily operated the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service flew the Nakajima Ki-27 and the Nakajima Ki-43, initially enjoying great success, as these fighters generally had better range, maneuverability, speed and climb rates than their Allied counterparts. Additionally, Japanese pilots were well trained and many were combat veterans from Japan's campaigns in China. They quickly gained air superiority over the Allies, who at this stage of the war were often disorganized, under-trained and poorly equipped, and Japanese air power contributed significantly to their successes in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, the Dutch East Indies and Burma.\nBy mid-1942, the Allies began to regroup and while some Allied aircraft such as the Brewster Buffalo and the P-39 Airacobra were hopelessly outclassed by fighters like Japan's Mitsubishi A6M Zero, others such as the Army's Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and the Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat possessed attributes such as superior firepower, ruggedness and dive speed, and the Allies soon developed tactics (such as the Thach Weave) to take advantage of these strengths. These changes soon paid dividends, as the Allied ability to deny Japan air superiority was critical to their victories at Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal and New Guinea. In China, the Flying Tigers also used the same tactics with some success, although they were unable to stem the tide of Japanese advances there.\nBy 1943, the Allies began to gain the upper hand in the Pacific Campaign's air campaigns. Several factors contributed to this shift. First, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and second-generation Allied fighters such as the Grumman F6 Hellcat and later the Vought F4 Corsair, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and the North American P-51 Mustang, began arriving in numbers. These fighters outperformed Japanese fighters in all respects except maneuverability. Other problems with Japan's fighter aircraft also became apparent as the war progressed, such as their lack of armor and light armament, which had been typical of all pre-war fighters worldwide, but the problem was particularly difficult to rectify on the Japanese designs. This made them inadequate as either bomber-interceptors or ground-attack aircraft, roles Allied fighters were still able to fill. Most importantly, Japan's training program failed to provide enough well-trained pilots to replace losses. In contrast, the Allies improved both the quantity and quality of pilots graduating from their training programs. By mid-1944, Allied fighters had gained air superiority throughout the theater, which would not be contested again during the war. The extent of Allied quantitative and qualitative superiority by this point in the war was demonstrated during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, a lopsided Allied victory in which Japanese fliers were shot down in such numbers and with such ease that American fighter pilots likened it to a great 'turkey shoot'. Late in the war, Japan began to produce new fighters such as the Nakajima Ki-84 and the Kawanishi N1K to replace the Zero, but only in small numbers, and by then Japan lacked the trained pilots or sufficient fuel to mount an effective challenge to Allied attacks. During the closing stages of the war, Japan's fighter arm could not seriously challenge raids over Japan by American Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, and was largely reduced to Kamikaze attacks.\nTechnological innovations.\nFighter technology advanced rapidly during the Second World War. Piston-engines, which powered the vast majority of World War II fighters, grew more powerful: at the beginning of the war fighters typically had engines producing between and , while by the end of the war many could produce over . For example, the Spitfire, one of the few fighters in continuous production throughout the war, was in 1939 powered by a Merlin II, while variants produced in 1945 were equipped with the Rolls-Royce Griffon 61. Nevertheless, these fighters could only achieve modest increases in top speed due to problems of compressibility created as aircraft and their propellers approached the sound barrier, and it was apparent that propeller-driven aircraft were approaching the limits of their performance. German jet and rocket-powered fighters entered combat in 1944, too late to impact the war's outcome. The same year the Allies' only operational jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor, also entered service. World War II fighters also increasingly featured monocoque construction, which improved their aerodynamic efficiency while adding structural strength. Laminar flow wings, which improved high speed performance, also came into use on fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, while the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the Messerschmitt Me 163 featured swept wings that dramatically reduced drag at high subsonic speeds. Armament also advanced during the war. The rifle-caliber machine guns that were common on prewar fighters could not easily down the more rugged warplanes of the era. Air forces began to replace or supplement them with cannons, which fired explosive shells that could blast a hole in an enemy aircraft\u00a0\u2013 rather than relying on kinetic energy from a solid bullet striking a critical component of the aircraft, such as a fuel line or control cable, or the pilot. Cannons could bring down even heavy bombers with just a few hits, but their slower rate of fire made it difficult to hit fast-moving fighters in a dogfight. Eventually, most fighters mounted cannons, sometimes in combination with machine guns. The British epitomized this shift. Their standard early war fighters mounted eight caliber machine guns, but by mid-war they often featured a combination of machine guns and cannons, and late in the war often only cannons. The Americans, in contrast, had problems producing a cannon design, so instead placed multiple heavy machine guns on their fighters. Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and air-to-surface ordnance such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings, and pressed into close air support roles as fighter-bombers. Although they carried less ordnance than light and medium bombers, and generally had a shorter range, they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability made it easier for them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles. Moreover, if they encountered enemy fighters, their ordnance (which reduced lift and increased drag and therefore decreased performance) could be jettisoned and they could engage enemy fighters, which eliminated the need for fighter escorts that bombers required.\nHeavily armed fighters such as Germany's Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Britain's Hawker Typhoon and Hawker Tempest, and America's Curtiss P-40, F4U Corsair, P-47 Thunderbolt and P-38 Lightning all excelled as fighter-bombers, and since the Second World War ground attack has become an important secondary capability of many fighters.\nWorld War II also saw the first use of airborne radar on fighters. The primary purpose of these radars was to help night fighters locate enemy bombers and fighters. Because of the bulkiness of these radar sets, they could not be carried on conventional single-engined fighters and instead were typically retrofitted to larger heavy fighters or light bombers such as Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88, Britain's de Havilland Mosquito and Bristol Beaufighter, and America's Douglas A-20, which then served as night fighters. The Northrop P-61 Black Widow, a purpose-built night fighter, was the only fighter of the war that incorporated radar into its original design. Britain and America cooperated closely in the development of airborne radar, and Germany's radar technology generally lagged slightly behind Anglo-American efforts, while other combatants developed few radar-equipped fighters.\nA concept originated from German engineer Bernhard J. Schrage in 1943 as a response to the increasing threat posed by Allied heavy bombers, particularly at night. The Schrage Musik system involved mounting upward-facing cannon turrets, typically twin 20mm or 30mm guns, in the belly of German night fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and later versions of the Junkers Ju 88. These guns were angled upwards to target the vulnerable underside of enemy bombers.\n1946\u2013present: Post\u2013World War II period.\nSeveral prototype fighter programs begun early in 1945 continued on after the war and led to advanced piston-engine fighters that entered production and operational service in 1946. A typical example is the Lavochkin La-9 'Fritz', which was an evolution of the successful wartime Lavochkin La-7 'Fin'. Working through a series of prototypes, the La-120, La-126 and La-130, the Lavochkin design bureau sought to replace the La-7's wooden airframe with a metal one, as well as fit a laminar flow wing to improve maneuver performance, and increased armament. The La-9 entered service in August 1946 and was produced until 1948; it also served as the basis for the development of a long-range escort fighter, the La-11 'Fang', of which nearly 1200 were produced 1947\u201351. Over the course of the Korean War, however, it became obvious that the day of the piston-engined fighter was coming to a close and that the future would lie with the jet fighter.\nThis period also witnessed experimentation with jet-assisted piston engine aircraft. La-9 derivatives included examples fitted with two underwing auxiliary pulsejet engines (the La-9RD) and a similarly mounted pair of auxiliary ramjet engines (the La-138); however, neither of these entered service. One that did enter service \u2013 with the U.S. Navy in March 1945 \u2013 was the Ryan FR-1 Fireball; production was halted with the war's end on VJ-Day, with only 66 having been delivered, and the type was withdrawn from service in 1947. The USAAF had ordered its first 13 mixed turboprop-turbojet-powered pre-production prototypes of the Consolidated Vultee XP-81 fighter, but this program was also canceled by VJ Day, with 80% of the engineering work completed.\nRocket-powered fighters.\nThe first rocket-powered aircraft was the Lippisch Ente, which made a successful maiden flight in March 1928. The only pure rocket aircraft ever mass-produced was the Messerschmitt Me 163B \"Komet\" in 1944, one of several German World War II projects aimed at developing high speed, point-defense aircraft. Later variants of the Me 262 (C-1a and C-2b) were also fitted with \"mixed-power\" jet/rocket powerplants, while earlier models were fitted with rocket boosters, but were not mass-produced with these modifications.\nThe USSR experimented with a rocket-powered interceptor in the years immediately following World War II, the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270. Only two were built.\nIn the 1950s, the British developed mixed-power jet designs employing both rocket and jet engines to cover the performance gap that existed in turbojet designs. The rocket was the main engine for delivering the speed and height required for high-speed interception of high-level bombers and the turbojet gave increased fuel economy in other parts of flight, most notably to ensure the aircraft was able to make a powered landing rather than risking an unpredictable gliding return.\nThe Saunders-Roe SR.53 was a successful design, and was planned for production when economics forced the British to curtail most aircraft programs in the late 1950s. Furthermore, rapid advancements in jet engine technology rendered mixed-power aircraft designs like Saunders-Roe's SR.53 (and the following SR.177) obsolete. The American Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor \u2013the first U.S. fighter to exceed Mach 1 in level flight\u2013 met a similar fate for the same reason, and no hybrid rocket-and-jet-engine fighter design has ever been placed into service.\nThe only operational implementation of mixed propulsion was Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO), a system rarely used in fighters, such as with the zero-length launch, RATO-based takeoff scheme from special launch platforms, tested out by both the United States and the Soviet Union, and made obsolete with advancements in surface-to-air missile technology.\nJet-powered fighters.\nIt has become common in the aviation community to classify jet fighters by \"generations\" for historical purposes. No official definitions of these generations exist; rather, they represent the notion of stages in the development of fighter-design approaches, performance capabilities, and technological evolution. Different authors have packed jet fighters into different generations. For example, Richard P. Hallion of the Secretary of the US Air Force's Action Group classified the F-16 as a sixth-generation jet fighter.\nThe timeframes associated with each generation remain inexact and are only indicative of the period during which their design philosophies and technology employment enjoyed a prevailing influence on fighter design and development. These timeframes also encompass the peak period of service entry for such aircraft.\n1940s\u20131950s: First-generation.\nThe first generation of jet fighters comprised the initial, subsonic jet-fighter designs introduced late in World War II (1939\u20131945) and in the early post-war period. They differed little from their piston-engined counterparts in appearance, and many employed unswept wings. Guns and cannon remained the principal armament. The need to obtain a decisive advantage in maximum speed pushed the development of turbojet-powered aircraft forward. Top speeds for fighters rose steadily throughout World War II as more powerful piston engines developed, and they approached transonic flight-speeds where the efficiency of propellers drops off, making further speed increases nearly impossible.\nThe first jets developed during World War II and saw combat in the last two years of the war. Messerschmitt developed the first operational jet fighter, the Me 262A, primarily serving with the Luftwaffe's JG 7, the world's first jet-fighter wing. It was considerably faster than contemporary piston-driven aircraft, and in the hands of a competent pilot, proved quite difficult for Allied pilots to defeat. The Luftwaffe never deployed the design in numbers sufficient to stop the Allied air campaign, and a combination of fuel shortages, pilot losses, and technical difficulties with the engines kept the number of sorties low. Nevertheless, the Me 262 indicated the obsolescence of piston-driven aircraft. Spurred by reports of the German jets, Britain's Gloster Meteor entered production soon after, and the two entered service around the same time in 1944. Meteors commonly served to intercept the V-1 flying bomb, as they were faster than available piston-engined fighters at the low altitudes used by the flying bombs. Nearer the end of World War II, the first military jet-powered light-fighter design, the Luftwaffe intended the Heinkel He 162A \"Spatz\" (sparrow) to serve as a simple jet fighter for German home defense, with a few examples seeing squadron service with JG 1 by April 1945. By the end of the war almost all work on piston-powered fighters had ended. A few designs combining piston- and jet-engines for propulsion \u2013 such as the Ryan FR Fireball \u2013 saw brief use, but by the end of the 1940s virtually all new fighters were jet-powered.\nDespite their advantages, the early jet-fighters were far from perfect. The operational lifespan of turbines were very short and engines were temperamental, while power could be adjusted only slowly and acceleration was poor (even if top speed was higher) compared to the final generation of piston fighters. Many squadrons of piston-engined fighters remained in service until the early to mid-1950s, even in the air forces of the major powers (though the types retained were the best of the World War II designs). Innovations including ejection seats, air brakes and all-moving tailplanes became widespread in this period.\nThe Americans began using jet fighters operationally after World War II, the wartime Bell P-59 having proven a failure. The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star (soon re-designated F-80) was more prone to wave drag than the swept-wing Me 262, but had a cruise speed () as high as the maximum speed attainable by many piston-engined fighters. The British designed several new jets, including the distinctive single-engined twin boom de Havilland Vampire which Britain sold to the air forces of many nations.\nThe British transferred the technology of the Rolls-Royce Nene jet-engine to the Soviets, who soon put it to use in their advanced Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter, which used fully swept wings that allowed flying closer to the speed of sound than straight-winged designs such as the F-80. The MiG-15s' top speed of proved quite a shock to the American F-80 pilots who encountered them in the Korean War, along with their armament of two cannons and a single cannon. Nevertheless, in the first jet-versus-jet dogfight, which occurred during the Korean War on 8 November 1950, an F-80 shot down two North Korean MiG-15s.\nThe Americans responded by rushing their own swept-wing fighter \u2013 the North American F-86 Sabre \u2013 into battle against the MiGs, which had similar transsonic performance. The two aircraft had different strengths and weaknesses, but were similar enough that victory could go either way. While the Sabres focused primarily on downing MiGs and scored favorably against those flown by the poorly trained North Koreans, the MiGs in turn decimated US bomber formations and forced the withdrawal of numerous American types from operational service.\nThe world's navies also transitioned to jets during this period, despite the need for catapult-launching of the new aircraft. The U.S. Navy adopted the Grumman F9F Panther as their primary jet fighter in the Korean War period, and it was one of the first jet fighters to employ an afterburner. The de Havilland Sea Vampire became the Royal Navy's first jet fighter. Radar was used on specialized night-fighters such as the Douglas F3D Skyknight, which also downed MiGs over Korea, and later fitted to the McDonnell F2H Banshee and swept-wing Vought F7U Cutlass and McDonnell F3H Demon as all-weather / night fighters. Early versions of Infra-red (IR) air-to-air missiles (AAMs) such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and radar-guided missiles such as the AIM-7 Sparrow whose descendants remain in use as of 2021[ [update]], were first introduced on swept-wing subsonic Demon and Cutlass naval fighters.\n1950s\u20131960s: Second-generation.\nTechnological breakthroughs, lessons learned from the aerial battles of the Korean War, and a focus on conducting operations in a nuclear warfare environment shaped the development of second-generation fighters. Technological advances in aerodynamics, propulsion and aerospace building-materials (primarily aluminum alloys) permitted designers to experiment with aeronautical innovations such as swept wings, delta wings, and area-ruled fuselages. Widespread use of afterburning turbojet engines made these the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier, and the ability to sustain supersonic speeds in level flight became a common capability amongst fighters of this generation.\nFighter designs also took advantage of new electronics technologies that made effective radars small enough to carry aboard smaller aircraft. Onboard radars permitted detection of enemy aircraft beyond visual range, thereby improving the handoff of targets by longer-ranged ground-based warning- and tracking-radars. Similarly, advances in guided-missile development allowed air-to-air missiles to begin supplementing the gun as the primary offensive weapon for the first time in fighter history. During this period, passive-homing infrared-guided (IR) missiles became commonplace, but early IR missile sensors had poor sensitivity and a very narrow field of view (typically no more than 30\u00b0), which limited their effective use to only close-range, tail-chase engagements. Radar-guided (RF) missiles were introduced as well, but early examples proved unreliable. These semi-active radar homing (SARH) missiles could track and intercept an enemy aircraft \"painted\" by the launching aircraft's onboard radar. Medium- and long-range RF air-to-air missiles promised to open up a new dimension of \"beyond-visual-range\" (BVR) combat, and much effort concentrated on further development of this technology.\nThe prospect of a potential third world war featuring large mechanized armies and nuclear-weapon strikes led to a degree of specialization along two design approaches: interceptors, such as the English Electric Lightning and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21F; and fighter-bombers, such as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the Sukhoi Su-7B. Dogfighting, \"per se\", became de-emphasized in both cases. The interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond-visual ranges. As a result, strategists designed interceptors with a large missile-payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favor of high speed, altitude ceiling and rate of climb. With a primary air-defense role, emphasis was placed on the ability to intercept strategic bombers flying at high altitudes. Specialized point-defense interceptors often had limited range and few, if any, ground-attack capabilities. Fighter-bombers could swing between air-superiority and ground-attack roles, and were often designed for a high-speed, low-altitude dash to deliver their ordnance. Television- and IR-guided air-to-surface missiles were introduced to augment traditional gravity bombs, and some were also equipped to deliver a nuclear bomb.\n1960s\u20131970s: Third-generation jet fighters.\nThe third generation witnessed continued maturation of second-generation innovations, but it is most marked by renewed emphases on maneuverability and on traditional ground-attack capabilities. Over the course of the 1960s, increasing combat experience with guided missiles demonstrated that combat would devolve into close-in dogfights. Analog avionics began to appear, replacing older \"steam-gauge\" cockpit instrumentation. Enhancements to the aerodynamic performance of third-generation fighters included flight control surfaces such as canards, powered slats, and blown flaps. A number of technologies would be tried for vertical/short takeoff and landing, but thrust vectoring would be successful on the Harrier.\nGrowth in air-combat capability focused on the introduction of improved air-to-air missiles, radar systems, and other avionics. While guns remained standard equipment (early models of F-4 being a notable exception), air-to-air missiles became the primary weapons for air-superiority fighters, which employed more sophisticated radars and medium-range RF AAMs to achieve greater \"stand-off\" ranges, however, kill probabilities proved unexpectedly low for RF missiles due to poor reliability and improved electronic countermeasures (ECM) for spoofing radar seekers. Infrared-homing AAMs saw their fields of view expand to 45\u00b0, which strengthened their tactical usability. Nevertheless, the low dogfight loss-exchange ratios experienced by American fighters in the skies over Vietnam led the U.S. Navy to establish its famous \"TOPGUN\" fighter-weapons school, which provided a graduate-level curriculum to train fleet fighter-pilots in advanced Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) tactics and techniques.\nThis era also saw an expansion in ground-attack capabilities, principally in guided missiles, and witnessed the introduction of the first truly effective avionics for enhanced ground attack, including terrain-avoidance systems. Air-to-surface missiles (ASM) equipped with electro-optical (E-O) contrast seekers \u2013 such as the initial model of the widely used AGM-65 Maverick \u2013 became standard weapons, and laser-guided bombs (LGBs) became widespread in an effort to improve precision-attack capabilities. Guidance for such precision-guided munitions (PGM) was provided by externally mounted targeting pods, which were introduced in the mid-1960s.\nThe third generation also led to the development of new automatic-fire weapons, primarily chain-guns that use an electric motor to drive the mechanism of a cannon. This allowed a plane to carry a single multi-barrel weapon (such as the Vulcan), and provided greater accuracy and rates of fire. Powerplant reliability increased, and jet engines became \"smokeless\" to make it harder to sight aircraft at long distances.\nDedicated ground-attack aircraft (like the Grumman A-6 Intruder, SEPECAT Jaguar and LTV A-7 Corsair II) offered longer range, more sophisticated night-attack systems or lower cost than supersonic fighters. With variable-geometry wings, the supersonic F-111 introduced the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30, the first turbofan equipped with afterburner. The ambitious project sought to create a versatile common fighter for many roles and services. It would serve well as an all-weather bomber, but lacked the performance to defeat other fighters. The McDonnell F-4 Phantom was designed to capitalize on radar and missile technology as an all-weather interceptor, but emerged as a versatile strike-bomber nimble enough to prevail in air combat, adopted by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. Despite numerous shortcomings that would not be fully addressed until newer fighters, the Phantom claimed 280 aerial kills (more than any other U.S. fighter) over Vietnam. With range and payload capabilities that rivaled that of World War II bombers such as B-24 Liberator, the Phantom would become a highly successful multirole aircraft.\n1970s\u20132000s: Fourth-generation.\nFourth-generation fighters continued the trend towards multirole configurations, and were equipped with increasingly sophisticated avionics- and weapon-systems. Fighter designs were significantly influenced by the Energy-Maneuverability (E-M) theory developed by Colonel John Boyd and mathematician Thomas Christie, based upon Boyd's combat experience in the Korean War and as a fighter-tactics instructor during the 1960s. E-M theory emphasized the value of aircraft-specific energy maintenance as an advantage in fighter combat. Boyd perceived maneuverability as the primary means of getting \"inside\" an adversary's decision-making cycle, a process Boyd called the \"OODA loop\" (for \"Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action\"). This approach emphasized aircraft designs capable of performing \"fast transients\" \u2013 quick changes in speed, altitude, and direction \u2013 as opposed to relying chiefly on high speed alone.\nE-M characteristics were first applied to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, but Boyd and his supporters believed these performance parameters called for a small, lightweight aircraft with a larger, higher-lift wing. The small size would minimize drag and increase the thrust-to-weight ratio, while the larger wing would minimize wing loading; while the reduced wing loading tends to lower top speed and can cut range, it increases payload capacity and the range reduction can be compensated for by increased fuel in the larger wing. The efforts of Boyd's \"Fighter mafia\" would result in the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon (now Lockheed Martin's).\nThe F-16's maneuverability was further enhanced by its slight aerodynamic instability. This technique, called \"relaxed static stability\" (RSS), was made possible by introduction of the \"fly-by-wire\" (FBW) flight-control system (FLCS), which in turn was enabled by advances in computers and in system-integration techniques. Analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement, but began to be replaced by digital flight-control systems in the latter half of the 1980s. Likewise, Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) to electronically manage powerplant performance was introduced with the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 turbofan. The F-16's sole reliance on electronics and wires to relay flight commands, instead of the usual cables and mechanical linkage controls, earned it the sobriquet of \"the electric jet\". Electronic FLCS and FADEC quickly became essential components of all subsequent fighter designs.\nOther innovative technologies introduced in fourth-generation fighters included pulse-Doppler fire-control radars (providing a \"look-down/shoot-down\" capability), head-up displays (HUD), \"hands on throttle-and-stick\" (HOTAS) controls, and multi-function displays (MFD), all essential equipment as of 2019[ [update]]. Aircraft designers began to incorporate composite materials in the form of bonded-aluminum honeycomb structural elements and graphite epoxy laminate skins to reduce weight. Infrared search-and-track (IRST) sensors became widespread for air-to-ground weapons delivery, and appeared for air-to-air combat as well. \"All-aspect\" IR AAM became standard air superiority weapons, which permitted engagement of enemy aircraft from any angle (although the field of view remained relatively limited). The first long-range active-radar-homing RF AAM entered service with the AIM-54 Phoenix, which solely equipped the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, one of the few variable-sweep-wing fighter designs to enter production. Even with the tremendous advancement of air-to-air missiles in this era, internal guns were standard equipment.\nAnother revolution came in the form of a stronger reliance on ease of maintenance, which led to standardization of parts, reductions in the numbers of access panels and lubrication points, and overall parts reduction in more complicated equipment like the engines. Some early jet fighters required 50 man-hours of work by a ground crew for every hour the aircraft was in the air; later models substantially reduced this to allow faster turn-around times and more sorties in a day. Some modern military aircraft only require 10-man-hours of work per hour of flight time, and others are even more efficient.\nAerodynamic innovations included variable-camber wings and exploitation of the vortex lift effect to achieve higher angles of attack through the addition of leading-edge extension devices such as strakes.\nUnlike interceptors of the previous eras, most fourth-generation air-superiority fighters were designed to be agile dogfighters (although the Mikoyan MiG-31 and Panavia Tornado ADV are notable exceptions). The continually rising cost of fighters, however, continued to emphasize the value of multirole fighters. The need for both types of fighters led to the \"high/low mix\" concept, which envisioned a high-capability and high-cost core of dedicated air-superiority fighters (like the F-15 and Su-27) supplemented by a larger contingent of lower-cost multi-role fighters (such as the F-16 and MiG-29). \nMost fourth-generation fighters, such as the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, HAL Tejas, JF-17 and Dassault Mirage 2000, are true multirole warplanes, designed as such from the start. This was facilitated by multimode avionics that could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes. The earlier approaches of adding on strike capabilities or designing separate models specialized for different roles generally became \"pass\u00e9\" (with the Panavia Tornado being an exception in this regard). Attack roles were generally assigned to dedicated ground-attack aircraft such as the Sukhoi Su-25 and the A-10 Thunderbolt II.\nA typical US Air Force fighter wing of the period might contain a mix of one air superiority squadron (F-15C), one strike fighter squadron (F-15E), and two multirole fighter squadrons (F-16C). Perhaps the most novel technology introduced for combat aircraft was \"stealth\", which involves the use of special \"low-observable\" (L-O) materials and design techniques to reduce the susceptibility of an aircraft to detection by the enemy's sensor systems, particularly radars. The first stealth aircraft introduced were the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft (introduced in 1983) and the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber (first flew in 1989). Although no stealthy fighters per se appeared among the fourth generation, some radar-absorbent coatings and other L-O treatments developed for these programs are reported to have been subsequently applied to fourth-generation fighters.\n1990s\u20132000s: 4.5-generation.\nThe end of the Cold War in December 1991 led many governments to significantly decrease military spending as a \"peace dividend\". Air force inventories were cut. Research and development programs working on \"fifth-generation\" fighters took serious hits. Many programs were canceled during the first half of the 1990s, and those that survived were \"stretched out\". While the practice of slowing the pace of development reduces annual investment expenses, it comes at the penalty of increased overall program and unit costs over the long-term. In this instance, however, it also permitted designers to make use of the tremendous achievements being made in the fields of computers, avionics and other flight electronics, which had become possible largely due to the advances made in microchip and semiconductor technologies in the 1980s and 1990s. This opportunity enabled designers to develop fourth-generation designs \u2013 or redesigns \u2013 with significantly enhanced capabilities. These improved designs have become known as \"Generation 4.5\" fighters, recognizing their intermediate nature between the 4th and 5th generations, and their contribution in furthering development of individual fifth-generation technologies.\nThe primary characteristics of this sub-generation are the application of advanced digital avionics and aerospace materials, modest signature reduction (primarily RF \"stealth\"), and highly integrated systems and weapons. These fighters have been designed to operate in a \"network-centric\" battlefield environment and are principally multirole aircraft. Key weapons technologies introduced include beyond-visual-range (BVR) AAMs; Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2013guided weapons, solid-state phased-array radars; helmet-mounted sights; and improved secure, jamming-resistant datalinks. Thrust vectoring to further improve transient maneuvering capabilities has also been adopted by many 4.5th generation fighters, and uprated powerplants have enabled some designs to achieve a degree of \"supercruise\" ability. Stealth characteristics are focused primarily on frontal-aspect radar cross section (RCS) signature-reduction techniques including radar-absorbent materials (RAM), L-O coatings and limited shaping techniques.\n\"Half-generation\" designs are either based on existing airframes or are based on new airframes following similar design theory to previous iterations; however, these modifications have introduced the structural use of composite materials to reduce weight, greater fuel fractions to increase range, and signature reduction treatments to achieve lower RCS compared to their predecessors. Prime examples of such aircraft, which are based on new airframe designs making extensive use of carbon-fiber composites, include the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, JF-17 Thunder, and HAL Tejas Mark 1A.\nApart from these fighter jets, most of the 4.5 generation aircraft are actually modified variants of existing airframes from the earlier fourth generation fighter jets. Such fighter jets are generally heavier and examples include the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which is an evolution of the F/A-18 Hornet, the F-15E Strike Eagle, which is a ground-attack/multi-role variant of the F-15 Eagle, the Su-30SM and Su-35S modified variants of the Sukhoi Su-27, and the MiG-35 upgraded version of the Mikoyan MiG-29. The Su-30SM/Su-35S and MiG-35 feature thrust vectoring engine nozzles to enhance maneuvering. The upgraded version of F-16 is also considered a member of the 4.5 generation aircraft.\nGeneration 4.5 fighters first entered service in the early 1990s, and most of them are still being produced and evolved. It is quite possible that they may continue in production alongside fifth-generation fighters due to the expense of developing the advanced level of stealth technology needed to achieve aircraft designs featuring very low observables (VLO), which is one of the defining features of fifth-generation fighters. Of the 4.5th generation designs, the Strike Eagle, Super Hornet, Typhoon, Gripen, and Rafale have been used in combat.\nThe U.S. government has defined 4.5 generation fighter aircraft as those that \"(1) have advanced capabilities, including\u2014 (A) AESA radar; (B) high capacity data-link; and (C) enhanced avionics; and (2) have the ability to deploy current and reasonably foreseeable advanced armaments.\"\n2000s\u20132020s: Fifth-generation.\nCurrently the cutting edge of fighter design, fifth-generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. They have multifunction AESA radars with high-bandwidth, low-probability of intercept (LPI) data transmission capabilities. The infra-red search and track sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced avionics, glass cockpits, helmet-mounted sights (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor data fusion for vastly improved situational awareness while easing the pilot's workload. Avionics suites rely on extensive use of very high-speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed data buses. Overall, the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth-generation fighters with a \"first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability\".\nA key attribute of fifth-generation fighters is a small radar cross-section. Great care has been taken in designing its layout and internal structure to minimize RCS over a broad bandwidth of detection and tracking radar frequencies; furthermore, to maintain its VLO signature during combat operations, primary weapons are carried in internal weapon bays that are only briefly opened to permit weapon launch. Furthermore, stealth technology has advanced to the point where it can be employed without a tradeoff with aerodynamics performance, in contrast to previous stealth efforts. Some attention has also been paid to reducing IR signatures, especially on the F-22. Detailed information on these signature-reduction techniques is classified, but in general includes special shaping approaches, thermoset and thermoplastic materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover intake and cooling vents, heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs (seen on the Northrop YF-23), and coating internal and external metal areas with radar-absorbent materials and paint (RAM/RAP).\nThe AESA radar offers unique capabilities for fighters (and it is also quickly becoming essential for Generation 4.5 aircraft designs, as well as being retrofitted onto some fourth-generation aircraft). In addition to its high resistance to ECM and LPI features, it enables the fighter to function as a sort of \"mini-AWACS\", providing high-gain electronic support measures (ESM) and electronic warfare (EW) jamming functions. Other technologies common to this latest generation of fighters includes integrated electronic warfare system (INEWS) technology, integrated communications, navigation, and identification (CNI) avionics technology, centralized \"vehicle health monitoring\" systems for ease of maintenance, fiber optics data transmission, stealth technology and even hovering capabilities. Maneuver performance remains important and is enhanced by thrust-vectoring, which also helps reduce takeoff and landing distances. Supercruise may or may not be featured; it permits flight at supersonic speeds without the use of the afterburner \u2013 a device that significantly increases IR signature when used in full military power.\nSuch aircraft are sophisticated and expensive. The fifth generation was ushered in by the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor in late 2005. The U.S. Air Force originally planned to acquire 650 F-22s, but now only 187 will be built. As a result, its unit flyaway cost (FAC) is around US$150\u00a0million. To spread the development costs \u2013 and production base \u2013 more broadly, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program enrolls eight other countries as cost- and risk-sharing partners. Altogether, the nine partner nations anticipate procuring over 3,000 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters at an anticipated average FAC of $80\u201385\u00a0million. The F-35, however, is designed to be a family of three aircraft, a conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) fighter, a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter, and a Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) fighter, each of which has a different unit price and slightly varying specifications in terms of fuel capacity (and therefore range), size and payload.\nOther countries have initiated fifth-generation fighter development projects. In December 2010, it was discovered that China is developing the 5th generation fighter Chengdu J-20. The J-20 took its maiden flight in January 2011. The Shenyang J-35 took its maiden flight on 31 October 2012, and developed a carrier-based version based on Chinese aircraft carriers. United Aircraft Corporation with Russia's Mikoyan LMFS and Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate plan, Sukhoi Su-57 became the first fifth-generation fighter jets in service with the Russian Aerospace Forces on 2020, and launch missiles in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2022. Japan is exploring its technical feasibility to produce fifth-generation fighters. India is developing the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a medium weight stealth fighter jet designated to enter into serial production by late 2030s. India also had initiated a joint fifth generation heavy fighter with Russia called the FGFA. As of 2018[ [update]] May, the project is suspected to have not yielded desired progress or results for India and has been put on hold or dropped altogether. Other countries considering fielding an indigenous or semi-indigenous advanced fifth generation aircraft include South Korea, Sweden, Turkey and Pakistan.\n2020s\u2013present: Sixth-generation.\nAs of November 2018, France, Germany, China, Japan, Russia, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States have announced the development of a sixth-generation aircraft program.\nFrance and Germany will develop a joint sixth-generation fighter to replace their current fleet of Dassault Rafales, Eurofighter Typhoons, and Panavia Tornados by 2035. The overall development will be led by a collaboration of Dassault and Airbus, while the engines will reportedly be jointly developed by Safran and MTU Aero Engines. Thales and MBDA are also seeking a stake in the project. Spain officially joined the Franco-German project to develop a Next-Generation Fighter (NGF) that will form part of a broader Future Combat Air Systems (FCAS) with the signing of a letter of intent (LOI) on February 14, 2019.\nCurrently at the concept stage, the first sixth-generation jet fighter is expected to enter service in the United States Navy in 2025\u201330 period. The USAF seeks a new fighter for the 2030\u201350 period named the \"Next Generation Tactical Aircraft\" (\"Next Gen TACAIR\"). The US Navy looks to replace its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets beginning in 2025 with the Next Generation Air Dominance air superiority fighter.\nThe United Kingdom's proposed stealth fighter is being developed along with Japan and Italy in \"https://\", consisting of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo S.p.A. and MBDA. The aircraft is intended to enter service in 2035.\nSaudi Arabia is also looking to get involved in Team Tempest.\nWeapons.\nFighters were typically armed with guns only for air to air combat up through the late 1950s, though unguided rockets for mostly air to ground use and limited air to air use were deployed in WWII. From the late 1950s forward guided missiles came into use for air to air combat. Throughout this history fighters which by surprise or maneuver attain a good firing position have achieved the kill about one third to one half the time, no matter what weapons were carried. The only major historic exception to this has been the low effectiveness shown by guided missiles in the first one to two decades of their existence.\nFrom WWI to the present, fighter aircraft have featured machine guns and automatic cannons as weapons, and they are still considered as essential back-up weapons today. The power of air-to-air guns has increased greatly over time, and has kept them relevant in the guided missile era. In WWI two rifle (approximately 0.30) caliber machine guns was the typical armament, producing a weight of fire of about per second. In WWII rifle caliber machine guns also remained common, though usually in larger numbers or supplemented with much heavier 0.50 caliber machine guns or cannons. The standard WWII American fighter armament of six 0.50-cal (12.7mm) machine guns fired a bullet weight of approximately 3.7\u00a0kg/sec (8.1\u00a0lbs/sec), at a muzzle velocity of 856\u00a0m/s (2,810\u00a0ft/s). British and German aircraft tended to use a mix of machine guns and autocannon, the latter firing explosive projectiles. Later British fighters were exclusively cannon-armed, the US were not able to produce a reliable cannon in high numbers and most fighters remained equipped only with heavy machine guns despite the US Navy pressing for a change to 20\u00a0mm.\nPost war 20\u201330\u00a0mm revolver cannon and rotary cannon were introduced. The modern M61 Vulcan 20mm rotary cannon that is standard on current American fighters fires a projectile weight of about 10\u00a0kg/s (22\u00a0lb/s), nearly three times that of six 0.50-cal machine guns, with higher velocity of 1,052\u00a0m/s (3450\u00a0ft/s) supporting a flatter trajectory, and with exploding projectiles. Modern fighter gun systems also feature ranging radar and lead computing electronic gun sights to ease the problem of aim point to compensate for projectile drop and time of flight (target lead) in the complex three dimensional maneuvering of air-to-air combat. However, getting in position to use the guns is still a challenge. The range of guns is longer than in the past but still quite limited compared to missiles, with modern gun systems having a maximum effective range of approximately 1,000 meters. High probability of kill also requires firing to usually occur from the rear hemisphere of the target. Despite these limits, when pilots are well trained in air-to-air gunnery and these conditions are satisfied, gun systems are tactically effective and highly cost efficient. The cost of a gun firing pass is far less than firing a missile, and the projectiles are not subject to the thermal and electronic countermeasures than can sometimes defeat missiles. When the enemy can be approached to within gun range, the lethality of guns is approximately a 25% to 50% chance of \"kill per firing pass\".\nThe range limitations of guns, and the desire to overcome large variations in fighter pilot skill and thus achieve higher force effectiveness, led to the development of the guided air-to-air missile. There are two main variations, heat-seeking (infrared homing), and radar guided. Radar missiles are typically several times heavier and more expensive than heat-seekers, but with longer range, greater destructive power, and ability to track through clouds.\nThe highly successful AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking (infrared homing) short-range missile was developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s. These small missiles are easily carried by lighter fighters, and provide effective ranges of approximately . Beginning with the AIM-9L in 1977, subsequent versions of Sidewinder have added all-aspect capability, the ability to use the lower heat of air to skin friction on the target aircraft to track from the front and sides. The latest (2003 service entry) AIM-9X also features \"off-boresight\" and \"lock on after launch\" capabilities, which allow the pilot to make a quick launch of a missile to track a target anywhere within the pilot's vision. The AIM-9X development cost was U.S. $3\u00a0billion in mid to late 1990s dollars, and 2015 per unit procurement cost is $0.6\u00a0million each. The missile weighs 85.3\u00a0kg (188\u00a0lbs), and has a maximum range of 35\u00a0km (22 miles) at higher altitudes. Like most air-to-air missiles, lower altitude range can be as limited as only about one third of maximum due to higher drag and less ability to coast downward.\nThe effectiveness of infrared homing missiles was only 7% early in the Vietnam War, but improved to approximately 15%\u201340% over the course of the war. The AIM-4 Falcon used by the USAF had kill rates of approximately 7% and was considered a failure. The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%. Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 Six-Day War, achieving 60 kills and 10 losses. However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In this extensive conflict Israel scored 171 of 261 total kills with heat-seeking missiles (65.5%), 5 kills with radar guided missiles (1.9%), and 85 kills with guns (32.6%). The AIM-9L Sidewinder scored 19 kills out of 26 fired missiles (73%) in the 1982 Falklands War. But, in a conflict against opponents using thermal countermeasures, the United States only scored 11 kills out of 48 fired (Pk = 23%) with the follow-on AIM-9M in the 1991 Gulf War.\nRadar guided missiles fall into two main missile guidance types. In the historically more common semi-active radar homing case the missile homes in on radar signals transmitted from launching aircraft and reflected from the target. This has the disadvantage that the firing aircraft must maintain radar lock on the target and is thus less free to maneuver and more vulnerable to attack. A widely deployed missile of this type was the AIM-7 Sparrow, which entered service in 1954 and was produced in improving versions until 1997. In more advanced active radar homing the missile is guided to the vicinity of the target by internal data on its projected position, and then \"goes active\" with an internally carried small radar system to conduct terminal guidance to the target. This eliminates the requirement for the firing aircraft to maintain radar lock, and thus greatly reduces risk. A prominent example is the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which was first fielded in 1991 as the AIM-7 replacement, and which has no firm retirement date as of 2016[ [update]]. The current AIM-120D version has a maximum high altitude range of greater than , and cost approximately $2.4\u00a0million each (2016). As is typical with most other missiles, range at lower altitude may be as little as one third that of high altitude.\nIn the Vietnam air war radar missile kill reliability was approximately 10% at shorter ranges, and even worse at longer ranges due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. At one point in the Vietnam war, the U.S. Navy fired 50 AIM-7 Sparrow radar guided missiles in a row without a hit. Between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 combined heat-seeking and radar guided missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, achieving 528 kills, of which 76 were radar missile kills, for a combined effectiveness of 26%. However, only 4 of the 76 radar missile kills were in the beyond-visual-range mode intended to be the strength of radar guided missiles. The United States invested over $10\u00a0billion in air-to-air radar missile technology from the 1950s to the early 1970s. Amortized over actual kills achieved by the U.S. and its allies, each radar guided missile kill thus cost over $130\u00a0million. The defeated enemy aircraft were for the most part older MiG-17s, \u221219s, and \u221221s, with new cost of $0.3\u00a0million to $3\u00a0million each. Thus, the radar missile investment over that period far exceeded the value of enemy aircraft destroyed, and furthermore had very little of the intended BVR effectiveness.\nHowever, continuing heavy development investment and rapidly advancing electronic technology led to significant improvement in radar missile reliabilities from the late 1970s onward. Radar guided missiles achieved 75% Pk (9 kills out of 12 shots) in operations in the Gulf War in 1991. The percentage of kills achieved by radar guided missiles also surpassed 50% of total kills for the first time by 1991. Since 1991, 20 of 61 kills worldwide have been beyond-visual-range using radar missiles. Discounting an accidental friendly fire kill, in operational use the AIM-120D (the current main American radar guided missile) has achieved 9 kills out of 16 shots for a 56% Pk. Six of these kills were BVR, out of 13 shots, for a 46% BVR Pk. Though all these kills were against less capable opponents who were not equipped with operating radar, electronic countermeasures, or a comparable weapon themselves, the BVR Pk was a significant improvement from earlier eras. However, a current concern is electronic countermeasures to radar missiles, which are thought to be reducing the effectiveness of the AIM-120D. Some experts believe that as of 2016[ [update]] the European Meteor missile, the Russian R-37M, and the Chinese PL-15 are more resistant to countermeasures and more effective than the AIM-120D.\nNow that higher reliabilities have been achieved, both types of missiles allow the fighter pilot to often avoid the risk of the short-range dogfight, where only the more experienced and skilled fighter pilots tend to prevail, and where even the finest fighter pilot can simply get unlucky. Taking maximum advantage of complicated missile parameters in both attack and defense against competent opponents does take considerable experience and skill, but against surprised opponents lacking comparable capability and countermeasures, air-to-air missile warfare is relatively simple. By partially automating air-to-air combat and reducing reliance on gun kills mostly achieved by only a small expert fraction of fighter pilots, air-to-air missiles now serve as highly effective force multipliers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of \"states\" at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a \"transition\". An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two types\u2014deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines. For any non-deterministic finite-state machine, an equivalent deterministic one can be constructed.\nThe behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented. Simple examples are vending machines, which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited; elevators, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders; traffic lights, which change sequence when cars are waiting; and combination locks, which require the input of a sequence of numbers in the proper order.\nThe finite-state machine has less computational power than some other models of computation such as the Turing machine. The computational power distinction means there are computational tasks that a Turing machine can do but an FSM cannot. This is because an FSM's memory is limited by the number of states it has. A finite-state machine has the same computational power as a Turing machine that is restricted such that its head may only perform \"read\" operations, and always has to move from left to right. FSMs are studied in the more general field of automata theory.\nExample: coin-operated turnstile.\nAn example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a state machine is a turnstile. A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.\nConsidered as a state machine, the turnstile has two possible states: \"Locked\" and \"Unlocked\". There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (\"coin\") and pushing the arm (\"push\"). In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input \"push\" is given, it stays in the locked state. Putting a coin in \u2013 that is, giving the machine a \"coin\" input \u2013 shifts the state from \"Locked\" to \"Unlocked\". In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional \"coin\" inputs does not change the state. A customer pushing through the arms gives a \"push\" input and resets the state to \"Locked\".\nThe turnstile state machine can be represented by a state-transition table, showing for each possible state, the transitions between them (based upon the inputs given to the machine) and the outputs resulting from each input:\nThe turnstile state machine can also be represented by a directed graph called a state diagram \"(above)\". Each state is represented by a node (\"circle\"). Edges (\"arrows\") show the transitions from one state to another. Each arrow is labeled with the input that triggers that transition. An input that doesn't cause a change of state (such as a \"coin\" input in the \"Unlocked\" state) is represented by a circular arrow returning to the original state. The arrow into the \"Locked\" node from the black dot indicates it is the initial state.\nConcepts and terminology.\nA \"state\" is a description of the status of a system that is waiting to execute a \"transition\". A transition is a set of actions to be executed when a condition is fulfilled or when an event is received.\nFor example, when using an audio system to listen to the radio (the system is in the \"radio\" state), receiving a \"next\" stimulus results in moving to the next station. When the system is in the \"CD\" state, the \"next\" stimulus results in moving to the next track. Identical stimuli trigger different actions depending on the current state.\nIn some finite-state machine representations, it is also possible to associate actions with a state:\nRepresentations.\nState/Event table.\nSeveral state-transition table types are used. The most common representation is shown below: the combination of current state (e.g. B) and input (e.g. Y) shows the next state (e.g. C). By itself, the table cannot completely describe the action, so it is common to use footnotes. Other related representations may not have this limitation. For example, an FSM definition including the full action's information is possible using state tables (see also virtual finite-state machine).\nUML state machines.\nThe Unified Modeling Language has a notation for describing state machines. UML state machines overcome the limitations of traditional finite-state machines while retaining their main benefits. UML state machines introduce the new concepts of hierarchically nested states and orthogonal regions, while extending the notion of actions. UML state machines have the characteristics of both Mealy machines and Moore machines. They support actions that depend on both the state of the system and the triggering event, as in Mealy machines, as well as entry and exit actions, which are associated with states rather than transitions, as in Moore machines.\nSDL state machines.\nThe Specification and Description Language is a standard from ITU that includes graphical symbols to describe actions in the transition:\nSDL embeds basic data types called \"Abstract Data Types\", an action language, and an execution semantic in order to make the finite-state machine executable.\nOther state diagrams.\nThere are a large number of variants to represent an FSM such as the one in figure 3.\nUsage.\nIn addition to their use in modeling reactive systems presented here, finite-state machines are significant in many different areas, including electrical engineering, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, biology, mathematics, video game programming, and logic. Finite-state machines are a class of automata studied in automata theory and the theory of computation.\nIn computer science, finite-state machines are widely used in modeling of application behavior (control theory), design of hardware digital systems, software engineering, compilers, network protocols, and computational linguistics.\nClassification.\nFinite-state machines can be subdivided into acceptors, classifiers, transducers and sequencers.\nAcceptors.\nAcceptors (also called \"detectors\" or recognizers) produce binary output, indicating whether or not the received input is accepted. Each state of an acceptor is either \"accepting\" or \"non accepting\". Once all input has been received, if the current state is an accepting state, the input is accepted; otherwise it is rejected. As a rule, input is a sequence of symbols (characters); actions are not used. The start state can also be an accepting state, in which case the acceptor accepts the empty string. The example in figure 4 shows an acceptor that accepts the string \"nice\". In this acceptor, the only accepting state is state 7.\nA (possibly infinite) set of symbol sequences, called a formal language, is a regular language if there is some acceptor that accepts \"exactly\" that set. For example, the set of binary strings with an even number of zeroes is a regular language (cf. Fig. 5), while the set of all strings whose length is a prime number is not.\nAn acceptor could also be described as defining a language that would contain every string accepted by the acceptor but none of the rejected ones; that language is \"accepted\" by the acceptor. By definition, the languages accepted by acceptors are the regular languages.\nThe problem of determining the language accepted by a given acceptor is an instance of the algebraic path problem\u2014itself a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs with edges weighted by the elements of an (arbitrary) semiring.\nAn example of an accepting state appears in Fig. 5: a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that detects whether the binary input string contains an even number of 0s.\n\"S\"1 (which is also the start state) indicates the state at which an even number of 0s has been input. S1 is therefore an accepting state. This acceptor will finish in an accept state, if the binary string contains an even number of 0s (including any binary string containing no 0s). Examples of strings accepted by this acceptor are \u03b5 (the empty string), 1, 11, 11..., 00, 010, 1010, 10110, etc.\nClassifiers.\nClassifiers are a generalization of acceptors that produce \"n\"-ary output where \"n\" is strictly greater than two.\nTransducers.\n\"Transducers\" produce output based on a given input and/or a state using actions. They are used for control applications and in the field of computational linguistics.\nIn control applications, two types are distinguished:\nSequencers.\n\"Sequencers\" (also called \"generators\") are a subclass of acceptors and transducers that have a single-letter input alphabet. They produce only one sequence, which can be seen as an output sequence of acceptor or transducer outputs.\nDeterminism.\nA further distinction is between \"deterministic\" (DFA) and \"non-deterministic\" (NFA, GNFA) automata. In a deterministic automaton, every state has exactly one transition for each possible input. In a non-deterministic automaton, an input can lead to one, more than one, or no transition for a given state. The powerset construction algorithm can transform any nondeterministic automaton into a (usually more complex) deterministic automaton with identical functionality.\nA finite-state machine with only one state is called a \"combinatorial FSM\". It only allows actions upon transition \"into\" a state. This concept is useful in cases where a number of finite-state machines are required to work together, and when it is convenient to consider a purely combinatorial part as a form of FSM to suit the design tools.\nAlternative semantics.\nThere are other sets of semantics available to represent state machines. For example, there are tools for modeling and designing logic for embedded controllers. They combine hierarchical state machines (which usually have more than one current state), flow graphs, and truth tables into one language, resulting in a different formalism and set of semantics. These charts, like Harel's original state machines, support hierarchically nested states, orthogonal regions, state actions, and transition actions.\nMathematical model.\nIn accordance with the general classification, the following formal definitions are found.\nA \"deterministic finite-state machine\" or \"deterministic finite-state acceptor\" is a quintuple formula_1, where:\nFor both deterministic and non-deterministic FSMs, it is conventional to allow formula_6 to be a partial function, i.e. formula_13 does not have to be defined for every combination of formula_14 and formula_15. If an FSM formula_16 is in a state formula_17, the next symbol is formula_18 and formula_13 is not defined, then formula_16 can announce an error (i.e. reject the input). This is useful in definitions of general state machines, but less useful when transforming the machine. Some algorithms in their default form may require total functions.\nA finite-state machine has the same computational power as a Turing machine that is restricted such that its head may only perform \"read\" operations, and always has to move from left to right. That is, each formal language accepted by a finite-state machine is accepted by such a kind of restricted Turing machine, and vice versa.\nA \"finite-state transducer\" is a sextuple formula_21, where:\nIf the output function depends on the state and input symbol (formula_30) that definition corresponds to the \"Mealy model\", and can be modelled as a Mealy machine. If the output function depends only on the state (formula_31) that definition corresponds to the \"Moore model\", and can be modelled as a Moore machine. A finite-state machine with no output function at all is known as a semiautomaton or transition system.\nIf we disregard the first output symbol of a Moore machine, formula_32, then it can be readily converted to an output-equivalent Mealy machine by setting the output function of every Mealy transition (i.e. labeling every edge) with the output symbol given of the destination Moore state. The converse transformation is less straightforward because a Mealy machine state may have different output labels on its incoming transitions (edges). Every such state needs to be split in multiple Moore machine states, one for every incident output symbol.\nOptimization.\nOptimizing an FSM means finding a machine with the minimum number of states that performs the same function. The fastest known algorithm doing this is the Hopcroft minimization algorithm. Other techniques include using an implication table, or the Moore reduction procedure. Additionally, acyclic FSAs can be minimized in linear time.\nImplementation.\nHardware applications.\nIn a digital circuit, an FSM may be built using a programmable logic device, a programmable logic controller, logic gates and flip flops or relays. More specifically, a hardware implementation requires a register to store state variables, a block of combinational logic that determines the state transition, and a second block of combinational logic that determines the output of an FSM.\nIn a \"Medvedev machine\", the output is directly connected to the state flip-flops minimizing the time delay between flip-flops and output.\nThrough state encoding for low power state machines may be optimized to minimize power consumption.\nSoftware applications.\nThe following concepts are commonly used to build software applications with finite-state machines:\nFinite-state machines and compilers.\nFinite automata are often used in the frontend of programming language compilers. Such a frontend may comprise several finite-state machines that implement a lexical analyzer and a parser.\nStarting from a sequence of characters, the lexical analyzer builds a sequence of language tokens (such as reserved words, literals, and identifiers) from which the parser builds a syntax tree. The lexical analyzer and the parser handle the regular and context-free parts of the programming language's grammar.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"We may think of a Markov chain as a process that moves successively through a set of states \"s1\", \"s2\", \u2026, \"sr\". \u2026 if it is in state \"si\" it moves on to the next stop to state \"sj\" with probability \"pij\".

It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.\nIn functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.\nFunctional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming that treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.\nFunctional programming has its roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based only on functions. Functional programming has historically been less popular than imperative programming, but many functional languages are seeing use today in industry and education, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang, Elixir, OCaml, Haskell, and F#. Lean is a functional programming language commonly used for verifying mathematical theorems. Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like JavaScript in the Web, R in statistics, J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML. Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, such as not allowing mutable values. In addition, many other programming languages support programming in a functional style or have implemented features from functional programming, such as C++ (since C++11), C#, Kotlin, Perl, PHP, Python, Go, Rust, Raku, Scala, and Java (since Java 8).\nHistory.\nThe lambda calculus, developed in the 1930s by Alonzo Church, is a formal system of computation built from function application. In 1937 Alan Turing proved that the lambda calculus and Turing machines are equivalent models of computation, showing that the lambda calculus is Turing complete. Lambda calculus forms the basis of all functional programming languages. An equivalent theoretical formulation, combinatory logic, was developed by Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel and Haskell Curry in the 1920s and 1930s.\nChurch later developed a weaker system, the simply typed lambda calculus, which extended the lambda calculus by assigning a data type to all terms. This forms the basis for statically typed functional programming.\nThe first high-level functional programming language, Lisp, was developed in the late 1950s for the IBM 700/7000 series of scientific computers by John McCarthy while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Lisp functions were defined using Church's lambda notation, extended with a label construct to allow recursive functions. Lisp first introduced many paradigmatic features of functional programming, though early Lisps were multi-paradigm languages, and incorporated support for numerous programming styles as new paradigms evolved. Later dialects, such as Scheme and Clojure, and offshoots such as Dylan and Julia, sought to simplify and rationalise Lisp around a cleanly functional core, while Common Lisp was designed to preserve and update the paradigmatic features of the numerous older dialects it replaced.\nInformation Processing Language (IPL), 1956, is sometimes cited as the first computer-based functional programming language. It is an assembly-style language for manipulating lists of symbols. It does have a notion of \"generator\", which amounts to a function that accepts a function as an argument, and, since it is a low-level programming language, code can be data, so IPL can be regarded as having higher-order functions. However, it relies heavily on the mutating list structure and similar imperative features.\nKenneth E. Iverson developed APL in the early 1960s, described in his 1962 book \"A Programming Language\" (). APL was the primary influence on John Backus's FP. In the early 1990s, Iverson and Roger Hui created J. In the mid-1990s, Arthur Whitney, who had previously worked with Iverson, created K, which is used commercially in financial industries along with its descendant Q.\nIn the mid-1960s, Peter Landin invented SECD machine, the first abstract machine for a functional programming language, described a correspondence between ALGOL 60 and the lambda calculus, and proposed the ISWIM programming language.\nJohn Backus presented FP in his 1977 Turing Award lecture \"Can Programming Be Liberated From the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and its Algebra of Programs\". He defines functional programs as being built up in a hierarchical way by means of \"combining forms\" that allow an \"algebra of programs\"; in modern language, this means that functional programs follow the principle of compositionality. Backus's paper popularized research into functional programming, though it emphasized function-level programming rather than the lambda-calculus style now associated with functional programming.\nThe 1973 language ML was created by Robin Milner at the University of Edinburgh, and David Turner developed the language SASL at the University of St Andrews. Also in Edinburgh in the 1970s, Burstall and Darlington developed the functional language NPL. NPL was based on Kleene Recursion Equations and was first introduced in their work on program transformation. Burstall, MacQueen and Sannella then incorporated the polymorphic type checking from ML to produce the language Hope. ML eventually developed into several dialects, the most common of which are now OCaml and Standard ML.\nIn the 1970s, Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman developed Scheme, as described in the Lambda Papers and the 1985 textbook \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\". Scheme was the first dialect of lisp to use lexical scoping and to require tail-call optimization, features that encourage functional programming.\nIn the 1980s, Per Martin-L\u00f6f developed intuitionistic type theory (also called \"constructive\" type theory), which associated functional programs with constructive proofs expressed as dependent types. This led to new approaches to interactive theorem proving and has influenced the development of subsequent functional programming languages.\nThe lazy functional language, Miranda, developed by David Turner, initially appeared in 1985 and had a strong influence on Haskell. With Miranda being proprietary, Haskell began with a consensus in 1987 to form an open standard for functional programming research; implementation releases have been ongoing as of 1990.\nMore recently it has found use in niches such as parametric CAD in the OpenSCAD language built on the CGAL framework, although its restriction on reassigning values (all values are treated as constants) has led to confusion among users who are unfamiliar with functional programming as a concept.\nFunctional programming continues to be used in commercial settings.\nConcepts.\nA number of concepts and paradigms are specific to functional programming, and generally foreign to imperative programming (including object-oriented programming). However, programming languages often cater to several programming paradigms, so programmers using \"mostly imperative\" languages may have utilized some of these concepts.\nFirst-class and higher-order functions.\nHigher-order functions are functions that can either take other functions as arguments or return them as results. In calculus, an example of a higher-order function is the differential operator formula_1, which returns the derivative of a function formula_2.\nHigher-order functions are closely related to first-class functions in that higher-order functions and first-class functions both allow functions as arguments and results of other functions. The distinction between the two is subtle: \"higher-order\" describes a mathematical concept of functions that operate on other functions, while \"first-class\" is a computer science term for programming language entities that have no restriction on their use (thus first-class functions can appear anywhere in the program that other first-class entities like numbers can, including as arguments to other functions and as their return values).\nHigher-order functions enable partial application or currying, a technique that applies a function to its arguments one at a time, with each application returning a new function that accepts the next argument. This lets a programmer succinctly express, for example, the successor function as the addition operator partially applied to the natural number one.\nPure functions.\nPure functions (or expressions) have no side effects (memory or I/O). This means that pure functions have several useful properties, many of which can be used to optimize the code:\nWhile most compilers for imperative programming languages detect pure functions and perform common-subexpression elimination for pure function calls, they cannot always do this for pre-compiled libraries, which generally do not expose this information, thus preventing optimizations that involve those external functions. Some compilers, such as gcc, add extra keywords for a programmer to explicitly mark external functions as pure, to enable such optimizations. Fortran 95 also lets functions be designated \"pure\". C++11 added codice_1 keyword with similar semantics.\nRecursion.\nIteration (looping) in functional languages is usually accomplished via recursion. Recursive functions invoke themselves, letting an operation be repeated until it reaches the base case. In general, recursion requires maintaining a stack, which consumes space in a linear amount to the depth of recursion. This could make recursion prohibitively expensive to use instead of imperative loops. However, a special form of recursion known as tail recursion can be recognized and optimized by a compiler into the same code used to implement iteration in imperative languages. Tail recursion optimization can be implemented by transforming the program into continuation passing style during compiling, among other approaches.\nThe Scheme language standard requires implementations to support proper tail recursion, meaning they must allow an unbounded number of active tail calls. Proper tail recursion is not simply an optimization; it is a language feature that assures users that they can use recursion to express a loop and doing so would be safe-for-space. Moreover, contrary to its name, it accounts for all tail calls, not just tail recursion. While proper tail recursion is usually implemented by turning code into imperative loops, implementations might implement it in other ways. For example, Chicken intentionally maintains a stack and lets the stack overflow. However, when this happens, its garbage collector will claim space back, allowing an unbounded number of active tail calls even though it does not turn tail recursion into a loop.\nCommon patterns of recursion can be abstracted away using higher-order functions, with catamorphisms and anamorphisms (or \"folds\" and \"unfolds\") being the most obvious examples. Such recursion schemes play a role analogous to built-in control structures such as loops in imperative languages.\nMost general purpose functional programming languages allow unrestricted recursion and are Turing complete, which makes the halting problem undecidable, can cause unsoundness of equational reasoning, and generally requires the introduction of inconsistency into the logic expressed by the language's type system. Some special purpose languages such as Rocq allow only well-founded recursion and are strongly normalizing (nonterminating computations can be expressed only with infinite streams of values called codata). As a consequence, these languages fail to be Turing complete and expressing certain functions in them is impossible, but they can still express a wide class of interesting computations while avoiding the problems introduced by unrestricted recursion. Functional programming limited to well-founded recursion with a few other constraints is called total functional programming.\nStrict versus non-strict evaluation.\nFunctional languages can be categorized by whether they use \"strict (eager)\" or \"non-strict (lazy)\" evaluation, concepts that refer to how function arguments are processed when an expression is being evaluated. The technical difference is in the denotational semantics of expressions containing failing or divergent computations. Under strict evaluation, the evaluation of any term containing a failing subterm fails. For example, the Python statement:\nprint(len([2 + 1, 3 * 2, 1 / 0, 5 - 4])) \nfails under strict evaluation because of the division by zero in the third element of the list. Under lazy evaluation, the length function returns the value 4 (i.e., the number of items in the list), since evaluating it does not attempt to evaluate the terms making up the list. In brief, strict evaluation always fully evaluates function arguments before invoking the function. Lazy evaluation does not evaluate function arguments unless their values are required to evaluate the function call itself.\nThe usual implementation strategy for lazy evaluation in functional languages is graph reduction. Lazy evaluation is used by default in several pure functional languages, including Miranda, Clean, and Haskell.\n argues for lazy evaluation as a mechanism for improving program modularity through separation of concerns, by easing independent implementation of producers and consumers of data streams. Launchbury 1993 describes some difficulties that lazy evaluation introduces, particularly in analyzing a program's storage requirements, and proposes an operational semantics to aid in such analysis. Harper 2009 proposes including both strict and lazy evaluation in the same language, using the language's type system to distinguish them.\nType systems.\nEspecially since the development of Hindley\u2013Milner type inference in the 1970s, functional programming languages have tended to use typed lambda calculus, rejecting all invalid programs at compilation time and risking false positive errors, as opposed to the untyped lambda calculus, that accepts all valid programs at compilation time and risks false negative errors, used in Lisp and its variants (such as Scheme), as they reject all invalid programs at runtime when the information is enough to not reject valid programs. The use of algebraic data types makes manipulation of complex data structures convenient; the presence of strong compile-time type checking makes programs more reliable in absence of other reliability techniques like test-driven development, while type inference frees the programmer from the need to manually declare types to the compiler in most cases.\nSome research-oriented functional languages such as Rocq, Agda, Cayenne, and Epigram are based on intuitionistic type theory, which lets types depend on terms. Such types are called dependent types. These type systems do not have decidable type inference and are difficult to understand and program with. But dependent types can express arbitrary propositions in higher-order logic. Through the Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism, then, well-typed programs in these languages become a means of writing formal mathematical proofs from which a compiler can generate certified code. While these languages are mainly of interest in academic research (including in formalized mathematics), they have begun to be used in engineering as well. Compcert is a compiler for a subset of the language C that is written in Rocq and formally verified.\nA limited form of dependent types called generalized algebraic data types (GADT's) can be implemented in a way that provides some of the benefits of dependently typed programming while avoiding most of its inconvenience. GADT's are available in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, in OCaml and in Scala, and have been proposed as additions to other languages including Java and C#.\nReferential transparency.\nFunctional programs do not have assignment statements, that is, the value of a variable in a functional program never changes once defined. This eliminates any chances of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution. So, functional programs are referentially transparent.\nConsider C assignment statement codice_2, this changes the value assigned to the variable codice_3. Let us say that the initial value of codice_3 was codice_5, then two consecutive evaluations of the variable codice_3 yields codice_7 and codice_8 respectively. Clearly, replacing codice_2 with either codice_7 or codice_8 gives a program a different meaning, and so the expression \"is not\" referentially transparent. In fact, assignment statements are never referentially transparent.\nNow, consider another function such as int plusOne(int x) { return x + 1; } \"is\" transparent, as it does not implicitly change the input x and thus has no such side effects.\nFunctional programs exclusively use this type of function and are therefore referentially transparent.\nData structures.\nPurely functional data structures are often represented in a different way to their imperative counterparts. For example, the array with constant access and update times is a basic component of most imperative languages, and many imperative data-structures, such as the hash table and binary heap, are based on arrays. Arrays can be replaced by maps or random access lists, which admit purely functional implementation, but have logarithmic access and update times. Purely functional data structures have persistence, a property of keeping previous versions of the data structure unmodified. In Clojure, persistent data structures are used as functional alternatives to their imperative counterparts. Persistent vectors, for example, use trees for partial updating. Calling the insert method will result in some but not all nodes being created.\nComparison to imperative programming.\nFunctional programming is very different from imperative programming. The most significant differences stem from the fact that functional programming avoids side effects, which are used in imperative programming to implement state and I/O. Pure functional programming completely prevents side-effects and provides referential transparency.\nHigher-order functions are rarely used in older imperative programming. A traditional imperative program might use a loop to traverse and modify a list. A functional program, on the other hand, would probably use a higher-order \"map\" function that takes a function and a list, generating and returning a new list by applying the function to each list item.\nImperative vs. functional programming.\nThe following two examples (written in Java) achieve the same effect: they multiply all even numbers in an array by 10 and add them all, storing the final sum in the variable codice_12.\nTraditional imperative loop:\nint[] numList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\nint result = 0;\nfor (int i: numList) {\n if (i % 2 == 0) {\n result += i * 10;\nFunctional programming with higher-order functions:\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nint[] numList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\nint result = Arrays.stream(numList)\n .filter(n -&gt; n % 2 == 0)\n .map(n -&gt; n * 10)\n .reduce(0, Integer::sum);\nSometimes the abstractions offered by functional programming might lead to development of more robust code that avoids certain issues that might arise when building upon large amount of complex, imperative code, such as off-by-one errors (see Greenspun's tenth rule).\nSimulating state.\nThere are tasks (for example, maintaining a bank account balance) that often seem most naturally implemented with state. Pure functional programming performs these tasks, and I/O tasks such as accepting user input and printing to the screen, in a different way.\nThe pure functional programming language Haskell implements them using monads, derived from category theory. Monads offer a way to abstract certain types of computational patterns, including (but not limited to) modeling of computations with mutable state (and other side effects such as I/O) in an imperative manner without losing purity. While existing monads may be easy to apply in a program, given appropriate templates and examples, many students find them difficult to understand conceptually, e.g., when asked to define new monads (which is sometimes needed for certain types of libraries).\nFunctional languages also simulate states by passing around immutable states. This can be done by making a function accept the state as one of its parameters, and return a new state together with the result, leaving the old state unchanged.\nImpure functional languages usually include a more direct method of managing mutable state. Clojure, for example, uses managed references that can be updated by applying pure functions to the current state. This kind of approach enables mutability while still promoting the use of pure functions as the preferred way to express computations.\nAlternative methods such as Hoare logic and uniqueness have been developed to track side effects in programs. Some modern research languages use effect systems to make the presence of side effects explicit.\nEfficiency issues.\nFunctional programming languages are typically less efficient in their use of CPU and memory than imperative languages such as C and Pascal. This is related to the fact that some mutable data structures like arrays have a very straightforward implementation using present hardware. Flat arrays may be accessed very efficiently with deeply pipelined CPUs, prefetched efficiently through caches (with no complex pointer chasing), or handled with SIMD instructions. It is also not easy to create their equally efficient general-purpose immutable counterparts. For purely functional languages, the worst-case slowdown is logarithmic in the number of memory cells used, because mutable memory can be represented by a purely functional data structure with logarithmic access time (such as a balanced tree). However, such slowdowns are not universal. For programs that perform intensive numerical computations, functional languages such as OCaml and Clean are only slightly slower than C according to The Computer Language Benchmarks Game. For programs that handle large matrices and multidimensional databases, array functional languages (such as J and K) were designed with speed optimizations.\nImmutability of data can in many cases lead to execution efficiency by allowing the compiler to make assumptions that are unsafe in an imperative language, thus increasing opportunities for inline expansion. Even if the involved copying that may seem implicit when dealing with persistent immutable data structures might seem computationally costly, some functional programming languages, like Clojure solve this issue by implementing mechanisms for safe memory sharing between \"formally\" \"immutable\" data. Rust distinguishes itself by its approach to data immutability which involves immutable references and a concept called \"lifetimes.\"\nImmutable data with separation of identity and state and shared-nothing schemes can also potentially be more well-suited for concurrent and parallel programming by the virtue of reducing or eliminating the risk of certain concurrency hazards, since concurrent operations are usually atomic and this allows eliminating the need for locks. This is how for example codice_13 classes are implemented, where some of them are immutable variants of the corresponding classes that are not suitable for concurrent use. Functional programming languages often have a concurrency model that instead of shared state and synchronization, leverages message passing mechanisms (such as the actor model, where each actor is a container for state, behavior, child actors and a message queue). This approach is common in Erlang/Elixir or Akka.\nLazy evaluation may also speed up the program, even asymptotically, whereas it may slow it down at most by a constant factor (however, it may introduce memory leaks if used improperly). Launchbury 1993 discusses theoretical issues related to memory leaks from lazy evaluation, and O'Sullivan \"et al.\" 2008 give some practical advice for analyzing and fixing them.\nHowever, the most general implementations of lazy evaluation making extensive use of dereferenced code and data perform poorly on modern processors with deep pipelines and multi-level caches (where a cache miss may cost hundreds of cycles) .\nAbstraction cost.\nSome functional programming languages might not optimize abstractions such as higher order functions like \"map\" or \"filter\" as efficiently as the underlying imperative operations. Consider, as an example, the following two ways to check if 5 is an even number in Clojure:\nWhen benchmarked using the https:// tool on a Ryzen 7900X GNU/Linux PC in a Leiningen REPL 2.11.2, running on Java VM version 22 and Clojure version 1.11.1, the first implementation, which is implemented as:\n(defn even?\n \"Returns true if n is even, throws an exception if n is not an integer\"\n {:added \"1.0\"\n [n] (if (integer? n)\n (zero? (bit-and (clojure.lang.RT/uncheckedLongCast n) 1))\n (throw (IllegalArgumentException. (str \"Argument must be an integer: \" n)))))\nhas the mean execution time of 4.76 ms, while the second one, in which .equals is a direct invocation of the underlying Java method, has a mean execution time of 2.8 \u03bcs \u2013 roughly 1700 times faster. Part of that can be attributed to the type checking and exception handling involved in the implementation of even?. For instance the https:// for Go, which implements various higher-order functions common in functional programming languages using generics. In a benchmark provided by the library's author, calling codice_14 is 4% slower than an equivalent codice_15 loop and has the same allocation profile, which can be attributed to various compiler optimizations, such as inlining.\nOne distinguishing feature of Rust are \"zero-cost abstractions\". This means that using them imposes no additional runtime overhead. This is achieved thanks to the compiler using loop unrolling, where each iteration of a loop, be it imperative or using iterators, is converted into a standalone Assembly instruction, without the overhead of the loop controlling code. If an iterative operation writes to an array, the resulting array's elements will be stored in specific CPU registers, allowing for constant-time access at runtime.\nFunctional programming in non-functional languages.\nIt is possible to use a functional style of programming in languages that are not traditionally considered functional languages. For example, both D and Fortran 95 explicitly support pure functions.\nJavaScript, Lua, Python and Go had first class functions from their inception. Python had support for \"lambda\", \"map\", \"reduce\", and \"filter\" in 1994, as well as closures in Python 2.2, though Python 3 relegated \"reduce\" to the codice_16 standard library module. First-class functions have been introduced into other mainstream languages such as Perl 5.0 in 1994, PHP 5.3, Visual Basic 9, C# 3.0, C++11, and Kotlin.\nIn Perl, lambda, map, reduce, filter, and closures are fully supported and frequently used. The book Higher-Order Perl, released in 2005, was written to provide an expansive guide on using Perl for functional programming.\nIn PHP, anonymous classes, closures and lambdas are fully supported. Libraries and language extensions for immutable data structures are being developed to aid programming in the functional style.\nIn Java, anonymous classes can sometimes be used to simulate closures; however, anonymous classes are not always proper replacements to closures because they have more limited capabilities. Java 8 supports lambda expressions as a replacement for some anonymous classes.\nIn C#, anonymous classes are not necessary, because closures and lambdas are fully supported. Libraries and language extensions for immutable data structures are being developed to aid programming in the functional style in C#.\nMany object-oriented design patterns are expressible in functional programming terms: for example, the strategy pattern simply dictates use of a higher-order function, and the visitor pattern roughly corresponds to a catamorphism, or fold.\nSimilarly, the idea of immutable data from functional programming is often included in imperative programming languages, for example the tuple in Python, which is an immutable array, and Object.freeze() in JavaScript.\nComparison to logic programming.\nLogic programming can be viewed as a generalisation of functional programming, in which functions are a special case of relations.\nFor example, the function, mother(X) = Y, (every X has only one mother Y) can be represented by the relation mother(X, Y). Whereas functions have a strict input-output pattern of arguments, relations can be queried with any pattern of inputs and outputs. Consider the following logic program:\nmother(charles, elizabeth).\nmother(harry, diana).\nThe program can be queried, like a functional program, to generate mothers from children:\n?- mother(harry, X).\nX = diana.\n?- mother(charles, X).\nX = elizabeth.\nBut it can also be queried \"backwards\", to generate children:\n?- mother(X, elizabeth).\nX = charles.\n?- mother(X, diana).\nX = harry.\nIt can even be used to generate all instances of the mother relation:\n?- mother(X, Y).\nX = charles,\nY = elizabeth.\nX = harry,\nY = diana.\nCompared with relational syntax, functional syntax is a more compact notation for nested functions. For example, the definition of maternal grandmother in functional syntax can be written in the nested form:\nmaternal_grandmother(X) = mother(mother(X)).\nThe same definition in relational notation needs to be written in the unnested form:\nmaternal_grandmother(X, Y) :- mother(X, Z), mother(Z, Y).\nHere codice_17 means \"if\" and codice_18means \"and\".\nHowever, the difference between the two representations is simply syntactic. In Ciao Prolog, relations can be nested, like functions in functional programming:\ngrandparent(X) := parent(parent(X)).\nparent(X) := mother(X).\nparent(X) := father(X).\nmother(charles) := elizabeth.\nfather(charles) := phillip.\nmother(harry) := diana.\nfather(harry) := charles.\n?- grandparent(X,Y).\nX = harry,\nY = elizabeth.\nX = harry,\nY = phillip.\nCiao transforms the function-like notation into relational form and executes the resulting logic program using the standard Prolog execution strategy.\nApplications.\nText editors.\nEmacs, a highly extensible text editor family uses its own Lisp dialect for writing plugins. The original author of the most popular Emacs implementation, GNU Emacs and Emacs Lisp, Richard Stallman considers Lisp one of his favorite programming languages.\nSpreadsheets.\nSpreadsheets can be considered a form of pure, zeroth-order, strict-evaluation functional programming system. However, spreadsheets generally lack higher-order functions as well as code reuse, and in some implementations, also lack recursion. Several extensions have been developed for spreadsheet programs to enable higher-order and reusable functions, but so far remain primarily academic in nature.\nMicroservices.\nDue to their composability, functional programming paradigms can be suitable for microservices-based architectures.\nAcademia.\nFunctional programming is an active area of research in the field of programming language theory. There are several peer-reviewed publication venues focusing on functional programming, including the International Conference on Functional Programming, the Journal of Functional Programming, and the Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming.\nIndustry.\nFunctional programming has been employed in a wide range of industrial applications. For example, Erlang, which was developed by the Swedish company Ericsson in the late 1980s, was originally used to implement fault-tolerant telecommunications systems, but has since become popular for building a range of applications at companies such as Nortel, Facebook, \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France and WhatsApp. Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, was used as the basis for several applications on early Apple Macintosh computers and has been applied to problems such as training-simulation software and telescope control. OCaml, which was introduced in the mid-1990s, has seen commercial use in areas such as financial analysis, driver verification, industrial robot programming and static analysis of embedded software. Haskell, though initially intended as a research language, has also been applied in areas such as aerospace systems, hardware design and web programming.\nOther functional programming languages that have seen use in industry include Scala, F#, Wolfram Language, Lisp, Standard ML and Clojure. Scala has been widely used in Data science, while ClojureScript, Elm or PureScript are some of the functional frontend programming languages used in production. Elixir's Phoenix framework is also used by some relatively popular commercial projects, such as Font Awesome or Allegro (one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in Poland)'s classified ads platform \"Allegro Lokalnie.\"\nFunctional \"platforms\" have been popular in finance for risk analytics (particularly with large investment banks). Risk factors are coded as functions that form interdependent graphs (categories) to measure correlations in market shifts, similar in manner to Gr\u00f6bner basis optimizations but also for regulatory frameworks such as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. Given the use of OCaml and Caml variations in finance, these systems are sometimes considered related to a categorical abstract machine. Functional programming is heavily influenced by category theory.\nEducation.\nMany universities teach functional programming. Some treat it as an introductory programming concept while others first teach imperative programming methods.\nOutside of computer science, functional programming is used to teach problem-solving, algebraic and geometric concepts. It has also been used to teach classical mechanics, as in the book \"Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics\".\nIn particular, Scheme has been a relatively popular choice for teaching programming for years.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its main function is to keep the calendars aligned with the Earth's seasons, as the planet orbits the sun. \nIn the older Julian calendar, leap days are added to every year that is evenly divisible by four. However, this causes the calendar to slowly become misaligned with the Earth's seasons, by about 3 days every 400 years. (The Julian calendar continues to be used in some places as the basis for their liturgical calendar).\nThe Gregorian calendar is the standard civil calendar used in most of the world, and is a slight modification of the Julian calendar. In this calendar, a centennial year does not have a February 29 (despite being evenly divisible by 4) unless it is also evenly divisible by 400. Thus, in contrast to the Julian calendar, the years 1700, 1800 and 1900 did not have leap year days but both calendars had a February 29 in the years 1600 and 2000. \nThe convention of adding a \"February 29\" to be the leap day was not widely used before the 15th century. Instead, beginning with Julius Caesar's calendar edict of 45 BC until the 16th century (formally), February 24 was doubled\u00a0\u2013 two successive days had the same date. \nFebruary 29 is the 60th day of a leap year for both the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and 306 days remain until the end of the leap year. It is also the last day of meteorological winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the last day of meteorological summer in the Southern Hemisphere in leap years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1814 Key observed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore during the War of 1812. He was inspired upon seeing an American flag flying over the fort at dawn: his poem was published within a week with the suggested tune of the popular song \"To Anacreon in Heaven\". The song with Key's lyrics became known as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and slowly gained in popularity as an unofficial anthem, finally achieving official status as the national anthem more than a century later under President Herbert Hoover.\nKey was a lawyer in Maryland and Washington, D.C., for four decades and worked on important cases, including the Burr conspiracy trial, and he argued numerous times before the Supreme Court. He was nominated for District Attorney for the District of Columbia by President Andrew Jackson, where he served from 1833 to 1841. He was a devout Episcopalian.\nKey owned slaves from 1800, during which time abolitionists ridiculed his words, claiming that America was more like the \"Land of the Free and Home of the Oppressed\". As District Attorney, he suppressed abolitionists, and he lost a case against Reuben Crandall in 1836 where he accused the defendant's abolitionist publications of instigating slaves to rebel. He was also a leader of the American Colonization Society which sent former slaves to Africa. He freed some of his slaves in the 1830s, paying one as his farm foreman to supervise his other slaves. He publicly criticized slavery and gave free legal representation to some slaves seeking freedom, but he also represented owners of runaway slaves. He had eight slaves at the time of his death.\nEarly life.\nKey was born into an affluent family. Key's father John Ross Key, of English descent, was a lawyer, a commissioned officer in the Continental Army, and a judge. His mother, Ann Phoebe Dagworthy Charlton (February 6, 1756 \u2013 1830), was born to Arthur Charlton, a tavern keeper, and his wife, Eleanor Harrison of Frederick, in the colony of Maryland.\nKey grew up on the family plantation Terra Rubra in Frederick County, Maryland, which is now in Carroll County. He graduated from St.John's College, Annapolis, Maryland, in 1796 and read law under his uncle Philip Barton Key who was loyal to the British Crown during the War of Independence. He married Mary Tayloe Lloyd on January 1, 1802, daughter of Edward Lloyd IV of Wye House and Elizabeth Tayloe, daughter of John Tayloe II of Mount Airy and sister of John Tayloe III of The Octagon House. The couple raised their 11 children in their Georgetown residence, the Key House.\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\nKey and Colonel John Stuart Skinner dined aboard on September 7, 1814, following the Burning of Washington in August. They were the guests of Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, Rear-Admiral George Cockburn, and Major-General Robert Ross. Skinner and Key were there to plead for the release of Dr. William Beanes, a physician who resided in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, and a friend of Key who had been captured in his home on August 28. Beanes was accused of aiding the detention of several British Army stragglers who were ransacking local homes in search of food. Skinner, Key, and the released Beanes were allowed to return under guard to their own truce ship, but they were not allowed to go ashore because they had become familiar with the strength and position of the British units and their intention to launch an attack on Baltimore. Key was unable to do anything but watch the 25-hour bombardment of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore from dawn of September 13 to the next morning.\nAt dawn, Key was able to see a large American flag waving over the fort, and he started writing a poem about his experience on the back of a letter that he had kept in his pocket. On September 16, Key, Skinner, and Beanes were released from the fleet. When they arrived in Baltimore that evening, Key completed the poem in his room at the Indian Queen Hotel. His untitled and unsigned manuscript was printed as a broadside the next day under the title \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", with the notation: \"Tune \u2013 Anacreon in Heaven\". This was a popular tune that Key had already used as a setting for his 1805 song \"When the Warrior Returns\", celebrating American heroes of the First Barbary War. It was published in newspapers, first in Baltimore and then across the nation, under the new title The Star-Spangled Banner. It was somewhat difficult to sing, yet it became increasingly popular, competing with \"Hail, Columbia\" (1796) as the de facto national anthem by the time of the Mexican\u2013American War and the American Civil War. The song was finally adopted as the American national anthem more than a century after its first publication by Act of Congress in 1931, signed by President Herbert Hoover.\nLegal career.\nKey was a leading attorney in Frederick, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., for many years, with an extensive real estate and trial practice. He and his family settled in Georgetown in 1805 or 1806, near the new national capital. He assisted his uncle Philip Barton Key in the sensational conspiracy trial of Aaron Burr and in the expulsion of Senator John Smith of Ohio. He made the first of his many arguments before the United States Supreme Court in 1807. In 1808, he assisted President Thomas Jefferson's attorney general in \"United Statesv.Peters\".\nIn 1829, Key assisted in the prosecution of Tobias Watkins, former U.S. Treasury auditor under President John Quincy Adams, for misappropriating public funds. He also handled the Petticoat affair concerning Secretary of War John Eaton, and he served as the attorney for Sam Houston in 1832 during his trial for assaulting Representative William Stanbery of Ohio. After years as an adviser to President Jackson, Key was nominated by the President to District Attorney for the District of Columbia in 1833. He served from 1833 to 1841 while also handling his own private legal cases. In 1835, he prosecuted Richard Lawrence for his attempt to assassinate President Jackson at the top steps of the Capitol, the first attempt to kill an American president.\nKey and slavery.\nKey purchased his first slave in 1800 or 1801 and owned six slaves in 1820. He freed seven in the 1830s, and owned eight when he died. One of his freed slaves continued to work for him for wages as his farm's foreman, supervising several slaves. Key also represented several slaves seeking their freedom, as well as several slave-owners seeking return of their runaway slaves. Key was one of the executors of John Randolph of Roanoke's will, which freed his 400 slaves, and Key fought to enforce the will for the next decade and to provide the freedmen and women with land to support themselves.\nKey is known to have publicly criticized slavery's cruelties, and a newspaper editorial stated that \"he often volunteered to defend the downtrodden sons and daughters of Africa.\" The editor said that Key \"convinced me that slavery was wrong\u2014radically wrong\".\nA quote increasingly credited to Key stating that free black people are \"a distinct and inferior race of people, which all experience proves to be the greatest evil that afflicts a community\" is erroneous. The quote is taken from an 1838 letter that Key wrote to Reverend Benjamin Tappan of Maine who had sent Key a questionnaire about the attitudes of Southern religious institutions about slavery. Rather than representing a statement by Key identifying his personal thoughts, the words quoted are offered by Key to describe the attitudes of others who assert that former slaves could not remain in the U.S. as paid laborers. This was the official policy of the American Colonization Society. Key was an ACS leader and fundraiser for the organization, but he himself did not send the men and women he freed to Africa upon their emancipation. The original confusion around this quote arises from ambiguities in the 1937 biography of Key by Edward S. Delaplaine.\nKey was a founding member and active leader of the American Colonization Society (ACS), whose primary goal was to send free black people to Africa. Though many free black people were born in the United States by this time, historians argue that upper-class American society, of which Key was a part, could never \"envision a multiracial society\". The ACS was not supported by most abolitionists or free black people of the time, but the organization's work would eventually lead to the creation of Liberia in 1847.\nAnti-abolitionism.\nIn the early 1830s American thinking on slavery changed quite abruptly. Considerable opposition to the American Colonization Society's project emerged. Led by newspaper editor and publisher William Lloyd Garrison, a growing portion of the population noted that only a very small number of free black people were actually moved, and they faced brutal conditions in West Africa, with very high mortality. Free Black people made it clear that few of them wanted to move, and if they did, it would be to Canada, Mexico, or Central America, not Africa. The leaders of the American Colonization Society, including Key, were predominantly slave owners. The Society was intended to preserve slavery, rather than eliminate it. In the words of philanthropist Gerrit Smith, it was \"quite as much an Anti-Abolition, as Colonization Society\". \"This Colonization Society had, by an invisible process, half conscious, half unconscious, been transformed into a serviceable organ and member of the Slave Power.\"\nThe alternative to the colonization of Africa, project of the American Colonization Society, was the total and immediate abolition of slavery in the United States. This Key was firmly against, with or without slave owner compensation, and he used his position as District Attorney to attack abolitionists. In 1833, he secured a grand jury indictment against Benjamin Lundy, editor of the anti-slavery publication \"Genius of Universal Emancipation\", and his printer William Greer, for libel after Lundy published an article that declared, \"There is neither mercy nor justice for colored people in this district [of Columbia]\". Lundy's article, Key said in the indictment, \"was intended to injure, oppress, aggrieve, and vilify the good name, fame, credit &amp; reputation of the Magistrates and constables\" of Washington. Lundy left town rather than face trial; Greer was acquitted.\nProsecution of Reuben Crandall.\nIn a larger unsuccessful prosecution, in August 1836 Key obtained an indictment against Reuben Crandall, brother of controversial Connecticut teacher Prudence Crandall, who had recently moved to Washington, D.C. It accused Crandall of \"seditious libel\" after two marshals (who operated as slave catchers in their off hours) found Crandall had a trunk full of anti-slavery publications in his Georgetown residence and office, five days after the Snow riot, caused by rumors that a mentally ill slave had attempted to kill an elderly white woman. In an April 1837 trial that attracted nationwide attention and that congressmen attended, Key charged that Crandall's publications instigated slaves to rebel. Crandall's attorneys acknowledged he opposed slavery, but denied any intent or actions to encourage rebellion. Evidence was introduced that the anti-slavery publications were packing materials used by his landlady in shipping his possessions to him. He had not \"published\" anything; he had given one copy to one man who had asked for it.\nKey, in his final address to the jury said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Are you willing, gentlemen, to abandon your country, to permit it to be taken from you, and occupied by the abolitionist, according to whose taste it is to associate and amalgamate with the negro? Or, gentlemen, on the other hand, are there laws in this community to defend you from the immediate abolitionist, who would open upon you the floodgates of such extensive wickedness and mischief?\nThe jury acquitted Crandall of all charges. This public and humiliating defeat, as well as family tragedies in 1835, diminished Key's political ambition. He resigned as District Attorney in 1840. He remained a staunch proponent of African colonization and a strong critic of the abolition movement until his death.\nCrandall died shortly after his acquittal of pneumonia contracted in the Washington jail.\nReligion.\nKey was a devout and prominent Episcopalian. In his youth, he almost became an Episcopal priest rather than a lawyer. Throughout his life he sprinkled biblical references in his correspondence. He was active in All Saints Parish in Frederick, Maryland, near his family's home. He also helped found or financially support several parishes in the new national capital, including St. John's Episcopal Church in Georgetown, Trinity Episcopal Church in present-day Judiciary Square, and Christ Church in Alexandria (at the time, in the District of Columbia). He was described as a \"devoted and intimate friend\" of Bishop William Meade of Virginia, and his \"good literary taste\" was credited for the quality of the church's hymnal.\nFrom 1818 until his death in 1843, Key was associated with the American Bible Society. He successfully opposed an abolitionist resolution presented to that group around 1838. \nKey also helped found two Episcopal seminaries, one in Baltimore and the other across the Potomac River in Alexandria (the Virginia Theological Seminary). Key also published a prose work called \"The Power of Literature, and Its Connection with Religion\", in 1834.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn January 11, 1843, Key died at the home of his daughter Elizabeth Howard in Baltimore from pleurisy at age 63. He was initially interred in Old Saint Paul's Cemetery in the vault of John Eager Howard but in 1866, his body was moved to his family plot in Frederick at Mount Olivet Cemetery.\nThe Key Monument Association erected a memorial in 1898 and the remains of both Francis Scott Key and his wife, Mary Tayloe Lloyd, were placed in a crypt in the base of the monument.\nDespite several efforts to preserve it, the Francis Scott Key residence was ultimately dismantled in1947. The residence had been located at 3516\u201318MStreet in Georgetown.\nThough Key had written poetry from time to time, often with heavily religious themes, these works were not collected and published until 14years after his death and in 1857 they were published . Two of his religious poems used as Christian hymns include \"Before the Lord We Bow\" and \"Lord, with Glowing Heart I'd Praise Thee\".\nIn1806, Key's sister, Anne Phoebe Charlton Key, married Roger\u00a0B.\u00a0Taney, who would later become Chief Justice of the United States. In 1846\u00a0one daughter, Alice, married U.S.\u00a0Senator George H. Pendleton and another, Ellen Lloyd, married Simon F. Blunt. In1859, Key's son Philip Barton Key II, who also served as United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, was shot and killed by Daniel Sickles\u200d\u2014\u200ca U.S.Representative from New York who would serve as a general in the American Civil War\u200d\u2014\u200cafter he discovered that Philip Barton Key was having an affair with his wife. Sickles was acquitted in the first use of the temporary insanity defense. In1861, Key's grandson Francis Key Howard was imprisoned in Fort\u00a0McHenry with the Mayor of Baltimore George William Brown and other locals deemed to be Confederate sympathizers.\nF.\u00a0Scott Fitzgerald, whose full name was Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was a distant cousin and the namesake of Key. Key's direct descendants include geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan, guitarist Dana Key, and American fashion designer and socialite Pauline de Rothschild.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called \"well-formed words\". A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar.\nIn computer science, formal languages are used, among others, as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages, in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with meanings or semantics. In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power. In logic and the foundations of mathematics, formal languages are used to represent the syntax of axiomatic systems, and mathematical formalism is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.\nThe field of formal language theory studies primarily the purely syntactic aspects of such languages\u2014that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of natural languages.\nHistory.\nIn the 17th century, Gottfried Leibniz imagined and described the characteristica universalis, a universal and formal language which utilised pictographs. Later, Carl Friedrich Gauss investigated the problem of Gauss codes.\nGottlob Frege attempted to realize Leibniz's ideas, through a notational system first outlined in \"Begriffsschrift\" (1879) and more fully developed in his 2-volume Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893/1903). This described a \"formal language of pure language.\"\nIn the first half of the 20th century, several developments were made with relevance to formal languages. Axel Thue published four papers relating to words and language between 1906 and 1914. The last of these introduced what Emil Post later termed 'Thue Systems', and gave an early example of an undecidable problem. Post would later use this paper as the basis for a 1947 proof \"that the word problem for semigroups was recursively insoluble\", and later devised the canonical system for the creation of formal languages.\nIn 1907, Leonardo Torres Quevedo introduced a formal language for the description of mechanical drawings (mechanical devices), in Vienna. He published \"Sobre un sistema de notaciones y s\u00edmbolos destinados a facilitar la descripci\u00f3n de las m\u00e1quinas\" (\"On a system of notations and symbols intended to facilitate the description of machines\"). Heinz Zemanek rated it as an equivalent to a programming language for the numerical control of machine tools.\nNoam Chomsky devised an abstract representation of formal and natural languages, known as the Chomsky hierarchy. In 1959 John Backus developed the Backus-Naur form to describe the syntax of a high level programming language, following his work in the creation of FORTRAN. Peter Naur was the secretary/editor for the ALGOL60 Report in which he used Backus\u2013Naur form to describe the Formal part of ALGOL60.\nWords over an alphabet.\nAn \"alphabet\", in the context of formal languages, can be any set; its elements are called \"letters\". An alphabet may contain an infinite number of elements; however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and many results apply only to them. It often makes sense to use an alphabet in the usual sense of the word, or more generally any finite character encoding such as ASCII or Unicode.\nA word over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e., string) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet \u03a3 is usually denoted by \u03a3* (using the Kleene star). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the \"empty word\", which is often denoted by e, \u03b5, \u03bb or even \u039b. By concatenation one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.\nIn some applications, especially in logic, the alphabet is also known as the \"vocabulary\" and words are known as \"formulas\" or \"sentences\"; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.\nDefinition.\nGiven a non-empty set formula_1, a formal language formula_2 over formula_1 is a subset of formula_4, which is the set of all possible finite-length words over formula_1. We call the set formula_1 the alphabet of formula_2. On the other hand, given a formal language formula_2 over formula_1, a word formula_10 is \"well-formed\" if formula_11. Similarly, an expression formula_12 is \"well-formed\" if formula_13. Sometimes, a formal language formula_2 over formula_1 has a set of clear rules and constraints for the creation of all possible well-formed words from formula_4.\nIn computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with natural languages, the adjective \"formal\" is often omitted as redundant. On the other hand, we can just say \"a formal language formula_2\" when its alphabet formula_1 is clear in the context.\nWhile formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactic rules, the actual definition of the concept \"formal language\" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less. In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as regular languages or context-free languages. The notion of a formal grammar may be closer to the intuitive concept of a \"language\", one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being accompanied with a formal grammar that describes it.\nExamples.\nThe following rules describe a formal language\u00a0L over the alphabet \u03a3\u00a0=\u00a0{0,\u20091,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094,\u20095,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098,\u20099,\u2009+,\u2009=}:\nUnder these rules, the string \"23+4=555\" is in\u00a0L, but the string \"=234=+\" is not. This formal language expresses natural numbers, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their syntax), not what they mean (semantics). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that \"0\" means the number zero, \"+\" means addition, \"23+4=555\" is false, etc.\nConstructions.\nFor finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language\u00a0L as just L\u00a0=\u00a0{a,\u2009b,\u2009ab,\u2009cba}. The degenerate case of this construction is the empty language, which contains no words at all (L\u00a0=\u00a0\u2205).\nHowever, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as \u03a3\u00a0=\u00a0{a,\u00a0b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: \"a\", \"abb\", \"ababba\", \"aaababbbbaab\",\u00a0... Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing \"L\"\u00a0=\u00a0{a,\u2009b,\u2009ab,\u2009cba}. Here are some examples of formal languages:\nLanguage-specification formalisms.\nFormal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as\nTypical questions asked about such formalisms include:\nSurprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is \"it cannot be done at all\", or \"it is extremely expensive\" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of computability theory and complexity theory. Formal languages may be classified in the Chomsky hierarchy based on the expressive power of their generative grammar as well as the complexity of their recognizing automaton. Context-free grammars and regular grammars provide a good compromise between expressivity and ease of parsing, and are widely used in practical applications.\nOperations on languages.\nCertain operations on languages are common. This includes the standard set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. Another class of operation is the element-wise application of string operations.\nExamples: suppose formula_19 and formula_20 are languages over some common alphabet formula_1.\nSuch string operations are used to investigate closure properties of classes of languages. A class of languages is closed under a particular operation when the operation, applied to languages in the class, always produces a language in the same class again. For instance, the context-free languages are known to be closed under union, concatenation, and intersection with regular languages, but not closed under intersection or complement. The theory of trios and abstract families of languages studies the most common closure properties of language families in their own right.\nApplications.\nProgramming languages.\nA compiler usually has two distinct components. A lexical analyzer, sometimes generated by a tool like codice_1, identifies the tokens of the programming language grammar, e.g. identifiers or keywords, numeric and string literals, punctuation and operator symbols, which are themselves specified by a simpler formal language, usually by means of regular expressions. At the most basic conceptual level, a parser, sometimes generated by a parser generator like codice_2, attempts to decide if the source program is syntactically valid, that is if it is well formed with respect to the programming language grammar for which the compiler was built.\nOf course, compilers do more than just parse the source code \u2013 they usually translate it into some executable format. Because of this, a parser usually outputs more than a yes/no answer, typically an abstract syntax tree. This is used by subsequent stages of the compiler to eventually generate an executable containing machine code that runs directly on the hardware, or some intermediate code that requires a virtual machine to execute.\nFormal theories, systems, and proofs.\nIn mathematical logic, a \"formal theory\" is a set of sentences expressed in a formal language.\nA \"formal system\" (also called a \"logical calculus\", or a \"logical system\") consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a \"deductive system\"). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules, which may be interpreted as valid rules of inference, or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Although a formal language can be identified with its formulas, a formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems. Two formal systems formula_42 and formula_43 may have all the same theorems and yet differ in some significant proof-theoretic way (a formula A may be a syntactic consequence of a formula B in one but not another for instance).\nA \"formal proof\" or \"derivation\" is a finite sequence of well-formed formulas (which may be interpreted as sentences, or propositions) each of which is an axiom or follows from the preceding formulas in the sequence by a rule of inference. The last sentence in the sequence is a theorem of a formal system. Formal proofs are useful because their theorems can be interpreted as true propositions.\nInterpretations and models.\nFormal languages are entirely syntactic in nature, but may be given semantics that give meaning to the elements of the language. For instance, in mathematical logic, the set of possible formulas of a particular logic is a formal language, and an interpretation assigns a meaning to each of the formulas\u2014usually, a truth value.\nThe study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics. In mathematical logic, this is often done in terms of model theory. In model theory, the terms that occur in a formula are interpreted as objects within mathematical structures, and fixed compositional interpretation rules determine how the truth value of the formula can be derived from the interpretation of its terms; a \"model\" for a formula is an interpretation of terms such that the formula becomes true.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Friedman, accompanied by a 10-part series broadcast on public television, that advocates free market principles. It was primarily a response to an earlier landmark book and television series \"The Age of Uncertainty\", by the noted economist John Kenneth Galbraith. \"Free To Choose\" has been translated into two dozen languages and a companion book.\nOverview.\n\"Free to Choose: A Personal Statement\" maintains that the free market works best for all members of a society, provides examples of how the free market engenders prosperity, and maintains that it can solve problems where other approaches have failed. Published in January 1980, the 297-page book contains 10 chapters. The book was on top of the United States best sellers list for five weeks.\nPBS broadcast the programs, beginning in January 1980. It was filmed at the invitation of Robert Chitester, the owner of WQLN-TV. It was based on a 15-part series of taped public lectures and question-and-answer sessions.\nThe general format was that of Milton Friedman visiting and narrating a number of success and failure stories in history, which he attributes to free-market capitalism or the lack thereof. Following the primary show, Friedman would engage in discussion moderated by Robert McKenzie with a number of selected debaters drawn from trade unions, academy and the business community, such as Donald Rumsfeld (then of G.D. Searle &amp; Company) and Frances Fox Piven of City University of New York. The interlocutors would offer objections to or support for the proposals put forward by Friedman, who would in turn respond. After the final episode, Friedman sat down for an interview with Lawrence Spivak.\nGuest debaters.\nGuest debaters included:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1990 rebroadcast.\nThe series was rebroadcast in 1990 with Linda Chavez moderating the episodes. Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Shultz, Ronald Reagan, David D. Friedman, and Steve Allen, each give personal introductions for one episode. This time, after the documentary segment, Milton Friedman sits down with a single discussion participant to debate the points raised in the episode.\nPositions advocated.\nThe Friedmans advocate \"laissez-faire\" economic policies, often criticizing interventionist government policies and their cost in personal freedoms and economic efficiency in the United States and abroad. They argue that international free trade has been restricted through tariffs and protectionism while domestic free trade and freedom have been limited through high taxation and regulation. They cite the 19th-century United Kingdom, the United States before the Great Depression, and modern Hong Kong as ideal examples of a minimalist economic policy. They contrast the economic growth of Japan after the Meiji Restoration and the economic stagnation of India after its independence from the British Empire, and argue that India has performed worse despite its superior economic potential due to its centralized planning. They argue that even countries with command economies, including the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, have been forced to adopt limited market mechanisms in order to operate.\nThe authors argue against government taxation on gas and tobacco and government regulation of the public school systems. The Friedmans claim that the Federal Reserve exacerbated the Great Depression by neglecting to prevent the decline of the money supply in the years leading up to it. They further argue that the American public falsely perceived the Depression to be a result of a failure of capitalism rather than the government, and that the Depression allowed the Federal Reserve Board to centralize its control of the monetary system despite its responsibility for it.\nOn the subject of welfare, the Friedmans argue that the United States has maintained a higher degree of freedom and productivity by avoiding the nationalizations and extensive welfare systems of Western European countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden. However, they also argue that welfare practices since the New Deal under \"the HEW empire\" have been harmful. They argue that public assistance programs have become larger than originally envisioned and are creating \"wards of the state\" as opposed to \"self-reliant individuals.\" They also argue that the Social Security System is fundamentally flawed, that urban renewal and public housing programs have contributed to racial inequality and diminished quality of low-income housing, and that Medicare and Medicaid are responsible for rising healthcare prices in the United States. They suggest completely replacing the welfare state with a negative income tax as a less harmful alternative.\nThe Friedmans also argue that declining academic performance in the United States is the result of increasing government control of the American education system tracing back to the 1840s, but suggest a voucher system as a politically feasible solution. They blame the 1970s recession and lower quality of consumer goods on extensive business regulations since the 1960s, and advocate abolishing the Food and Drug Administration, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Amtrak, and Conrail. They argue that the energy crisis would be resolved by abolishing the Department of Energy and price floors on crude oil. They recommend replacing the Environmental Protection Agency and environmental regulation with an effluent charge. They criticize labor unions for raising prices and lowering demand by enforcing high wage levels, and for contributing to unemployment by limiting jobs. They argue that inflation is caused by excessive government spending, the Federal Reserve's attempts to control interest rates, and full employment policy. They call for tighter control of Fed money supply despite the fact that it will result in a temporary period of high unemployment and low growth due to the interruption of the wage-price spiral. In the final chapter, they take note of recent current events that seem to suggest a return to free-market principles in academic thought and public opinion, and argue in favor of an \"economic Bill of Rights\" to cement the changes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is used annually as a circuit for the Formula One Australian Grand Prix, the supporting Supercars Championship Melbourne SuperSprint and other associated support races. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 licence.\nAlthough the entire track consists of normally public roads, each sector includes medium to high-speed characteristics more commonly associated with dedicated racetracks facilitated by grass and gravel run-off safety zones that are reconstructed annually. However, the circuit also has characteristics of a street circuit's enclosed nature due to concrete barriers annually built along the Lakeside Drive curve, in particular, where run-off is not available due to the proximity of the lake shore.\nDesign.\nThe circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake, a small man-altered lake (originally a large lagoon formed as part of the ancient Yarra River course) just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne. The road sections that are used were rebuilt before the inaugural event in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness. As a result, compared to other circuits that are held on public roads, the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface. Before 2007 there existed only a few other places on the Formula 1 calendar with a body of water close to the track. Many of the new tracks, such as Valencia, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are close to a body of water.\nThe course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive, drivers having commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times. However, the flat terrain around the lake, coupled with a track design that features few true straights, means that the track is not conducive to overtaking or easy spectating unless in possession of a grandstand seat.\nEach year, most of the trackside fencing, pedestrian overpasses, grandstands, and other motorsport infrastructure are erected approximately two months before the Grand Prix weekend and removed within 6 weeks after the event. The land around the circuit (including a large aquatic centre, a golf course, a Lakeside Stadium, some restaurants, and rowing boathouses) has restricted access during that entire period. Dissent is still prevalent among nearby residents and users of those other facilities, and some still maintain a silent protest against the event. Nevertheless, the event is reasonably popular in Melbourne and Australia (with a large European population and a general interest in motorsport). Middle Park, the home of South Melbourne FC was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at Albert Park.\nThe Grand Prix regularly draws crowds of over 270,000 spectators, with the 2024 drawing a record crowd of 452,055, including 132,106 on the main raceday. There has never been a night race at Albert Park, although the 2009 and 2010 events both started at 5:00\u00a0p.m. local time. The current contract for the Grand Prix at the circuit concludes in 2035.\nFollowing the postponement of the Australian Grand Prix in 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the track underwent layout changes, the most notable part was the modification of the turn 9\u201310 complex from a heavy right-left corner to a fast-sweeping right-left corner into turns 11 and 12. Further modifications included the widening of the pit lane by and the reprofiling of turn 13.\nEveryday access.\nDuring the nine months of the year when the track is not required for Grand Prix preparation or the race weekend, most of the track can be driven by ordinary street-registered vehicles either clockwise or anti-clockwise.\nOnly the sections between turns 3, 4, and 5, then 5 and 6, differ significantly from the race track configuration. Turn 4 is replaced by a car park access road running directly from turns 3 to 5. Between turns 5 and 6, the road is blocked. It is possible to drive from turn 5 on to Albert Road and back on to the track at turn 7 though three sets of lights control the flow of this option. The only set of lights on the actual track is halfway between turns 12 and 13, where drivers using Queens Road are catered for. The chicanes at turns 11 and 12 are considerably more open than that used in the Grand Prix, using the escape roads. Turn 9 is also a car park and traffic is directed down another escape road.\nThe speed limit for road cars is generally , while some short sections have a speed limit of , which is still slower than an F1 car under pit lane speed restrictions. The back of the track, turns 7 to 13 inclusive, is known as Lakeside Drive. Double lines separate the two-way traffic along most of Lakeside Drive with short road islands approximately every which means overtaking is illegal here. Black swans live and breed in Albert Park, and frequently cross the road causing traffic delays, sometimes with up to five cygnets (young swans).\nApproximately 80% of the track edge is lined with short parkland-style chain-linked fencing leaving normal drivers less room for error than F1 drivers have during race weekend. There is however substantial shoulder room between the outside of each lane and the fencing, which is used as parking along Aughtie Drive during the other nine months.\nHistory.\nAlbert Park Circuit (1953\u20131958).\nPrior to World War II, attempts were made to use Albert Park for motor racing. The first was in 1934 but failed due to opposition, and a second attempt for a motorcycle race in 1937 similarly failed. Finally in 1953 the Light Car Club of Australia were able to secure use of the circuit for that year's Australian Grand Prix.\nAlbert Park is the only venue to host the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-World Championship formats with an earlier configuration of the current circuit used for the race on two occasions during the 1950s. During this time racing was conducted in an anti-clockwise direction as opposed to the current circuit which runs clockwise.\nKnown as the Albert Park Circuit, the original course hosted a total of six race meetings:\nThe November 1958 meeting was the last on the original incarnation of the circuit, as it closed shortly after.\nRace lap records.\nAs of March 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Albert Park Circuit are listed as:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10946", "revid": "35791198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10946", "title": "Monaco Grand Prix", "text": "Formula One motor race\nThe Monaco Grand Prix () is a Formula One motor racing event held annually on the Circuit de Monaco, in late May or early June. Run since 1929, it is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world, and is one of the races\u2014along with the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans\u2014that form the Triple Crown of Motorsport. It is the only Grand Prix that does not adhere to the FIA's mandated minimum race distance for Formula One races.\nThe race is held on a narrow course laid out in the streets of Monaco, with many elevation changes and tight corners as well as the tunnel, making it one of the most demanding circuits in Formula One. In spite of the relatively low average speeds, the Monaco circuit is a dangerous place to race due to how narrow the track is, and the race often involves the intervention of the safety car.\nThe first Monaco Grand Prix took place on 14 April 1929, and the race eventually became part of the pre-Second World War European Championship and was included in the first World Championship of Drivers in 1950. It was twice designated the European Grand Prix, in 1955 and 1963, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. Graham Hill was known as \"Mr. Monaco\" due to his five Monaco wins in the 1960s. Ayrton Senna won the race more times than any other driver, with six victories, winning five races consecutively between 1989 and 1993. In the 82 editions of the Monaco Grand Prix, only two Mon\u00e9gasque drivers have won the race, Louis Chiron in 1931 and Charles Leclerc in 2024.\nThe circuit has been called \"an exceptional location of glamour and prestige\". Prior to 2026, the Formula One event is usually held on the last weekend of May and is known as one of the largest weekends in motor racing, as the Formula One race occurs on the same Sunday as the Indianapolis 500 (IndyCar Series) and the Coca-Cola 600 (NASCAR Cup Series).\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nLike many European races, the Monaco Grand Prix predates the current World Championship. The principality's first Grand Prix was organised in 1929 by Antony Nogh\u00e8s, under the auspices of Prince Louis II, through the Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM), of which he was president. The ACM organised the Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo, and in 1928 applied to the \"Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus\" (AIACR), the international governing body of motorsport, to be upgraded from a regional French club to full national status. Their application was refused due to the lack of a major motorsport event held wholly within Monaco's boundaries. The rally could not be considered, as it mostly used the roads of other European countries.\nTo attain full national status, Nogh\u00e8s proposed the creation of an automobile Grand Prix in the streets of Monte Carlo. He obtained the official sanction of Prince Louis II and the support of Mon\u00e9gasque \"Grand Prix\" driver Louis Chiron. Chiron thought Monaco's topography was well-suited to setting up a race track.\nThe first race, held on 14 April 1929, was won by William Grover-Williams (using the pseudonym \"Williams\"), driving a works Bugatti Type 35B. It was an invitation-only event, but not all of those who were invited decided to attend. The leading Maserati and Alfa Romeo drivers decided not to compete, but Bugatti was well represented. Mercedes sent their leading driver, Rudolf Caracciola. Starting fifteenth, Caracciola drove a fighting race, taking his SSK into the lead before wasting &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442 minutes on refuelling and a tyre change to finish second. Another driver who competed using a pseudonym was \"Georges Philippe\", the Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Chiron was unable to compete, having a prior commitment to compete in the Indianapolis 500.\nCaracciola's SSK was refused permission to race the following year, but Chiron did compete (in the works Bugatti Type 35C), when he was beaten by privateer Ren\u00e9 Dreyfus and his Bugatti Type 35B, and finished second. Chiron took victory in the 1931 race driving a Bugatti. He remained the only native of Monaco to have won the event until 2024.\nPre-war.\nThe race quickly grew in importance after its inception. Because of the high number of races which were being termed 'Grands Prix', the AIACR formally recognised the most important race of each of its affiliated national automobile clubs as International Grands Prix, or \"Grandes \u00c9preuves\", and in 1933 Monaco was ranked as such alongside the French, Belgian, Italian, and Spanish Grands Prix. That year's race was the first Grand Prix in which grid positions were decided, as they are now, by practice time rather than the established method of balloting. The race saw Achille Varzi and Tazio Nuvolari exchange the lead many times before the race settled in Varzi's favour on the final lap when Nuvolari's car caught fire.\nThe race became a round of the new European Championship in 1936, when stormy weather and a broken oil line led to a series of crashes, eliminating the Mercedes-Benzes of Chiron, Fagioli, and von Brauchitsch, as well as Bernd Rosemeyer's \"Typ C\" for newcomer Auto Union; Rudolf Caracciola, proving the truth of his nickname, \"Regenmeister\" (Rainmaster), went on to win. In 1937, von Brauchitsch duelled Caracciola before coming out on top. It was the last prewar \"Grand Prix\" at Monaco, for in 1938, the lack of profits for organisers, and demand for nearly \u00a3500 (approximately \u00a3 adjusted to 2023 inflation) in appearance money per top entrant led AIACR to cancel the event, while looming war overtook it in 1939, and the Second World War ended organised racing in Europe until 1945.\nPost-war Grand Prix.\nRacing in Europe started again on 9 September 1945 at the Bois de Boulogne Park in the city of Paris, four months and one day after the end of the war in Europe. However, the Monaco Grand Prix was not run between 1945 and 1947 due to financial reasons. In 1946, a new premier racing category, Grand Prix, was defined by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the successor of the AIACR, based on the pre-war voiturette class. A Monaco Grand Prix was run to this formula in 1948, won by the future world champion Nino Farina in a Maserati 4CLT.\nThe 1948 race also included a motorbike race.\nFormula One.\nEarly championship days.\nThe 1949 event was cancelled due to the death of Prince Louis II; it was included in the new Formula One World Drivers' Championship the following year. The race provided future five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio with his first win in a World Championship race, as well as third place for the 51-year-old Louis Chiron, his best result in the World Championship era. However, there was no race in 1951 due to budgetary concerns and a lack of regulations in the sport.\n1952 was the first of the two years in which the World Drivers' Championship was run to less powerful Formula Two regulations. The race was run to sports car rules instead, and it did not form part of the World Championship.\nNo races were held in 1953 or 1954 due to the fact that the car regulations were not finalized.\nThe Monaco Grand Prix returned in 1955, again as part of the Formula One World Championship, and this would begin a streak of 64 consecutive years in which the race was held. In the 1955 race, Maurice Trintignant won in Monte Carlo for the first time and Chiron again scored points and at 56 became the oldest driver to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix. It was not until 1957, when Fangio won again, that the Grand Prix saw a double winner. Between 1954 and 1961 Fangio's former Mercedes colleague, Stirling Moss, went one better, as did Trintignant, who won the race again in 1958 driving a Cooper. The 1961 race saw Moss fend off three works Ferrari 156s in a year-old privateer Rob Walker Racing Team Lotus 18 to take his third Monaco victory.\nGraham Hill's era.\nBritain's Graham Hill won the race five times in the 1960s and became known as \"King of Monaco\" and \"Mr. Monaco\". He first won in 1963, and then won the next two years. In the 1965 race, he took pole position and led from the start, but went up an escape road on lap\u00a025 to avoid hitting a slow backmarker. Re-joining in fifth place, Hill set several new lap records on the way to winning. The race was also notable for Jim Clark's absence (he was participating in the Indianapolis 500), and for Paul Hawkins's Lotus ending up in the harbour. Hill's teammate, Briton Jackie Stewart, won in 1966 and New Zealander Denny Hulme won in 1967, but Hill won the next two years, the 1969 event being his final Formula One championship victory, by which time he was a double Formula One world champion.\nTrack alterations, safety, and increasing business interests.\nBy the start of the 1970s, efforts by Jackie Stewart saw several Formula One events cancelled because of safety concerns. For the 1969 event, Armco barriers were placed at specific points for the first time in the circuit's history. Before that, the circuit's conditions were (aside from the removal of people's production cars parked on the side of the road) virtually identical to everyday road use. If a driver went off, he had a chance to crash into whatever was next to the track (buildings, trees, lamp posts, glass windows, and even a train station), and in Alberto Ascari's and Paul Hawkins's cases, the harbour water, because the concrete road the course used had no Armco to protect the drivers from going off the track and into the Mediterranean. The circuit gained more Armco in specific points for the next two races, and by 1972, the circuit was almost completely Armco-lined. For the first time in its history, the Monaco circuit was altered in 1972, as the pits were moved next to the waterfront straight between the chicane and Tabac, and the chicane was moved further forward right before Tabac, becoming the junction point between the pits and the course. The course was changed again for the 1973 race. The Rainier III Nautical Stadium was constructed where the straight that went behind the pits was, and the circuit introduced a double chicane that went around the new swimming pool (this chicane complex is known today as \"Swimming Pool\"). This created space for a whole new pit facility, and in 1976 the course was altered yet again; the Sainte Devote corner was made slower and a chicane was placed right before the pit straight.\nBy the early 1970s, as Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone started to marshal the collective bargaining power of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA), Monaco was prestigious enough to become an early bone of contention. Historically, the number of cars permitted in a race was decided by the race organiser, in this case the ACM, which had always set a low number of around 16. In 1972, Ecclestone started to negotiate deals which relied on FOCA guaranteeing at least 18 entrants for every race. A stand-off over this issue left the 1972 race in jeopardy until the ACM gave in and agreed that 26 cars could participate\u00a0\u2013 the same number permitted at most other circuits. Two years later, in 1974, the ACM got the numbers back down to 18.\nBecause of its tight confines, slow average speeds, and punishing nature, Monaco has often thrown up unexpected results. In the 1982 race, Ren\u00e9 Arnoux led the first 15\u00a0laps before retiring. Alain Prost then led until four laps from the end, when he spun off on the wet track, hit the barriers and lost a wheel, giving Riccardo Patrese the lead. Patrese himself spun with only a lap and a half to go, letting Didier Pironi through to the front, followed by Andrea de Cesaris. On the last lap, Pironi ran out of fuel in the tunnel, but De Cesaris also ran out of fuel before he could overtake. In the meantime, Patrese had bump-started his car and went through to score his first Grand Prix win.\nIn 1983, the ACM became entangled in the disagreements between F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) and FOCA. The ACM, with the agreement of Bernie Ecclestone, negotiated an individual television rights deal with ABC in the United States. This broke an agreement enforced by FISA for a single central negotiation of television rights. Jean-Marie Balestre, president of FISA, announced that the Monaco Grand Prix would not form part of the Formula One world championship in 1985. The ACM fought their case in the French courts. They won the case and the race was eventually reinstated.\nIn 1986, the Nouvelle Chicane was added by expanding into the nearby water to make the track wider.\nEra of Prost &amp; Senna dominance.\nFor the decade from 1984 to 1993, the race was won by only two drivers, arguably the two best drivers in Formula One at the time \u2013 Frenchman Alain Prost and Brazilian Ayrton Senna. Prost, already a winner of the support race for Formula Three cars in 1979, took his first Monaco win at the 1984 race. The race started 45\u00a0minutes late after heavy rain. Prost led briefly before Nigel Mansell overtook him on lap 11. Mansell crashed out five laps later, letting Prost back into the lead. On lap\u00a027, Prost led from Ayrton Senna's Toleman and Stefan Bellof's Tyrrell. Senna was catching Prost, and Bellof was catching both of them in the only naturally aspirated car in the race. However, on lap 31, the race was controversially stopped due to conditions deemed to be undriveable. Later, FISA fined the clerk of the course, Jacky Ickx, $6,000 and suspended his licence for not consulting the stewards before stopping the race. The drivers received only half of the points that would usually be awarded, as the race had been stopped before two-thirds of the intended race distance had been completed.\nProst won 1985 after polesitter Senna retired with a blown Renault engine in his Lotus after over-revving it at the start, and Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari retook the lead twice, but he went off the track at Sainte-Devote, where Brazilian Nelson Piquet and Italian Riccardo Patrese had a huge accident only a few laps previously and oil and debris littered the track. Prost passed Alboreto, who retook the Frenchman, and then he punctured a tyre after running over bodywork debris from the Piquet/Patrese accident, which dropped him to 4th. He was able to pass his Roman countrymen Andrea De Cesaris and Elio de Angelis, but finished 2nd behind Prost. The French Prost dominated 1986 after starting from pole position, a race where the Nouvelle Chicane had been changed on the grounds of safety.\nSenna holds the record for the most victories in Monaco, with six, including five consecutive wins between 1989 and 1993, as well as eight podium finishes in ten starts. His 1987 win was the first time a car with an active suspension had won a Grand Prix. He won this race after Briton Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Honda went out with a broken exhaust. His win was very popular with the people of Monaco, and when he was arrested on the Monday following the race for riding a motorcycle without wearing a helmet, he was released by the officers after they realised who he was. Senna dominated 1988 and was able to get ahead of his teammate Prost while the Frenchman was held up for most of the race by Austrian Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari. By the time Prost got past Berger, he pushed as hard as he could and set a lap some 6 seconds faster than Senna's; Senna then set 2 fastest laps, and while pushing as hard as possible, he touched the barrier at the Portier corner and crashed into the Armco separating the road from the Mediterranean. Senna was so upset that he went back to his Monaco flat and was not heard from until the evening. Prost went on to win for the fourth time.\nSenna dominated 1989 while Prost was stuck behind backmarker Ren\u00e9 Arnoux and others; the Brazilian also dominated 1990 and 1991. At the 1992 event Nigel Mansell, who had won all five races held to that point in the season, took pole and dominated the race in his Williams FW14B-Renault. However, with seven laps remaining, Mansell suffered a loose wheel nut and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Senna's McLaren-Honda, who was on worn tyres. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than Senna's and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final four laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just two-tenths of a second behind the Brazilian. It was Senna's fifth win at Monaco, equalling Graham Hill's record. Senna had a poor start to the 1993 event, crashing in practice and qualifying 3rd behind pole-sitter Prost and the rising German star Michael Schumacher. Both of them beat Senna to the first corner, but Prost had to serve a time penalty for jumping the start and Schumacher retired after suspension problems, so Senna took his sixth win to break Graham Hill's record for most wins at the Monaco Grand Prix. Runner-up Damon Hill commented, \"If my father was around now, he would be the first to congratulate Ayrton.\"\n1990s: Tragedies and triumphs.\nThe 1994 race was an emotional and tragic affair. It came two weeks after the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola in which Austrian Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna both died in crashes on successive days. During the Monaco event, Austrian Karl Wendlinger had an accident in his Sauber in the tunnel; he went into a coma and was to miss the rest of the season. The German Michael Schumacher won the 1994 Monaco event. Schumacher also won the 1995 event. The 1996 race saw Michael Schumacher take pole position before crashing out on the first lap after being overtaken by Damon Hill. Hill led the first 40\u00a0laps before his engine expired in the tunnel. Jean Alesi took the lead but suffered suspension failure 20\u00a0laps later. Olivier Panis, who started in 14th place, moved into the lead and stayed there until the end of the race, being pushed all the way by David Coulthard. It was Panis's only win, and the last for his Ligier team. Only three cars crossed the finish line, but seven were classified.\n21st century.\nIn 2004, land reclamation work was completed, allowing expansion of the pit area with larger temporary garages. A temporary 6,000 seat grandstand would also be constructed in the Swimming Pool area. \nSeven-time world champion Schumacher would eventually win the race five times, matching Graham Hill's record. In his appearance at the 2006 event, he attracted criticism when, while provisionally holding pole position and with the qualifying session drawing to a close, he stopped his car at the Rascasse hairpin, blocking the track and obliging competitors to slow down. Although Schumacher claimed it was the unintentional result of a genuine car failure, the FIA disagreed and he was sent to the back of the grid.\nIn July 2010, Bernie Ecclestone announced that a 10-year deal had been reached with the race organisers, keeping the race on the calendar until at least 2020.\nIn 2025, the fastest yet qualifying lap was set by Lando Norris in qualifying (Q3) for the 2025 Monaco Grand Prix, at a time of 1:09.954.\n2020s.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FIA announced the 2020 Monaco Grand Prix's postponement, along with the two other races scheduled for May 2020, to help prevent the spread of the virus.\nHowever, later the same day the Automobile Club de Monaco confirmed that the Grand Prix was instead cancelled, making 2020 the first time the Grand Prix was not run since 1954. The race returned in 2021.\nThe 2022 event saw the Mon\u00e9gasque driver, Charles Leclerc of Scuderia Ferrari, achieve his first Monaco Grand Prix pole position at the Circuit de Monaco (he had taken pole the previous year but could not start due to driveshaft failure). However, a critical strategical error meant Leclerc would drop to fourth, with Sergio P\u00e9rez winning the race.\nIn 2024, Charles Leclerc became the second Mon\u00e9gasque to win the race following Louis Chiron's win in 1931. The race was the first time the top 10 cars finished in their starting order, and there were no successful overtakes. \nIn November 2024, the ACM signed a new race contract to remain on the F1 calendar until the 2031 season, extending their previous agreement which was set to expire in 2025. As part of this deal, the ACM relinquished advertising rights and television coverage to Formula One Management, with previous races having their television coverage produced by Tele Monte Carlo. From 2026, the race will be held on the first weekend of June, and will therefore no longer clash with the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600. Another extension to 2035 was confirmed in September 2025.\nThe 2025 Monaco Grand Prix will carry different tyre usage rules for the rest of the 2025 championship as drivers will be required if the race is dry to make two mandatory tyre changes using at least two different compounds rather the one mandatory change to a different compound as will remain the case at all of the other 2025 events. Also unlike other races these mandatory tyre changes will still be in effect even if wet weather tyres compounds (meaning both Wets and Intermediates) are used. These changes however did not improve the racing quality and overtake opportunities, and Lando Norris managed to win the race after starting on pole position.\nCircuit.\nThe Grand Prix takes place on the Circuit de Monaco which traverses the narrow city streets of Monte Carlo and La Condamine alongside Monaco's harbour, Port Hercules. It has hosted the Grand Prix every time it has been run since 1929 \u2013 only the Italian Grand Prix, which has been held at Autodromo Nazionale Monza during every Formula One regulated year except 1980, has a similarly lengthy and close relationship with a single circuit.\nThe race circuit has many elevation changes, tight corners, and a narrow course that requires millimetre accuracy and makes it one of the most demanding tracks in Formula One racing. Drivers will often touch the track walls to achieve a fast lap time. In 1929, \"La Vie Automobile\" magazine offered the opinion that \"Any respectable traffic system would have covered the track with \u00abDanger\u00bb sign posts left, right and centre\". As of 2025[ [update]], two drivers have crashed and ended up in the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in 1955. Despite undergoing minor changes throughout its history, the circuit is largely unchanged since 1929 and remains widely regarded as the ultimate test of driving skills and mental strength. If Monaco were not already an existing Grand Prix, it is unlikely that its street circuit would be permitted to host Formula One due to its short track length and concerns with safety and overtaking. However, as the 'Crown Jewel' of Formula One with a near century-old heritage in motorsport, Monaco is granted some exceptions to accommodate its limited possibilities for expansion.\nTriple Formula One champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing at Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room,\" illustrating the unique challenges posed by the circuit's narrow streets. He further emphasized the significance of victory at Monaco by stating that \"a win here was worth two anywhere else\".\nNotably, the circuit includes a tunnel. The contrast of daylight and gloom when entering/exiting the tunnel presents \"challenges not faced elsewhere\", as the drivers have to \"adjust their vision as they emerge from the tunnel at the fastest point of the track and brake for the chicane in the daylight.\".\nThe fastest-ever qualifying lap was set by Lando Norris in qualifying (Q3) for the 2025 Monaco Grand Prix, at a time of 1:09.954.\nViewing areas.\nDuring the Grand Prix weekend, spectators crowd around the Monaco Circuit. There are a number of temporary grandstands built around the circuit, mostly around the harbour area. The rich and famous spectators often arrive on their boats and the yachts through the harbour. Balconies around Monaco become viewing areas for the race as well. Many hotels and residents cash in on the bird's eye views of the race.\nCriticism.\nAlthough Formula One cars have grown in size, the Circuit de Monaco has rarely expanded (with the notable exception of the addition of the Nouvelle Chicane in 1986), limiting overtaking opportunities and on-track entertainment. The circuit has only one DRS zone. Various ideas have been suggested to make the circuit longer, safer, and more conducive to overtakes. One suggestion was to extend the race track along the east side of Hercules harbor and add a second DRS zone. Lewis Hamilton accepted that the Principality was unlikely to widen the roads for the race, but suggested adding \"more variability\" by introducing more pit stops or special tyre compounds.\nThe 2024 Monaco Grand Prix was considered particularly dull. Although Formula One mandates a pit stop and using two different tyre compounds at every race, a lap-one red flag allowed drivers to change tyres and tyre compounds, essentially converting their races into a zero-stop race. The impracticality of passing allowed drivers at the front to preserve their tyres by driving very slowly; second-placed Oscar Piastri said that at one point the pace was \"slower than Formula 2.\" The top ten drivers in qualifying finished in the exact same order, and Max Verstappen joked about needing a pillow. The following season, the FIA passed a new rule requiring all drivers to make at least two pit stops at Monaco, with the explicit goal of making the race more entertaining.\nOrganization.\nThe Monaco Grand Prix is organised each year by the \"Automobile Club de Monaco\" which also runs the Monte Carlo Rally and previously ran the Junior Monaco Kart Cup.\nThe Monaco Grand Prix differs in several ways from other Grands Prix. The practice session for the race was traditionally held on the Thursday preceding the race instead of Friday. This allows the streets to be opened to the public again on Friday. From the 2022 event onwards the first two Formula One practice sessions were held on Friday, bringing the running schedule for Formula One in line with other Grands Prix. Support races is run on Thursday. Until the late 1990s the race started at 3:30\u00a0p.m. local time\u00a0\u2013 an hour and a half later than other European Formula One races. Since then the race has fallen in line with the other Formula One races for the convenience of television viewers. Historically, the event was traditionally held on the week of Ascension Day, since 2003 the race has been held in May. From 2026, the race will be held in the first weekend of June.\nFor many years, the numbers of cars admitted to Grands Prix was at the discretion of the race organisers\u00a0\u2013 Monaco had the smallest grids, ostensibly because of its narrow and twisting track. Only 18 cars were permitted to start the 1975 Monaco Grand Prix, compared to 23 to 26 cars at all other rounds that year. \nThe erecting of the circuit takes six weeks, and the removal after the race takes three weeks. Until 2017, there was no proper podium at the race. Instead, a section of the track was closed after the race to act as parc ferm\u00e9, a place where the cars are held for official inspection. The first three drivers in the race left their cars there and walked directly to the royal box where the 'podium' ceremony was held, which was considered a custom for the race. The trophies were handed out before the national anthems for the winning driver and team are played, as opposed to other Grands Prix where the anthems are played first.\nFame.\nThe Monaco Grand Prix is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world alongside the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. These three races are considered to form a \"Triple Crown\" of the three most famous motor races in the world. As of 2025, Graham Hill is the only driver to have won the Triple Crown, by winning all three races. The practice session for Monaco overlaps with that for the Indianapolis 500, and the races themselves sometimes clash. As the two races take place on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean and form part of different championships, it is difficult for one driver to compete effectively in both during his career. Juan Pablo Montoya and Fernando Alonso are the only active drivers to have won two of the three events.\nIn awarding its first gold medal for motorsport to Prince Rainier III, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) characterised the Monaco Grand Prix as contributing \"an exceptional location of glamour and prestige\" to motorsport. The Grand Prix has been run under the patronage of three generations of Monaco's royal family: Louis II, Rainier III and Albert II, all of whom have taken a close interest in the race. A large part of the principality's income comes from tourists attracted by the warm climate and the famous casino, but it is also a tax haven and is home to many millionaires, including several Formula One drivers.\nMonaco has produced four native Formula One drivers\u2014Louis Chiron, Andr\u00e9 Testut, Olivier Beretta, and Charles Leclerc\u2014but its tax status has made it home to many drivers over the years, including Gilles Villeneuve and Ayrton Senna. Of the Formula One contenders, several have property in the principality, including Jenson Button and David Coulthard, who was part owner of a hotel there. Because of the small size of the principality and the location of the circuit, drivers whose races end early can usually get back to their apartments in minutes. Ayrton Senna famously retired to his apartment after crashing out of the lead of the 1988 race. In the 2006 race, after retiring due to a mechanical failure while in second place, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen retired to his yacht, which was parked in the harbour.\nThe Grand Prix attracts big-name celebrities each year who come to experience the glamour and prestige of the event. Big parties are held in the nightclubs on the Grand Prix weekend, and the Port Hercule fills up with party-goers joining in the celebrations.\nCriticism.\nIn the 21st century, several commentators and F1 drivers have called the Grand Prix the most boring race of all circuits, both to drive and to watch as a spectator. Criticism has been directed towards how few overtake attempts are performed, as well as how frequently the driver who sets the pole position wins. Fernando Alonso has said that the race is \"the most boring race ever,\" and Lewis Hamilton stated that the 2022 Grand Prix \"wasn't really racing.\"\nWinners.\nRepeat winners (drivers).\n\"Drivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\nRepeat winners (constructors).\n\"Teams in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\n\"A yellow background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war European Championship.\"\nRepeat winners (engine manufacturers).\n\"Manufacturers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.\"\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\n\"A yellow background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war European Championship.\"\nBy year.\n\"A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.\"\n\"A yellow background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war European Championship.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Initially, this proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand. The proof has gained wide acceptance since then, although some doubts remain.\nThe theorem is a stronger version of the five color theorem, which can be shown using a significantly simpler argument. Although the weaker five color theorem was proven already in the 1800s, the four color theorem resisted until 1976 when it was proven by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in a computer-aided proof. This came after many false proofs and mistaken counterexamples in the preceding decades.\nThe Appel\u2013Haken proof proceeds by analyzing a very large number of reducible configurations. This was improved upon in 1997 by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas, who have managed to decrease the number of such configurations to 633 \u2013 still an extremely long case analysis. In 2005, the theorem was verified by Georges Gonthier using a general-purpose theorem-proving software.\nFormulation.\nThe coloring of maps can also be stated in terms of graph theory, by considering it in terms of constructing a graph coloring of the planar graph of adjacencies between regions. In graph-theoretic terms, the theorem states that for a loopless planar graph formula_1, denoting by formula_2 its chromatic number, formula_3.\nFor this to be meaningful, the intuitive statement of the four color theorem \u2013 \"given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, the regions can be colored using at most four colors so that no two adjacent regions have the same color\" \u2013 needs to be interpreted appropriately.\nFirst, regions are adjacent if they share a boundary segment; two regions that share only isolated boundary points are not considered adjacent. (Otherwise, a map in a shape of a pie chart would make an arbitrarily large number of regions 'adjacent' to each other at a common corner, and require an arbitrarily large number of colors as a result.) Second, bizarre regions, such as those with finite area but infinitely long perimeter, are not allowed; maps with such regions can require more than four colors. (To be safe, we can restrict to regions whose boundaries consist of finitely many straight line segments. It is allowed that a region has enclaves, that is it entirely surrounds one or more other regions.) Note that the notion of \"contiguous region\" (technically: connected open subset of the plane) is not the same as that of \"country\" on regular maps, since a country need not be contiguous: it may have exclaves, like Angola with its Cabinda Province, Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Russia with its Kaliningrad Oblast, France with its overseas territories, and the United States with the state of Alaska. If we require the entire territory of a country to receive the same color, then four colors are not always sufficient. For instance, consider the simplified map:\nIn this map, the two regions labeled \"A\" belong to the same country. If we want those regions to receive the same color, then five colors are required, since the two \"A\" regions together are adjacent to four other regions, each of which is adjacent to every other.\nA simpler statement of the theorem uses graph theory. The set of regions of a map can be represented more abstractly as an undirected graph that has a vertex for each region and an edge for every pair of regions that share a boundary segment. This graph is planar: it can be drawn in the plane without crossings by placing each vertex at an arbitrarily chosen location within the region to which it corresponds, and by drawing the edges as curves without crossings that lead from one region's vertex, across a shared boundary segment, to an adjacent region's vertex. Conversely, any planar graph can be formed from a map in this way. In graph-theoretic terminology, the four-color theorem states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with at most four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, or for short: every planar graph is four-colorable.\nHistory.\nEarly proof attempts.\nAs far as is known, the conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852, when Francis Guthrie, while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. At the time, Guthrie's brother, Frederick, was a student of Augustus De Morgan (the former advisor of Francis) at University College London. Francis inquired with Frederick regarding it, who then took it to De Morgan. (Francis Guthrie graduated later in 1852, and later became a professor of mathematics in South Africa.) According to De Morgan:\nA student of mine [Guthrie] asked me to day to give him a reason for a fact which I did not know was a fact\u2014and do not yet. He says that if a figure be any how divided and the compartments differently colored so that figures with any portion of common boundary \"line\" are differently colored\u2014four colors may be wanted but not more\u2014the following is his case in which four colors \"are\" wanted. Query cannot a necessity for five or more be invented...\n\"F.G.\", perhaps one of the two Guthries, published the question in \"The Athenaeum\" in 1854, and De Morgan posed the question again in the same magazine in 1860. Another early published reference by Arthur Cayley\u00a0(1879) in turn credits the conjecture to De Morgan.\nThere were several early failed attempts at proving the theorem. De Morgan believed that it followed from a simple fact about four regions, though he didn't believe that fact could be derived from more elementary facts.\nThis arises in the following way. We never need four colours in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, each of which has boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the colour used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.\nOne proposed proof was given by Alfred Kempe in 1879, which was widely acclaimed; another was given by Peter Guthrie Tait in 1880. It was not until 1890 that Kempe's proof was shown incorrect by Percy Heawood, and in 1891, Tait's proof was shown incorrect by Julius Petersen\u2014each false proof stood unchallenged for 11 years.\nIn 1890, in addition to exposing the flaw in Kempe's proof, Heawood proved the five color theorem and generalized the four color conjecture to surfaces of arbitrary genus.\nTait, in 1880, showed that the four color theorem is equivalent to the statement that a certain type of graph (called a snark in modern terminology) must be non-planar.\nIn 1943, Hugo Hadwiger formulated the Hadwiger conjecture, a far-reaching generalization of the four-color problem that still remains unsolved.\nProof by computer.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the German mathematician Heinrich Heesch developed methods of using computers to search for a proof. Notably, he was the first to use discharging for proving the theorem, which turned out to be important in the unavoidability portion of the subsequent Appel\u2013Haken proof. He also expanded on the concept of reducibility and, along with Ken Durre, developed a computer test for it. Unfortunately, at this critical juncture, he was unable to procure the necessary supercomputer time to continue his work.\nOthers took up his methods, including his computer-assisted approach. While other teams of mathematicians were racing to complete proofs, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken at the University of Illinois announced, on June 21, 1976, that they had proved the theorem. They were assisted in some algorithmic work by John A. Koch.\nIf the four-color conjecture were false, there would be at least one map with the smallest possible number of regions that requires five colors. The proof showed that such a minimal counterexample cannot exist, through the use of two technical concepts:\nUsing mathematical rules and procedures based on properties of reducible configurations, Appel and Haken found an unavoidable set of reducible configurations, thus proving that a minimal counterexample to the four-color conjecture could not exist. Their proof reduced the infinitude of possible maps to 1,834 reducible configurations (later reduced to 1,482) which had to be checked one by one by computer and took over a thousand hours. This reducibility part of the work was independently double checked with different programs and computers. However, the unavoidability part of the proof was verified in over 400 pages of microfiche, which had to be checked by hand with the assistance of Haken's daughter Dorothea Blostein.\nAppel and Haken's announcement was widely reported by the news media around the world, and the math department at the University of Illinois used a postmark stating \"Four colors suffice.\" At the same time, the unusual nature of the proof\u2014it was the first major theorem to be proved with extensive computer assistance\u2014and the complexity of the human-verifiable portion aroused considerable controversy.\nIn the early 1980s, rumors spread of a flaw in the Appel\u2013Haken proof. Ulrich Schmidt at RWTH Aachen had examined Appel and Haken's proof for his master's thesis that was published in 1981. He had checked about 40% of the unavoidability portion and found a significant error in the discharging procedure . In 1986, Appel and Haken were asked by the editor of \"Mathematical Intelligencer\" to write an article addressing the rumors of flaws in their proof. They replied that the rumors were due to a \"misinterpretation of [Schmidt's] results\" and obliged with a detailed article. Their magnum opus, \"Every Planar Map is Four-Colorable\", a book claiming a complete and detailed proof (with a microfiche supplement of over 400 pages), appeared in 1989; it explained and corrected the error discovered by Schmidt as well as several further errors found by others.\nSimplification and verification.\nSince the proving of the theorem, a new approach has led to both a shorter proof and a more efficient algorithm for 4-coloring maps. In 1996, Neil Robertson, Daniel P. Sanders, Paul Seymour, and Robin Thomas created a quadratic-time algorithm (requiring only O(\"n\"2) time, where \"n\" is the number of vertices), improving on a quartic-time algorithm based on Appel and Haken's proof. The new proof, based on the same ideas, is similar to Appel and Haken's but more efficient because it reduces the complexity of the problem and requires checking only 633 reducible configurations. Both the unavoidability and reducibility parts of this new proof must be executed by a computer and are impractical to check by hand. In 2001, the same authors announced an alternative proof, by proving the snark conjecture. This proof remains unpublished, however.\nIn 2005, Benjamin Werner and Georges Gonthier formalized a proof of the theorem inside the Coq proof assistant. This removed the need to trust the various computer programs used to verify particular cases; it is only necessary to trust the Coq kernel.\nSummary of proof ideas.\nThe following discussion is a summary based on the introduction to \"Every Planar Map is Four Colorable\" . Although flawed, Kempe's original purported proof of the four color theorem provided some of the basic tools later used to prove it. The explanation here is reworded in terms of the modern graph theory formulation above.\nKempe's argument goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not \"triangulated\" (i.e., do not have exactly three edges in their boundaries), we can add edges without introducing new vertices in order to make every region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this triangulated graph is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs to prove it for all planar graphs, and without loss of generality we assume the graph is triangulated.\nSuppose \"v\", \"e\", and \"f\" are the number of vertices, edges, and regions (faces). Since each region is triangular and each edge is shared by two regions, we have that 2\"e\" = 3\"f\". This together with Euler's formula, \"v\" \u2212 \"e\" + \"f\" = 2, can be used to show that 6\"v\" \u2212 2\"e\" = 12. Now, the \"degree\" of a vertex is the number of edges abutting it. If \"v\"\"n\" is the number of vertices of degree \"n\" and \"D\" is the maximum degree of any vertex,\n formula_4\nBut since 12 &gt; 0 and 6 \u2212 \"i\" \u2264 0 for all \"i\" \u2265 6, this demonstrates that there is at least one vertex of degree 5 or less.\nIf there is a graph requiring 5 colors, then there is a \"minimal\" such graph, where removing any vertex makes it four-colorable. Call this graph \"G\". Then \"G\" cannot have a vertex of degree 3 or less, because if \"d\"(\"v\") \u2264 3, we can remove \"v\" from \"G\", four-color the smaller graph, then add back \"v\" and extend the four-coloring to it by choosing a color different from its neighbors.\nKempe also showed correctly that \"G\" can have no vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex \"v\" and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of \"v\" are different colors, say red, green, blue, and yellow in clockwise order, we look for an alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, and there may be a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Suppose it is the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and \"v\" can now be added back and colored red.\nThis leaves only the case where \"G\" has a vertex of degree 5; but Kempe's argument was flawed for this case. Heawood noticed Kempe's mistake and also observed that if one was satisfied with proving only five colors are needed, one could run through the above argument (changing only that the minimal counterexample requires 6 colors) and use Kempe chains in the degree 5 situation to prove the five color theorem.\nIn any case, to deal with this degree 5 vertex case requires a more complicated notion than removing a vertex. Rather the form of the argument is generalized to considering \"configurations\", which are connected subgraphs of \"G\" with the degree of each vertex (in G) specified. For example, the case described in degree 4 vertex situation is the configuration consisting of a single vertex labelled as having degree 4 in \"G\". As above, it suffices to demonstrate that if the configuration is removed and the remaining graph four-colored, then the coloring can be modified in such a way that when the configuration is re-added, the four-coloring can be extended to it as well. A configuration for which this is possible is called a \"reducible configuration\". If at least one of a set of configurations must occur somewhere in G, that set is called \"unavoidable\". The argument above began by giving an unavoidable set of five configurations (a single vertex with degree 1, a single vertex with degree 2, ..., a single vertex with degree 5) and then proceeded to show that the first 4 are reducible; to exhibit an unavoidable set of configurations where every configuration in the set is reducible would prove the theorem.\nBecause \"G\" is triangular, the degree of each vertex in a configuration is known, and all edges internal to the configuration are known, the number of vertices in \"G\" adjacent to a given configuration is fixed, and they are joined in a cycle. These vertices form the \"ring\" of the configuration; a configuration with \"k\" vertices in its ring is a \"k\"-ring configuration, and the configuration together with its ring is called the \"ringed configuration\". As in the simple cases above, one may enumerate all distinct four-colorings of the ring; any coloring that can be extended without modification to a coloring of the configuration is called \"initially good\". For example, the single-vertex configuration above with 3 or fewer neighbors were initially good. In general, the surrounding graph must be systematically recolored to turn the ring's coloring into a good one, as was done in the case above where there were 4 neighbors; for a general configuration with a larger ring, this requires more complex techniques. Because of the large number of distinct four-colorings of the ring, this is the primary step requiring computer assistance.\nFinally, it remains to identify an unavoidable set of configurations amenable to reduction by this procedure. The primary method used to discover such a set is the method of discharging. The intuitive idea underlying discharging is to consider the planar graph as an electrical network. Initially positive and negative \"electrical charge\" is distributed amongst the vertices so that the total is positive.\nRecall the formula above:\n formula_5\nEach vertex with degree formula_6 is assigned an initial charge of formula_7. Then one \"flows\" the charge by systematically redistributing the charge from a vertex to its neighboring vertices according to a set of rules, the \"discharging procedure\". Since the total charge was initially positive (12), and charge is preserved, some vertices still have positive charge. The rules restrict the possibilities for configurations of positively charged vertices, so enumerating all such possible configurations gives an unavoidable set.\nAs long as some member of the unavoidable set is not reducible, the discharging procedure is modified to eliminate it (while introducing other configurations). Appel and Haken's final discharging procedure was extremely complex and, together with a description of the resulting unavoidable configuration set, filled a 400-page volume, but the configurations it generated could be checked mechanically to be reducible. Verifying the volume describing the unavoidable configuration set itself was done by peer review over a period of several years.\nA technical detail not discussed here but required to complete the proof is \"immersion reducibility\".\nFalse disproofs.\nThe four color theorem has been notorious for attracting a large number of false proofs and disproofs in its long history. At first, \"The New York Times\" refused, as a matter of policy, to report on the Appel\u2013Haken proof, fearing that the proof would be shown false like the ones before it. Some alleged proofs, like Kempe's and Tait's mentioned above, stood under public scrutiny for over a decade before they were refuted. But many more, authored by amateurs, were never published at all.\nGenerally, the simplest, though invalid, counterexamples attempt to create one region which touches all other regions. This forces the remaining regions to be colored with only three colors. Because the four color theorem is true, this is always possible; however, because the person drawing the map is focused on the one large region, they fail to notice that the remaining regions can in fact be colored with three colors.\nThis trick can be generalized: there are many maps where if the colors of some regions are selected beforehand, it becomes impossible to color the remaining regions without exceeding four colors. A casual verifier of the counterexample may not think to change the colors of these regions, so that the counterexample will appear as though it is valid.\nPerhaps one effect underlying this common misconception is the fact that the color restriction is not transitive: a region only has to be colored differently from regions it touches directly, not regions touching regions that it touches. If this were the restriction, planar graphs would require arbitrarily large numbers of colors.\nOther false disproofs violate the assumptions of the theorem, such as using a region that consists of multiple disconnected parts, or disallowing regions of the same color from touching at a point.\nThree-coloring.\nWhile every planar map can be colored with four colors, it is NP-complete in complexity to decide whether an arbitrary planar map can be colored with just three colors.\nA cubic map can be colored with only three colors if and only if each interior region has an even number of neighboring regions. In the US states map example, landlocked Missouri (MO) has eight neighbors (an even number): it must be differently colored from all of them, but the neighbors can alternate colors, thus this part of the map needs only three colors. However, landlocked Nevada (NV) has five neighbors (an odd number): these neighbors require three colors, and it must be differently colored from them, thus four colors are needed here.\nGeneralizations.\nInfinite graphs.\nThe four color theorem applies not only to finite planar graphs, but also to infinite graphs that can be drawn without crossings in the plane, and even more generally to infinite graphs (possibly with an uncountable number of vertices) for which every finite subgraph is planar. To prove this, one can combine a proof of the theorem for finite planar graphs with the De Bruijn\u2013Erd\u0151s theorem stating that, if every finite subgraph of an infinite graph is \"k\"-colorable, then the whole graph is also \"k\"-colorable . This can also be seen as an immediate consequence of Kurt G\u00f6del's compactness theorem for first-order logic, simply by expressing the colorability of an infinite graph with a set of logical formulae.\nHigher surfaces.\nOne can also consider the coloring problem on surfaces other than the plane. The problem on the sphere or cylinder is equivalent to that on the plane. For closed (orientable or non-orientable) surfaces with positive genus, the maximum number \"p\" of colors needed depends on the Euler characteristic \"\u03c7\" of the surface:\n formula_8\nwhere the outermost brackets denote the floor function.\nAlternatively, for an orientable surface, \"p\" can be given in terms of the genus \"g\" of the surface:\n formula_9\nThis formula, the Heawood conjecture, was proposed by P. J. Heawood in 1890 and, after contributions by several people, proved by Gerhard Ringel and J. W. T. Youngs in 1968. The only exception to the formula is the Klein bottle, which has Euler characteristic \"\u03c7\" = 0 (hence the formula gives \"p\" = 7) but requires only six colors, as shown by Philip Franklin in 1934.\nFor example, the torus has Euler characteristic \"\u03c7\" = 0 (and genus \"g\" = 1) and thus \"p\" = 7, so no more than seven colors are required to color any map on a torus. This upper bound of 7 is sharp: certain toroidal polyhedra, such as the Szilassi polyhedron, require seven colors.\nA M\u00f6bius strip requires six colors as do 1-planar graphs (graphs drawn with at most one simple crossing per edge) . If both the vertices and the faces of a planar graph are colored, in such a way that no two adjacent vertices, faces, or vertex-face pair have the same color, then again at most six colors are needed .\nThe real projective plane has Euler characteristic \"\u03c7\" = 1 and the formula gives \"p\" = 6, so no more than six colors are required.\nFor graphs whose vertices are represented as pairs of points on two distinct surfaces, with edges drawn as non-crossing curves on one of the two surfaces, the chromatic number can be at least 9 and is at most 12, but more precise bounds are not known; this is Gerhard Ringel's Earth\u2013Moon problem.\nSolid regions.\nThere is no obvious extension of the coloring result to three-dimensional solid regions. By using a set of \"n\" folded rods, one can arrange that every rod touches every other rod. The set would then require \"n\" colors, or \"n\"+1 if the empty space (which also touches every rod) is included. The number \"n\" can be taken to be any integer, as large as desired. Such examples were known to Frederick Guthrie in 1880. Even for axis-parallel cuboids (two cuboids are considered to be adjacent if they share a two-dimensional boundary surface), an unbounded number of colors may be necessary.\nRelation to other areas of mathematics.\nDror Bar-Natan gave a statement concerning Lie algebras and Vassiliev invariants which is equivalent to the four color theorem.\nUse outside of mathematics.\nDespite the motivation from coloring political maps of countries, the theorem is not of particular interest to cartographers. According to an article by the math historian Kenneth May, \"Maps utilizing only four colors are rare, and those that do usually require only three. Books on cartography and the history of mapmaking do not mention the four-color property\". The theorem also does not guarantee the usual cartographic requirement that non-contiguous regions of the same country (such as the exclave Alaska and the rest of the United States) be colored identically. Because the four-color theorem does not apply when the regions on the map are not contiguous, it also does not apply to the world map. On the world map, the ocean, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and France all border each other because the Netherlands borders France on the island of Saint Martin.\nThe theorem also fails to apply if one requires that all bodies of water be given the same color that cannot be used for a country (e.g., blue). Then the map of Europe itself is not four-colorable. France, Germany and Belgium must be assigned three different colors, since they all border one another, thus using four colors in total. France and the Netherlands can be given the same color, but Luxembourg requires a fifth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It presents a future American society where books have been outlawed and \"firemen\" burn any that are found. The novel follows in the viewpoint of Guy Montag, a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role of censoring literature and destroying knowledge, eventually quitting his job and committing himself to the preservation of literary and cultural writings.\n\"Fahrenheit 451\" was written by Bradbury during the Second Red Scare and the McCarthy era, inspired by the book burnings in Nazi Germany and by ideological repression in the Soviet Union. Bradbury said his motivations for writing the novel had changed multiple times. In a 1956 radio interview, Bradbury said that he wrote the book because of his concerns about the threat of burning books in the United States. In later years, he described the book as a commentary on how mass media reduces interest in reading literature. In a 1994 interview, Bradbury cited political correctness as an allegory for the censorship in the book, calling it \"the real enemy these days\" and labeling it as \"thought control and freedom of speech control\".\nThe writing and theme within \"Fahrenheit 451\" was explored by Bradbury in some of his previous short stories. Between 1947 and 1948, Bradbury wrote \"Bright Phoenix\", a short story about a librarian who confronts a \"Chief Censor\", who burns books. An encounter Bradbury had in 1949 with the police inspired him to write the short story \"The Pedestrian\" in 1951. In \"The Pedestrian\", a man going for a nighttime walk in his neighborhood is harassed and detained by the police. In the society of \"The Pedestrian\", citizens are expected to watch television as a leisurely activity, a detail that would be included in \"Fahrenheit 451\". Elements of both \"Bright Phoenix\" and \"The Pedestrian\" would be combined into \"The Fireman\", a novella published in \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" in 1951. Bradbury was urged by Stanley Kauffmann, an editor at Ballantine Books, to make \"The Fireman\" into a full novel. Bradbury finished the manuscript for \"Fahrenheit 451\" in 1953, and the novel was published later that year.\nUpon its release, \"Fahrenheit 451\" was a critical success, albeit with notable dissenters; the novel's subject matter led to its censorship in apartheid South Africa and various schools in the United States. In 1954, \"Fahrenheit 451\" won the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature and the Commonwealth Club of California Gold Medal. It later won the Prometheus \"Hall of Fame\" Award in 1984 and a \"Retro\" Hugo Award in 2004. Bradbury was honored with a Spoken Word Grammy nomination for his 1976 audiobook version. The novel has been adapted into films, stage plays, and video games. Film adaptations of the novel include a 1966 film directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut starring Oskar Werner as Guy Montag and a 2018 television film directed by Ramin Bahrani starring Michael B. Jordan as Montag, both of which received a mixed critical reception. Bradbury himself published a stage play version in 1979 and helped develop a 1984 interactive fiction video game of the same name, as well as a collection of his short stories titled \"A Pleasure to Burn\". Two BBC Radio dramatizations were also produced.\nHistorical and biographical context.\nThe House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), formed in 1938 to investigate American citizens and organizations suspected of having communist ties, held hearings in 1947 to investigate alleged communist influence in Hollywood movie-making. The government's interference in the affairs of artists and creative types infuriated Bradbury; he was concerned about the workings of his government, and a late 1949 nighttime encounter with an overzealous police officer would inspire Bradbury to write \"The Pedestrian\", a short story which would go on to become \"The Fireman\" and then \"Fahrenheit 451\". The rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy's McCarthyism persecution of accused communists, beginning in 1950, deepened Bradbury's contempt for government overreach.\nThe Golden Age of Radio occurred between the early 1920s to the late 1950s, during Bradbury's early life, while the transition to the Golden Age of Television began right around the time he started to work on the stories that would eventually lead to \"Fahrenheit 451\". Bradbury saw these forms of media as a threat to the reading of books, indeed as a threat to society, as he believed they could act as a distraction from important affairs. This contempt for mass media and technology would express itself through Mildred and her friends and is an important theme in the book.\nBradbury's lifelong passion for books began at an early age. After he graduated from high school, his family could not afford for him to attend college, so Bradbury began spending time at the Los Angeles Public Library where he educated himself. As a frequent visitor to his local libraries in the 1920s and 1930s, he recalls being disappointed because they did not stock popular science fiction novels, like those of H. G. Wells, because, at the time, they were not deemed literary enough. Between this and learning about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, a great impression was made on Bradbury about the vulnerability of books to censure and destruction.\nLater, as a teenager, Bradbury was horrified by the Nazi book burnings stating, \"When I was fifteen years old, Hitler burned books in the streets of Berlin. And it terrified me\". Bradbury was also influenced by Joseph Stalin's campaign of political repression, the Great Purge, in which writers and poets, among many others, were arrested and often executed, stating, \"They burned the authors instead of the books.\"\nPlot summary.\n\"The Hearth and the Salamander\".\nIn a distant future, Guy Montag is a fireman employed to burn outlawed books, along with the houses they are hidden in. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. Two EMTs pump her stomach and change her blood. After they leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag overhears Clarisse and her family talking about their illiterate society. Shortly afterward, Montag's mind is bombarded with Clarisse's subversive thoughts and the memory of Mildred's near-death. Over the next few days, Clarisse meets Montag each night as he walks home. Clarisse's simple pleasures and interests make her an outcast among her peers, and she is forced to go to therapy for her behavior. Montag looks forward to the meetings, but one day, Clarisse goes missing.\nIn the following days, while he and other firemen are ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman and drenching it in kerosene, Montag steals a book. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Jarred by the suicide, Montag returns home and hides the book under his pillow. Montag asks Mildred if she has heard anything about Clarisse. She reveals that Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of \"The Mechanical Hound\", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen in hunting book hoarders.\nMontag awakens ill the next morning. Mildred tries to care for her husband but finds herself more involved in the \"parlor wall\" entertainment in the living room \u2013 large televisions filling the walls. Montag suggests he should take a break from being a fireman, and Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall \"family\". Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing his concerns, Beatty recounts the history of how books had lost their value and how the firemen were adapted for their current role: over decades, people began to embrace new media (like film and television), sports, and an ever-quickening pace of life. Books were abridged or degraded to accommodate shorter attention spans. At the same time, advances in technology resulted in nearly all buildings being made with fireproof materials, and firemen preventing fires were no longer necessary. The government then instead turned the firemen into officers of society's peace of mind: instead of putting out fires, they were charged with starting them, specifically to burn books, which were condemned as sources of confusing and depressing thoughts that complicated people's lives. After an awkward exchange between Mildred and Montag over the book hidden under his pillow, Beatty becomes suspicious and casually adds a passing threat before leaving; he says that if a fireman had a book, he would be asked to burn it within the following twenty-four hours. If he refused, the other firemen would come and burn it for him. The encounter leaves Montag shaken.\nMontag reveals to Mildred that, over the last year, he has accumulated books that are hidden in their ceiling. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in the kitchen incinerator, but Montag subdues her and says they are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned and their lives will return to normal.\n\"The Sieve and the Sand\".\nMildred refuses to go along with Montag's plan, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the woman who burned herself, and the imminent war that goes ignored by the masses. He suggests that perhaps the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. Mildred remains unconvinced.\nConceding that Mildred is a lost cause, Montag needs help to understand the books. He remembers an old man named Faber, an English professor before books were banned, whom he once met in a park. Montag visits Faber's home carrying a copy of the Bible, the book he stole at the woman's house. Once there, after multiple attempts to ask, Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade earpiece communicator so that he can offer constant guidance.\nAt home, Mildred's friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, arrive to watch the \"parlor walls\". Not interested in this entertainment, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only for them to reveal just how indifferent, ignorant, and callous they truly are. Enraged, Montag shows them a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely. Mildred tries to dismiss Montag's actions as a tradition firemen act out once a year: they find an old book and read it as a way to make fun of how silly the past is. Montag proceeds to recite a poem, causing Mrs. Phelps to cry. The two women leave.\nMontag hides his books in the backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night. There, Montag hands Beatty a book to cover for the one he believes Beatty knows he stole the night before, which is tossed into the trash. Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm sounds and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. They drive in the fire truck to the unexpected destination: Montag's house.\n\"Burning Bright\".\nBeatty orders Montag to destroy his house with a flamethrower, rather than the more powerful \"salamander\" that is usually used by the fire team, and tells him that his wife and her friends reported him. Montag watches as Mildred walks out of the house, too traumatized about losing her parlor wall \"family\" to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the situation going on around her, and catches a taxi. Montag complies, destroying the home piece by piece, but Beatty discovers his earpiece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and, after Beatty taunts him, Montag burns Beatty alive. As Montag tries to escape the scene, the Mechanical Hound attacks him, managing to inject his leg with an anesthetic. He destroys the Hound with the flamethrower and limps away. While escaping, Montag concludes that Beatty wanted to die a long time ago, having goaded him and provided him with a weapon.\nMontag runs towards Faber's house. En route, he crosses a road as a car attempts to run him over, but he manages to evade the vehicle, almost suffering the same fate as Clarisse and losing his knee. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact a group of exiled book-lovers who live there. Faber plans to leave on a bus heading to St. Louis, Missouri, where he and Montag can rendezvous later. Meanwhile, another Mechanical Hound is released to track down and kill Montag, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. After wiping his scent from around the house in hopes of thwarting the Hound, Montag leaves. He escapes the manhunt by wading into a river and floating downstream, where he meets the book-lovers. They predicted Montag's arrival while watching the TV.\nThe drifters are all former intellectuals. They have each memorized books should the day arrive that society comes to an end, with the survivors learning to embrace the literature of the past. Wanting to contribute to the group, Montag finds that he partially memorized the Book of Ecclesiastes, discovering that the group has a special way of unlocking photographic memory. While discussing their learnings, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and annihilate the city with nuclear weapons: the war has begun and ended in the same night. While Faber would have left on the early bus, everyone else (possibly including Mildred) is killed. Injured and dirtied, Montag and the group manage to survive the shockwave.\nWhen the war is over, the exiles return to the city to rebuild society.\nTitle.\nThe title page of the book explains the title as follows: \"Fahrenheit 451\u2014The temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns...\". On inquiring about the temperature at which paper would catch fire, Bradbury had been told that was the autoignition temperature of paper. In various studies, scientists have placed the autoignition temperature at a range of temperatures between , depending on the type of paper.\nWriting and development.\n\"Fahrenheit 451\" developed out of a series of ideas Bradbury had visited in previously written stories. For many years, he tended to single out \"The Pedestrian\" in interviews and lectures as sort of a proto-\"Fahrenheit 451\". In the preface of his 2006 anthology \"Match to Flame: The Fictional Paths to Fahrenheit 451\" he states that this is an oversimplification. The full genealogy of \"Fahrenheit 451\" given in \"Match to Flame\" is involved. The following covers the most salient aspects.\nBetween 1947 and 1948, Bradbury wrote the short story \"Bright Phoenix\" (not published until the May 1963 issue of \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\") about a librarian who confronts a book-burning \"Chief Censor\" named Jonathan Barnes.\nIn late 1949, Bradbury was stopped and questioned by a police officer while walking late one night. When asked \"What are you doing?\", Bradbury wisecracked, \"Putting one foot in front of another\". This incident inspired Bradbury to write the 1951 short story \"The Pedestrian\".\nIn \"The Pedestrian\", Leonard Mead is harassed and detained by the city's only remotely operated police cruiser for taking nighttime walks, something that has become extremely rare in this future-based setting, as everybody else stays inside and watches television (\"viewing screens\"). Alone and without an alibi, Mead is taken to the \"Psychiatric Center for Research on Regressive Tendencies\" for his peculiar habit. \"Fahrenheit 451\" echoed this theme of an authoritarian society distracted by broadcast media.\nBradbury expanded the book-burning premise of \"Bright Phoenix\" and the totalitarian future of \"The Pedestrian\" into \"The Fireman\", a novella published in the February 1951 issue of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\". \"The Fireman\" was written in the basement of UCLA's Powell Library on a typewriter that he rented for a fee of ten cents per half hour. The first draft was 25,000 words long and was completed in nine days.\nUrged by a publisher at Ballantine Books to double the length of his story to make a novel, Bradbury returned to the same typing room and made the story 25,000 words longer, again taking nine days. The title \"Fahrenheit 451\" came to him on January 22. The final manuscript was ready in mid-August, 1953. The resulting novel, which some considered as a fix-up (despite being an expanded rewrite of one single novella), was published by Ballantine in 1953.\nSupplementary material.\nBradbury has supplemented the novel with various front and back matter, including a 1979 coda, a 1982 afterword, a 1993 foreword, and several introductions.\nPublication history.\nThe first U.S. printing was a paperback version from October 1953 by The Ballantine Publishing Group. Shortly after the paperback, a hardback version was released that included a special edition of 200 signed and numbered copies bound in asbestos. These were technically collections because the novel was published with two short stories, \"The Playground\" and \"And the Rock Cried Out\", which have been omitted from later printings. A few months later, the novel was serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of nascent \"Playboy\" magazine.\nExpurgation.\nStarting in January 1967, \"Fahrenheit 451\" was subject to expurgation by its publisher, Ballantine Books, with the release of the \"Bal-Hi Edition\" aimed at high school students. Among the changes made by the publisher were the censorship of the words \"hell\", \"damn\", and \"abortion\"; the modification of seventy-five passages; and the changing of two incidents.\nIn the first incident, a drunk man is changed to a \"sick man\", while the second involves cleaning fluff out of a human navel, which instead becomes \"cleaning ears\" in the other. For a while, both the censored and uncensored versions were available concurrently, but by 1973, Ballantine was publishing only the censored version. That continued until 1979, when it came to Bradbury's attention:\nIn 1979, one of Bradbury's friends showed him an expurgated copy of the book. Bradbury demanded that Ballantine Books withdraw that version and replace it with the original, and in 1980 the original version once again became available. In this reinstated work, in the Author's Afterword, Bradbury relates to the reader that it is not uncommon for a publisher to expurgate an author's work, but he asserts that he himself will not tolerate the practice of manuscript \"mutilation\".\nThe \"Bal-Hi\" editions are now referred to by the publisher as the \"Revised Bal-Hi\" editions.\nNon-print publications.\nAn audiobook version read by Bradbury himself was released in 1976 and received a Spoken Word Grammy nomination. Another audiobook was released in 2005 narrated by Christopher Hurt. The e-book version was released in December 2011.\nReception.\nIn 1954, \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" reviewer Groff Conklin placed the novel \"among the great works of the imagination written in English in the last decade or more.\" The \"Chicago Sunday Tribune\"'s August Derleth described the book as \"a savage and shockingly prophetic view of one possible future way of life\", calling it \"compelling\" and praising Bradbury for his \"brilliant imagination\". Over half a century later, Sam Weller wrote, \"upon its publication, \"Fahrenheit 451\" was hailed as a visionary work of social commentary.\" Today, \"Fahrenheit 451\" is still viewed as an important cautionary tale about conformity and the evils of government censorship.\nWhen the novel was first published, there were those who did not find merit in the tale. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas were less enthusiastic, faulting the book for being \"simply padded, occasionally with startlingly ingenious gimmickry, ... often with coruscating cascades of verbal brilliance [but] too often merely with words.\" Reviewing the book for \"Astounding Science Fiction\", P. Schuyler Miller characterized the title piece as \"one of Bradbury's bitter, almost hysterical diatribes,\" while praising its \"emotional drive and compelling, nagging detail.\" Similarly, \"The New York Times\" was unimpressed with the novel and further accused Bradbury of developing a \"virulent hatred for many aspects of present-day culture, namely, such monstrosities as radio, TV, most movies, amateur and professional sports, automobiles, and other similar aberrations which he feels debase the bright simplicity of the thinking man's existence.\"\n\"Fahrenheit 451\" was number seven on the list of \"Top Check Outs OF ALL TIME\" by the New York Public Library.\nCensorship/banning incidents.\nIn the years since its publication, \"Fahrenheit 451\" has occasionally been banned, censored, or redacted in some schools at the behest of parents or teaching staff either unaware of or indifferent to the inherent irony in such censorship. Notable incidents include:\nThemes.\nDiscussions about \"Fahrenheit 451\" often center on its story foremost as a warning against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, he was concerned about censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said\nI wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.\nAs time went by, Bradbury tended to dismiss censorship as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually claimed that the real messages of \"Fahrenheit 451\" were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted\nIn writing the short novel \"Fahrenheit 451\", I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was \"not\" fiction.\nThis story echoes Mildred's \"Seashell ear-thimbles\" (i.e., a brand of in-ear headphones) that act as an emotional barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that \"Fahrenheit 451\" is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature. Regarding minorities, he wrote in his 1979 Coda\n'There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, Mattachine/Four Square Gospel feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse. [...] Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel \"Fahrenheit 451\", described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever. [...] Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. Judy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.\nBook-burning censorship, Bradbury would argue, was a side-effect of these two primary factors; this is consistent with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag about the history of the firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit in \"Fahrenheit 451\". Fahrenheit's censorship is not the result of an authoritarian program to retain power, but the result of a fragmented society seeking to accommodate its challenges by deploying the power of entertainment and technology. As Captain Beatty explains (p.\u00a055)\n...The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean.\"[...] \"It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God.\nA variety of other themes in the novel besides censorship have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out that the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that, rather than the government banning books, the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment for the general public.\nIn a 1994 interview, Bradbury stated that \"Fahrenheit 451\" was more relevant during this time than in any other, stating that, \"it works even better because we have political correctness now. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can't say certain things. The homosexual groups don't want you to criticize them. It's thought control and freedom of speech control.\"\nPredictions for the future.\n\"Fahrenheit 451\" is set in an unspecified city and time, though it is written as if set in a distant future. The earliest editions make clear that it takes place no earlier than the year 2022 due to a reference to an atomic war taking place during that year.\nBradbury described himself as \"a \"preventer\" of futures, not a predictor of them.\" He did not believe that book burning was an inevitable part of the future; he wanted to warn against its development. In a later interview, when asked if he believes that teaching \"Fahrenheit 451\" in schools will prevent his totalitarian vision of the future, Bradbury replied in the negative. Rather, he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level. If students are unable to read then, they will be unable to read \"Fahrenheit 451\".\nAs to technology, Sam Weller notes that Bradbury \"predicted everything from flat-panel televisions to earbud headphones and twenty-four-hour banking machines.\"\nAdaptations.\nTelevision.\n\"Playhouse 90\" broadcast \"A Sound of Different Drummers\" on CBS in 1957, written by Robert Alan Aurthur. The play combined plot ideas from \"Fahrenheit 451\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". Bradbury sued and eventually won on appeal.\nFilm.\nA film adaptation written and directed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut and starring Oskar Werner and Julie Christie was released in 1966.\nA film adaptation directed by Ramin Bahrani and starring Michael B. Jordan, Michael Shannon, Sofia Boutella, and Lilly Singh was released in 2018 for HBO.\nTheater.\nIn the late 1970s Bradbury adapted his book into a play. At least part of it was performed at the Colony Theatre in Los Angeles in 1979, but it was not in print until 1986 and the official world premiere was only in November 1988 by the Fort Wayne, Indiana Civic Theatre. The stage adaptation diverges considerably from the book and seems influenced by Truffaut's movie. For example, fire chief Beatty's character is fleshed out and is the wordiest role in the play. As in the movie, Clarisse does not simply disappear but in the finale meets up with Montag as a book character (she as Robert Louis Stevenson, he as Edgar Allan Poe).\nThe UK premiere of Bradbury's stage adaptation was not until 2003 in Nottingham, while it took until 2006 before the Godlight Theatre Company produced and performed its New York City premiere at 59E59 Theaters. After the completion of the New York run, the production then transferred to the Edinburgh Festival where it was a 2006 Edinburgh Festival \"Pick of the Fringe\".\nThe Off-Broadway theatre The American Place Theatre presented a one man show adaptation of \"Fahrenheit 451\" as a part of their 2008\u20132009 Literature to Life season.\nBradbury's Pandemonium Theatre Company staged a production at the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena from April through December 2008, which was led by resident director Alan Neal Hubbs, produced by Bradbury and Racquel Lehrman, and starred David Polcyn (alternated with David Mauer and Lee Holmes) as Montag, Mageina Tovah alternating with Tanya Mounsey as Montag's wife, Jessica D. Stone as Clarisse, and Michael Prichard as Captain Beatty. The play was extended multiple times during its run for its reported popularity with audiences.\n\"Fahrenheit 451\" inspired the Birmingham Repertory Theatre production \"Time Has Fallen Asleep in the Afternoon Sunshine\", which was performed at the Birmingham Central Library in April 2012.\nRadio.\nIn 1982, Gregory Evans' radio dramatization of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 starring Michael Pennington as Montag. It was broadcast eight more times on BBC Radio 4 Extra, twice each in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015.\nBBC Radio's second dramatization, by David Calcutt, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2003, starring Stephen Tomlin in the same role.\nMusic.\nIn 1984 the new wave band \"Scortilla\" released the song Fahrenheit 451 inspired by the book by R. Bradbury and the film by F. Truffaut.\nIn 2025, one composition on the instrumental concept album \"The Ray Bradbury Chronicles\" was based on the book, with three sections (City, Escape, Exile) inspired by the key stages of the novel's plotline.\nComputer games.\nIn 1984, the novel was adapted into a computer text adventure game of the same name by the software company Trillium, serving as a sequel to the events of the novel, and co-written by Len Neufeld and Bradbury himself.\nComics.\nIn June 2009, a graphic novel edition of the book was published. Entitled \"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451: The Authorized Adaptation\", the paperback graphic adaptation was illustrated by Tim Hamilton. The introduction in the novel is written by Bradbury himself.\nCultural references.\nMichael Moore's 2004 documentary \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" refers to Bradbury's novel and the September 11 attacks, emphasized by the film's tagline \"The temperature where freedom burns\". The film takes a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush, the war on terror, and its coverage in the news media, and became the highest grossing documentary of all time. Bradbury was upset by what he considered the appropriation of his title, and wanted the film renamed. He really didn't want to be associated in any way. Moore filmed a subsequent documentary about the 2016 election of Donald Trump called \"Fahrenheit 11/9\" in 2018, but compared to the earlier documentary, there was a complete shift in interest by the general audience.\nIn 2015, the Internet Engineering Steering Group approved the publication of \"An HTTP Status Code to Report Legal Obstacles\", now \"RFC 7725\", which specifies that websites forced to block resources for legal reasons should return a status code of 451 when users request those resources.\nGuy Montag (as Gui Montag) is used in the 1998 real-time strategy game \"StarCraft\" as a terran firebat hero.\nThe numbers \"451\", and sometimes \"0451\", are often included as the first security code a player encounters in immersive sim video games as a reference to the \"System Shock\" series of games which first included the code as their own reference to Bradbury's novel.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He co-founded the Society of Jesus and, as a representative of the Portuguese Empire, led the first Christian mission to Japan.\nBorn in the town of Xavier, Kingdom of Navarre (in today's Spain), he was a companion of Ignatius of Loyola and one of the first seven Jesuits who took vows of poverty and chastity at Montmartre, Paris in 1534. He led extensive missionary work across Asia, primarily within the Portuguese Empire in the East, and played a significant role in the evangelization of early modern India, particularly through his activities in Portuguese India. In 1546, Francis Xavier wrote to King John III of Portugal proposing measures to strengthen the Christian faith in Goa. Some historians interpret this letter as a request for the establishment of the Goan Inquisition, while others contend that he instead called for the appointment of a special minister dedicated solely to promoting Christianity in Goa.\nAs a representative of the King of Portugal, he was the first major Christian missionary to venture into Borneo, the Maluku Islands, Japan, and other areas. In those areas, struggling to learn the local languages and in the face of opposition, he had less success than he had enjoyed in India. Xavier also extended his mission to Ming China, where he died on Shangchuan Island.\nHe was beatified by Pope Paul V on 25 October 1619 and canonized by Pope Gregory XV on 12 March 1622. In 1624, he was made co-patron of Navarre. Known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\", \"Apostle of the Far East\", \"Apostle of China\" and \"Apostle of Japan\", he is considered to be one of the greatest missionaries since Paul the Apostle. In 1927, Pope Pius XI published the decree \"Apostolicorum in Missionibus\" naming Francis Xavier, along with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, co-patron of all foreign missions. He is now co-patron saint of Navarre, along with Saint Fermin. The \"Day of Navarre\" marks the anniversary of Francis Xavier's death, on 3 December.\nEarly life.\nFrancis Xavier was born in the Castle of Xavier, in the Kingdom of Navarre, on 7 April 1506 into an influential noble family. He was the youngest son of Don Juan de Jasso y Atondo, Lord of Idoc\u00edn, president of the Royal Council of the Kingdom of Navarre, and seneschal of the Castle of Xavier, a doctor in law by the University of Bologna, belonging to a prosperous noble family of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, later privy counsellor and finance minister to King John III of Navarre.\nHis mother was Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de Azpilcueta y Azn\u00e1rez, sole heiress to the Castle of Xavier, related to the theologian and philosopher Mart\u00edn de Azpilcueta. His brother Miguel de Jasso, later known as Miguel de Javier, became Lord of Xavier and Idoc\u00edn at the death of his parents, a direct ancestor of the Counts of Javier. Basque and Romance were his two mother tongues.\nIn 1512, Ferdinand, King of Aragon and regent of Castile, invaded Navarre, initiating a war that lasted over 18 years. In 1515, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers participated in a failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the kingdom. The Spanish Governor, Cardinal Cisneros, confiscated the family lands, demolished the outer wall, the gates, and two towers of the family castle, and filled in the moat. The height of the keep was reduced by half. Only the family residence inside the castle was left. In 1522, one of Francis's brothers participated with 200 Navarrese nobles in dogged but failed resistance against the Castilian Count of Miranda in Amaiur, Baztan, the last Navarrese territorial position south of the Pyrenees.\nIn 1525, Francis went to study in Paris at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe, University of Paris, where he spent the next eleven years. In the early days he acquired some reputation as an athlete and a high-jumper.\nIn 1529, Francis shared lodgings with his friend Pierre Favre. A new student, Ignatius of Loyola, came to room with them. At 38, Ignatius was much older than Pierre and Francis, who were both 23 at the time. Ignatius convinced Pierre to become a priest, but was unable to convince Francis, who had aspirations of worldly advancement. At first, Francis regarded the new lodger as a joke and was sarcastic about his efforts to convert students.\nWhen Pierre left their lodgings to visit his family and Ignatius was alone with Francis, he was able to slowly break down Francis's resistance. According to most biographies Ignatius is said to have posed the question: \"What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" However, according to James Broderick such method is not characteristic of Ignatius and there is no evidence that he employed it at all.\nIn 1530, Francis received the degree of Master of Arts, and afterwards taught Aristotelian philosophy at the Coll\u00e8ge de Beauvais, University of Paris.\nMissionary work.\nOn 15 August 1534, seven students met in a crypt beneath the Church of Saint Denis (now Saint Pierre de Montmartre), on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris. They were Francis, Ignatius of Loyola, Alfonso Salmeron, Diego La\u00ednez, Nicol\u00e1s Bobadilla from Spain, Peter Faber from Savoy, and Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues from Portugal. They made private vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the Pope, and also vowed to go to the Holy Land to convert infidels. Francis began his study of theology in 1534 and was ordained on 24 June 1537.\nIn 1539, after long discussions, Ignatius drew up a formula for a new religious order, the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). Ignatius's plan for the order was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540.\nIn 1540, King John III of Portugal had Pedro Mascarenhas, Portuguese ambassador to the Holy See, request Jesuit missionaries to spread the faith in his new possessions in India, where the king believed that Christian values were eroding among the Portuguese. After successive appeals to the Pope asking for missionaries for the East Indies under the Padroado agreement, John III was encouraged by Diogo de Gouveia, rector of the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe, to recruit the newly graduated students who had established the Society of Jesus.\nIgnatius promptly appointed Nicholas Bobadilla and Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues. At the last moment, however, Bobadilla became seriously ill. With some hesitance and uneasiness, Ignatius asked Francis to go in Bobadilla's place. Thus, Francis Xavier began his life as the first Jesuit missionary almost accidentally.\nLeaving Rome on 15 March 1540, in the Ambassador's train, Francis took with him a breviary, a catechism, and (Instructions for a Virtuous Life According to the Examples of the Saints) by Croatian humanist Marko Maruli\u0107, a Latin book that had become popular in the Counter-Reformation. According to a 1549 letter of F. Balthasar Gago from Goa, it was the only book that Francis read or studied. Francis reached Lisbon in June 1540 and, four days after his arrival, he and Rodrigues were summoned to a private audience with King John and Queen Catherine.\nFrancis Xavier devoted much of his life to missions in Asia, mainly in four centres: Malacca, Amboina and Ternate (in the Maluku Islands of Indonesia), Japan, and off-shore China. His growing information about new places indicated to him that he had to go to what he understood were centres of influence for the whole region. China loomed large from his days in India. Japan was particularly attractive because of its culture. For him, these areas were interconnected; they could not be evangelised separately.\nGoa and India.\nFrancis Xavier left Lisbon on 7 April 1541, his thirty-fifth birthday, along with two other Jesuits and the new viceroy Martim Afonso de Sousa, on board the \"Santiago\". As he departed, Francis was given a brief from the pope appointing him apostolic nuncio to the East. From August until March 1542 he remained in Portuguese Mozambique, and arrived in Goa, then the capital of Portuguese India, on 6 May 1542, thirteen months after leaving Lisbon.\nThe Portuguese, following quickly on the great voyages of discovery, had established themselves at Goa thirty years earlier. Francis's primary mission, as ordered by King John III, was to restore Christianity among the Portuguese settlers. According to Teotonio R. DeSouza, recent critical accounts indicate that apart from the posted civil servants, \"the great majority of those who were dispatched as 'discoverers' were the riff-raff of Portuguese society, picked up from Portuguese jails.\" Nor did the soldiers, sailors, or merchants come to do missionary work, and Imperial policy permitted the outflow of disaffected nobility. Many of the arrivals formed liaisons with local women and adopted Indian culture. Missionaries often wrote against the \"scandalous and undisciplined\" behaviour of their fellow Christians.\nThe Christian population had churches, clergy, and a bishop, but there were few preachers and no priests beyond the walls of Goa. Xavier decided that he must begin by instructing the Portuguese themselves, and gave much of his time to the teaching of children. The first five months he spent in preaching and ministering to the sick in the hospitals. After that, he walked through the streets ringing a bell to summon the children and servants to catechism. He was invited to head Saint Paul's College, a pioneer seminary for the education of secular priests, which became the first Jesuit headquarters in Asia.\nConversion efforts\nXavier soon learned that along the Pearl Fishery Coast, which extends from Cape Comorin on the southern tip of India to the island of Mannar, off Ceylon (Sri Lanka), there was a J\u0101ti of people called Paravas. Many of them had been baptised ten years before, merely to please the Portuguese who had helped them against the Moors, but remained uninstructed in the faith. Accompanied by several native clerics from the seminary at Goa, he set sail for Cape Comorin in October 1542.\nHe taught those who had already been baptised and preached to those who weren't. His efforts with the high-caste Brahmins remained unavailing. The Brahmin and Muslim authorities in Travancore opposed Xavier with violence; time and again his hut was burned down over his head, and once he saved his life only by hiding among the branches of a large tree.\nHe devoted almost three years to the work of preaching to the people of southern India and Ceylon, converting many. He built nearly 40 churches along the coast, including St. Stephen's Church, Kombuthurai, mentioned in his letters dated 1544.\nDuring this time, he visited the tomb of Thomas the Apostle in Mylapore, now part of Madras/Chennai then in Portuguese India. He set his sights eastward in 1545 and planned a missionary journey to Makassar on the island of Celebes, today's Indonesia.\nAs the first Jesuit in India, Francis had difficulty achieving much success in his missionary trips. His successors, such as Roberto de Nobili, Matteo Ricci, and Constanzo Beschi, attempted to convert the noblemen first as a means to influence more people, while Francis had initially interacted most with the lower classes. Later in Japan, Francis changed tack by paying tribute to the Emperor and seeking an audience with him.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn the spring of 1545, Xavier started for Portuguese Malacca. He laboured there for the last months of that year. About January 1546, Xavier left Malacca for the Maluku Islands, where the Portuguese had some settlements. For a year and a half, he preached the Gospel there. He went first to Ambon Island, where he stayed until mid-June. He then visited the other Maluku Islands, including Ternate, Baranura, and Morotai.\nShortly after Easter 1547, he returned to Ambon Island. A few months later he returned to Malacca. While there, Malacca was attacked by the Acehnese from Sumatra. Through preaching, Xavier inspired the Portuguese to seek battle, achieving a victory at the Battle of Perlis River, despite being heavily outnumbered.\nJapan.\nIn Malacca in December 1547, Francis Xavier met a Japanese man named Anjir\u014d. Anjir\u014d had heard of Francis in 1545 and had travelled from Kagoshima to Malacca to meet him. Having been charged with murder, Anjir\u014d had fled Japan. He told Francis extensively about his former life, and the customs and culture of his homeland. Anjir\u014d became the first Japanese Christian and adopted the name 'Paulo de Santa Fe'. He later helped Xavier as a mediator and interpreter for the mission to Japan that now seemed much more possible.\nIn January 1548 Francis returned to Goa to attend to his responsibilities as superior of the mission there. The next 15 months were occupied with various journeys and administrative measures. He left Goa on 15 April 1549, stopped at Malacca, and visited Canton. He was accompanied by Anjir\u014d, two other Japanese men, Father Cosme de Torres and Brother Juan Fern\u00e1ndez. He had taken with him presents for the \"King of Japan\" since he intended to introduce himself as the Apostolic Nuncio.\nEuropeans had already visited Japan. The Portuguese first landed in 1543 on the island of Tanegashima, where they introduced matchlock firearms to Japan.\nFrom Amboina, he wrote to his companions in Europe: \"I asked a Portuguese merchant, ... who had been for many days in Anjir\u014d's country of Japan, to give me ... some information on that land and its people from what he had seen and heard. ...All the Portuguese merchants coming from Japan tell me that if I go there I shall do great service for God our Lord, more than with the pagans of India, for they are a very reasonable people.\" (To His Companions Residing in Rome, From Cochin, 20 January 1548, no. 18, p.\u00a0178).\nFrancis Xavier reached Japan on 27 July 1549, with Anjir\u014d and three other Jesuits, but he was not permitted to enter any port his ship arrived at until 15 August, when he went ashore at Kagoshima, the principal port of Satsuma Province on the island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner. Shimazu Takahisa (1514\u20131571), \"daimy\u014d\" of Satsuma, gave a friendly reception to Francis on 29 September 1549, but in the following year he forbade the conversion of his subjects to Christianity under penalty of death; Christians in Kagoshima could not be given any catechism in the following years. The Portuguese missionary Pedro de Alc\u00e1\u00e7ova would later write in 1554:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In Cangoxima, the first place Father Master Francisco stopped at, there were a good number of Christians, although there was no one there to teach them; the shortage of labourers prevented the whole kingdom from becoming Christian.\nFrancis was the first Jesuit to go to Japan as a missionary. He brought with him paintings of the Madonna and the Madonna and Child. These paintings were used to help teach the Japanese about Christianity. There was a huge language barrier as Japanese was unlike other languages the missionaries had previously encountered. For a long time, Francis struggled to learn the language. He was hosted by Anjir\u014d's family until October 1550. From October to December 1550, he resided in Yamaguchi. Shortly before Christmas, he left for Kyoto but failed to meet with Emperor Go-Nara. He returned to Yamaguchi in March 1551, where the daimy\u014d of the province gave him permission to preach.\nHaving learned that evangelical poverty did not have the appeal in Japan that it had in Europe and in India, he decided to change his approach. Hearing after a time that a Portuguese ship had arrived at a port in the province of Bungo in Kyushu and that the prince there would like to see him, Xavier now set out southward. The Jesuit, in a fine cassock, surplice, and stole, was attended by thirty gentlemen and as many servants, all in their best clothes.\nFive of them bore on cushions valuable articles, including a portrait of Our Lady and a pair of velvet slippers, not for the prince, but solemn offerings to Xavier, to impress the onlookers with his eminence. Handsomely dressed, with his companions acting as attendants, he presented himself before Oshindono, the ruler of Nagate, and as a representative of the great Kingdom of Portugal, offered him letters and presents: a musical instrument, a watch, and other attractive objects which had been given him by the authorities in India for the emperor.\nFor forty-five years the Jesuits were the only missionaries in Asia, but the Franciscans began proselytizing in Asia, as well. Christian missionaries were later forced into exile, along with their assistants. However, some were able to stay behind. Christianity was then kept underground so as to not be persecuted.\nThe Japanese people were not easily converted. Many of the people were already Buddhist or Shinto. Francis tried to combat the reservations of some of the Japanese. Many mistakenly interpreted Catholic doctrine as teaching that demons had been created evil, and they thus concluded the God who had created them could not be good. Much of Francis' preaching was devoted to providing answers to this and other such challenges. In the course of these discussions, Francis grew to respect the rationality and general literacy of those Japanese people whom he encountered. He expressed optimism at the prospect of converting the country.\nXavier was welcomed by the Shingon monks since he used the word \"Dainichi\" for the Christian God; attempting to adapt the concept to local traditions. As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he changed to \"Deusu\" from the Latin and Portuguese \"Deus\". The monks later realised that Xavier was preaching a rival religion and grew more resistant towards his attempts at conversion.\nWith the passage of time, his sojourn in Japan could be considered somewhat fruitful as attested by congregations established in Hirado, Yamaguchi, and Bungo. Xavier worked for more than two years in Japan and saw his successor-Jesuits established. He then decided to return to India. Historians debate the exact path by which he returned, but from evidence attributed to the captain of his ship, he may have travelled through Tanegeshima and Minato, and avoided Kagoshima because of the hostility of the daimyo.\nChina.\nDuring his trip from Japan back to India, a tempest forced him to stop on an island near Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, where he met Diogo Pereira, a rich merchant and an old friend from Cochin. Pereira showed him a letter from Portuguese prisoners in Guangzhou, asking for a Portuguese ambassador to speak to the Jiajing Emperor on their behalf. He arrived back in Goa by early 1552 and planned to travel on to China.\nOn 17 April he set sail with Diogo Pereira on the \"Santa Cruz\" for China, planning to introduce himself as Apostolic Nuncio, and Pereira as the ambassador of the king of Portugal - but then realized that he had forgotten his testimonial letters as an Apostolic Nuncio. Back in Malacca, he was confronted by the captain \u00c1lvaro de Ata\u00edde da Gama who refused to recognize his title of Nuncio, asked Pereira to resign from his title of ambassador, named a new crew for the ship, and demanded the gifts for the Chinese Emperor be left in Malacca.\nIn late August 1552, the \"Santa Cruz\" reached the Chinese island of Shangchuan, 14\u00a0km away from the southern coast of mainland China, near Taishan, Guangdong. He was accompanied only by a Jesuit student called \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, a Chinese man called Ant\u00f3nio, and a Malabar servant called Christopher. Around mid-November, he sent a letter saying that a man had agreed to take him to the mainland in exchange for a large sum of money, and that he was waiting for the man. He had sent back \u00c1lvaro Ferreira and was staying in a small hut when he fell ill. He died, with only Ant\u00f3nio as company, early in December 1552. His feast is celebrated on December 3, but it is not clear that this is the day he actually died.\nBurials and relics.\nXavier was first buried on a beach at Shangchuan Island. Ant\u00f3nio got a shroud from some Portuguese merchants, and with another servant put his body in a wooden coffin. They added lime so that his bones could be taken back to India if requested. His body was buried until February 1553, when the Portuguese merchants dug it up. They noted that there was no smell at all, and that his body was whole. A slice was cut from the thigh for the captain, who smelled it and agreed to transport the body.\nHis body was taken to Our Lady of the Hill, a Jesuit church, in Portuguese Malacca on 22 March 1553. It was removed from the coffin and put in a shroud. The pit was small and workers tamped down the dirt on top of his body, causing lesions and breaking bones, and flattening the nose. There were no Jesuits present at the church during this process. An open grave in the church now marks the place of Xavier's burial.\nThe first time his body was inspected by non-laymen or servants was around 15 August 1553, when a group of Jesuits exhumed his body and found it incorrupt, emanating a sweet smell, \"more like the garden of the bridegroom when the south wind blows than that of human flesh\". The shroud was stained with blood, which was still wet. His body was then moved 4,000\u00a0km to Goa, where it arrived on March the 16th, 1554.\nIt was greeted by a crowd of some 6,000 people, including the Viceroy and other key colonial figures, and carried in procession to the Jesuit College of St Paul. For the following four days, people went to St Paul's in crowds to venerate it. Contemporary observers recorded \"a great deal of shouting and disorder\" and people shoving violently to have rosaries and other articles touch his body. Father Melchior Nunes Barreto opined in a letter to Igiatius Loyola the following May his belief that, if the priests had not been present, people would have even tried to obtain pieces of his body.\nIn 1559, his body was moved from St Paul's church, which was to be demolished, moved to the rector's room for a time and then to several other locations.\nThe right forearm, which Xavier used to bless and baptise his converts, was detached by request of Superior General Claudio Acquaviva in 1614.\nThis was done in secret, his body being exhumed again for the lower portion of the arm to be surgically detached. It was sent to and has been displayed since in a silver reliquary at the main Jesuit church in Rome, Il Ges\u00f9.\nThe rest of the right arm was removed in 1619, the year that Francis was beatified, to be distributed to other Jesuit colleges in Cochi, Macau, and Malacca. Intestines and internal organs were removed in 1620 and distributed as relics more widely around the world.\nThe main body was enshrined in a silver reliquary in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa in 1659. It had been placed there on 2 December 1637, and remains there now, in a glass container encased in a silver casket. This casket was constructed by Goan silversmiths between 1636 and 1637 and was a blend of Italian and Indian aesthetics. It included 32 silver plates on all four sides of the casket, depicting different episodes from the life of Xavier. Several of them depict Xavier's mission as having been planned by God, such as the one that depicts a recurrent dream that Xavier had of carrying a man on his shoulders. Another depicts the story of the healing of Antonio Rodrigues, a blind man who according to the story regained his sight when he placed the dead hand of Xavier's body over his eyes when it was lying at St Paul's. The casket was restored in 2021. \nA relic from the right hand of St Francis Xavier is on display at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney.\nWhen the Jesuit provincial in Goa examined his body in 1686, he found that the face was deformed, the skin ravaged by moths, and the limbs shrunken. Jesuit concern at this prompted locks to be affixed to the removable silver panels on the reliquary. At one point the rector of the Basilica wrote to Rome, pleading that he be permitted to lose the keys by throwing them into the sea.\nIn the 1690s, Cosimo III de' Medici commissioned a marble pedestal for the reliquary to sit upon. It was carved in Florence by Giovanni Battista Foggini and shipped to India via Italy to be installed in 1698. The marble is polychromatic, and the pedestal has four large bronze relief sculptures that depict episodes from Xavier's life: preaching in the Indies, baptizing people, being persecuted by non-Christians, and dying on Shangchuan.\nThe bronze panels are on the second register of the pedestal, flanked by liliies and semi-precious stones. The third register, above it, is a balustrade made of pink marble, with two putti at each end, holding bronze banners above cartouche made of alabaster and bronze. The register below is made of pink and yellow marble and decorated with items made of white marble, including cherub heads, garlands, shields, and scroll volutes.\nVeneration.\nBeatification and canonization.\nFrancis Xavier was beatified by Pope Paul V on 25 October 1619, and was canonized by Pope Gregory XV on 12 March 1622, at the same time as Ignatius Loyola. Pope Pius XI proclaimed him the \"Patron of Catholic Missions\". His feast day is 3 December.\nPilgrimage centres.\nGoa.\nSaint Francis Xavier's mostly-incorruptible relics are kept in a silver casket, elevated inside the Bom Jesus Basilica and are exposed (being brought to ground level) generally every ten years, but this is discretionary. The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November 2014 at the XVII Solemn Exposition. The display closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from 21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005.\nRelics of Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) Church, Marg\u00e3o, in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), Batpal, Canacona, Goa, and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.\nOther places.\nOther pilgrimage centres include Xavier's birthplace in Navarre; the Church of the Ges\u00f9, Rome; Malacca (where he was buried for two years, before being brought to Goa); and Sancian (place of death).\nXavier is a major venerated saint in both Sonora and the neighbouring U.S. state of Arizona. In Magdalena de Kino in Sonora, Mexico, in the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena, there is a reclining statue of San Francisco Xavier brought by pioneer Jesuit missionary Padre Eusebio Kino in the early 18th century. The statue is said to be miraculous and is the object of pilgrimage for many in the region. Also the Mission San Xavier del Bac is a pilgrimage site. The mission is an active parish church ministering to the people of the San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, and nearby Tucson, Arizona.\nFrancis Xavier is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 3 December.\nNovena of Grace.\nThe Novena of Grace is a popular devotion to Francis Xavier, typically prayed either on the nine days before 3 December or on 4 March through 12 March (the anniversary of Pope Gregory XV's canonisation of Xavier in 1622). It began with the Italian Jesuit missionary Marcello Mastrilli. Before he could travel to the Far East, Mastrilli was gravely injured in a freak accident after a festive celebration dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in Naples. Delirious and on the verge of death, Mastrilli saw Xavier, who he later said asked him to choose between travelling or death by holding the respective symbols, to which Mastrilli answered, \"I choose that which God wills\".\nUpon regaining his health, Mastrilli made his way via Goa and the Philippines to Satsuma, Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate beheaded the missionary in October 1637, after undergoing three days of tortures involving the volcanic sulphurous fumes from Mount Unzen, known as the \"Hell mouth\" or \"pit\" that had supposedly caused an earlier missionary to renounce his faith.\nLegacy.\nFrancis Xavier became widely noteworthy for his missionary work, both as an organiser and as a pioneer; he converted more people than anyone else had done since Paul the Apostle. In 2006 Pope Benedict XVI said of both Ignatius of Loyola and Francis Xavier: \"not only their history which was interwoven for many years from Paris and Rome, but a unique desire \u2013 a unique passion, it could be said \u2013 moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored.\"\nHis personal efforts most affected religious practice in India and in the East Indies (Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor). As of 2021[ [update]] India still has numerous Jesuit missions and many more schools. Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in China and Japan. However, following the persecutions from 1587 onwards, instituted by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners from 1633 onwards, the Christians of Japan had to go underground to preserve an independent Christian culture. Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians were forced underground there and developed their own Christian culture.\nIn 1869, a small chapel designed by Achille-Antoine Hermitte was completed over Xavier's death-place on Shangchuan Island, Canton. It was damaged and restored several times. The most recent restoration in 2006 marked the 500th anniversary of the saint's birth.\nFrancis Xavier is the patron saint of his native Navarre, which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday. In addition to Roman Catholic Masses remembering Xavier on that day, now known as the Day of Navarre, celebrations in the surrounding weeks honour the region's cultural heritage. In the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the Javierada, an annual day-long pilgrimage, often on foot, from the capital at Pamplona to Xavier, where the Jesuits built a basilica and museum and restored Francis Xavier's family's castle.\nPersonal names.\nAs the foremost saint from Navarre and one of the main Jesuit saints, Francis Xavier is much venerated in Spain and the Hispanic countries where \"Francisco Javier\" or \"Javier\" are common male given names. The alternative spelling \"Xavier\" is also popular in the Basque Country, Portugal, Catalonia, Brazil, France, Belgium, and southern Italy. In India, the spelling \"Xavier\" is almost always used, and the name is quite common among Christians, especially in Goa and in the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka.\nThe names \"Francisco Xavier\", \"Ant\u00f3nio Xavier\", \"Jo\u00e3o Xavier\", \"Caetano Xavier\", \"Domingos Xavier\" and so forth, were very common till quite recently in Goa. \"Fransiskus Xaverius\" is commonly used as a name for Indonesian Catholics, usually abbreviated as FX. In Austria and Bavaria the name is spelt as \"Xaver\" (pronounced ) and often used in addition to Francis as \"Franz-Xaver\" (). In Polish the name becomes \"Ksawery\".\nMany Catalan men are named after him, often using the two-name combination \"Francesc Xavier\". In English-speaking countries, \"Xavier\" until recently was likely to follow \"Francis\". In the 2000s, \"Xavier\" by itself became more popular than \"Francis\", and after 2001 featured as one of the hundred most common male baby names in the US. The Sevier family name, possibly most famous in the United States for John Sevier (1745\u20131815), originated from the name \"Xavier\".\nChurch dedications.\nMany churches all over the world, often founded by Jesuits, have been named in honour of Xavier. The many in the United States include the historic St. Francis Xavier Shrine at Warwick, Maryland (founded 1720), and the Basilica of St. Francis Xavier in Dyersville, Iowa. Note also the American educational teaching order, the Xaverian Brothers, and the Mission San Xavier del Bac in Tucson, Arizona (founded in 1692, and known for its Spanish Colonial architecture).\nMissions.\nShortly before leaving for the East, Xavier issued a famous instruction to Father Gaspar Barazeuz who was leaving to go to Ormus (a Portuguese vassal kingdom on an island in the Persian Gulf, now part of Iran), that he should mix with sinners:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And if you wish to bring forth much fruit, both for yourselves and for your neighbours, and to live consoled, converse with sinners, making them unburden themselves to you. These are the living books by which you are to study, both for your preaching and for your own consolation. I do not say that you should not on occasion read written books... to support what you say against vices with authorities from the Holy Scriptures and examples from the lives of the saints.\nModern scholars assess the number of people converted to Christianity by Francis Xavier at around 30,000. While some of Xavier's methods have subsequently come under criticism, he has also earned praise. He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly to the language, of the culture they wish to evangelise. And unlike later missionaries, Xavier supported an educated native clergy. Though for a time it seemed that persecution had subsequently destroyed his work in Japan, Protestant missionaries three centuries later discovered that approximately 100,000 Christians still practised the faith in the Nagasaki area.\nFrancis Xavier's work initiated permanent change in eastern Indonesia, and he became known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" \u2013 in 1546\u20131547 he worked in the Maluku Islands among the people of Ambon, Ternate, and Morotai (or Moro), and laid the foundations for a permanent mission. After he left the Maluku Islands, others carried on his work. By the 1560s there were 10,000 Roman Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon. By the 1590s, there were 50,000 to 60,000.\nRole in the Goa Inquisition.\nIn 1546, Francis Xavier proposed the establishment of the Goa Inquisition in a letter addressed to the Portuguese King, John III. Xavier addresses the King as the 'Vicar of Christ', owing to his royal patronage over Christianity in the East Indies. In a letter dated 20 January 1548, he requests the king to be tough on the Portuguese governor in India so that he may be active in propagating the faith. Xavier also wrote to the Portuguese king asking for protection in regards to new converts who were being harassed by Portuguese commandants. Francis Xavier died in 1552 without ever living to see the start of the Goa Inquisition.\nEducational institutions.\nA number of educational institutions are named after him, including:\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks and journals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWWW sites.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10958", "revid": "47179870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10958", "title": "Fossil", "text": "Preserved remains or traces of organisms from a past geological age\nA fossil (from Classical Latin , lit.\u2009'obtained by digging') is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood and DNA remnants. The totality of fossils is known as the \"fossil record\". Though the fossil record is incomplete, numerous studies have demonstrated that there is enough information available to give a good understanding of the pattern of diversification of life on Earth. In addition, the record can predict and fill gaps such as the discovery of \"Tiktaalik\" in the arctic of Canada.\nPaleontology includes the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance. Specimens are sometimes considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old. The oldest fossils are around 3.48\u00a0billion years to 4.1\u00a0billion years old. The observation in the 19th century that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led to the recognition of a geological timescale and the relative ages of different fossils. The development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the absolute ages of rocks and the fossils they host.\nThere are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration.\nFossils vary in size from one-micrometre (1\u00a0\u03bcm) bacteria to dinosaurs and trees, many meters long and weighing many tons. The largest presently known is a \"Sequoia\" sp. measuring in length at Coaldale, Nevada. A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life, such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates, or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates. Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, such as animal tracks or feces (coprolites). These types of fossil are called trace fossils or \"ichnofossils\", as opposed to \"body fossils\". Some fossils are biochemical and are called \"chemofossils\" or biosignatures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory of study.\nGathering fossils dates at least to the beginning of recorded history. The fossils themselves are referred to as the fossil record. The fossil record was one of the early sources of data underlying the study of evolution and continues to be relevant to the history of life on Earth. Paleontologists examine the fossil record to understand the process of evolution and the way particular species have evolved.\nAncient civilizations.\nFossils have been visible and common throughout most of natural history, and so documented human interaction with them goes back as far as recorded history, or earlier.\nThere are many examples of Paleolithic stone knives in Europe, with fossil echinoderms set precisely at the hand grip, dating back to \"Homo heidelbergensis\" and Neanderthals. These ancient peoples also drilled holes through the center of those round fossil shells, apparently using them as beads for necklaces.\nThe ancient Egyptians gathered fossils of species that resembled the bones of modern species they worshipped. The god Set was associated with the hippopotamus, therefore fossilized bones of hippo-like species were kept in that deity's temples. Five-rayed fossil sea urchin shells were associated with the deity Sopdu, the Morning Star, equivalent of Venus in Roman mythology.\nFossils appear to have directly contributed to the mythology of many civilizations, including the ancient Greeks. Classical Greek historian Herodotos wrote of an area near Hyperborea where gryphons protected golden treasure. There was indeed gold mining in that approximate region, where beaked \"Protoceratops\" skulls were common as fossils.\nA later Greek scholar, Aristotle, eventually realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating the fossils were once living animals. He had previously explained them in terms of vaporous exhalations, which Persian polymath Avicenna modified into the theory of petrifying fluids (). Recognition of fossil seashells as originating in the sea was built upon in the 14th century by Albert of Saxony, and accepted in some form by most naturalists by the 16th century.\nRoman naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote of \"tongue stones\", which he called glossopetra. These were fossil shark teeth, thought by some classical cultures to look like the tongues of people or snakes. He also wrote about the horns of Ammon, which are fossil ammonites, whence the group of shelled octopus-cousins ultimately draws its modern name. Pliny also makes one of the earlier known references to toadstones, thought until the 18th century to be a magical cure for poison originating in the heads of toads, but which are fossil teeth from \"Lepidotes\", a Cretaceous ray-finned fish.\nThe Plains tribes of North America are thought to have similarly associated fossils, such as the many intact pterosaur fossils naturally exposed in the region, with their own mythology of the thunderbird.\nThere is no such direct mythological connection known from prehistoric Africa, but there is considerable evidence of tribes there excavating and moving fossils to ceremonial sites, apparently treating them with some reverence.\nIn Japan, fossil shark teeth were associated with the mythical tengu, thought to be the razor-sharp claws of the creature, documented some time after the 8th century AD.\nIn medieval China, the fossil bones of ancient mammals including \"Homo erectus\" were often mistaken for \"dragon bones\" and used as medicine and aphrodisiacs. In addition, some of these fossil bones are collected as \"art\" by scholars, who left scripts on various artifacts, indicating the time they were added to a collection. One good example is the famous scholar Huang Tingjian of the Song dynasty during the 11th century, who kept a specific seashell fossil with his own poem engraved on it. In his \"Dream Pool Essays\" published in 1088, Song dynasty Chinese scholar-official Shen Kuo hypothesized that marine fossils found in a geological stratum of mountains located hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean was evidence that a prehistoric seashore had once existed there and shifted over centuries of time. His observation of petrified bamboos in the dry northern climate zone of what is now Yan'an, Shaanxi province, China, led him to advance early ideas of gradual climate change due to bamboo naturally growing in wetter climate areas.\nIn medieval Christendom, fossilized sea creatures on mountainsides were seen as proof of the biblical deluge of Noah's Ark. After observing the existence of seashells in mountains, the ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (c. 570 \u2013 478 BC) speculated that the world was once inundated in a great flood that buried living creatures in drying mud.\nIn 1027, the Persian Avicenna explained fossils' stoniness in \"The Book of Healing\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If what is said concerning the petrifaction of animals and plants is true, the cause of this (phenomenon) is a powerful mineralizing and petrifying virtue which arises in certain stony spots, or emanates suddenly from the earth during earthquake and subsidences, and petrifies whatever comes into contact with it. As a matter of fact, the petrifaction of the bodies of plants and animals is not more extraordinary than the transformation of waters.\nFrom the 13th century to the present day, scholars pointed out that the fossil skulls of Deinotherium giganteum, found in Crete and Greece, might have been interpreted as being the skulls of the Cyclopes of Greek mythology, and are possibly the origin of that Greek myth. Their skulls appear to have a single eye-hole in the front, just like their modern elephant cousins, though in fact it's actually the opening for their trunk.\nIn Norse mythology, echinoderm shells (the round five-part button left over from a sea urchin) were associated with the god Thor, not only being incorporated in thunderstones, representations of Thor's hammer and subsequent hammer-shaped crosses as Christianity was adopted, but also kept in houses to garner Thor's protection.\nThese grew into the shepherd's crowns of English folklore, used for decoration and as good luck charms, placed by the doorway of homes and churches. In Suffolk, a different species was used as a good-luck charm by bakers, who referred to them as fairy loaves, associating them with the similarly shaped loaves of bread they baked.\nEarly modern explanations.\nMore scientific views of fossils emerged during the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci concurred with Aristotle's view that fossils were the remains of ancient life. For example, Leonardo noticed discrepancies with the biblical flood narrative as an explanation for fossil origins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the Deluge had carried the shells for distances of three and four hundred miles from the sea it would have carried them mixed with various other natural objects all heaped up together; but even at such distances from the sea we see the oysters all together and also the shellfish and the cuttlefish and all the other shells which congregate together, found all together dead; and the solitary shells are found apart from one another as we see them every day on the sea-shores.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And we find oysters together in very large families, among which some may be seen with their shells still joined together, indicating that they were left there by the sea and that they were still living when the strait of Gibraltar was cut through. In the mountains of Parma and Piacenza multitudes of shells and corals with holes may be seen still sticking to the rocks...\nIn 1666, Nicholas Steno examined a shark, and made the association of its teeth with the \"tongue stones\" of ancient Greco-Roman mythology, concluding that those were not in fact the tongues of venomous snakes, but the teeth of some long-extinct species of shark.\nRobert Hooke (1635\u20131703) included micrographs of fossils in his \"Micrographia\" and was among the first to observe fossil forams. His observations on fossils, which he stated to be the petrified remains of creatures some of which no longer existed, were published posthumously in 1705.\nWilliam Smith (1769\u20131839), an English canal engineer, observed that rocks of different ages (based on the law of superposition) preserved different assemblages of fossils, and that these assemblages succeeded one another in a regular and determinable order. He observed that rocks from distant locations could be correlated based on the fossils they contained. He termed this the principle of \"faunal succession\". This principle became one of Darwin's chief pieces of evidence that biological evolution was real.\nGeorges Cuvier came to believe that most if not all the animal fossils he examined were remains of extinct species. This led Cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism. Near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All of these facts, consistent among themselves, and not opposed by any report, seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours, destroyed by some kind of catastrophe.\nInterest in fossils, and geology more generally, expanded during the early nineteenth century. In Britain, Mary Anning's discoveries of fossils, including the first complete ichthyosaur and a complete plesiosaurus skeleton, sparked both public and scholarly interest.\nLinnaeus and Darwin.\nEarly naturalists well understood the similarities and differences of living species leading Linnaeus to develop a hierarchical classification system still in use today. Darwin and his contemporaries first linked the hierarchical structure of the tree of life with the then very sparse fossil record. Darwin eloquently described a process of descent with modification, or evolution, whereby organisms either adapt to natural and changing environmental pressures, or they perish.\nWhen Darwin wrote \"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\", the oldest animal fossils were those from the Cambrian Period, now known to be about 540\u00a0million years old. He worried about the absence of older fossils because of the implications on the validity of his theories, but he expressed hope that such fossils would be found, noting that: \"only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy.\" Darwin also pondered the sudden appearance of many groups (i.e. phyla) in the oldest known Cambrian fossiliferous strata.\nAfter Darwin.\nSince Darwin's time, the fossil record has been extended to between 2.3 and 3.5\u00a0billion years. Most of these Precambrian fossils are microscopic bacteria or microfossils. However, macroscopic fossils are now known from the late Proterozoic. The Ediacara biota (also called Vendian biota) dating from 575\u00a0million years ago collectively constitutes a richly diverse assembly of early multicellular eukaryotes.\nThe fossil record and faunal succession form the basis of the science of biostratigraphy or determining the age of rocks based on embedded fossils. For the first 150 years of geology, biostratigraphy and superposition were the only means for determining the relative age of rocks. The geologic time scale was developed based on the relative ages of rock strata as determined by the early paleontologists and stratigraphers.\nSince the early years of the twentieth century, absolute dating methods, such as radiometric dating (including potassium/argon, argon/argon, uranium series, and, for very recent fossils, radiocarbon dating) have been used to verify the relative ages obtained by fossils and to provide absolute ages for many fossils. Radiometric dating has shown that the earliest known stromatolites are over 3.4\u00a0billion years old.\nModern era.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe fossil record is life's evolutionary epic that unfolded over four\u00a0billion years as environmental conditions and genetic potential interacted in accordance with natural selection.\nThe Virtual Fossil Museum\nPaleontology has joined with evolutionary biology to share the interdisciplinary task of outlining the tree of life, which inevitably leads backwards in time to Precambrian microscopic life when cell structure and functions evolved. Earth's deep time in the Proterozoic and deeper still in the Archean is only \"recounted by microscopic fossils and subtle chemical signals.\" Molecular biologists, using phylogenetics, can compare protein amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology (i.e., similarity) to evaluate taxonomy and evolutionary distances among organisms, with limited statistical confidence. The study of fossils, on the other hand, can more specifically pinpoint when and in what organism a mutation first appeared. Phylogenetics and paleontology work together in the clarification of science's still dim view of the appearance of life and its evolution.\nNiles Eldredge's study of the \"Phacops\" trilobite genus supported the hypothesis that modifications to the arrangement of the trilobite's eye lenses proceeded by fits and starts over millions of years during the Devonian. Eldredge's interpretation of the \"Phacops\" fossil record was that the aftermaths of the lens changes, but not the rapidly occurring evolutionary process, were fossilized. This and other data led Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to publish their seminal paper on punctuated equilibrium in 1971.\nSynchrotron X-ray tomographic analysis of early Cambrian bilaterian embryonic microfossils yielded new insights of metazoan evolution at its earliest stages. The tomography technique provides previously unattainable three-dimensional resolution at the limits of fossilization. Fossils of two enigmatic bilaterians, the worm-like \"Markuelia\" and a putative, primitive protostome, \"Pseudooides\", provide a peek at germ layer embryonic development. These 543-million-year-old embryos support the emergence of some aspects of arthropod development earlier than previously thought in the late Proterozoic. The preserved embryos from China and Siberia underwent rapid diagenetic phosphatization resulting in exquisite preservation, including cell structures. This research is a notable example of how knowledge encoded by the fossil record continues to contribute otherwise unattainable information on the emergence and development of life on Earth. For example, the research suggests \"Markuelia\" has closest affinity to priapulid worms, and is adjacent to the evolutionary branching of Priapulida, Nematoda and Arthropoda.\nDespite significant advances in uncovering and identifying paleontological specimens, it is generally accepted that the fossil record is vastly incomplete. Approaches for measuring the completeness of the fossil record have been developed for numerous subsets of species, including those grouped taxonomically, temporally, environmentally/geographically, or in sum. This encompasses the subfield of taphonomy and the study of biases in the paleontological record.\nDating/Age.\nStratigraphy and estimations.\nPaleontology seeks to map out how life evolved across geologic time. A substantial hurdle is the difficulty of working out fossil ages. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50\u00a0million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so the ratio of the radioactive element to its decay products shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are volcanic ash layers, which may provide termini for the intervening sediments.\nConsequently, palaeontologists rely on stratigraphy to date fossils. Stratigraphy is the science of deciphering the \"layer-cake\" that is the sedimentary record. Rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers, with each layer younger than the one underneath it. If a fossil is found between two layers whose ages are known, the fossil's age is claimed to lie between the two known ages. Because rock sequences are not continuous, but may be broken up by faults or periods of erosion, it is very difficult to match up rock beds that are not directly adjacent. However, fossils of species that survived for a relatively short time can be used to match isolated rocks: this technique is called \"biostratigraphy\". For instance, the conodont \"Eoplacognathus pseudoplanus\" has a short range in the Middle Ordovician period. If rocks of unknown age have traces of \"E. pseudoplanus\", they have a mid-Ordovician age. Such index fossils must be distinctive, be globally distributed and occupy a short time range to be useful. Misleading results are produced if the index fossils are incorrectly dated. Stratigraphy and biostratigraphy can in general provide only relative dating (\"A\" was before \"B\"), which is often sufficient for studying evolution. However, this is difficult for some time periods, because of the problems involved in matching rocks of the same age across continents. Family-tree relationships also help to narrow down the date when lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X\u00a0million years ago and the calculated \"family tree\" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved earlier.\nIt is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged (i.e., the age of their last common ancestor) by assuming that mutations accumulate at a constant rate for a given gene. These \"molecular clocks\", however, are fallible, and provide only approximate timing: for example, they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved, and estimates produced by different techniques may vary by a factor of two.\nLimitations.\nOrganisms are only rarely preserved as fossils in the best of circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. This is illustrated by the fact that the number of species known through the fossil record is less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived. Because of the specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure to fossilize, only a small percentage of life-forms can be expected to be represented in discoveries, and each discovery represents only a snapshot of the process of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which are never guaranteed to demonstrate a convenient half-way point.\nThe fossil record is strongly biased toward organisms with hard parts, leaving most groups of soft-bodied organisms with little to no presence. It is replete with mollusks, vertebrates, echinoderms, brachiopods, and some groups of arthropods.\nSites.\nLagerst\u00e4tten.\nFossil sites with exceptional preservation\u2014sometimes including preserved soft tissues\u2014are known as Lagerst\u00e4tten (German for \"storage places\"). These formations may have resulted from carcass burial in an anoxic environment with minimal bacteria, thus slowing decomposition. Lagerst\u00e4tten span geological time from the Cambrian period to the present. Worldwide, some of the best examples of near-perfect fossilization are the Cambrian Maotianshan Shales and Burgess Shale, the Devonian Hunsr\u00fcck Slates, the Jurassic Solnhofen Limestone, and the Carboniferous Mazon Creek localities.\nFossilization processes.\nRecrystallization.\nA fossil is said to be \"recrystallized\" when the original skeletal compounds are still present but in a different crystal form, such as from aragonite to calcite.\nReplacement.\nReplacement occurs when the shell, bone, or other tissue is replaced with another mineral. In some cases mineral replacement of the original shell occurs so gradually and at such fine scales that microstructural features are preserved despite the total loss of original material. Scientists can use such fossils when researching the anatomical structure of ancient species. Several species of saurids have been identified from mineralized dinosaur fossils.\nPermineralization.\nPermineralization is a process of fossilization that occurs when an organism is buried. The empty spaces within an organism (spaces filled with liquid or gas during life) become filled with mineral-rich groundwater. Minerals precipitate from the groundwater, occupying the empty spaces. This process can occur in very small spaces, such as within the cell wall of a plant cell, and can produce very detailed fossils at small scales. For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death, otherwise the remains are destroyed by scavengers or decomposition. The degree to which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details of the fossil. Some fossils consist only of skeletal remains or teeth; other fossils contain traces of skin, feathers or even soft tissues. This is a form of diagenesis.\nPhosphatization.\nPhosphatization refers to a process of fossilization where organic matter is replaced by abundant calcium-phosphate minerals. The produced fossils tend to be particularly dense and have a dark coloration that ranges from dark orange to black.\nPyritization.\nThis fossil preservation involves the elements sulfur and iron. Organisms may become pyritized when they are in marine sediments saturated with iron sulfides. As organic matter decays, it releases sulfide which reacts with dissolved iron in the surrounding waters, forming pyrite. Pyrite replaces carbonate shell material due to an undersaturation of carbonate in the surrounding waters. Some plants become pyritized when they are in a clay terrain, but to a lesser extent than in a marine environment. Some pyritized fossils include Precambrian microfossils, marine arthropods, and plants.\nSilicification.\nIn silicification, the precipitation of silica from saturated water bodies is responsible for the fossil's formation and preservation. The mineral-laden water permeates the pores and cells of some dead organism, where it becomes a gel. Over time, the gel will dehydrate, forming a silica-rich crystal structure, which can be expressed in the form of quartz, chalcedony, agate, opal, among others, with the shape of the original remain.\nCasts and molds.\nIn some cases, the original remains of the organism completely dissolve or are otherwise destroyed. The remaining organism-shaped hole in the rock is called an \"external mold\". If this void is later filled with sediment, the resulting \"cast\" resembles what the organism looked like. An endocast, or \"internal mold\", is the result of sediments filling an organism's interior, such as the inside of a bivalve or snail or the hollow of a skull. Endocasts are sometimes termed , especially when bivalves are preserved this way.\nThe term \"cast\" is also used in a different context for human-made replicas of fossils. A cast-maker pours silicone rubber over an original fossil to capture its form. Once removed, the silicone acts as a mold to be refilled with a liquid such as plaster, which hardens into a plaster cast. Many fossils are too fragile to safely display or transport, and casts allow their anatomical details to become available to other museums or public exhibits. More recent technologies such as 3D printing serve a similar purpose.\nAuthigenic mineralization.\nThis is a special form of cast and mold formation. If the chemistry is right, the organism (or fragment of organism) can act as a nucleus for the precipitation of minerals such as siderite, resulting in a nodule forming around it. If this happens rapidly before significant decay to the organic tissue, very fine three-dimensional morphological detail can be preserved. Nodules from the Carboniferous Mazon Creek fossil beds of Illinois, US, are among the best documented examples of such mineralization.\nAdpression (compression-impression).\nCompression fossils, such as those of fossil ferns, are the result of chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules composing the organism's tissues. In this case, the fossil consists of original material, albeit in a geochemically altered state. This chemical change is an example of diagenesis. What remains is often a carbonaceous film known as a phytoleim, in which case the fossil is known as a compression. Often, however, the phytoleim is lost and all that remains is an impression of the organism in the rock\u2014an impression fossil. In many cases, however, compressions and impressions occur together. For instance, when the rock is broken open, the phytoleim will often be attached to one part (compression), whereas the counterpart will just be an impression. For this reason, one term covers the two modes of preservation: \"adpression\".\nCarbonization and coalification.\nFossils that are carbonized or coalified consist of the organic remains which have been reduced primarily to the chemical element carbon. Carbonized fossils consist of a thin film which forms a silhouette of the original organism, and the original organic remains were typically soft tissues. Coalified fossils consist primarily of coal, and the original organic remains were typically woody in composition.\nSoft tissue, cell and molecular preservation.\nBecause of their antiquity, an unexpected exception to the alteration of an organism's tissues by chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules during fossilization has been the discovery of soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, including blood vessels, and the isolation of proteins and evidence for DNA fragments. In 2014, Mary Schweitzer and her colleagues reported the presence of iron particles (goethite-aFeO(OH)) associated with soft tissues recovered from dinosaur fossils. Based on various experiments that studied the interaction of iron in haemoglobin with blood vessel tissue they proposed that solution hypoxia coupled with iron chelation enhances the stability and preservation of soft tissue and provides the basis for an explanation for the unforeseen preservation of fossil soft tissues. However, a slightly older study based on eight taxa ranging in time from the Devonian to the Jurassic found that reasonably well-preserved fibrils that probably represent collagen were preserved in all these fossils and that the quality of preservation depended mostly on the arrangement of the collagen fibers, with tight packing favoring good preservation. There seemed to be no correlation between geological age and quality of preservation, within that timeframe.\nBioimmuration.\nBioimmuration occurs when a skeletal organism overgrows or otherwise subsumes another organism, preserving the latter, or an impression of it, within the skeleton. Usually it is a sessile skeletal organism, such as a bryozoan or an oyster, which grows along a substrate, covering other sessile sclerobionts. Sometimes the bioimmured organism is soft-bodied and is then preserved in negative relief as a kind of external mold. There are also cases where an organism settles on top of a living skeletal organism that grows upwards, preserving the settler in its skeleton. Bioimmuration is known in the fossil record from the Ordovician to the Recent.\nTypes.\nIndex.\nIndex fossils (also known as guide fossils, indicator fossils or zone fossils) are fossils used to define and identify geologic periods (or faunal stages). They work on the premise that, although different sediments may look different depending on the conditions under which they were deposited, they may include the remains of the same species of fossil. The shorter the species' time range, the more precisely different sediments can be correlated, and so rapidly evolving species' fossils are particularly useful as index fossils. The best index fossils are common, easy to identify at species level and have a broad distribution\u2014otherwise the likelihood of finding and recognizing one in the two sediments is poor.\nTrace.\nTrace fossils are fossil records of biological activity by lifeforms but not the preserved remains of the organism itself. They consist mainly of tracks and burrows, but also include coprolites (fossil feces) and marks left by feeding. Trace fossils are particularly significant because they represent a data source that is not limited to animals with easily fossilized hard parts, and they reflect animal behaviours. Many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them. Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible, traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals (comparable to earthworms).\nCoprolites are classified as trace fossils as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the animal's behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Prior to this they were known as \"fossil fir cones\" and \"bezoar stones.\" They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms. Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.\nTransitional.\nA \"transitional fossil\" is any fossilized remains of a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. These fossils serve as a reminder that taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation.\nMicrofossils.\nMicrofossil is a descriptive term applied to fossilized plants and animals whose size is just at or below the level at which the fossil can be analyzed by the naked eye. A commonly applied cutoff point between \"micro\" and \"macro\" fossils is 1\u00a0mm. Microfossils may either be complete (or near-complete) organisms (such as the marine plankters foraminifera and coccolithophores) or component parts (such as small teeth or spores) of larger animals or plants. Microfossils are of critical importance as a reservoir of paleoclimate information, and are also commonly used by biostratigraphers to assist in the correlation of rock units.\nResin.\nFossil resin (colloquially called amber) is a natural polymer found in many types of strata throughout the world, even the Arctic. The oldest fossil resin dates to the Triassic, though most dates to the Cenozoic. The excretion of resin by certain plants is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation for to protect against insects and to seal wounds. Fossil resin often contains other fossils, called inclusions, that were captured by the sticky resin. These include bacteria, fungi, other plants, and animals. Animal inclusions are usually small invertebrates, predominantly arthropods such as insects and spiders, and only extremely rarely a vertebrate such as a small lizard. Preservation of inclusions can be exquisite, including small fragments of DNA.\nDerived or reworked.\nA \"derived\", \"reworked\" or is a fossil found in rock that accumulated significantly later than when the fossilized animal or plant died. Reworked fossils are created by erosion exhuming (freeing) fossils from the rock formation in which they were originally deposited and redepositing them in a younger sedimentary deposit.\nWood.\nFossil wood is wood that is preserved in the fossil record. Wood is usually the part of a plant that is best preserved (and most easily found). Fossil wood may or may not be petrified. The fossil wood may be the only part of the plant that has been preserved; therefore such wood may get a special kind of botanical name. This will usually include \"xylon\" and a term indicating its presumed affinity, such as \"Araucarioxylon\" (wood of \"Araucaria\" or some related genus), \"Palmoxylon\" (wood of an indeterminate palm), or \"Castanoxylon\" (wood of an indeterminate chinkapin).\nSubfossil.\nThe term subfossil can be used to refer to remains, such as bones, nests, or fecal deposits, whose fossilization process is not complete, either because the length of time since the animal involved was living is too short or because the conditions in which the remains were buried were not optimal for fossilization. Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years. The main importance of subfossil vs. fossil remains is that the former contain organic material, which can be used for radiocarbon dating or extraction and sequencing of DNA, protein, or other biomolecules. Additionally, isotope ratios can provide much information about the ecological conditions under which extinct animals lived. Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology.\nSubfossils are often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils. Once deposited, physical and chemical weathering can alter the state of preservation, and small subfossils can also be ingested by living organisms. Subfossil remains that date from the Mesozoic are exceptionally rare, are usually in an advanced state of decay, and are consequently much disputed. The vast bulk of subfossil material comes from Quaternary sediments, including many subfossilized chironomid head capsules, ostracod carapaces, diatoms, and foraminifera.\nFor remains such as molluscan seashells, which frequently do not change their chemical composition over geological time, and may occasionally even retain such features as the original color markings for millions of years, the label 'subfossil' is applied to shells that are understood to be thousands of years old, but are of Holocene age, and therefore are not old enough to be from the Pleistocene epoch.\nChemical fossils.\nChemical fossils, or chemofossils, are chemicals found in rocks and fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, and natural gas) that provide an organic signature for ancient life. Molecular fossils and isotope ratios represent two types of chemical fossils. The oldest traces of life on Earth are fossils of this type, including carbon isotope anomalies found in zircons that imply the existence of life as early as 4.1\u00a0billion years ago.\nStromatolites.\nStromatolites are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by biofilms of microorganisms, especially cyanobacteria. Stromatolites provide some of the most ancient fossil records of life on Earth, dating back more than 3.5\u00a0billion years ago.\nStromatolites were much more abundant in Precambrian times. While older, Archean fossil remains are presumed to be colonies of cyanobacteria, younger (that is, Proterozoic) fossils may be primordial forms of the eukaryote chlorophytes (that is, green algae). One genus of stromatolite very common in the geologic record is \"Collenia\". The earliest stromatolite of confirmed microbial origin dates to 2.724\u00a0billion years ago.\nA 2009 discovery provides strong evidence of microbial stromatolites extending as far back as 3.45\u00a0billion years ago.\nStromatolites are a major constituent of the fossil record for life's first 3.5\u00a0billion years, peaking about 1.25\u00a0billion years ago. They subsequently declined in abundance and diversity, which by the start of the Cambrian had fallen to 20% of their peak. The most widely supported explanation is that stromatolite builders fell victims to grazing creatures (the Cambrian substrate revolution), implying that sufficiently complex organisms were common over 1\u00a0billion years ago.\nThe connection between grazer and stromatolite abundance is well documented in the younger Ordovician evolutionary radiation; stromatolite abundance also increased after the end-Ordovician and end-Permian extinctions decimated marine animals, falling back to earlier levels as marine animals recovered. Fluctuations in metazoan population and diversity may not have been the only factor in the reduction in stromatolite abundance. Factors such as the chemistry of the environment may have been responsible for changes.\nWhile prokaryotic cyanobacteria themselves reproduce asexually through cell division, they were instrumental in priming the environment for the evolutionary development of more complex eukaryotic organisms. Cyanobacteria (as well as extremophile Gammaproteobacteria) are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval Earth's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria use water, carbon dioxide and sunlight to create their food. A layer of mucus often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the mucus, which can be cemented by the calcium carbonate to grow thin laminations of limestone. These laminations can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites is the result of the vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed oncolites are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the fossil record. Thrombolites are poorly laminated or non-laminated clotted structures formed by cyanobacteria common in the fossil record and in modern sediments.\nThe Zebra River Canyon area of the Kubis platform in the deeply dissected Zaris Mountains of southwestern Namibia provides an extremely well exposed example of the thrombolite-stromatolite-metazoan reefs that developed during the Proterozoic period, the stromatolites here being better developed in updip locations under conditions of higher current velocities and greater sediment influx.\nPseudofossils.\n\"Pseudofossils\" are visual patterns in rocks that imitate fossils but are produced by geologic processes rather than biologic processes. Some pseudofossils, such as geological dendrite crystals, are formed by naturally occurring fissures in the rock that get filled up by percolating minerals. Other types of pseudofossils are kidney ore (round shapes in iron ore) and moss agates, which look like moss or plant leaves. Concretions, spherical or ovoid-shaped nodules found in some sedimentary strata, were once thought to be dinosaur eggs and are often mistaken for fossils as well.\nAstrobiology.\nIt has been suggested that biominerals could be important indicators of extraterrestrial life and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet Mars. Furthermore, organic components (biosignatures) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and biotic reactions.\nOn 24 January 2014, NASA reported that current studies by the \"Curiosity\" and \"Opportunity\" rovers on Mars would begin searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective.\nArt.\nAccording to one hypothesis, a Corinthian vase from the 6th century BCE (Boston 63.420) is the oldest artistic record of a vertebrate fossil, perhaps a Miocene giraffe combined with elements from other species. However, a later study by Juli\u00e1n Monge-N\u00e1jera using expert evaluations rejects this idea, because mammals do not have the eye bones shown on the painted monster. Monge-N\u00e1jera believes the morphology shown in the vase painting corresponds best to an extant varanid that would have been known to the Ancient Greeks.\nTrading and collecting.\nFossil trading is the practice of buying and selling fossils. This is often done illegally with artifacts stolen from research sites, costing many important scientific specimens each year. The problem is quite pronounced in China, where many specimens have been stolen.\nFossil collecting (sometimes, in a non-scientific sense, fossil hunting) is the collection of fossils for scientific study, leisure, or profit. Amateur fossil collecting is the predecessor of modern paleontology and remains a practiced hobby to date. Professionals and amateurs alike collect fossils for their scientific value.\nAs medicine.\nThe use of fossils to address health issues is rooted in traditional medicine and include the use of fossils as talismans. The specific fossil to use to alleviate or cure an illness is often based on its resemblance to the symptoms or affected organ (see sympathetic magic). The usefulness of fossils as medicine is almost entirely a placebo effect, though fossil material might conceivably have some antacid activity or supply some essential minerals. The use of dinosaur bones as \"dragon bones\" has persisted in Traditional Chinese medicine into modern times, with mid-Cretaceous dinosaur bones being consumed in Ruyang County during the early 21st century.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The act is also referred to as the Buckley Amendment, for one of its proponents, Senator James L. Buckley of New York.\nFERPA is a U.S. federal law that regulates access and disclosure of student education records. It grants parents access to their child's records, allows amendments, and controls disclosure. After a student turns 18, their consent is generally required for disclosure. The law applies to institutions receiving U.S. Department of Education funds and provides privacy rights to students 18 years or older, or those in post-secondary institutions. Disclosure is permitted to parents of dependent students, and medical records are usually protected under FERPA rather than HIPAA. The law has faced criticism for concealing non-educational public records.\nOverview.\nFERPA gives parents access to their child's education records, an opportunity to seek to have the records amended, and some control over the disclosure of information from the records. With several exceptions, schools must have a student's consent prior to the disclosure of education records after that student is 18 years old. The law applies only to educational agencies and institutions that receive funds under a program administered by the U.S. Department of Education.\nOther regulations under this Act, effective starting January 3, 2012, allow for greater disclosures of personal and directory student identifying information and regulate disclosure of student IDs and e-mail addresses. For example, schools may provide external companies with a student's personally identifiable information without the student's consent. Conversely, tying student directory information to other information may result in a violation, as the combination creates an education record.\nExamples of situations affected by FERPA include school employees divulging information to anyone other than the student about the student's grades or behavior, and school work posted on a bulletin board with a grade. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record.\nThis privacy policy also governs how state agencies transmit testing data to federal agencies, such as the Education Data Exchange Network.\nThis U.S. federal law also gave students 18 years of age or older, or students of any age if enrolled in any post-secondary educational institution, the right of privacy regarding grades, enrollment, and even billing information unless the school has specific permission from the student to share that specific type of information.\nFERPA also permits a school to disclose personally identifiable information from education records of an \"eligible student\" (a student age 18 or older or enrolled in a postsecondary institution at any age) to his or her parents if the student is a dependent \"student\" as that term is defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, if either parent has claimed the student as a dependent on the parent's most recent U.S. Federal income tax return, the school may non-consensually disclose the student's education records to both parents.\nThe law allowed students who apply to an educational institution such as graduate school permission to view recommendations submitted by others as part of the application. On standard application forms, students are given the option to waive this right.\nFERPA specifically excludes employees of an educational institution if they are not students.\nFERPA is now a guide to communicating higher education issues and privacy issues that include sexual assault and campus safety. It provides a framework on addressing needs of certain populations in higher education.\nAccess to public records.\nThe citing of FERPA to conceal public records that are not \"educational\" in nature has been widely criticized, including criticism by the Act's primary Senate sponsor. For example, in the \"Owasso Independent School District v. Falvo\" case, an important part of the debate was determining the relationship between peer-grading and \"education records\" as defined in FERPA. The plaintiffs argued \"that allowing students to score each other's tests [...] as the teachers explain the correct answers to the entire class [...] embarrassed [...] children\", but they lost in a summary judgment by the district court. The Court of Appeals, ruled that students placing grades on the work of other students made such work into an \"education record.\" Thus, peer-grading was determined as a violation of FERPA privacy policies because students had access to other students' academic performance without full consent. However, on appeal to the Supreme Court, it was unanimously ruled that peer-grading was not a violation of FERPA. This is because a grade written on a student's work does not become an \"education record\" until the teacher writes the final grade into a grade book.\nStudent medical records.\nLegal experts have debated the issue of whether student medical records (e.g. records of therapy sessions with a therapist at an on-campus counseling center) might be released to the school administration under certain triggering events, such as when a student sues his or her college or university.\nUsually, student medical treatment records will remain under the protection of FERPA, not the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This is due to the \"FERPA Exception\" written within HIPAA.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
