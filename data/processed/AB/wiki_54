Jordan's telecom infrastructure is growing at a very rapid pace and continually being updated and expanded. Communications in Jordan occur across many media, including telephone, radio, television, and internet.\nTelephone.\n50% of households have at least one main line telephone. , 103% of the population has a cell phone; 15% have more than one.\n&lt;br&gt;In mid 2004, XPress Telecom was launched as the country's digital radio trunking operator.\n \"domestic:\" Microwave radio relay transmission and coaxial and fiber-optic cable are employed on trunk lines; considerable use is made of mobile cellular systems; Internet service is available.\n \"international:\" satellite earth stations - 3 Intelsat, 1 Arabsat, and 29 land and maritime Inmarsat terminals; fiber-optic cable to Saudi Arabia and microwave radio relay link with Egypt and Syria; connection to international submarine cable FLAG (Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe); participant in MEDARABTEL; international links total about 4,000.\nPCs.\n40% of Jordanian households have a PC. This is expected to double in the coming years when the government reduces the sales tax on PCs and internet service in an effort to make Jordan the high-tech capital of the Middle East. The Jordanian Government is also providing every university student with a laptop in partnership with the private sector. All Jordan's schools are connected with internet service and the Jordanian Government is heavily purchasing computers and smart technology to be equipped in Jordan's classrooms.\nInternet.\nAs of 2013, Internet penetration in Jordan was 63%. It was 50.5 percent by the end of 2011. Internet usage more than doubled from 2007 to 2009 with the rapid growth expected to continue. Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) figures indicate that Internet penetration stood at 29 per cent by the end of 2009 and 38 per cent by the end of 2010.\nThe Jordanian government has announced that the sales tax on computers and internet connection would be removed in order to further stimulate the ICT industry in Jordan. King Abdullah II told the BBC in 2004 that he hoped to make his country the tech hub of the Middle East. Jordan has more internet start up companies than any other country in the Middle East, and thus was dubbed the Middle East's \"Silicon Valley\". Amman was ranked as the 10th-best city in the world to launch a tech startup, according to a 2012 list compiled by Finaventures, a California-based venture-capital firm. Tech entrepreneurs have praised the ability to access high speed internet connections in Jordan, comparing this to Dubai and Saudi Arabia. \"Al Jami'a Street\", in Jordan's northern city of Irbid, was ranked as the street with the highest number of internet cafes in the world by the Guinness World Records.\nPast.\nThe IT industry in Jordan in the year 2000 and beyond got a very big boost after the Gulf War of 1991. This boost came from a large influx of immigrants from the Gulf countries to Jordan, mostly from Jordanian expatriates from Kuwait, totaling few hundred thousands. This large wave impacted Jordan in many ways, and one of them was on its IT industry.\nFuture.\nWhen King Abdullah II ascended to the throne in 1999, he stated his intentions to turn Jordan into the high-tech capital of the Middle East and to create a Silicon Valley-like venture in Jordan. All Jordanian schools are equipped with computers and internet connection and instituted an ICT curriculum into Jordan's education system. ICT faculties were established in Jordanian universities and these campuses have been churning out 15,000 ICT graduates every year. Information access centers were established across the Kingdom to allow rural areas access to the Internet.\nThe number of phone lines has decreased dramatically in the past three years to below 500K telephone lines, due to the introduction of WI-Max technology and 3G networks.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the first Gulf War (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process. After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.\nIn 2000, Jordan signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States, which went into effect in 2010.\nIn 2013, the U.S. approved the CIA\u2013led Timber Sycamore covert operation, based in Jordan, to train and arm Syrian rebels.\nEuropean Union.\nJordan enjoys \"advanced status\" with the European Union and is part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which aims to increase links between the EU and its neighbours.\nRegional neighbours.\nOwing to its location, bordering Israel, Syria, and Iraq, Jordan has experienced wars along its borders for decades, and maintains careful diplomatic relations with Israel and its main ally, the U.S.\nAlong with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, as of 2009[ [update]] Jordan was one of only three Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour.\nJordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position reinforced in the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.\nJordan signed a non-aggression pact with Israel (the Washington Declaration) in Washington, D.C., on 25 July 1994. Jordan and Israel signed a historic peace treaty on October 26, 1994, witnessed by President Clinton, accompanied by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

Prime minister Bisher al Khasawneh expressed his country's disapproval of Israel's offensive in Gaza by recalling its ambassador from Israel, and declared that Israel's ambassador, who had departed Amman following Hamas' attack, would not be permitted to return. Khasawneh argued that Israel's blockade of the heavily populated Gaza Strip could not be justified as self-defense, and criticised the indiscriminate Israeli assault, which had included safe zones and ambulances in its targets.\nJordanian residents (including the approximately 2 million Palestinian refugees and others with Palestinian roots) have staged protests against Israel's actions in Gaza, which adds pressure to the government to take action on the issue. There is also evidence that there is more sympathy with Hamas among Jordanians in recent years. However, Jordan's Western allies view the kingdom as a potentially vital mediator, should Israel and Hamas agree to negotiate. King Abdullah has been taking part in diplomatic meetings in Europe, aiming to secure safe passage of humanitarian aid; however, the government is also grappling with domestic problems such as inflation, unemployment, and trafficking of arms and drugs through Jordan to the West Bank. The king and Queen Rania have criticised Israel's action in Gaza, and called for a ceasefire. Jordan's ambassador to Israel was recalled, and the Israeli ambassador was told to stay away.

It is a low, flat island, in size.\nAdministratively, the island is one of the Scattered islands in the Indian Ocean, a district of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. However, its sovereignty is disputed by Madagascar.\nAnchorage is possible off the northeast of the island which also has a airstrip. The island is garrisoned by French troops from R\u00e9union and has a weather station.\nDescription.\nJuan de Nova, about long and at its widest, is a nature reserve surrounded by reefs which enclose an area\u2014not a true lagoon like in an atoll\u2014of roughly . Forests, mainly of Casuarinaceae, cover about half the island. Sea turtles nest on the beaches around the island.\nGeography.\nJuan de Nova is located in the Mozambique Canal, closer to the Madagascar side: from Tambohorano, west-southwest from Tanjona Vilanandro and from the African coast.\nThe island was created when an underwater promontory of a coral reef emerged when the reef was dismantled by ocean currents, producing a sandy island. The prevailing south-southwest winds form dunes on the island, which, at tall, form the island's highest points.\nIts southwest coast is bordered by a coral reef that prevents ships from landing, and the northeast coast consists of a lagoon that becomes sandy and impassable at low tide. There is a single pass that allows access to the island.\nThe difficult conditions for accessing the island has caused several shipwrecks, some of which remain on the Island, including that of the \"Tottenham\" (nicknamed the Charbonnier), which ran aground in 1911 on the island's southwest coast.\nThe island is about long from east to west, and wide, with an area of approximately . The entire quasi-atoll is in circumference, with an exclusive economic zone of .\nHistory.\nDiscovery of the island (1501).\nJo\u00e3o da Nova, a Galician admiral in the service of Portugal, came across the uninhabited island in 1501 while he was crossing the Mozambique Channel during an expedition to India. He called it Galega or Agalega (the Galician) in reference to his nationality. The island then came to be named for him, with the Spanish spelling: on subsequent maps it was labeled \"Johan de Nova\" on a map by Salvatore de Pilestrina (1519), \"Joa de Nova\" (Mercator, 1569), \"San-Christophoro\" (Ortelius, 1570), \"Saint-Christophe\" (Lislet Geoffroy), before finally being dubbed \"Juan de Nova\" by the British explorer William Fitzwilliam Owen. Historically, the island was sometimes confused with the nearby island Bassas da India, which is completely covered at high tide.\nAlthough the island was located along the spice route, it was not of interest to the colonial powers because of its small size and little utility as a stopover. However, it is possible that it served as a refuge for pirates, such as Olivier Levasseur.\nAcquisition by France and resource exploitation (1896\u20131975).\nThe island had never been inhabited when it became a possession of France, alongside Europa Island and Bassas da India, in 1897.\nAt the time, the only visitors to the island were Malagasy fishermen during sea turtles' nesting season. However, around 1900, the island was granted to a Frenchman for a 20-year lease. He initiated the exploitation of the island's guano deposits, which production reaching 53,000 tons in 1923. A coconut grove on the island also produced 12 tons of copra per year.\nIn 1921, France transferred the administration of Juan de Nova from Paris to Tananarive in its colony of Madagascar and Dependencies. Then, before the independence of Madagascar, France transferred the administration of the island to Saint-Pierre on R\u00e9union. Madagascar became independent in 1960, and it has claimed sovereignty over the island since 1972.\nAn airstrip was built on the island in 1934. Guano exploitation continued for several decades, with a pause in activity during World War II. The island was abandoned during the war, and it was visited by German submariners. Installations, including a hangar, rail lines, houses and a jetty are in ruins.\nIn 1952, a second concession was granted for 15 years to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise des \u00eeles Malgaches (SOFIM), led by Hector Patureau. This concession was renewed for 25 years in 1960, after Madagascar's independence. Structures were built throughout the island to support the phosphate mining operation, including warehouses, housing, a prison, and a cemetery.\nThe workers on the island came mainly from Mauritius and the Seychelles. Working conditions were extremely harsh, with rule-breaking punished by flogging or imprisonment, and each worker had to extract one metric ton of phosphate per day to earn 3.5 rupees. In 1968, Mauritian workers revolted, and the operation's management appealed to the prefect of R\u00e9union for help. The revolt brought government and media attention to abusive practices on the island, including \"droit du seigneur\" being practiced by one of the foremen, and some members of the staff were fired by SOFIM's president.\nIn the 1960s, the price of phosphate collapsed, and the mining operation on the island ceased to be profitable. SOFIM was dissolved in 1968, and the last workers left the island in 1975. The French government retook control of the concession, paying 45 million CFA to Hector Patureau in compensation.\nInstallation of a weather station (1971\u20131973).\nIn 1963, an auxiliary weather installation, called \"la Goulette,\" was installed to carry out regular temperature and pressure readings. But on a visit to the island in 1971, a representative of the Weather Service found numerous irregularities in the readings, as well as poor security on the island, which was still under the responsibility of Patureau. Following the recommendations of the World Weather Watch, a basic, year-round weather station was built in 1973 in the southwest part of the island, at the end of the airstrip.\nA project to create a Club Med tourist resort was proposed by Gilbert Trigano, which for a time brought a team of workers to the island under the supervision of Hector Patureau, but it was quickly abandoned.\nMilitary presence (1974\u2013present).\nIn 1974, the French government decided to install military detachments across the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean that lay within the Mozambique Channel (Juan de Nova, Europa Island, and the Glorioso Islands). Its aim was primarily to respond to Madagascar's claims to those territories, which France considers protected within an exclusive economic zone.\nJuan de Nova Island was assigned a small garrison of 14 soldiers from the 2nd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment, as well as a \"gendarme\". They settled in housing that formerly hosted SOFIM workers. The troops receive supplies by air every 45 days.\nToday, most of the installations from the mining days are in ruins, and only a few buildings are maintained for military use. Upkeep is also performed on the cemetery. The island has been converted into a nature preserve, which aims to protect biodiversity and particularly coral reefs. It is closed to access, with temporary authorization granted to scientists on short-term missions.\nThe Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean are partially claimed by the Comoros, Madagascar, and Mauritius. The Malagasy and Mauritian claims, however, are significantly later than their access to independence. However, the agreement reached in October 2024 on the restitution to Mauritius of the Chagos Islands by Great Britain, in the heart of the Indian Ocean, notably home to the American base of Diego Garcia, has relaunched the debate in Madagascar.\nWrecks.\nThe island lies on the sea route between South Africa and the northern tip of Madagascar. It is affected by strong currents and has become the site of numerous wrecks. Most visible are the remains of the which ran onto the southern fringing reef in 1911.\nEconomic resources.\nGuano.\nThe presence of a significant bird population on Juan de Nova Island led to a major guano deposit on the surface of the island. This became the first natural resource to be exploited on the island in the 20th century. This mining operation led to the establishment of the first structures on the island, and the workers also planted coconut trees, whose products were also exported. The exploitation of guano stopped around 1970, after the price of phosphates dropped.\nHydrocarbons.\nIn 2005, a government decree authorized preliminary exploration for liquid or gas hydrocarbons offshore. This authorization covers an area of approximately 62,000 square kilometers surrounding the island. In 2008, a subsequent decree granted an exploration permit for the \"Juan de Nova Est\" field to the companies Nighthawk Energy Plc, Jupiter Petroleum Juan de Nova Ltd, and Osceola Hydrocarbons Ltd, as well as to Marex Inc. and Roc Oil Company Ltd for the \"Juan de Nova Maritime Profond\" field. The licensees had to commit to investing around $100 million over five years for mining and research. The eastern boundary of these exploration areas is in contention with Madagascar and its exclusive economic zone.\nIn 2015, the drilling authorization was renewed Sapetro and Marex Petroleum for a period of three years.\nHowever, these projects have been abandoned since 2019, when the island was classified as a nature reserve.\nFauna and flora.\nThree or four times a year, scientists come to Juan de Nova Island to study its ecosystem. Despite the ongoing scientific efforts, an inventory of the island's biodiversity (particularly genetics) is only in its earliest stages. There is much to be studied.\nResearchers from the University of Reunion Island's ECOMAR lab have worked to identify or observe seabirds around the island. In particular, they have worked to study the behavior of 2 million pairs of terns that have sought refuge on the island, forming the largest colony in the Indian Ocean.\nPascale Chabanet, of the Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement, says based on their research on the island:\n\"The reefs of these deserted and isolated islands like Juan de Nova Island are preserved from all pollution and anthropogenic influence. But they are affected by climate change.\"Such environments are useful for scientists to measure to what degree environmental changes are attributable to humans.\nThe scientists are also observing and working to mitigate the impact of the presence of invasive species on the island, including mosquitoes such as \"Aedes aegypti, Aedes fryeri, Culex sitiens, Culex tritaeniorhynchus,\" and \"Mansonia uniformis\". \"Aedes albopictus\", an invasive Asian species that can carry pathogenic arbovirus, has also been seen on the island.\nGeology.\nImportant Bird Area.\nThe island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports a very large colony of sooty terns, with up to 100,000\u00a0breeding pairs. It also has a much smaller colony of greater crested terns\u00a0\u2013 with at least 50\u00a0breeding pairs recorded in 1994. Of at least seven species of land birds present, most are probably introduced.\nClimate.\nThe island exhibits a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\"). A year on the island can be divided into two seasons: the cool season and the rainy season.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is a key figure in the 17th-century Scientific Revolution, best known for his laws of planetary motion, and his books \"Astronomia nova\", \"Harmonice Mundi\", and \"Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae\". The variety and impact of his work made Kepler one of the founders and fathers of modern astronomy, the scientific method, natural science, and modern science. He has been described as the \"father of science fiction\" for his novel \"Somnium\".\nKepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague, and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II. He also taught mathematics in Linz, and was an adviser to General Wallenstein.\nKepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) and physics (a branch of natural philosophy). Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason. Kepler described his new astronomy as \"celestial physics\", as \"an excursion into Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\"\", and as \"a supplement to Aristotle's \"On the Heavens\"\", transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics. Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, being named the father of modern optics, in particular for his \"Astronomiae pars optica\". He also invented an improved version of the refracting telescope, the Keplerian telescope, which became the foundation of the modern refracting telescope, while also improving on the telescope design by Galileo Galilei, who mentioned Kepler's discoveries in his work. He postulated the Kepler conjecture. Kepler influenced among others Isaac Newton, providing one of the foundations for his theory of universal gravitation.\nEarly life.\nChildhood (1571\u20131590).\nKepler was born on 27 December 1571, in the Free Imperial City of Weil der Stadt (now part of the Stuttgart Region in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg). His parents were Lutheran, but it is presumed that he was baptized a Catholic, as Protestant baptisms were not permitted in Weil at that time. His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of the city. By the time Johannes was born, the Kepler family fortune was in decline. His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a mercenary, and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to have died in the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands where, although a Protestant, he was fighting in the Catholic Spanish army. His mother, Katharina Guldenmann, an innkeeper's daughter, was a healer and herbalist. Johannes had six siblings, of which two brothers and one sister survived to adulthood. Born prematurely, he claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child. Nevertheless, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty.\nHe was introduced to astronomy at an early age and developed a strong passion for it that would span his entire life. At age six, he observed the Great Comet of 1577, writing that he \"was taken by [his] mother to a high place to look at it.\" In 1580, at age nine, he observed another astronomical event, a lunar eclipse, recording that he remembered being \"called outdoors\" to see it and that the Moon \"appeared quite red\". However, childhood smallpox left him with weak vision and crippled hands, limiting his ability in the observational aspects of astronomy.\nKepler attended the Grammar School in Weil until 1577, when the family moved to Leonberg in Protestant W\u00fcrttemberg. He attended the elementary German school in Leonberg for a year, and then the Latin Grammar School, where all lessons and books were in Latin. He was then at two monastic schools, from 1584 in Adelberg, and from 1586 at the seminary at Maulbronn. In September 1589, Kepler entered the T\u00fcbinger Stift at the University of T\u00fcbingen, a seminary which served to prepare Lutheran pastors for W\u00fcrttemberg. There, he studied philosophy under Vitus M\u00fcller and theology under Jacob Heerbrand (a student of Philipp Melanchthon at Wittenberg), who also taught Michael Maestlin while he was a student, until he became Chancellor at T\u00fcbingen in 1590. He proved himself to be a superb mathematician and earned a reputation as a skillful astrologer, casting horoscopes for fellow students. Under the instruction of Michael Maestlin, T\u00fcbingen's professor of mathematics from 1583 to 1631, he learned both the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system of planetary motion. He became a Copernican at that time. In a student disputation, he defended heliocentrism from both a theoretical and theological perspective, maintaining that the Sun was the principal source of motive power in the universe. Despite his desire to become a minister in the Lutheran church, he was denied ordination because of beliefs contrary to the Formula of Concord, the Lutheran statement of faith which had been adopted in 1577. Near the end of his studies, Kepler was recommended for a position as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the Protestant school in Graz, in Styria, Inner Austria. He accepted the position in April 1594, at the age of 22.\nGraz (1594\u20131600).\nDuring his time in Graz (1594\u20131600), he issued many official calendars and prognostications that enhanced his reputation as an astrologer. Although Kepler had mixed feelings about astrology and disparaged many customary practices of astrologers, he believed deeply in a connection between the cosmos and the individual. He eventually published some of the ideas he had entertained while a student in the \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" (1596), published a little over a year after his arrival at Graz.\nIn December 1595, Kepler was introduced to Barbara M\u00fcller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her. M\u00fcller, an heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage. Even though Kepler had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on \"Mysterium\", but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials\u2014who had helped set up the match\u2014pressured the M\u00fcllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on 27 April 1597.\nIn the first years of their marriage, the Keplers had two children (Heinrich and Susanna), both of whom died in infancy. In 1602, they had a daughter (Susanna); in 1604, a son (Friedrich); and in 1607, another son (Ludwig).\nOther research.\nFollowing the publication of \"Mysterium\" and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.\nHe also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent \"Mysterium\", among them Reimarus Ursus (Nicolaus Reimers B\u00e4r)\u2014the imperial mathematician to Rudolf II and a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the Tychonic system with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.\nInstead, he turned his attention to chronology and \"harmony\", the numerological relationships among music, mathematics and the physical world, and their astrological consequences. By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the Sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting astrological aspects and astronomical distances to weather and other earthly phenomena. By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data\u2014just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz. \nExpulsion from Graz.\nGraz was a largely Protestant, mostly Lutheran, city, while the ruler of Inner Austria was a Catholic Habsburg. In 1578, Duke Charles II had granted considerable privileges to Protestants in the Pacification of Bruck. Charles died in 1590, when his son and heir Ferdinand II was 12 years old. Ferdinand was educated in the Jesuit College and University of Ingolstadt, and became full ruler of Inner Austria in 1596. He travelled to Italy in 1598, and returned with a determination to restore the true Catholic faith and eliminate heresy. Kepler wrote to a friend in June of that year expressing his foreboding for the future. As Ferdinand's biographer Robert L. Bireley wrote, his fears were justified, as the Counter-Reformation gained strength.\nIn September 1598, Ferdinand ordered all Protestant preachers and teachers to leave the country. Kepler was exempted from the decree, but did not feel secure, and looked for alternatives. He learned that Tycho Brahe had been appointed Imperial Mathematician in Prague, and Kepler re-established contact. In December 1599, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in Prague; on 1 January 1600 (before he even received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones. On 4 February 1600, Kepler met Tycho Brahe and his assistants Franz Tengnagel and Longomontanus at Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou (35\u00a0km from Prague), the site where Tycho's new observatory was being constructed. Over the next two months, he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory from \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of Johannes Jessenius, Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on 6 April. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.\nThe situation in Graz made it impossible to return immediately to Brahe; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies, Kepler sought an appointment as a mathematician to Duke Ferdinand. To that end, Kepler composed an essay\u2014dedicated to Ferdinand\u2014in which he proposed a force-based theory of lunar motion: \"In Terra inest virtus, quae Lunam ciet\" (\"There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move\"). Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand's court, it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses, which he applied during the 10 July eclipse in Graz. These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in \"Astronomiae Pars Optica\". Then on 17 July a new decree was announced, ordering all inhabitants to renounce the Protestant faith or leave the province. This time there was no exception for Kepler, and he and his wife and step-daughter left Graz for Prague on 30 September 1600.\nScientific career.\nPrague (1600\u20131612).\nOnce established in Prague, he was supported directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the \"Rudolphine Tables\" that should replace the \"Prutenic Tables\" of Erasmus Reinhold. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on 24 October 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as the imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.\nImperial Advisor.\nKepler's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor, Rudolf II. Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in T\u00fcbingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolf was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.\nOfficially, the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and Utraquist, but Kepler's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars (Johannes Matth\u00e4us Wackher von Wackhenfels, Jost B\u00fcrgi, David Fabricius, Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.\nSupernova of 1604.\nIn October 1604, a bright new evening star (SN 1604) appeared, but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began systematically observing the supernova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a fiery trigon, the start of the about 800-year cycle of great conjunctions; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of Charlemagne (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor.\nIt was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his \"De Stella Nova\". In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was beyond the planetary orbits, and thus in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. Kepler also attached an appendix where he discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the Star of Bethlehem\u2014analogous to the present new star\u2014would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.\nOver the following years, Kepler attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini, and dealt with chronology, especially the dating of events in the life of Jesus. Around 1611, Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published (posthumously) as \"Somnium\" [The Dream]. Part of the purpose of \"Somnium\" was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system. The manuscript, which disappeared after changing hands several times, described a fantastic trip to the Moon; it was part allegory, part autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel (and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction). Years later, a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother, as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel. Following her eventual acquittal, Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story\u2014several times longer than the actual text\u2014which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content (particularly regarding lunar geography) hidden within the text.\nLater life.\nTroubles.\nDuring Kepler's time in Prague, religious and political tensions were building up in the Empire, both between Protestants and Catholics, and within the Habsburg dynasty over the isssue of succession. The situation in Prague, a cosmopolitan city, became increasingly difficult, and Kepler considered a move to W\u00fcrttemberg, which he considered his homeland. In 1609 he wrote to the Duke, Johann Frederick, requesting a position in the University of T\u00fcbingen. The Duke turned down the request, but sent a present as a token of goodwill. Kepler replied, and in his letter summarised his position on the doctrinal issues that had caused problems in the past. The Duke did not repond to this. Two years later, he tried again, but this time the request was referred to the theological consistory in Stuttgart, who rejected Kepler's request on 25 April 1611, denouncing his Calvinist leanings both in his reservations about the Formula of Concord, and his insistence that Calvinists should, despite disagreements, be considered \"brothers in Christ\".\nIn 1611, Emperor Rudolf's health was failing, and he was forced to abdicate as King of Bohemia by his brother Matthias. Both sides sought Kepler's astrological advice, an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice (with little reference to the stars, except in general statements to discourage drastic action). However, it was clear that Kepler's future prospects in the court of Matthias were bleak.\nAlso in that year, Kepler's wife Barbara contracted Hungarian spotted fever and began having seizures. While she was recovering, all three of their children fell sick with smallpox; six-year-old Friedrich died. As well as his approach to W\u00fcrttemberg, Kepler was in contact with Padua. The University of Padua \u2014 on the recommendation of the departing Galileo \u2014 sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.\nPostponing the move to Linz, Kepler remained in Prague until Rudolf's death in early 1612, though political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate) prevented him from doing any research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, \"Eclogae Chronicae\", from correspondence and earlier work. Upon his succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.\nLinz (1612\u20131630).\nIn Linz, Kepler's primary responsibilities (beyond completing the \"Rudolphine Tables\") were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague\u2014though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was during his time in Linz that Kepler had to deal with the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow, happening only a few years after his excommunication, is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.\nHis first publication in Linz was \"De vero Anno\" (1613), an expanded treatise on the year of Christ's birth. He also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce Pope Gregory's reformed calendar to Protestant German lands. On 30\u00a0October 1613, Kepler married Susanna Reuttinger. Following the death of his first wife Barbara, Kepler had considered 11 different matches over two years (a decision process formalized later as the marriage problem). He eventually returned to Reuttinger (the fifth match) who, he wrote, \"won me over with love, humble loyalty, economy of household, diligence, and the love she gave the stepchildren\". The first three children of this marriage (Margareta Regina, Katharina, and Sebald) died in childhood. Three more survived into adulthood: Cordula (born 1621); Fridmar (born 1623); and Hildebert (born 1625). According to Kepler's biographers, this was a much happier marriage than his first.\nOn 8 October 1630, Kepler set out for Regensburg, hoping to collect interest on work he had done previously. A few days after reaching Regensburg, he became sick and progressively worsened. Kepler died on 15\u00a0November 1630, just over a month after his arrival. He was buried in a Protestant churchyard in Regensburg, which was completely destroyed during the Thirty Years' War.\nChristianity.\nKepler's belief that God created the cosmos in an orderly fashion caused him to attempt to determine and comprehend the laws that govern the natural world, most profoundly in astronomy. The phrase \"I am merely thinking God's thoughts after Him\" has been attributed to him, although this is probably a capsulized version of a writing from his hand:\nThose laws [of nature] are within the grasp of the human mind; God wanted us to recognize them by creating us after his own image so that we could share in his own thoughts.Kepler advocated for tolerance among Christian denominations, for example arguing that Catholics and Lutherans should be able to take communion together. He wrote, \"Christ the Lord neither was nor is Lutheran, nor Calvinist, nor Papist.\"\nAstronomy.\n\"Mysterium Cosmographicum\".\nKepler's first major astronomical work was \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" (\"The Cosmographic Mystery\", 1596). Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on 19 July 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found that each of the five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively\u2014octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube\u2014Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. \nKepler thought the \"Mysterium\" had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about the connection between the physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between them to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of \"Mysterium\" contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism. With the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler received permission from the T\u00fcbingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible exegesis and the addition of a simpler, more understandable, description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas. \"Mysterium\" was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the patronage system.\nIn 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of \"Mysterium\", half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication. In terms of impact, the \"Mysterium\" can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by Copernicus in his \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\". While Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book, he resorted to Ptolemaic devices (viz., epicycles and eccentric circles) in order to explain the change in planets' orbital speed, and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the Earth's orbit rather than that of the Sun \"as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy.\" Modern astronomy owes much to \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\", despite flaws in its main thesis, \"since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it.\" Kepler never abandoned his five solids theory, publishing the second edition of \"Mysterium\" in 1621 and affirming his continued belief in the validity of the model. Although he noted that there were discrepancies between the observational data and his model's predictions, he did not think they were large enough to invalidate the theory.\n\"Astronomia Nova\".\nThe extended line of research that culminated in \"Astronomia Nova\" (\"A New Astronomy\")\u2014including the first two laws of planetary motion\u2014began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of the orbit of Mars. In this work Kepler introduced the revolutionary concept of planetary orbit, a path of a planet in space resulting from the action of physical causes, distinct from previously held notion of planetary orb (a spherical shell to which planet is attached). As a result of this breakthrough astronomical phenomena came to be seen as being governed by physical laws. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars's orbit using an equant (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data.\nIn Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of God the Father) was the source of motive force in the Solar System. As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on William Gilbert's theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from \"De Magnete\" (1600) and on his own work on optics. Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive \"species\") radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it. Using a physical model to derive a trajectory was a major breakthrough. Kepler did not simply assume a circular orbit but attempted to come up with it cause, and did this before discovering the area law Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order. Based on measurements of the aphelion and perihelion of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: \"planets sweep out equal areas in equal times\"\u2014his second law of planetary motion.\nHe then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg-shaped ovoid orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in late 1604 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked. Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data (the Vicarious Hypothesis), Kepler immediately concluded that \"all planets move in ellipses, with the Sun at one focus\"\u2014his first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for \"Astronomia nova\", though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.\n\"Epitome of Copernican Astronomy\".\nSince completing the \"Astronomia Nova\", Kepler had intended to compose an astronomy textbook that would cover all the fundamentals of heliocentric astronomy. Kepler spent the next several years working on what would become \"Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae\" (\"Epitome of Copernican Astronomy\"). Despite its title, which merely hints at heliocentrism, the \"Epitome\" is less about Copernicus's work and more about Kepler's own astronomical system. The \"Epitome\" contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes. Although it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion (applied to Mars in \"Astronomia nova\") to all the planets as well as the Moon and the Medicean satellites of Jupiter, it did not explain how elliptical orbits could be derived from observational data.\nOriginally intended as an introduction for the uninitiated, Kepler sought to model his \"Epitome\" after that of his master Michael Maestlin, who published a well-regarded book explaining the basics of geocentric astronomy to non-experts. Kepler completed the first of three volumes, consisting of Books I\u2013III, by 1615 in the same question-answer format of Maestlin's and have it printed in 1617. However, the banning of Copernican books by the Catholic Church, as well as the start of the Thirty Years' War, meant that publication of the next two volumes would be delayed. In the interim, and to avoid being subject to the ban, Kepler switched the audience of the \"Epitome\" from beginners to that of expert astronomers and mathematicians, as the arguments became more and more sophisticated and required advanced mathematics to be understood. The second volume, consisting of Book IV, was published in 1620, followed by the third volume, consisting of Books V\u2013VII, in 1621.\n\"Rudolphine Tables\".\nIn the years following the completion of \"Astronomia Nova\", most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the \"Rudolphine Tables\" and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table, though neither would be completed for many years.\nKepler, at last, completed the \"Rudolphine Tables\" in 1623, which at the time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627.\nAstrology.\nLike Ptolemy, Kepler considered astrology as the counterpart to astronomy, and as being of equal interest and value. However, in the following years, the two subjects drifted apart until astrology was no longer practiced among professional astronomers.\nSir Oliver Lodge observed that Kepler was somewhat disdainful of astrology in his own day, as he was \"continually attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology, but it was the only thing for which people would pay him, and on it after a fashion he lived. Nonetheless, Kepler spent a huge amount of time trying to restore astrology on a firmer philosophical footing, composing numerous astrological calendars, more than 800 nativities, and a number of treatises dealing with the subject of astrology proper.\n\"De Fundamentis\".\nIn his bid to become imperial astronomer, Kepler wrote \"De Fundamentis\" (1601), whose full title can be translated as \"On Giving Astrology Sounder Foundations\", as a short foreword to one of his yearly almanacs.\nIn this work, Kepler describes the effects of the Sun, Moon, and the planets in terms of their light and their influences upon humors, concluding with Kepler's view that the Earth possesses a soul with some sense of geometry. Stimulated by the geometric convergence of rays formed around it, the world-soul is sentient but not conscious. As a shepherd is pleased by the piping of a flute without understanding the theory of musical harmony, so likewise Earth responds to the angles and aspects made by the heavens but not in a conscious manner. Eclipses are important as omens because the animal faculty of the Earth is violently disturbed by the sudden intermission of light, experiencing something like emotion and persisting in it for some time.\nKepler surmises that the Earth has \"cycles of humors\" as living animals do, and provides as an example: \"the highest tides of the sea are said by sailors to return after nineteen years around the same days of the year\". (This may refer to the 18.6-year lunar node precession cycle.) Kepler advocates searching for such cycles by gathering observations over a period of many years, \"and so far this observation has not been made\".\n\"Tertius Interveniens\".\nKepler and Helisaeus Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter-attacks on the importance of astrology after the supernova of 1604; around the same time, physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular).\nIn response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology, on the one hand, and overzealous rejection of it, on the other, Kepler prepared \"Tertius Interveniens\" (1610). Nominally this work\u2014presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius\u2014was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars (the titled meaning \"Third-party interventions\"), but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the \"evil-smelling dung\" in which \"an industrious hen\" scrapes, there was an \"occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget\" to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer.\nMusic.\n\"Harmonice Mundi\".\nKepler was convinced \"that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world\". In \"Harmonice Mundi\" (1619), he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world\u2014particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects\u2014in terms of music. The central set of \"harmonies\" was the \"musica universalis\" or \"music of the spheres\", which had been studied by Pythagoras, Ptolemy and others before Kepler; in fact, soon after publishing \"Harmonice Mundi\", Kepler was embroiled in a priority dispute with Robert Fludd, who had recently published his own harmonic theory.\nKepler began by exploring regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures that would come to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies\u2014and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler\u2014with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories\u2014treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.\nAmong many other harmonies, Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion. He tried many combinations until he discovered that (approximately) \"\"The square of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances\".\" Although he gives the date of this epiphany (8 March 1618), he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion. However, the wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely kinematical law was not realized until the 1660s. When conjoined with Christiaan Huygens' newly discovered law of centrifugal force, it enabled Isaac Newton, Edmund Halley, and perhaps Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke to demonstrate independently that the presumed gravitational attraction between the Sun and its planets decreased with the square of the distance between them. This refuted the traditional assumption of scholastic physics that the power of gravitational attraction remained constant with distance whenever it applied between two bodies, such as was assumed by Kepler and also by Galileo in his mistaken universal law that gravitational fall is uniformly accelerated, and also by Galileo's student Borrelli in his 1666 celestial mechanics.\nOptics.\n\"Astronomiae Pars Optica\".\nAs Kepler slowly continued analyzing Tycho's Mars observations\u2014now available to him in their entirety\u2014and began the slow process of tabulating the \"Rudolphine Tables\", Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to \"all\" astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on 1 January 1604, was published as \"Astronomiae Pars Optica\" (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the eye's lens onto the retina. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected \"in the hollows of the brain\" due to the \"activity of the Soul.\"\nToday, \"Astronomiae Pars Optica\" is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent). With respect to the beginnings of projective geometry, Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity, thus having the properties of a large circle.\n\"Dioptrice\".\nIn the first months of 1610, Galileo Galilei\u2014using his powerful new telescope\u2014discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter. Upon publishing his account as \"Sidereus Nuncius\" [Starry Messenger], Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations. Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, \"Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo\" [Conversation with the Starry Messenger]. He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology. Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in \"Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus\", providing further support of Galileo. To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to \"Astronomia Nova\".\nKepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic lenses using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne. The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as \"Dioptrice\" in 1611. In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of double-convex converging lenses and double-concave diverging lenses\u2014and how they are combined to produce a Galilean telescope\u2014as well as the concepts of real vs. virtual images, upright vs. inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction. He also described an improved telescope\u2014now known as the \"astronomical\" or \"Keplerian telescope\"\u2014in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo's combination of convex and concave lenses.\nMathematics and physics.\nAs a New Year's gift that year (1611), he also composed for his friend and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled \"Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula\" (\"A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow\"). In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical atomistic physical basis for their symmetry, posed what later became known as the Kepler conjecture, a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres. This important mathematical problem has practical applications in the understanding of crystalline solids; it was formally solved by Thomas Hales in 2017.\nKepler wrote the influential mathematical treatise \"Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum\" in 1613, on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels, which was published in 1615. Kepler also contributed to the development of infinitesimal methods and numerical analysis, including iterative approximations, infinitesimals, and the early use of logarithms and transcendental equations. Kepler's work on calculating volumes of shapes, and on finding the optimal shape of a wine barrel, were significant steps toward the development of calculus. Simpson's rule, an approximation method used in integral calculus, is known in German as \"Keplersche Fassregel\" (Kepler's barrel rule).\nLegacy.\nReception of his astronomy.\nKepler's laws of planetary motion were not immediately accepted. Several major figures such as Galileo and Ren\u00e9 Descartes completely ignored Kepler's \"Astronomia nova\". Many astronomers, including Kepler's teacher, Michael Maestlin, objected to Kepler's introduction of physics into his astronomy. Some adopted compromise positions. Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus accepted elliptical orbits but replaced Kepler's area law with uniform motion in respect to the empty focus of the ellipse, while Seth Ward used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant.\nSeveral astronomers tested Kepler's theory, and its various modifications, against astronomical observations. Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the Sun provided sensitive tests of the theory, under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed. In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631, Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury, and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date. Pierre Gassendi observed the transit on the date predicted, a confirmation of Kepler's prediction. This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury. However, his attempt to observe the transit of Venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables. Gassendi did not realize that it was not visible from most of Europe, including Paris. Jeremiah Horrocks, who observed the 1639 Venus transit, had used his own observations to adjust the parameters of the Keplerian model, predicted the transit, and then built apparatus to observe the transit. He remained a firm advocate of the Keplerian model.\n\"Epitome of Copernican Astronomy\" was read by astronomers throughout Europe, and following Kepler's death, it was the main vehicle for spreading Kepler's ideas. In the period 1630\u20131650, this book was the most widely used astronomy textbook, winning many converts to ellipse-based astronomy. However, few adopted his ideas on the physical basis for celestial motions. In the late 17th century, a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler's work\u2014notably those of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Robert Hooke\u2014began to incorporate attractive forces (though not the quasi-spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler) and the Cartesian concept of inertia. This culminated in Isaac Newton's \"Principia Mathematica\" (1687), in which Newton derived Kepler's laws of planetary motion from a force-based theory of universal gravitation, a mathematical challenge later known as \"solving the Kepler problem\".\nHistory of science.\nBeyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy, Kepler has loomed large in the philosophy and historiography of science. Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla's 1758 \"Histoire des math\u00e9matiques\" and Jean-Baptiste Delambre's 1821 \"Histoire de l'astronomie moderne\". These and other histories written from an Enlightenment perspective treated Kepler's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval, but later Romantic-era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success.\nWilliam Whewell, in his influential \"History of the Inductive Sciences\" of 1837, found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius; in his \"Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences\" of 1840, Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of scientific method. Similarly, Ernst Friedrich Apelt\u2014the first to extensively study Kepler's manuscripts, after their purchase by Catherine the Great\u2014identified Kepler as a key to the \"Revolution of the sciences\".\nApelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, aesthetic sensibility, physical ideas, and theology as part of a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work.\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9's work on Kepler was, after Apelt, the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler's cosmology and its influence. In the 1930s and 1940s, Koyr\u00e9, and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science, described the \"Scientific Revolution\" as the central event in the history of science, and Kepler as a (perhaps the) central figure in the revolution. Koyr\u00e9 placed Kepler's theorization, rather than his empirical work, at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern worldviews. Since the 1960s, the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly, including studies of his astrology and meteorology, his geometrical methods, the role of his religious views in his work, his literary and rhetorical methods, his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time, and even his role as an historian of science.\nPhilosophers of science\u2014such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Norwood Russell Hanson, Stephen Toulmin, and Karl Popper\u2014have repeatedly turned to Kepler: examples of incommensurability, analogical reasoning, falsification, and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler's work. Physicist Wolfgang Pauli even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of analytical psychology on scientific investigation.\nEditions and translations.\nModern translations of a number of Kepler's books appeared in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937 (and is nearing completion in the early 21st century).\nAn edition in eight volumes, \" Kepleri Opera omnia,\" was prepared by Christian Frisch (1807\u20131881), during 1858 to 1871, on the occasion of Kepler's 300th birthday.\nFrisch's edition only included Kepler's Latin, with a Latin commentary.\nA new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856\u20131934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.\nMax Caspar (1880\u20131956) published his German translation of Kepler's \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\" in 1923. Both Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician Alexander von Brill (1842\u20131935). Caspar became Dyck's collaborator, succeeding him as project leader in 1934, establishing the \"Kepler-Kommission\" in the following year. Assisted by Martha List (1908\u20131992) and Franz Hammer (1898\u20131969), Caspar continued editorial work during World War II. Max Caspar also published a biography of Kepler in 1948. The commission was later chaired by Volker Bialas (during 1976\u20132003) and Ulrich Grigull (during 1984\u20131999) and Roland Bulirsch (1998\u20132014).\nCultural influence and eponymy.\nKepler has acquired a popular image as an icon of scientific modernity and a man before his time; science popularizer Carl Sagan described him as \"the first astrophysicist and the last scientific astrologer\". The debate over Kepler's place in the Scientific Revolution has produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments. One of the most influential is Arthur Koestler's 1959 book, ', in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero (morally and theologically, as well as intellectually) of the revolution.\nA well-received historical novel by John Banville, \"Kepler\" (1981), explored many of the themes developed in Koestler's non-fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science. A 2004 nonfiction book, \"Heavenly Intrigue\", speculated that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data. In 2010 Tycho Brahe was exhumed by a Dutch-Czech team and his bones, teeth and beard where analyzed for mercury. The results conclusively eliminate mercury poisoning as a cause of Brahe's death.\nIn Austria, a silver collector's 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin was minted in 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\".\nThe German composer Paul Hindemith wrote an opera about Kepler titled \"Die Harmonie der Welt\" (1957), and during the prolonged process of its creation he concurrently wrote a symphony of the same name based on the musical ideas he had developed for the opera. Hindemith's work inspired John Rodgers and Willie Ruff of Yale University to create a synthesizer composition based on Kepler's scheme for representing planetary motion with music. Philip Glass wrote an opera called \"Kepler\" (2009) based on Kepler's life, with a libretto in German and Latin by Martina Winkel.\nDirectly named for Kepler's contribution to science are: Kepler's laws of planetary motion; Kepler's Supernova SN 1604, which he observed and described; the Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedra (a set of geometrical constructions), two of which were described by him; and the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing. Places and entities named in his honor include multiple city streets and squares, several educational institutions, an asteroid, a lunar crater, and a Martian crater.\nThe Kepler space telescope has observed 530,506 stars and detected 2,778 confirmed planets (as of 2023[ [update]]), many of them named after the telescope and Kepler himself.\nWorks.\nA critical edition of Kepler's collected works (\"Johannes Kepler Gesammelte Werke\", KGW) in 22 volumes is being edited by the \"Kepler-Kommission\" (founded 1935) on behalf of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften.\nVol. 1: \"Mysterium Cosmographicum.

{"id": "15737", "revid": "50772701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15737", "title": "John Bardeen", "text": "American condensed matter physicist (1908\u20131991)\nJohn Bardeen (May 23, 1908 \u2013 January 30, 1991) was an American condensed matter physicist. He is the only person to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics twice: first in 1956 with William Shockley and Walter Brattain for their invention of the transistor; and again in 1972 with Leon Cooper and Robert Schrieffer for their microscopic theory of superconductivity, known as the BCS theory.\nBorn and raised in Wisconsin, Bardeen earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin, before receiving a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University. After serving in World War II, he was a researcher at Bell Labs and a professor at the University of Illinois.\nThe transistor revolutionized the electronics industry, making possible the development of almost every modern electronic device, from telephones to computers, and ushering in the Information Age. Bardeen's developments in superconductivity\u2014for which he was awarded his second Nobel Prize\u2014are used in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and superconducting quantum circuits.\nBardeen is the first of only three people to have won multiple Nobel Prizes in the same category (the others being Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless in chemistry), and one of five persons with . In 1990, Bardeen appeared on \"Life\" magazine's list of \"100 Most Influential Americans of the Century.\"\nEducation.\nJohn Bardeen was born on May 23, 1908, in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Charles Russell Bardeen, the first dean of the University of Wisconsin Medical School, and Althea Harmer.\nBardeen attended University of Wisconsin High School in Madison, graduating in 1923 at age 15; he could have graduated several years earlier, but this was postponed because he took courses at another high school and because of his mother's death. Bardeen entered the University of Wisconsin in 1923. While in college, he joined the Zeta Psi fraternity. He raised a part of the needed membership fees by playing billiards. Bardeen was initiated as a member of Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society. Not wanting to be an academic like his father, Bardeen chose engineering. He also felt that engineering had good job prospects.\nBardeen received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1928 from the University of Wisconsin. Despite taking a year off to work in Chicago, he graduated in 1928. Taking all the graduate courses in physics and mathematics that had interested him, Bardeen graduated in five years instead of the usual four. This allowed him time to complete his master's thesis, supervised by Leo J. Peters. He received his M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1929 from Wisconsin.\nBardeen furthered his studies by staying on at Wisconsin, but he eventually went to work for Gulf Research Laboratories, the research arm of the Gulf Oil Corporation that was based in Pittsburgh. From 1930 to 1933, Bardeen worked there on the development of methods for the interpretation of magnetic and gravitational surveys. He worked as a geophysicist. After the work failed to keep his interest, he applied and was accepted to the graduate program in mathematics at Princeton University.\nAs a graduate student, Bardeen studied mathematics and physics. Under the physicist Eugene Wigner, he wrote his thesis on a problem in solid-state physics. Before completing his thesis, he was offered a position as junior fellow of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University in 1935. He spent the next three years there, from 1935 to 1938, working with to-be Nobel laureates in Physics John Hasbrouck van Vleck and Percy Williams Bridgman on problems in cohesion and electrical conduction in metals\u2014and also did some work on level density of nuclei. He received his Ph.D. in Mathematical Physics from Princeton in 1936.\nCareer.\nFrom 1941 to 1944, Bardeen headed the group working on magnetic mines and torpedoes and mine and torpedo countermeasures at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. During this period, his wife Jane gave birth to a son (Bill, born in 1941) and a daughter (Betsy, born in 1944).\nBell Laboratories.\nIn October 1945, Bardeen began work at Bell Laboratories as a member of a solid-state physics group led by William Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan. Other personnel working in the group were Walter Brattain, physicist Gerald Pearson, chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore and several technicians. He moved his family to Summit, New Jersey.\nThe assignment of the group was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers. Their first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity. These experiments mysteriously failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states, meeting almost daily to discuss the work. The rapport of the group was excellent and ideas were freely exchanged. By the winter of 1946, they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to \"Physical Review\". Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments. The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily and suggested that they use \"glycol borate\" (gu), a viscous chemical that did not evaporate. Finally, they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley, put a voltage on a droplet of gu placed across a p\u2013n junction.\nUniversity of Illinois.\nBy 1951, Bardeen was looking for a new job. Fred Seitz, a friend of Bardeen, convinced the University of Illinois to make Bardeen an offer of $10,000 a year. Bardeen accepted the offer and left Bell Labs, joining the engineering and physics faculties at Illinois in 1951, where he was Professor of Electrical Engineering and Professor of Physics.\nAt Illinois, he established two major research programs, one in the electrical engineering department and one in the physics department. The research program in the electrical engineering department dealt with both experimental and theoretical aspects of semiconductors, and the research program in the physics department dealt with theoretical aspects of macroscopic quantum systems, particularly superconductivity and quantum liquids.\nHe was an active professor at Illinois from 1951 to 1975 and then became \"professor emeritus\". In his later life, Bardeen remained active in academic research, during which time he focused on understanding the flow of electrons in charge density waves (CDWs) through metallic linear chain compounds. His proposals that CDW electron transport is a collective quantum phenomenon (see Macroscopic quantum phenomena) were initially greeted with skepticism. However, experiments reported in 2012 show oscillations in CDW current versus magnetic flux through tantalum trisulfide rings, similar to the behavior of superconducting quantum interference devices (see SQUID and Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect), lending credence to the idea that collective CDW electron transport is fundamentally quantum in nature. (See quantum mechanics.) Bardeen continued his research throughout the 1980s, and published articles in \"Physical Review Letters\" and \"Physics Today\" less than a year before he died.\nA collection of Bardeen's personal papers are held by the University of Illinois Archives.\nResearch.\nInvention of the transistor.\nOn December 23, 1947, Bardeen and Walter Brattain were working without William Shockley when they succeeded in creating a point-contact transistor that achieved amplification. By the next month, Bell Labs' patent attorneys started to work on the patent applications.\nBell Labs' attorneys soon discovered that Shockley's field effect principle had been anticipated and patented in 1930 by Julius Lilienfeld, who filed his MESFET-like patent in Canada on October 22, 1925.\nShockley publicly took the lion's share of the credit for the invention of the transistor; this led to a deterioration of Bardeen's relationship with him. Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Shockley eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, essentially blocking the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group. Neither Bardeen nor Brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention.\nThe \"transistor\" (a portmanteau of \"transconductance\" and \"resistor\") was 1/50 the size of the vacuum tubes it replaced in televisions and radios, used far less power, was far more reliable, and it allowed electrical devices to become more compact.\nIn 1956, Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect.\"\nBCS theory.\nIn 1957, Bardeen, in collaboration with Leon Cooper and his doctoral student John Robert Schrieffer, proposed the standard theory of superconductivity known as the BCS theory (named for their initials).\nIn 1972, Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their jointly developed theory of superconductivity, usually called the BCS theory.\" This was Bardeen's second Nobel Prize in Physics; he became the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in the same field.\nIn the late 1960s, Bardeen felt that Cooper and Schrieffer deserved the Nobel Prize for BCS. He was concerned that they might not be awarded because of the Nobel Committee's reluctance to award the same person twice, which would be his case as a co-author of the theory. Bardeen nominated scientists who worked on superconducting tunneling effects such as the Josephson effect for the Prize in 1967: Leo Esaki, Ivar Giaever, and Brian Josephson. He recognized that because the tunneling developments depended on superconductivity, it would increase the chances that BCS itself would be awarded first. He also reasoned that the Nobel Committee had a predilection for multinational teams, which was the case for his tunneling nominees, each being from a different country. Bardeen renewed the nominations in 1971, 1972, when BCS received the prize, and finally 1973, when tunneling was awarded.230-231\nJosephson effect controversy.\nBardeen became interested in superconducting tunneling in the summer of 1960 after consulting for the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, where he learned about experiments done by Ivar Giaever at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, which suggested that electrons from a normal material could tunnel into a superconducting one.\nOn June 8, 1962, Brian Josephson, then 23, submitted to \"Physics Letters\" his prediction of a super-current flow across a barrier, effect which later became known as the Josephson effect. Bardeen challenged Josephson's theory on a note in his own paper received ten days later by \"Physical Review Letters\":\nIn a recent note, Josephson uses a somewhat similar formulation to discuss the possibility of superfluid flow across the tunneling region, in which no quasi-particles are created. However, as pointed out by the author (reference 3), pairing does not extend into the barrier, so that there can be no such superfluid flow.\nThe matter was further discussed on the 8th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics held September 16 to 22, 1962 at Queen Mary University of London. While Josephson was presenting his theory, Bardeen rose to describe his objections. After an intense debate both men were unable to reach a common understanding, and at points Josephson repeatedly asked Bardeen, \"Did you calculate it? No? I did.\"\nIn 1963, experimental evidence and further theoretical clarifications were discovered supporting the Josephson effect, notably in a paper by Philip W. Anderson and John Rowell from Bell Labs. After this, Bardeen came to accept Josephson's theory and publicly withdrew his previous opposition to it at a conference held in August 1963. Bardeen also invited Josephson as a postdoc in Illinois for the academic year of 1965\u20131966, and later nominated Josephson and Giaever for the Nobel Prize in Physics, which they received in 1973.\nPersonal life.\nWhile studying at Princeton, Bardeen met Jane Maxwell (1907\u20131997) during a visit to his old friends in Pittsburgh. He married Jane on July 18, 1938.\nBardeen was a scientist with a very unassuming personality. While he served as a professor for almost 40 years at the University of Illinois, he was best remembered by neighbors for hosting cookouts where he would prepare food for his friends, many of whom were unaware of his accomplishments at the university. He would always ask his guests if they liked the hamburger bun toasted (since he liked his that way). He enjoyed playing golf and going on picnics with his family. Lillian Hoddeson said that because he \"differed radically from the popular stereotype of 'genius' and was uninterested in appearing other than ordinary, the public and the media often overlooked him.\"\nWhen Bardeen was asked about his beliefs during a 1988 interview, he responded: \"I am not a religious person, and so do not think about it very much\". However, he has also said: \"I feel that science cannot provide an answer to the ultimate questions about the meaning and purpose of life.\" Bardeen did believe in a code of moral values and behavior. John Bardeen's children were taken to church by his wife, who taught Sunday school and was a church elder. Despite this, he and his wife made it clear that they did not have faith in an afterlife and other religious ideas. He was the father of James M. Bardeen, William A. Bardeen, and daughter Elizabeth.\nBardeen died of heart disease on January 30, 1991, at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 82. Although he lived in Champaign-Urbana, he had come to Boston for medical consultation. Bardeen and his wife Jane are buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin.\nRecognition.\nAwards.\nBardeen is the only double laureate in Physics, and one of three of the same prize; the others are Frederick Sanger who won the 1958 and 1980 Prizes in Chemistry and Karl Barry Sharpless who won the 2001 and 2022 Prizes in Chemistry.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNear the end of this decade, when they begin enumerating the names of the people who had the greatest impact on the 20th century, the name of John Bardeen, who died last week, has to be near, or perhaps even arguably at, the top of the list ... Mr. Bardeen shared two Nobel Prizes and has been awarded numerous other honors. But what greater honor can there be when each of us can look all around us and everywhere see the reminders of a man whose genius has made our lives longer, healthier and better.\n \u2014\"Chicago Tribune\" editorial, February 3, 1991\nIn honor of Bardeen, the engineering quadrangle at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign is named the Bardeen Quad.\nAlso in honor of Bardeen, Sony Corporation endowed a $3\u00a0million John Bardeen professorial chair at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, beginning in 1990. Sony Corporation owed much of its success to commercializing Bardeen's transistors in portable TVs and radios, and had worked with Illinois researchers. As of 2022[ [update]], the John Bardeen Professor is Yurii Vlasov.\nAt the time of Bardeen's death, then-University of Illinois chancellor Morton Weir said, \"It is a rare person whose work changes the life of every American; John's did.\"\nBardeen was honored on a March 6, 2008, United States postage stamp as part of the \"American Scientists\" series designed by artist Victor Stabin. The $0.41 stamp was unveiled in a ceremony at the University of Illinois. His citation reads: \"Theoretical physicist John Bardeen (1908\u20131991) shared the Nobel Prize in Physics twice\u2014in 1956, as co-inventor of the transistor and in 1972, for the explanation of superconductivity. The transistor paved the way for all modern electronics, from computers to microchips. Diverse applications of superconductivity include infrared sensors and medical imaging systems.\" The other scientists on the \"American Scientists\" sheet include biochemist Gerty Cori, chemist Linus Pauling and astronomer Edwin Hubble.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From a Western perspective, the term is restricted to durable ornaments, excluding flowers for example. For many centuries, metals such as gold and silver, often combined with gemstones, has been the normal material for jewellery. Other materials such as glass, shells, or wood may also be used.\nJewellery is one of the oldest types of archaeological artefact \u2013 with 100,000-year-old beads made from \"Nassarius\" shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery. The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.\nJewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. Gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral, precious metals, beads, and shells have been widely used, and enamel has often been important. In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings, and even genital jewellery. In modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture. Jewellery that is designed to be worn for long periods, is difficult to remove, or is always worn is called permanent jewellery.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"jewellery\" itself is derived from the word \"jewel\", which was anglicised from the Old French \"\"jouel\", and beyond that, to the Latin word \"jocale\"\", meaning plaything. In British English, Indian English, New Zealand English, Hiberno-English, Australian English, and South African English it is spelled \"jewellery.\" At the same time, the spelling is \"jewelry\" in American English. Both are used in Canadian English. However, \"jewellery\" prevails by a two-to-one margin. In French and a few other European languages the equivalent term, \"joaillerie\", may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as \"objets d'art\" and church items, not just objects worn on the person.\nForm and function.\nHumans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons:\nMost cultures at some point have had a practice of keeping large amounts of wealth stored in the form of jewellery. Numerous cultures store wedding dowries in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins. Alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good to buy and sell, an example being the use of slave beads.\nMany items of jewellery, such as brooches and buckles, originated as purely functional items, but evolved into decorative items as their functional requirement diminished. Similarly, Tiffany &amp; Co. produced inkwells in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, skillfully combining materials like enamel and fine metals, reflecting the same craftsmanship seen in their jewellery collections. These inkwells were not only practical but also artistic in design.\nJewellery can symbolise group membership (as in the case, of the Christian crucifix or the Jewish Star of David) or status (as in the case of chains of office, or the Western practice of married people wearing wedding rings).\nWearing of amulets and devotional medals to provide protection or to ward off evil is common in some cultures. These may take the form of symbols (such as the ankh), stones, plants, animals, body parts (such as the Khamsa), or glyphs (such as stylised versions of the Throne Verse in Islamic art).\nMaterials and methods.\nIn creating jewellery, gemstones, coins, or other precious items are often used, and they are typically set into precious metals. Platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually sterling silver, or 92.5% fine silver. In costume jewellery, stainless steel findings are sometimes used.\nOther commonly used materials include glass, such as fused-glass or enamel; wood, often carved or turned; shells and other natural animal substances such as bone and ivory; natural clay; polymer clay; Hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give a British Assay office (the body which gives U.K. jewellery its stamp of approval, the Hallmark) the right to destroy the piece, however, it is very rare for the assay office to do so.\nBeads are frequently used in jewellery. These may be made of glass, gemstones, metal, wood, shells, clay and polymer clay. Beaded jewellery commonly encompasses necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts and rings. Beads may be large or small; the smallest type of beads used are known as seed beads, these are the beads used for the \"woven\" style of beaded jewellery. Seed beads are also used in an embroidery technique where they are sewn onto fabric backings to create broad collar neck pieces and beaded bracelets. Bead embroidery, a popular type of handwork during the Victorian era, is enjoying a renaissance in modern jewellery making. Beading, or beadwork, is also very popular in many African and indigenous North American cultures.\nSilversmiths, goldsmiths, and lapidaries use methods including forging, casting, soldering or welding, cutting, carving and \"cold-joining\" (using adhesives, staples and rivets to assemble parts).\nDiamonds.\nDiamonds were first mined in India. Pliny may have mentioned them, although there is some debate as to the exact nature of the stone he referred to as \"Adamas\". In 2005, Australia, Botswana, Russia and Canada ranked among the primary sources of gemstone diamond production. There are negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas. Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and other nations have been labeled as blood diamonds when they are mined in a war zone and sold to finance an insurgency.\nNow popular in engagement rings, the use of diamonds in jewellery dates back to the marriage of Maximilian I to Mary of Burgundy in 1477. A popular style is the diamond solitaire, which features a single large diamond mounted prominently. Within solitaire, there are three categories in which a ring can be classified: prong, bezel and tension setting.\nThe British crown jewels contain the Cullinan Diamond, part of the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found (1905), at 3,106.75 carats (621.35 g).\nOther gemstones.\nMany precious and semiprecious stones are used for jewellery.\nSome gemstones (like pearls, coral, and amber) are classified as organic, meaning that they are produced by living organisms. Others are inorganic, meaning that they are generally composed of and arise from minerals.\nSome gems, for example, amethyst, have become less valued as methods of extracting and importing them have progressed. Some man-made gems can serve in place of natural gems, such as cubic zirconia, which can be used in place of diamonds.\nMetal finishes.\nFor platinum, gold, and silver jewellery, there are many techniques to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. High-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving \"brush strokes\". Hammered finishes are typically created using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture.\nSome jewellery is plated to give it a shiny, reflective look or to achieve a desired colour. Sterling silver jewellery may be plated with a thin layer of 0.999 fine silver (a process known as flashing) or plated with rhodium or gold. Base metal costume jewellery may also be plated with silver, gold, or rhodium for a more attractive finish.\nImpact on society.\nJewellery has been used to denote status. In ancient Rome, only certain ranks could wear rings and later, sumptuary laws dictated who could wear what type of jewellery. This was also based on the rank of the citizens of that time.\nCultural dictates have also played a significant role. For example, the wearing of earrings by Western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. More recently, the display of body jewellery, such as piercings, has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. Likewise, hip hop culture has popularised the slang term bling-bling, which refers to the ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.\nConversely, the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise wedding rings for men, which caught on, as well as engagement rings for men, which did not, going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots. By the mid-1940s, 85% of weddings in the U.S. featured a double-ring ceremony, up from 15% in the 1920s.\nSome religions have specific rules or traditions surrounding jewellery (or even prohibiting it) and many religions have edicts against excessive display. Islam, for instance, considers the wearing of gold by men as Haraam. The majority of Islamic jewellery was in the form of bridal dowries, and traditionally was not handed down from generation to generation; instead, on a woman's death it was sold at the souk and recycled or sold to passers-by. Islamic jewellery from before the 19th century is thus exceedingly rare.\nHistory.\nThe history of jewellery is long and goes back many years, with many different uses among different cultures. It has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient cultures worked.\nPrehistory.\nThe earliest known Jewellery was actually created not by modern humans (\"Homo sapiens\") but by Neanderthal living in Europe. Specifically, perforated beads made from small seashells have been found dating to 115,000 years ago in the Cueva de los Aviones, a cave along the southeast coast of Spain. Later in Kenya, at Enkapune Ya Muto, beads made from perforated ostrich eggshells have been dated to more than 40,000 years ago. In Russia, a stone bracelet and marble ring are attributed to a similar age.\nLater, the European early modern humans had crude necklaces and bracelets of bone, teeth, berries, and stone hung on pieces of string or animal sinew, or pieces of carved bone used to secure clothing together. In some cases, jewellery had shell or mother-of-pearl pieces. A decorated engraved pendant (the Star Carr Pendant) dating to around 11,000 BC, and thought to be the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site of Star Carr in North Yorkshire in 2015. In southern Russia, carved bracelets made of mammoth tusk have been found. The Venus of Hohle Fels features a perforation at the top, showing that it was intended to be worn as a pendant.\nAround seven thousand years ago, the first sign of copper jewellery was seen. In October 2012, the Museum of Ancient History in Lower Austria revealed that they had found a grave of a female jewellery worker \u2013 forcing archaeologists to take a fresh look at prehistoric gender roles after it appeared to be that of a female fine metal worker \u2013 a profession that was previously thought to have been carried out exclusively by men.\nAfrica.\nEgypt.\nThe first signs of established jewellery making in Ancient Egypt was around 3,000\u20135,000 years ago. The Egyptians preferred the luxury, rarity, and workability of gold over other metals. In Predynastic Egypt jewellery soon began to symbolise political and religious power in the community. Although it was worn by wealthy Egyptians in life, it was also worn by them in death, with jewellery commonly placed among grave goods.\nIn conjunction with gold jewellery, Egyptians used coloured glass, along with semi-precious gems. The colour of the jewellery had significance. Green, for example, symbolised fertility. Lapis lazuli and silver had to be imported from beyond the country's borders.\nEgyptian designs were most common in Phoenician jewellery. Also, ancient Turkish designs found in Persian jewellery suggest that trade between the Middle East and Europe was not uncommon. Women wore elaborate gold and silver pieces that were used in ceremonies.\nMaghreb countries in North Africa.\nJewellery of the Berber cultures is a style of traditional jewellery worn by women and girls in the rural areas of the Maghreb region in North Africa inhabited by indigenous Berber people (in Berber language: \"Amazigh, Imazighen\", pl). Following long social and cultural traditions, the silversmiths of different ethnic Berber groups of Morocco, Algeria and neighbouring countries created intricate jewellery to adorn their women and that formed part of their ethnic identity. Traditional Berber jewellery was usually made of silver and includes elaborate brooches made of triangular plates and pins (fibula), originally used as clasps for garments, but also necklaces, bracelets, earrings and similar items.\nAnother major type is the so-called \"khmissa\" (local pronunciation of the Arabic word \"khamsa\" for the number \"five\"), which is called \"afus\" in the Berber language (\"Tamazight)\". This form represents the five fingers of the hand and is traditionally believed both by Muslims as well as Jewish people to protect against the evil eye.\nEurope and the Middle East.\nThe first gold jewellery from Bulgaria.\nThe oldest gold jewellery in the world is dating from 4,600 BC to 4,200 BC and was discovered in Europe, at the site of Varna Necropolis, near the Black Sea coast in Bulgaria.\nMesopotamia.\nBy approximately 5,000 years ago, jewellery-making had become a significant craft in the cities of Mesopotamia. The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, where hundreds of burials dating 2900\u20132300 BC were unearthed; tombs such as that of Puabi contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as lapis lazuli crowns embellished with gold figurines, close-fitting collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In Assyria, men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including amulets, ankle bracelets, heavy multi-strand necklaces, and cylinder seals.\nJewellery in Mesopotamia tended to be manufactured from thin metal leaf and was set with large numbers of brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, carnelian, and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as cloisonn\u00e9, engraving, fine granulation, and filigree.\nExtensive and meticulously maintained records pertaining to the trade and manufacture of jewellery have also been unearthed throughout Mesopotamian archaeological sites. One record in the Mari royal archives, for example, gives the composition of various items of jewellery: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;* 1 necklace of flat speckled chalcedony beads including: 34 flat speckled chalcedony bead, [and] 35 gold fluted beads, in groups of five.\nGreece.\nThe Greeks started using gold and gems in jewellery in 1600 BC, although beads shaped as shells and animals were produced widely in earlier times. Around 1500 BC, the main techniques of working gold in Greece included casting, twisting bars, and making wire. Many of these sophisticated techniques were popular in the Mycenaean period, but unfortunately this skill was lost at the end of the Bronze Age. The forms and shapes of jewellery in ancient Greece such as the armring (13th century BC), brooch (10th century BC) and pins (7th century BC), have varied widely since the Bronze Age as well. Other forms of jewellery include wreaths, earrings, necklace and bracelets. A good example of the high quality that gold working techniques could achieve in Greece is the 'Gold Olive Wreath' (4th century BC), which is modelled on the type of wreath given as a prize for winners in athletic competitions like the Olympic Games. Jewellery dating from 600 to 475 BC is not well represented in the archaeological record, but after the Persian wars the quantity of jewellery again became more plentiful. One particularly popular type of design at this time was a bracelet decorated with snake and animal-heads. Because these bracelets used considerably more metal, many examples were made from bronze. By 300 BC, the Greeks had mastered making coloured jewellery and using amethysts, pearl, and emeralds. Also, the first signs of cameos appeared, with the Greeks creating them from Indian Sardonyx, a striped brown pink and cream agate stone. Greek jewellery was often simpler than in other cultures, with simple designs and workmanship. However, as time progressed, the designs grew in complexity and different materials were soon used.\nJewellery in Greece was hardly worn and was mostly used for public appearances or on special occasions. It was frequently given as a gift and was predominantly worn by women to show their wealth, social status, and beauty. The jewellery was often supposed to give the wearer protection from the \"evil eye\" or endowed the owner with supernatural powers, while others had a religious symbolism. Older pieces of jewellery that have been found were dedicated to the Gods.\nThey worked two styles of pieces: cast pieces and pieces hammered out of sheet metal. Fewer pieces of cast jewellery have been recovered. It was made by casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds. The two-halves were then joined, and wax, followed by molten metal, was placed in the centre. This technique had been practised since the late Bronze Age. The more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type. Sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together. The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work. Different techniques, such as using a stamp or engraving, were then used to create motifs on the jewellery. Jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface.\nThe Greeks took much of their designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when Alexander the Great conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European influences can also be detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous polychrome butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near Olbia, with only one example ever found anywhere else.\nEtruscan.\nGorgons, pomegranates, acorns, lotus flowers and palms were a clear indicator of Greek influence in Etruscan jewellery. The modelling of heads, which was a typical practice from the Greek severe period, was a technique that spread throughout the Etruscan territory. An even clearer evidence of new influences is the shape introduced in the Orientalising era: The Bullae. A pear-shaped vessel used to hold perfume. Its surface was usually decorated with repouss\u00e9 and engraved symbolic figures.\nMuch of the jewellery found was not \"worn\" by Etruscans, but were made to accompany them in the after world. Most, if not all, techniques of Etruscan goldsmiths were not invented by them as they are dated to the third millennium BC.\nRome.\nAlthough jewellery work was abundantly diverse in earlier times, especially among the tribes such as the Celts, when the Romans conquered most of Europe, jewellery was changed as smaller factions developed the Roman designs. The most common artefact of early Rome was the brooch, which was used to secure clothing together. The Romans used a diverse range of materials for their jewellery from their extensive resources across the continent. Although they used gold, they sometimes used bronze or bone, and in earlier times, glass beads and pearl. As early as 2,000 years ago, they imported Sri Lankan sapphires and Indian diamonds and used emeralds and amber in their jewellery. In Roman-ruled England, fossilised wood called jet from Northern England was often carved into pieces of jewellery. The early Italians worked in crude gold and created clasps, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. They also produced larger pendants that could be filled with perfume.\nLike the Greeks, often the purpose of Roman jewellery was to ward off the \"evil eye\" given by other people. Although women wore a vast array of jewellery, men often only wore a finger ring. Although they were expected to wear at least one ring, some Roman men wore a ring on every finger, while others wore none. Roman men and women wore rings with an engraved gem on it that was used with wax to seal documents, a practice that continued into medieval times when kings and noblemen used the same method. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the jewellery designs were absorbed by neighbouring countries and tribes.\nMiddle Ages.\nPost-Roman Europe continued to develop jewellery making skills. The Celts and Merovingians in particular are noted for their jewellery, which in terms of quality matched or exceeded that of the Byzantine Empire. Clothing fasteners, amulets, and, to a lesser extent, signet rings, are the most common artefacts known to us. A particularly striking Celtic example is the Tara Brooch. The Torc was common throughout Europe as a symbol of status and power. By the 8th century, jewelled weaponry was common for men, while other jewellery (with the exception of signet rings) seemed to become the domain of women. Grave goods found in a 6th\u20137th century burial near Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne are illustrative. A young girl was buried with: 2 silver fibulae, a necklace (with coins), bracelet, gold earrings, a pair of hair-pins, comb, and buckle. The Celts specialised in continuous patterns and designs, while Merovingian designs are best known for stylised animal figures. They were not the only groups known for high quality work. Note the Visigoth work shown here, and the numerous decorative objects found at the Anglo-Saxon Ship burial at Sutton Hoo Suffolk, England are a particularly well-known example. On the continent, cloisonn\u00e9 and garnet were perhaps the quintessential method and gemstone of the period. In the 15th century, characteristic English jewellery types, such as golden signets and niello rings, became prominent. These pieces were often adorned with tiny figures of saints and intricate floral patterns, rivaling continental designs in craftsmanship.\nThe Eastern successor of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, continued many of the methods of the Romans, though religious themes came to predominate. Unlike the Romans, the Franks, and the Celts, however, Byzantium used light-weight gold leaf rather than solid gold, and more emphasis was placed on stones and gems. As in the West, Byzantine jewellery was worn by wealthier females, with male jewellery apparently restricted to signet rings. Woman's jewellery had some peculiarities like kolts that decorated headband.\nLike other contemporary cultures, jewellery was commonly buried with its owner.\nRenaissance.\nThe Renaissance and exploration both had significant impacts on the development of jewellery in Europe. By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability of a wide variety of gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the Cheapside Hoard, the stock of a jeweller hidden in London during the Commonwealth period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian emerald, topaz, amazonite from Brazil, spinel, iolite, and chrysoberyl from Sri Lanka, ruby from India, Afghan lapis lazuli, Persian turquoise, Red Sea peridot, as well as Bohemian and Hungarian opal, garnet, and amethyst. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings. Notable among merchants of the period was Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who brought the precursor stone of the Hope Diamond to France in the 1660s.\nWhen Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned as Emperor of the French in 1804, he revived the style and grandeur of jewellery and fashion in France. Under Napoleon's rule, jewellers introduced \"parures\", suites of matching jewellery, such as a diamond tiara, diamond earrings, diamond rings, a diamond brooch, and a diamond necklace. Both of Napoleon's wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly. Another fashion trend resurrected by Napoleon was the cameo. Soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen, cameos were highly sought. The period also saw the early stages of costume jewellery, with fish scale covered glass beads in place of pearls or conch shell cameos instead of stone cameos. New terms were coined to differentiate the arts: jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called \"bijoutiers\", while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called \"joailliers\", a practice which continues to this day.\nRomanticism.\nStarting in the late 18th century, Romanticism had a profound impact on the development of western jewellery. Perhaps the most significant influences were the public's fascination with the treasures being discovered through the birth of modern archaeology and a fascination with Medieval and Renaissance art. Changing social conditions and the onset of the Industrial Revolution also led to growth of a middle class that wanted and could afford jewellery. As a result, the use of industrial processes, cheaper alloys, and stone substitutes led to the development of paste or costume jewellery. Distinguished goldsmiths continued to flourish, however, as wealthier patrons sought to ensure that what they wore still stood apart from the jewellery of the masses, not only through use of precious metals and stones but also though superior artistic and technical work. One such artist was the French goldsmith Fran\u00e7ois-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Froment-Meurice. A category unique to this period and quite appropriate to the philosophy of romanticism was mourning jewellery. It originated in England, where Queen Victoria was often seen wearing jet jewellery after the death of Prince Albert, and it allowed the wearer to continue wearing jewellery while expressing a state of mourning at the death of a loved one.\nIn the United States, this period saw the founding in 1837 of Tiffany &amp; Co. by Charles Lewis Tiffany. Tiffany's put the United States on the world map in terms of jewellery and gained fame creating dazzling commissions for people such as the wife of Abraham Lincoln. Later, it would gain popular notoriety as the setting of the film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\". In France, Pierre Cartier founded Cartier SA in 1847, while 1884 saw the founding of Bulgari in Italy. The modern production studio had been born and was a step away from the former dominance of individual craftsmen and patronage.\nThis period also saw the first major collaboration between East and West. Collaboration in Pforzheim between German and Japanese artists led to Shakud\u014d plaques set into Filigree frames being created by the Stoeffler firm in 1885. Perhaps the grand final\u00e9 \u2013 and an appropriate transition to the following period \u2013 were the masterful creations of the Russian artist Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9, working for the Imperial Russian court, whose Faberg\u00e9 eggs and jewellery pieces are still considered as the epitome of the goldsmith's art.\n18th century/Romanticism/Renaissance.\nMany whimsical fashions were introduced in the extravagant eighteenth century. Cameos that were used in connection with jewellery were the attractive trinkets along with many of the small objects such as brooches, ear-rings and scarf-pins. Some of the necklets were made of several pieces joined with the gold chains were in and bracelets were also made sometimes to match the necklet and the brooch. At the end of the Century the jewellery with cut steel intermixed with large crystals was introduced by an Englishman, Matthew Boulton of Birmingham.\nArt Nouveau.\nIn the 1890s, jewellers began to explore the potential of the growing Art Nouveau style and the closely related German Jugendstil, British (and to some extent American) Arts and Crafts Movement, Catalan Modernisme, Austro-Hungarian Sezession, Italian \"Liberty\", etc.\nArt Nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour, most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille, champleve, cloisonn\u00e9, and plique-\u00e0-jour. Motifs included orchids, irises, pansies, vines, swans, peacocks, snakes, dragonflies, mythological creatures, and the female silhouette.\nRen\u00e9 Lalique, working for the Paris shop of Samuel Bing, was recognised by contemporaries as a leading figure in this trend. The Darmstadt Artists' Colony and Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend, while in Denmark Georg Jensen, though best known for his Silverware, also contributed significant pieces. In England, Liberty &amp; Co., (notably through the Cymric designs of Archibald Knox) and the British arts and crafts movement of Charles Robert Ashbee contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs. The new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself. Lalique's dragonfly design is one of the best examples of this. Enamels played a large role in technique, while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature.\nThe end of World War I once again changed public attitudes, and a more sober style developed.\nArt Deco.\nGrowing political tensions, the after-effects of the war, and a reaction against the perceived decadence of the turn of the 20th century led to simpler forms, combined with more effective manufacturing for mass production of high-quality jewellery. Covering the period of the 1920s and 1930s, the style has become popularly known as Art Deco. Walter Gropius and the German Bauhaus movement, with their philosophy of \"no barriers between artists and craftsmen\" led to some interesting and stylistically simplified forms. Modern materials were also introduced: plastics and aluminium were first used in jewellery, and of note are the chromed pendants of Russian-born Bauhaus master Naum Slutzky. Technical mastery became as valued as the material itself. In the West, this period saw the reinvention of granulation by the German Elizabeth Treskow, although development of the re-invention has continued into the 1990s. It is based on the basic shapes.\nAsia.\nIn Asia, the Indian subcontinent has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery making anywhere, Asia was the first place where these jewellery were made in large numbers for the royals with a history of over 5,000 years. One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the Indus Valley civilisation, in what is now predominately modern-day Pakistan and part of northern and western India. Early jewellery making in China started around the same period, but it became widespread with the spread of Buddhism around 2,000 years ago.\nChina.\nThe Chinese used silver in their jewellery more than gold. Blue kingfisher feathers were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs. However, jade was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty. The first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved. Jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries BC show evidence of having been worked with a compound milling machine, hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west.\nIn China, the most uncommon piece of jewellery is the earring, which was worn neither by men nor women. In modern times, earrings are still considered culturally taboo for men in China\u2014in fact, in 2019, the Chinese video streaming service iQiyi began blurring the ears of male actors wearing earrings. Amulets were common, often with a Chinese symbol or dragon. Dragons, Chinese symbols, and phoenixes were frequently depicted on jewellery designs.\nThe Chinese often placed their jewellery in their graves. Most Chinese graves found by archaeologists contain decorative jewellery.\nIndian subcontinent.\nThe Indian subcontinent has a long jewellery history, which has gone through various changes via cultural influence and politics for more than 5,000\u20138,000 years. Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years. One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the Indus Valley civilisation. By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic bangles. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the bead trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the family. Children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.\nJewellery in the Indus Valley Civilisation was worn predominantly by females, who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists. They were often shaped like doughnuts and painted black. Over time, clay bangles were discarded for more durable ones. In present-day India, bangles are made out of metal or glass. Other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead, earrings, primitive brooches, chokers, and gold rings. Although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the Indus Valley wore beads. Small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and women's hair. The beads were about one millimetre long.\nA female skeleton (presently on display at the National Museum, New Delhi, India) wears a carlinean bangle (bracelet) on her left hand. \"Kada\" is a special kind of bracelet and is widely popular in Indian culture. They symbolise animals such as peacock, elephant, etc.\nAccording to Hindu belief, gold and silver are considered as sacred metals. Gold is symbolic of the warm sun, while silver suggests the cool moon. Both are the quintessential metals of Indian jewellery. Pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time, which is why Hindu tradition associates gold with immortality. Gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient Indian literature. In the Vedic Hindu belief of cosmological creation, the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb (hiranyagarbha) or egg (hiranyanda), a metaphor of the sun, whose light rises from the primordial waters.\nJewellery had great status with India's royalty; it was so powerful that they established laws, limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty. Only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet. This would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals. Even though the majority of the Indian population wore jewellery, Maharajas and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery. The Maharaja's role was so important that the Hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world. He was considered as a divine being, a deity in human form, whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma, the moral order of the universe. The largest ever single order to Cartier was made in 1925 by the Indian royalty, the Maharaja of Patiala, for the Patiala Necklace and other jewellery worth million ().\nNavaratna (nine gems) is a powerful jewel frequently worn by a Maharaja (Emperor). It is an amulet, which comprises diamond, pearl, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, cat's eye, coral, and hyacinth (red zircon). Each of these stones is associated with a celestial deity, representing the totality of the Hindu universe when all nine gems are together. The diamond is the most powerful gem among the nine stones. There were various cuts for the gemstone. Indian Kings bought gemstones privately from the sellers. Maharaja and other royal family members value gem as Hindu God. They exchanged gems with people to whom they were very close, especially the royal family members and other intimate allies.\nIndia was the first country to mine diamonds, with some mines dating back to 296 BC. India traded the diamonds, realising their valuable qualities. Historically, diamonds have been given to retain or regain a lover's or ruler's lost favour, as symbols of tribute, or as an expression of fidelity in exchange for concessions and protection. Mughal emperors and Kings used the diamonds as a means of assuring their immortality by having their names and worldly titles inscribed upon them. Moreover, it has played and continues to play a pivotal role in Indian social, political, economic, and religious event, as it often has done elsewhere. In Indian history, diamonds have been used to acquire military equipment, finance wars, foment revolutions, and tempt defections. They have contributed to the abdication or the decapitation of potentates. They have been used to murder a representative of the dominating power by lacing his food with crushed diamond. Indian diamonds have been used as security to finance large loans needed to buttress politically or economically tottering regimes. Victorious military heroes have been honoured by rewards of diamonds and also have been used as ransom payment for release from imprisonment or abduction.\nToday, many jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in Indian ceremonies and weddings. For many Indians, especially those who follow the Hindu or Jain faiths, bridal jewellery is known as \"streedhan\" and functions as personal wealth for the bride only, as a sort of financial security. For this reason, this jewellery, especially in the sacred metals of gold and silver, has large cultural significance for Indian brides. Jewellery is worn on the arms and hands, ears, neck, hair, head, feet, toes and waist to bless the bride with prosperity.\nNorth and South America.\nJewellery making started in the Americas with the arrival of Paleo-Indians more than 15,000 years ago. This jewellery would have been made from stone, shell, bone and other perishable materials. The American continent is home to 2 cradles of civilisation: in the Andes and Mesoamerica. Cultures in these regions developed more complex methods of jewellery creation. The Andes is the origin of hot working metallurgy in the Americas and consequently the region has the longest history of work in materials such as silver, platinum and gold. Metallurgy began in Mesoamerica during the Termainal Classic era, likely arriving from direct maritime trade with the Andean cultures. As a result, western Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Tarascans and Mixtecs, had more complex use of the technology.\nWith the Moche culture, goldwork flourished. The pieces are no longer simple metalwork, but are now masterful examples of jewellery making. Pieces are sophisticated in their design, and feature inlays of turquoise, mother of pearl, spondylus shell, and amethyst. The nose and ear ornaments, chest plates, small containers and whistles are considered masterpieces of ancient Peruvian culture.\nA notable example of Andean metallurgy is the Northern Andean cultures' work with platinum, which has a much higher melting point than other precious metals. There are only a few known examples of cold worked platinum in the Old World and no known intentionally hot worked examples (platinum was not identified as a separate element and small inclusions appeared in some goldwork). In the New World however, certain Andean cultures recognised platinum as a separate metal and were able to incorporate it into jewellery, such as through sintering it with gold.\nAmong the Late Post-Classic Aztecs, only nobility wore gold jewellery, as it showed their rank, power, and wealth. A large portion of \"Aztec gold\" jewellery was created by Mixtec artisans. The Mixtecs were particularly known for their goldwork and gold jewellery was part of the tribute paid by Mixtec polities to the Aztecs. In general, the more jewellery an Aztec noble wore, the higher his status or prestige. The Emperor and his High Priests, for example, would be nearly completely covered in jewellery when making public appearances. Although gold was the most common and a popular material used in Aztec jewellery, jade, turquoise, and certain feathers were considered more valuable. In addition to adornment and status, the Aztecs also used jewellery in sacrifices to appease the gods.\nAnother ancient American civilisation with expertise in jewellery making were the Maya. During the Pre-Classic and Classic era of Maya civilisation, the Maya were making jewellery from local materials such as jade, pearls, and seashell while also incorporating imported materials such as obsidian and turquoise. In the Terminal Classic and Post-Classic, importation of gold, silver, bronze, and copper lead to the use of these materials in jewellery. Merchants and nobility were the only few that wore expensive jewellery in the Maya region, much the same as with the Aztecs. Jade in particular had an important role across Mesoamerica.\nIn Northern America, Native Americans used shells, wood, turquoise, and soapstone The turquoise was used in necklaces and to be placed in earrings. The turquoise incorporated into Mesoamerican jewellery was primarily obtained through trade with Oasisamerica. Native Americans with access to oyster shells, often located in only one location in America, traded the shells with other tribes, showing the great importance of the body adornment trade in Northern America.\nJewellery played a major role in the fate of the Americas when the Spanish colonisers were spurred to search for gold on the American mainland after coming into contact with Caribbean natives that had gold jewellery obtained through trade with the mainland. Continued contact with Native Americans wearing gold jewellery eventually lead to Spanish expeditions of the mythological El Dorado.\nNative American.\nNative American jewellery is the personal adornment, often in the forms of necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings, pins, brooches, labrets, and more, made by the Indigenous peoples of the United States. Native American jewellery reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers. Native American tribes continue to develop distinct aesthetics rooted in their personal artistic visions and cultural traditions. Artists create jewellery for adornment, ceremonies, and trade. Lois Sherr Dubin writes, \"[i]n the absence of written languages, adornment became an important element of Indian [Native American] communication, conveying many levels of information.\" Later, jewellery and personal adornment \"...signaled resistance to assimilation. It remains a major statement of tribal and individual identity.\"\nWithin the Haida Nation of the Pacific Northwest, copper was used as a form of jewellery for creating bracelets.\nMetalsmiths, beaders, carvers, and lapidaries combine a variety of metals, hardwoods, precious and semi-precious gemstones, beadwork, quillwork, teeth, bones, hide, vegetal fibres, and other materials to create jewellery. Contemporary Native American jewellery ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewellery.\nPacific.\nJewellery making in the Pacific started later than in other areas because of recent human settlement. Early Pacific jewellery was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived. Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist, with headdresses, necklaces, hair pins, and arm and waist belts being the most common pieces.\nJewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either fertility or power. Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some, such as the inhabitants of Papua New Guinea, wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy. Tribesman may wear boar bones through their noses.\nIsland jewellery is still very much primal because of the lack of communication with outside cultures. Some areas of Borneo and Papua New Guinea are yet to be explored by Western nations. However, the island nations that were flooded with Western missionaries have had drastic changes made to their jewellery designs. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus, many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity.\nAustralia is now the number one supplier of opals in the world. Opals had already been mined in Europe and South America for many years prior, but in the late 19th century, the Australian opal market became predominant. Australian opals are only mined in a few select places around the country, making it one of the most profitable stones in the Pacific.\nThe New Zealand M\u0101ori traditionally had a strong culture of personal adornment, most famously the hei-tiki. Hei-tikis are traditionally carved by hand from bone, nephrite, or bowenite.\nNowadays a wide range of such traditionally inspired items such as bone carved pendants based on traditional fishhooks \"hei matau\" and other greenstone jewellery are popular with young New Zealanders of all backgrounds \u2013 for whom they relate to a generalised sense of New Zealand identity. These trends have contributed towards a worldwide interest in traditional M\u0101ori culture and arts.\nOther than jewellery created through M\u0101ori influence, modern jewellery in New Zealand is multicultural and varied.\nModern.\nMost modern commercial jewellery continues traditional forms and styles, but designers such as Georg Jensen have widened the concept of wearable art. The advent of new materials, such as plastics, Precious Metal Clay (PMC), and colouring techniques, has led to increased variety in styles. Other advances, such as the development of improved pearl harvesting by people such as Mikimoto K\u014dkichi and the development of improved quality synthetic gemstones such as moissanite, has placed jewellery within the economic grasp of a much larger segment of the population.\nThe \"jewellery as art\" movement was spearheaded by artisans such as Robert Lee Morris and continued by designers such as Gill Forsbrook in the UK. Influence from other cultural forms is also evident. One example of this is bling-bling style jewellery, popularised by hip-hop and rap artists in the early 21st century, e.g. grills, a type of jewellery worn over the teeth.\nThe late 20th century saw the blending of European design with oriental techniques such as Mokume-gane. The following are innovations in the decades straddling the year 2000: \"Mokume-gane, hydraulic die forming, anti-clastic raising, fold-forming, reactive metal anodising, shell forms, PMC, photoetching, and [use of] CAD/CAM.\"\nAlso, 3D printing as a production technique gains more and more importance. With a great variety of services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for prototypes, small batch series or unique and personalised designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realised by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using 3D modelling software.\nArtisan jewellery continues to grow as both a hobby and a profession. With more than 17 United States periodicals about beading alone, resources, accessibility, and a low initial cost of entry continues to expand production of hand-made adornments. Some fine examples of artisan jewellery can be seen at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The increase in numbers of students choosing to study jewellery design and production in Australia has grown in the past 20 years, and Australia now has a thriving contemporary jewellery community. Many of these jewellers have embraced modern materials and techniques, as well as incorporating traditional workmanship.\nMore expansive use of metal to adorn the wearer, where the piece is larger and more elaborate than what would normally be considered jewellery, has come to be referred to by designers and fashion writers as metal couture.\nMasonic.\nFreemasons attach jewels to their detachable collars when in Lodge to signify a Brothers Office held with the Lodge. For example, the square represents the Master of the Lodge and the dove represents the Deacon.\nBody modification.\nJewellery used in body modification can be simple and plain or dramatic and extreme. The use of simple silver studs, rings, and earrings predominates. Common jewellery pieces such as earrings are a form of body modification, as they are accommodated by creating a small hole in the ear.\nPadaung women in Myanmar place large golden rings around their necks. From as early as five years old, girls are introduced to their first neck ring. Over the years, more rings are added. In addition to the twenty-plus pounds of rings on her neck, a woman will also wear just as many rings on her calves. At their extent, some necks modified like this can reach long. The practice has health impacts and has in recent years declined from cultural norm to tourist curiosity. Tribes related to the Padaung, as well as other cultures throughout the world, use jewellery to stretch their earlobes or enlarge ear piercings. In the Americas, labrets have been worn since before first contact by Innu and First Nations peoples of the northwest coast. Lip plates have been worn by the African Mursi and Sara people, as well as some South American peoples.\nIn the late twentieth century, the influence of modern primitivism led to many of these practices being incorporated into western subcultures. Many of these practices rely on a combination of body modification and decorative objects, thus keeping the distinction between these two types of decoration blurred.\nIn many cultures, jewellery is used as a temporary body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin. Although this procedure is often carried out by tribal or semi-tribal groups, often acting under a trance during religious ceremonies, this practice has seeped into western culture. Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin. Most often, these hooks are used in conjunction with pulleys to hoist the recipient into the air. This practice is said to give an erotic feeling to the person and some couples have even performed their marriage ceremony whilst being suspended by hooks.\nJewellery market.\nThe Asia Pacific region dominated the jewellery market with a market share of 39.28% in 2024. The global jewelry market size was valued at US$353.26 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% from 2024 to 2030.\nAs of 2022, the global jewellery market was valued at approximately $270 billion and is projected to grow to over $330 billion by 2026. In 2022, the leading countries in the jewellery and watch market revenue were China, India, and the United States.\nThe global jewellery market was valued at US$278.5 billion in 2018. India remains the largest consumer of gold globally, with gold demand rising by 11% year-on-year to 760.40 tonnes in 2018.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "15744", "revid": "50564755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15744", "title": "Jim Jarmusch", "text": "American filmmaker (born 1953)\nJames Robert Jarmusch ( ; born January 22, 1953) is an American filmmaker and musician.\nHe has been a major proponent of independent cinema since the 1980s, directing films such as \"Stranger Than Paradise\" (1984), \"Down by Law\" (1986), \"Mystery Train\" (1989), \"Night on Earth\" (1991), \"Dead Man\" (1995), \"\" (1999), \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" (2003), \"Broken Flowers\" (2005), \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" (2013), \"Paterson\" (2016) and \"Father Mother Sister Brother\" (2025). \"Stranger Than Paradise\" was added to the National Film Registry in December 2002. For \"Father Mother Sister Brother\", Jarmusch won the Golden Lion at the 82nd Venice Film Festival.\nAs a musician, he has been part of the no wave band The Del-Byzanteens and in addition composed music for some of his films. He has released four musical albums with Jozef van Wissem.\nEarly life.\nJarmusch was born in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the second of three children of middle-class suburbanites. His mother, of German and Irish descent, was a reviewer of film and theatre for the \"Akron Beacon Journal\" before marrying his father, a businessman of Czech and German descent who worked for the B.F. Goodrich Company. She introduced Jarmusch to cinema by leaving him at a local theater to watch matinee double features such as \"Attack of the Crab Monsters\" and \"Creature From the Black Lagoon\" while she ran errands. The first adult film he recalls seeing was the 1958 cult classic \"Thunder Road\", the violence and darkness of which left an impression on the seven-year-old Jarmusch. Another B-movie influence from his childhood was \"Ghoulardi\", an eccentric Cleveland television show which featured horror films.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe key, I think, to Jim, is that he went gray when he was 15... As a result, he always felt like an immigrant in the teenage world. He's been an immigrant\u2014a benign, fascinated foreigner\u2014ever since. And all his films are about that.\n \u2014Tom Waits, as quoted in \"The New York Times\", 2005.\nJarmusch was an avid reader in his youth and acquired an enthusiasm for film. He had an even greater interest in literature which was encouraged by his grandmother. Though he refused to attend church with his Episcopalian parents (not liking \"the idea of sitting in a stuffy room wearing a little tie\"), Jarmusch credits literature with shaping his metaphysical beliefs and leading him to reconsider theology in his mid-teens.\nFrom his peers, he developed a taste for counterculture, and he and his friends would steal the records and books of their older siblings\u2014this included works by William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and The Mothers of Invention. They made fake identity documents which allowed them to visit bars at the weekend but also the local art house cinema, which typically showed pornographic films but would occasionally feature underground films such as Robert Downey, Sr.'s \"Putney Swope\" and Andy Warhol's \"Chelsea Girls\". At one point, he took an apprenticeship with a commercial photographer. He later remarked, \"Growing up in Ohio was just planning to get out.\"\nAfter graduating from high school in 1971, Jarmusch moved to Chicago and enrolled in the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. After being asked to leave because he had neglected to take any journalism courses\u2014Jarmusch favored literature and art history\u2014he transferred to Columbia University the following year, with the intention of becoming a poet. At Columbia he studied English and American literature under professors including New York School avant garde poets Kenneth Koch and David Shapiro. At Columbia, he began to write short \"semi-narrative abstract pieces\" and edited the undergraduate literary journal \"The Columbia Review\".\nDuring his final year studying at Columbia, Jarmusch moved to Paris for what was initially a summer semester on an exchange program, but turned into 10 months. He worked as a delivery driver for an art gallery and spent most of his time at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That's where I saw things I had only read about and heard about\u2014films by many of the good Japanese directors, like Imamura, Ozu, Mizoguchi. Also, films by European directors like Bresson and Dreyer, and even American films, like the retrospective of Samuel Fuller's films, which I only knew from seeing a few of them on television late at night. When I came back from Paris, I was still writing, and my writing was becoming more cinematic in certain ways, more visually descriptive.\u2014\u200a\nJarmusch graduated from Columbia University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1975. He was broke and working as a musician in New York City after returning from Paris in 1976. He applied on a whim to the graduate film school of New York University's School of the Arts (then under the direction of Hollywood director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benedek). Though he lacked experience in filmmaking, his submission of a collection of photographs and an essay about film secured his acceptance into the program. He studied there for four years; he met fellow students and future collaborators Sara Driver, Tom DiCillo, Howard Brookner, and Spike Lee in the process. During the late 1970s in New York City, Jarmusch and his contemporaries were part of a no wave cultural scene centered on the CBGB music club which inspired the formation of his no wave band The Del-Byzanteens.\nIn his final year at New York University, Jarmusch worked as an assistant to the film noir director Nicholas Ray, who was at that time teaching in the department. In an anecdote, Jarmusch recounted the formative experience of showing his mentor his first script; Ray disapproved of its lack of action, to which Jarmusch responded after meditating on the critique by reworking the script to be even less eventful. On Jarmusch's return with the revised script, Ray reacted favourably to his student's dissent, citing approvingly the young student's obstinate independence. Jarmusch was the only person Ray brought to work\u2014as his personal assistant\u2014on \"Lightning Over Water\", a documentary about his dying years on which he was collaborating with Wim Wenders. Ray died in 1979 after a long fight with cancer. A few days afterwards, having been encouraged by Ray and New York underground filmmaker Amos Poe and using scholarship funds given by the Louis B. Mayer Foundation to pay for his school tuition, Jarmusch started work on a film for his final project. The university was unimpressed with Jarmusch's use of his funding as well as the project itself and refused to award him a degree.\nCareer.\n1980s.\nJarmusch's final year university project was completed in 1980 as \"Permanent Vacation\", his first feature film. It had its premiere at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg (formerly known as Filmweek Mannheim) and won the Josef von Sternberg Award. It was made on a shoestring budget of around $12,000 in misdirected scholarship funds and shot by cinematographer Tom DiCillo on 16 mm film. The quasi-autobiographical feature follows an adolescent drifter (Chris Parker) as he wanders around downtown Manhattan.\nThe film was not released theatrically and did not attract the sort of adulation from critics that greeted his later work. \"The Washington Post\" staff writer Hal Hinson would disparagingly comment in an aside during a review of Jarmusch's \"Mystery Train\" (1989) that in the director's debut, \"the only talent he demonstrated was for collecting egregiously untalented actors\". The bleak and unrefined \"Permanent Vacation\" is nevertheless one of the director's most personal films, and established many of the hallmarks he would exhibit in his later work, including derelict urban settings, chance encounters, and a wry sensibility.\nJarmusch's first major film, \"Stranger Than Paradise\", was produced on a budget of approximately $125,000 and released in 1984 to much critical acclaim. A deadpan comedy recounting a strange journey of three disillusioned youths from New York through Cleveland to Florida, the film broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking. It was awarded the Camera d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival as well as the 1985 National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film, and became a landmark work in modern independent film.\nIn 1986, Jarmusch wrote and directed \"Down by Law\", starring musicians John Lurie and Tom Waits, and Italian comic actor Roberto Benigni (his introduction to American audiences) as three convicts who escape from a New Orleans jailhouse. Shot like the director's previous efforts in black and white, this constructivist neo-noir was Jarmusch's first collaboration with Dutch cinematographer Robby M\u00fcller, who had been known for his work with Wenders.\nHis next two films each experimented with parallel narratives: \"Mystery Train\" (1989) told three successive stories set on the same night in and around a small Memphis hotel, and \"Night on Earth\" (1991) involved five cab drivers and their passengers on rides in five different world cities, beginning at sundown in Los Angeles and ending at sunrise in Helsinki. Less bleak and somber than Jarmusch's earlier work, \"Mystery Train\" nevertheless retained the director's askance conception of America. He wrote \"Night on Earth\" in about a week, out of frustration at the collapse of the production of another film he had written and the desire to visit and collaborate with friends such as Benigni, Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder, and Isaach de Bankol\u00e9.\nAs a result of his early work, Jarmusch became an influential representative of the trend of the American road movie. Not intended to appeal to mainstream filmgoers, these early Jarmusch films were embraced by art house audiences, gaining a small but dedicated American following and cult status in Europe and Japan. Each of the four films had its premiere at the New York Film Festival, while \"Mystery Train\" was in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Jarmusch's distinctive aesthetic and \"auteur\" status fomented a critical backlash at the close of this early period, however; though reviewers praised the charm and adroitness of \"Mystery Train\" and \"Night On Earth\", the director was increasingly charged with repetitiveness and risk-aversion.\nA film appearance in 1989 as a used car dealer in the cult comedy \"Leningrad Cowboys Go America\" further solidified his interest and participation in the road movie genre. In 1991 Jarmusch appeared as himself in Episode One of John Lurie's cult television series \"Fishing With John\".\n1990s.\nIn 1995, Jarmusch released \"Dead Man\", a period film set in the 19th century American West starring Johnny Depp and Gary Farmer. Produced at a cost of almost $9\u00a0million with a high-profile cast including John Hurt, Gabriel Byrne and, in his final role, Robert Mitchum, the film marked a significant departure for the director from his previous features. Earnest in tone in comparison to its self-consciously hip and ironic predecessors, \"Dead Man\" was thematically expansive and of an often violent and progressively more surreal character. The film was shot in black and white by Robby M\u00fcller, and features a score composed and performed by Neil Young, for whom Jarmusch subsequently filmed the tour documentary \"Year of the Horse\", released to tepid reviews in 1997.\nThough ill-received by mainstream American reviewers, \"Dead Man\" found much favor internationally and among critics, many of whom lauded it as a visionary masterpiece. It has been hailed as one of the few films made by a Caucasian that presents an authentic Native American culture and character, and Jarmusch stands by it as such, though it has attracted both praise and castigation for its portrayal of the American West, violence, and especially Native Americans.\nFollowing artistic success and critical acclaim in the American independent film community, he achieved mainstream recognition with his far-East philosophical crime film \"\" (1999), shot in Jersey City and starring Forest Whitaker as a young inner-city man who has found purpose for his life by unyieldingly conforming it to the \"Hagakure\", an 18th-century philosophy text and training manual for samurai, becoming, as directed, a terrifyingly deadly hit-man for a local mob boss to whom he may owe a debt, and who then betrays him. The soundtrack was supplied by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, which blends into the director's \"aesthetics of sampling\". The film was unique among other things for the number of books important to and discussed by its characters, most of them listed bibliographically as part of the end credits. The film is also considered to be a homage to \"Le Samourai\", a 1967 French New Wave film by auteur Jean-Pierre Melville, which starred renowned French actor Alain Delon in a strikingly similar role and narrative.\n2000s.\nA five-year gap followed the release of \"Ghost Dog\", which the director has attributed to a creative crisis he experienced in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in New York City. 2004 saw the eventual release of \"Coffee and Cigarettes\", a collection of eleven short films of characters sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes that had been filmed by Jarmusch over the course of the previous two decades. The first vignette, \"Strange to Meet You\", had been shot for and aired on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1986, and paired Roberto Benigni with comedian Steven Wright. This had been followed three years later by \"Twins\", a segment featuring actors Steve Buscemi and Joie and Cinqu\u00e9 Lee, and then in 1993 with the Short Film Palme d'Or-winning \"Somewhere in California\", starring musicians Tom Waits and Iggy Pop.\nHe followed \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" in 2005 with \"Broken Flowers\", which starred Bill Murray as an early retiree who goes in search of the mother of his unknown son in attempt to overcome a midlife crisis. Following the release of \"Broken Flowers\", Jarmusch signed a deal with Fortissimo Films, whereby the distributor would fund and have \"first-look\" rights to the director's future films, and cover some of the overhead costs of his production company, Exoskeleton. The film premiered at the 58th Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d'Or and received the Grand Prix. Film critic Peter Bradshaw for \"The Guardian\" described the film as \"Jarmusch's most enjoyable, accessible work for some time, perhaps his most emotionally generous film...a very attractive piece of film-making, bolstered by terrific performances from an all-star cast, spearheaded by endlessly droll, seductively sensitive Bill Murray.\"\nIn 2009, Jarmusch released \"The Limits of Control\", a sparse, meditative crime film set in Spain, it starred Isaach de Bankol\u00e9 as a lone assassin with a secretive mission. A behind-the-scenes documentary, \"Behind Jim Jarmusch\", was filmed over three days on the set of the film in Seville by director L\u00e9a Rinaldi. Also in 2009, Jarmusch appeared as himself in an episode of the HBO series \"Bored to Death\", and the following year, Jarmusch helped to curate the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in Monticello, New York.\n2010s.\nIn an August 2010 interview, Jarmusch revealed his forthcoming work schedule at that time:\nI'm working on a documentary about the Stooges [Iggy Pop-fronted band]. It's going to take a few years. There's no rush on it, but it's something that Iggy asked me to do. I'm co-writing an \"opera\". It won't be a traditional opera, but it'll be about the inventor Nikola Tesla, with the composer Phil Klein. I have a new film project that's really foremost for me that I hope to shoot early next year with Tilda Swinton and Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska, who was Alice in Wonderland in Tim Burton's film. I don't have that quite financed yet, so I'm working on that. I'm also making music and hoping to maybe score some silent films to put out. Our band will have an EP that we'll give out at ATP. We have enough music for three EPs or an album.\nJarmusch eventually attained funding for the aforementioned film project after a protracted period and, in July 2012, Jarmusch began shooting \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" with Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska, Anton Yelchin, and Hurt, while Jarmusch's musical project Sq\u00fcrl were the main contributors to the film's soundtrack. The film screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), with Jarmusch explaining the seven-year completion time frame at the former: \"The reason it took so long is that no one wanted to give us the money. It took years to put it together. Its (sic) getting more and more difficult for films that are a little unusual, or not predictable, or don't satisfy people's expectations of something.\" The film's budget was US$7 million and its UK release date was February 21, 2014.\nJarmusch wrote and directed \"Paterson\" in 2016. The film follows the daily experiences of an inner-city bus driver and poet (Adam Driver) in Paterson, New Jersey, who shares the same name as the city. Paterson was inspired by objectivist American poet William Carlos Williams and his epic poem \"Paterson\". The film features the wry, minimalist style found in Jarmusch's other works and earned 22 award nominations for Jarmusch, Driver and Nellie, the dog featured in the film. The story focuses on Paterson's poetry writing efforts, interspersed with his observations and experiences of the residents he encounters on his bus route and in his daily life. Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a positive review, writing: \"A mild-mannered, almost startlingly undramatic work that offers discreet pleasures to longtime fans of the New York indie-scene veteran, who can always be counted on to go his own way.\" Eric Kohn, film critic of \"IndieWire\" wrote that the film was \"an apt statement from Jarmusch, a filmmaker who continues to surprise and innovate while remaining true to his singular voice, and who here seems to have delivered its purest manifestation.\"\nJarmusch wrote and directed his first horror film, the zombie comedy \"The Dead Don't Die\" featuring an ensemble cast which included performances from Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, Tilda Swinton, Carol Kane, and Selena Gomez. The film premiered at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival and received mixed reviews. It was distributed by Focus Features. Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"At times, the deadpan of Murray and Driver becomes, well, a bit deadening, and true wit is in short supply, even though the film remains amusing most of the way.\"\n2020s.\nJarmusch directed and wrote a short film titled \"French Water\" for the Yves Saint Laurent House of Fashion to celebrate their spring/summer 2021 collection. It starred Charlotte Gainsbourg and Julianne Moore, among others.\nIn September 2021, Jarmusch published with Anthology Editions a hardcover book of his small-scale collage art called \"Some Collages\" with texts by Lucy Sante and Randy Kennedy.\nJarmusch wrote and directed \"Father Mother Sister Brother.\" Jarmusch first spoke about the film at the Outlook Festival in April 2023, where he said he was working on a new film that was a \"very subtle film; it\u2019s very quiet\u2026Funny and sad\". He hinted that the film may not have any music. In November 2023, the film's title was revealed, with filming taking place in New Jersey, Dublin, and Paris. It premiered at the 82nd Venice International Film Festival in 2025, winning the Golden Lion.\nMusic.\nIn the early 1980s, Jarmusch was part of a revolving lineup of musicians in Robin Crutchfield's Dark Day project, and later became the keyboardist and one of two vocalists for The Del-Byzanteens, a No Wave band who released the LP \"Lies to Live By\" in 1982.\nJarmusch is also featured on the album \"Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture\" (2005) in two interludes described by Sean Fennessy in a Pitchfork review of the album as both \"bizarrely pretentious\" and \"reason alone to give it a listen\". Jarmusch and Michel Gondry each contributed a remix to a limited edition release of the track \"Blue Orchid\" by The White Stripes in 2005.\nHe released four collaborative albums with lutist Jozef van Wissem: \"Concerning the Entrance into Eternity\" (Important Records); \"The Mystery of Heaven\" (Sacred Bones Records) in 2012, the 2019 release \"An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil\" (Sacred Bones Records) and in 2025 \"The Day the Angels cried\" (Incunabulum Records). Jarmusch and van Wissem also collaborated on the soundtrack of \"Only Lovers Left Alive\".\nJarmusch first met van Wissem on a street in New York City's SoHo neighborhood in 2007, at which time the lute player handed the director a CD. Several months later, Jarmusch asked van Wissem to send his catalog of recordings and the two started playing together as part of their developing friendship. Van Wissem explained in early April 2014: \"I know the way [Jarmusch] makes his films is kind of like a musician. He has music in his head when he's writing a script so it's more informed by a tonal thing than it is by anything else.\"\nJarmusch is a member of the avant-garde rock band Sq\u00fcrl with film associate Carter Logan and sound engineer Shane Stoneback. The band formed to create additional soundtracks for Jarmusch's film \"The Limits of Control\", which they released together with two other songs on an EP called \"Film Music from The Limits of Control\" under the name Bad Rabbit. Sq\u00fcrl's version of Wanda Jackson's 1961 song \"Funnel of Love\", featuring Madeline Follin of Cults on vocals, opens Jarmusch's 2014 film \"Only Lovers Left Alive\". On March 8, 2023, Sq\u00fcrl announced its debut album \"Silver Haze\" and released lead single \"Berlin '87\". The album was released on May 5 by Sacred Bones Records.\nLegacy as a filmmaker.\nIn 2014, Jarmusch shunned the \"auteur theory\" and likened the filmmaking process to human sexual reproduction:\nI put 'A film by' as a protection of my rights, but I don't really believe it. It's important for me to have a final cut, and I do for every film. So I'm in the editing room every day, I'm the navigator of the ship, but I'm not the captain, I can't do it without everyone's equally valuable input. For me it's phases where I'm very solitary, writing, and then I'm preparing, getting the money, and then I'm with the crew and on a ship and it's amazing and exhausting and exhilarating, and then I'm alone with the editor again... I've said it before, it's like seduction, wild sex, and then pregnancy in the editing room. That's how it feels for me.\nJarmusch recorded a Q &amp; A in 2010 for the Criterion Blu-ray release of \"Mystery Train\". He explained at the beginning that he did this, instead of the usual practice of a director's commentary to be played over the film itself, because \"I don't like looking at my films again\u2014it's agony to me.\"\nStyle.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is nonexistent. And don't bother concealing your thievery\u2014celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: \"It's not where you take things from\u2014it's where you take them to.\"\nJim Jarmusch's Golden Rules \u2013 #5, 2004, \nJarmusch has been characterized as a minimalist filmmaker whose idiosyncratic films are unhurried. His films often eschew traditional narrative structure, lacking clear plot progression and focus more on mood and character development. In an interview early in his career, he stated that his goal was \"to approximate real time for the audience.\"\nHis early work is marked by a brooding, contemplative tone, featuring extended silent scenes and prolonged still shots. He has experimented with a vignette format in three films that were either released, or begun around, the early 1990s: \"Mystery Train,\" \"Night on Earth\" and \"Coffee and Cigarettes\". \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" critic Sean P. Means wrote that Jarmusch blends \"film styles and genres with sharp wit and dark humor\", while his style is also defined by a signature deadpan comedic tone.\nThe protagonists of Jarmusch's films are usually lone adventurers. The director's male characters have been described by critic Jennie Yabroff as \"three time losers, petty thiefs and inept con men, all... eminently likeable, if not down right charming\"; while novelist Paul Auster described them as \"laconic, withdrawn, sorrowful mumblers\".\nJarmusch has revealed that his instinct is a greater influence during the filmmaking process than any cognitive processes. He explained: \"I feel like I have to listen to the film and let it tell me what it wants. Sometimes it mumbles and it isn't very clear.\" Films such as \"Dead Man\" and \"Limits of Control\" have polarized fans and general viewers alike, as Jarmusch's stylistic instinct is embedded in his strong sense of independence.\nThemes.\nThough his films are predominantly set in the United States, Jarmusch has advanced the notion that he looks at America \"through a foreigner's eyes\", with the intention of creating a form of world cinema that synthesizes European and Japanese film with that of Hollywood. His films have often included foreign actors and characters, and (at times substantial) non-English dialogue. In his two later-nineties films, he dwelt on different cultures' experiences of violence, and on textual appropriations between cultures: a wandering Native American's love of William Blake, a black hitman's passionate devotion to the \"Hagakure\". The interaction and syntheses between different cultures, the arbitrariness of national identity, and irreverence towards ethnocentric, patriotic or nationalistic sentiment are recurring themes in Jarmusch's work.\nJarmusch's fascination with music is another characteristic that is readily apparent in his work. Musicians appear frequently in key roles\u2014John Lurie, Tom Waits, Gary Farmer, Youki Kudoh, RZA and Iggy Pop have featured in multiple Jarmusch films, while Joe Strummer and Screamin' Jay Hawkins appear in \"Mystery Train\" and GZA, Jack and Meg White feature in \"Coffee and Cigarettes\". Hawkins' song \"I Put a Spell on You\" was central to the plot of \"Stranger than Paradise\", while \"Mystery Train\" is inspired by and named after a song popularized by Elvis Presley, who is also the subject of a vignette in \"Coffee and Cigarettes\". In the words of critic Vincent Canby, \"Jarmusch's movies have the tempo and rhythm of blues and jazz, even in their use\u2014or omission\u2014of language. His films work on the senses much the way that some music does, unheard until it's too late to get it out of one's head.\"\nDuring a 1989 interview Jarmusch commented on his narrative focus, \"I'd rather make a movie about a guy walking his dog than about the emperor of China.\"\nAwards and legacy.\nIn 1980, Jarmusch's film \"Permanent Vacation\" won the Josef von Sternberg Award at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg. In 1999, he was laureate of the Douglas Sirk Preis at Filmfest Hamburg, Germany. In 1984, he won the Cam\u00e9ra d'Or at Cannes Film Festival for \"Stranger Than Paradise\". In 2004, Jarmusch was honored with the \"Filmmaker on the Edge Award\" at the Provincetown International Film Festival. In 2005, he won the Grand Prix of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival for his film \"Broken Flowers\". He won the Golden Lion at the 82nd Venice International Film Festival for \"Father Mother Sister Brother\" in 2025.\nJarmusch is credited with having instigated the American independent film movement with \"Stranger Than Paradise\". In her description of the film in a 2005 profile of the director for \"The New York Times\", critic Lynn Hirschberg declared that \"Stranger than Paradise\" \"permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant-garde form\". The success of the film accorded the director a certain iconic status within arthouse cinema, as an idiosyncratic and uncompromising auteur, exuding the aura of urban cool embodied by downtown Manhattan. Such perceptions were reinforced by the release of his subsequent features in the late 1980s, establishing him as one of the generation's most prominent and influential independent filmmakers.\nNew York critic and festival director Kent Jones undermined the \"urban cool\" association that Jarmusch has garnered and was quoted in a February 2014 media article, following the release of his eleventh feature film:\nThere's been an overemphasis on the hipness factor\u2014and a lack of emphasis on his incredible attachment to the idea of celebrating poetry and culture. You can complain about the preciousness of a lot of his movies, [but] they are unapologetically standing up for poetry. [His attitude is] 'if you want to call me an elitist, go ahead, I don't care'.\nJarmusch's staunch independence has been represented by his success in retaining the negatives for all of his films, an achievement that was described by the \"Guardian\"'s Jonathan Romney as \"extremely rare.\" British producer Jeremy Thomas, who was one of the eventual financiers of \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" called Jarmusch \"one of the great American independent film-makers\" who is \"the last of the line.\" Thomas believes that filmmakers like Jarmusch \"are not coming through... any more.\"\nIn a 1989 review of his work, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called Jarmusch \"the most adventurous and arresting film maker to surface in the American cinema in this decade\". He was recognized with the \"Filmmaker on the Edge\" award at the 2004 Provincetown International Film Festival. A retrospective of the director's films was hosted at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during February 1994, and another, \"The Sad and Beautiful World of Jim Jarmusch\", by the American Film Institute in August 2005.\nWhile Swinton, who has worked with Jarmusch on numerous occasions, describes him as a \"rock star\", the director admits that \"I don't know where I fit in. I don't feel tied to my time.\" Dutch lute player Jozef van Wissem, who worked on the score for \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" calls Jarmusch a \"cultural sponge\" who \"absorbs everything.\"\nThe moving image collection of Jim Jarmusch is held at the Academy Film Archive.\nPersonal life.\nJarmusch rarely discusses his personal life in public. He divides his time between New York City and the Catskill Mountains. He stopped drinking coffee in 1986, the year of the first installment of \"Coffee and Cigarettes\", although he continues to smoke cigarettes. He has been a vegetarian since 1987.\nJarmusch has been a supporter of Pro-Palestine causes and was one of 55 celebrities to sign the Artists4Ceasefire letter calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.\nThe author of a series of essays on influential bands, Jarmusch has also had at least two poems published. He is a founding member of The Sons of Lee Marvin, a humorous \"semi-secret society\" of artists resembling the iconic actor, which issues communiqu\u00e9s and meets on occasion for the ostensible purpose of watching Marvin's films.\nIn a February 2014 interview, Jarmusch stated that he is not interested in eternal life, as \"there's something about the cycle of life that's very important, and to have that removed would be a burden\".\nFrequent collaborators.\nIn the following table, entries marked with an a indicate collaborators who acted in a film; those marked c composed music for the film.\nDiscography.\nLive albums\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther sources"}

Though movable type was already in use in East Asia, Gutenberg's invention of the printing press enabled a much faster rate of printing. The printing press later spread across the world, and led to an information revolution and the unprecedented mass-spread of literature throughout Europe. It had a profound impact on the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, and humanist movements.\nGutenberg's many contributions to printing include the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink for printing books; adjustable molds; mechanical movable type; and the invention of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period. Gutenberg's method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and antimony that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type. His major work, the Gutenberg Bible, was the first printed version of the Bible and has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.\nGutenberg is often cited as among the most influential figures in human history and has been commemorated around the world. To celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth, the Gutenberg Museum was founded in his hometown of Mainz in 1900. In 1997, Time Life picked Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nJohannes Gutenberg was born in Mainz (in modern-day Germany), a wealthy city along the Rhine, between the 14th and 15th centuries. His exact year of birth is unknown; on the basis of a later document indicating that he came of age by 1420, scholarly estimates have ranged from 1393 to 1406. The year 1400 is commonly assigned to Gutenberg, \"for the sake of convenience\". Tradition also holds his birthdate to be on the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, 24 June, since children of the time were often named after their birthday's patron saint. There is no verification for this assumption, since the name \"Johannes\"\u2014and variants such as \"Johann\", \"Henne\", \"Hengin\" and \"Henchen\"\u2014was widely popular at the time. In full, Johannes Gutenberg's name was 'Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg', with \"Laden\" and \"Gutenberg\" being adopted from the family's residences in Mainz. The latter refers to the \"Hof zum Gutenberg\", a large and now destroyed Gothic-style residence inherited by Gutenberg's father. Gutenberg probably spent his earliest years at the manor, which existed beside St. Christoph's.\nHis father Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden was a patrician and merchant, likely in the cloth trade. Friele later served among the \"master of the accounts\" for the city and was a (lit.\u2009'minting house cooperative'), a part of the mint's companionship. In 1386 Friele married his second wife, Else Wyrich, the daughter of a shopkeeper; Johannes was probably the youngest of the couple's three children, after his brother Friele (b. c.\u20091387) and sister Else (b. c.\u20091390\u20131397). Scholars commonly assume that the marriage of Friele to Else, who was not of patrician lineage, complicated Gutenberg's future. Because of his mother's commoner status, Gutenberg would never be able to succeed his father at the mint; according to the historian Ferdinand Geldner this disconnect may have disillusioned him from high society and encouraged his unusual career as an inventor.\nThe patrician () class of Mainz\u2014the Gutenbergs included\u2014held a privileged socioeconomic status, and their efforts to preserve this put them into frequent conflict with the younger generations of guild () craftsmen. A particularly violent conflict arose in February 1411 amid an election dispute, and at least 117 patricians fled the conflict in August. Friele left, presumably with the Gutenberg family, and probably stayed in the nearby Eltville since Else had inherited a house on the town walls there. The archbishop mediated a peace between the rival parties, allowing the family to return to Mainz later that Autumn. The situation remained unstable and the rise of hunger riots forced the Gutenberg family to leave in January 1413 for Eltville.\nEducation.\nNo documents survive concerning Gutenberg's childhood or youth. The biographer Albert Kapr remarked that \"most books on Gutenberg pass over this period with the remark that not a single fact is known\". As the son of a patrician, education in reading and arithmetic would have been expected. A knowledge of Latin\u2014a prerequisite for universities\u2014is also probable, though it is unknown whether he attended a Mainz parish school, was educated in Eltville or had a private tutor. Gutenberg may have initially pursued a religious career, as was common with the youngest sons of patricians, since the proximity of many churches and monasteries made it a safe prospect. It has been speculated that he attended the St. Victor's south of Mainz (near Weisenau), as he would later join their brotherhood. It was the site of a well-regarded school and his family had connections there, though his actual attendance remains speculative.\nHe is assumed to have studied at the University of Erfurt, where there is a record of the enrollment of a student called Johannes de Altavilla in 1418\u2014Altavilla is the Latin form of Eltville am Rhein.\nNothing is now known of Gutenberg's life for the next fifteen years, but in March 1434, a letter by him indicates that he was living in Strasbourg, where he had some relatives on his mother's side. He also appears to have been a goldsmith member enrolled in the Strasbourg militia. In 1437, there is evidence that he was instructing a wealthy tradesman on polishing gems, but where he had acquired this knowledge is unknown. In 1436/37 his name also comes up in court in connection with a broken promise of marriage to a woman from Strasbourg, Ennelin. Whether the marriage actually took place is not recorded. Following his father's death in 1419, he is mentioned in the inheritance proceedings.\nPrinting press.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n What was written to me about that marvelous man [Gutenberg] seen at Frankfurt [\"sic\"] entirely true. I have not seen complete bibles but only a number of quires of various books [of the Bible]. The script is extremely neat and legible, not at all difficult to follow [You] would be able to read it without effort, and indeed without glasses\n Future pope Pius II in a letter to Cardinal Carvajal, March 1455\nAround 1439, Gutenberg was involved in a financial misadventure making polished metal mirrors (which were believed to capture holy light from religious relics) for sale to pilgrims to Aachen: in 1439 the city was planning to exhibit its collection of relics from Emperor Charlemagne but the event was delayed by one year due to a severe flood and the capital already spent could not be repaid. \nUntil at least 1444 Gutenberg lived in Strasbourg, most likely in the St. Arbogast parish. It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that he is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled \"Aventur und Kunst\" (enterprise and art). It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type were conducted there. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia. By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with intaglio printing; it is claimed that he had worked on copper engravings with an artist known as the Master of Playing Cards.\nBy 1450, the press was in operation, and a German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there. Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender Johann Fust for a loan of 800 guilders. Peter Sch\u00f6ffer, who became Fust's son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Sch\u00f6ffer had worked as a scribe in Paris and is believed to have designed some of the first typefaces.\nGutenberg's workshop was set up at Humbrechthof, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this, he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there were two presses: one for the pedestrian texts and one for the Bible. One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of indulgences for the church, documented from 1454 to 1455.\nIn 1455, Gutenberg completed his \"42-line Bible\", known as the Gutenberg Bible. About 180 copies were printed, three quarters on paper, and the rest on vellum.\nCourt case.\nSome time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, in which Fust demanded his money back, and accused Gutenberg of misusing the funds. Gutenberg's two rounds of financing from Fust, totaling 1,600 guilders at 6% interest, now amounted to 2,026 guilders. Fust sued at the archbishop's court. A legal document, from November 1455, records that there was a partnership for a \"project of the books,\" the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop.\nThus, Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained, or restarted, a printing shop and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of Bamberg around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain. It is possible the large \"Catholicon\" dictionary, printed in Mainz in 1460 or later, was executed in his workshop, but there has been considerable scholarly debate.\nMeanwhile, the Fust\u2013Sch\u00f6ffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer's name and date, the \"Mainz Psalter\" of August 1457, and while proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.\nLater life.\nIn 1462, during the devastating Mainz Diocesan Feud, Mainz was sacked by Archbishop Adolph von Nassau. On 18 January 1465, Gutenberg's achievements were recognized by Archbishop von Nassau. He was given the title \"Hofmann\" (gentleman of the court). This honor included a stipend and an annual court outfit, as well as 2,180 litres of grain and 2,000 litres of wine tax-free.\nGutenberg died in 1468 and was buried likely as a tertiary in the Franciscan church at Mainz. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg's grave is now lost.\nIn 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon's biography of famous Germans.\nPrinting.\nPrinting method.\nGutenberg's early printing process, and what texts he printed with movable type, are not known in great detail. His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts. Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up the sheets, distributing the type etc., the Gutenberg\u2013Fust shop may have employed many craftsmen.\nGutenberg's technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.\nIn the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a \"matrix\". This is then placed into a hand-held mould and a piece of type, or \"sort\", is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or fonts. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of \"movable type\".\nThe invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg's process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variation due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg's earliest work shows other variations.\nIn 2001, the physicist Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas and Princeton librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of a Papal bull in the Scheide Library, Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text. Gutenberg's type had irregularities, particularly in simple characters like the hyphen. These variations could not have been caused by ink smears or wear on the metal pieces. Detailed image analysis suggests the variations could not have come from the same matrix. Examination of transmitted light pictures of the page revealed substructures, in the type, that could not have been made using traditional punchcutting techniques.\nBased on these observations, researchers hypothesized that Gutenberg's method involved impressing simple shapes in a \"cuneiform\" style onto a matrix made of a soft material, such as sand. Casting the type would then destroy the mold, necessitating the recreation of the matrix for each additional sort. This hypothesis could potentially explain both the variations in the type and the substructures observed in the printed images.\nThus, they speculated that \"the decisive factor for the birth of typography\", the use of reusable moulds for casting type, was a more progressive process than was previously thought. They suggested that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains uncertain.\nA 1568 book \"Batavia\" by Hadrianus Junius from Holland claims the idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from Haarlem to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. He was an inventor and a goldsmith. However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor. The author of the \"Cologne Chronicle of 1499\" quotes Ulrich Zell, the first printer of Cologne, that printing was performed in Mainz in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of Coster, while it actually credits Gutenberg as the \"first inventor of printing\" in the very same passage (fol. 312). The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend.\nThe 19th-century printer and typefounder Fournier Le Jeune suggested that Gutenberg was not using type cast with a reusable matrix, but wooden types that were carved individually. A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004.\nPrinted books.\nBetween 1450 and 1455, Gutenberg printed several texts, some of which remain unidentified; his texts did not bear the printer's name or date, so attribution is possible only from typographical evidence and external references. Certainly church documents including a papal letter and two indulgences were printed, one of which was issued in Mainz. In view of the value of printing in quantity, seven editions in two styles were ordered, resulting in several thousand copies being printed. Some printed editions of \"Ars Minor\", a schoolbook on Latin grammar by Aelius Donatus, may have been printed by Gutenberg; these have been dated either 1451\u201352, or 1455. Every copy of printed books were identical; this was a significant departure from handwritten manuscripts, which left room for possible human error. \nIn 1455, Gutenberg completed copies of a well-executed folio Bible (\"Biblia Sacra\"), with 42 lines on each page. Copies sold for 30 florins each, roughly three years' wages for a clerk. Nonetheless, it was much cheaper than a manuscript Bible that could take a single scribe over a year to prepare. After printing, some copies were rubricated or hand-illuminated in the same elegant way as manuscript Bibles from the same period.\n48 substantially complete copies are known to survive, including two at the British Library that can be viewed and compared online. The text lacks modern features such as page numbers, indentations, and paragraph breaks.\nAn undated 36-line edition of the Bible was printed, probably in Bamberg in 1458\u201360, possibly by Gutenberg. A large part of it was shown to have been set from a copy of Gutenberg's Bible, thus disproving earlier speculation that it was the earlier of the two.\nLegacy.\nInfluence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhat the world is today, good and bad, it owes to Gutenberg. Everything can be traced to this source, but we are bound to bring him homage, \u2026 for the bad that his colossal invention has brought about is overshadowed a thousand times by the good with which mankind has been favored.\n American writer Mark Twain (1835\u20131910)\nGutenberg's invention had an enormous impact on subsequent human history, both on cultural and social matters. His design directly impacted the mass spread of books across Europe, causing an information revolution. As a result, Venzke describes the inauguration of the Renaissance, Reformation and humanist movement as \"unthinkable\" without Gutenberg's influence. Described as \"one of the most recognized names in the world\", a team of US journalists voted Gutenberg as the \"man of the millennium\" in 1999. Similarly, in 1999 the A&amp;E Network ranked Gutenberg the No. 1 most influential person of the second millennium on their \"Biographies of the Millennium\" countdown, while \"Time\u2013Life\" magazine picked Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium in 1997. The scholar of paper history, Thomas Francis Carter, drew parallels between Cai Lun, the traditional inventor of paper during the Eastern Han dynasty, and Gutenberg, calling them \"spiritual father and son\" respectively. In his 1978 book, \"\", Michael H. Hart ranked him 8th, below Cai but above figures such as Christopher Columbus, Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin.\nThe capital of printing in Europe shifted to Venice, where printers like Aldus Manutius ensured widespread availability of the major Greek and Latin texts. The claims of an Italian origin for movable type have focused on this rapid rise of Italy in movable-type printing. This may perhaps be explained by the prior eminence of Italy in the paper and printing trade. Italy's economy was growing rapidly at the time, facilitating the spread of literacy. Christopher Columbus had a geography book printed with movable type, bought by his father; it is now in the Biblioteca Colombina in Seville. Finally, the city of Mainz was sacked in 1462, driving many printers into exile.\nPrinting was also a factor in the Reformation. Martin Luther's \"Ninety-five Theses\" were printed and circulated widely; subsequently he issued broadsheets outlining his anti-indulgences position (certificates of indulgences were one of the first items Gutenberg had printed). Due to this, Gutenberg would also be viewed as a proto-Protestant. The broadsheet contributed to the development of the newspaper.\nMemorials and monuments.\nThere are many statues of Gutenberg in Germany, including one by Bertel Thorvaldsen (1837) at Gutenbergplatz in Mainz, home to the eponymous Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz and Gutenberg Museum on the history of early printing. The latter publishes the \"Gutenberg-Jahrbuch\", the leading periodical in the history of printing, and the book.\nIn 1952, the United States Postal Service issued a five hundredth anniversary stamp commemorating Johannes Gutenberg invention of the movable-type printing press. In space, he is commemorated in the name of the asteroid 777 Gutemberga. Two operas based on Gutenberg are \"G, Being the Confession and Last Testament of Johannes Gensfleisch, also known as Gutenberg, Master Printer, formerly of Strasbourg and Mainz\", from 2001, with music by Gavin Bryars; and \"La Nuit de Gutenberg\", with music by Philippe Manoury, premiered in 2011 in Strasbourg. Project Gutenberg, the oldest digital library, commemorates Gutenberg's name. The Mainz Johannisnacht (St. John's Night), has commemorated Gutenberg in his native city since 1968.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The 1988 film \"The Big Blue\", directed by Luc Besson, was inspired by his life story and that of his friend, Enzo Maiorca. Mayol was one of the screenwriters and authored the book \"Homo Delphinus: the Dolphin Within Man\" of his philosophy about the aquatic origins of humans.\nEarly life.\nJacques Mayol was a French national born in Shanghai, China. Mayol spent his summer holidays in Karatsu (Japan) every year as a child. When he was 7, he would skin dive with his older brother in seas around Nanatsugama (Karatsu, Japan), where he saw a dolphin for the first time. Mayol described the fateful encounter in his book, \"Homo Delphinus: The Dolphin Within Man\".\nCareer.\nOn 23 November 1976, at 49, he became the first free diver to descend to , and when he was 56 he managed to descend to . During the scientific research phase of his career, Mayol tried to answer the question of whether man had a hidden aquatic potential that could be evoked by rigorous physiological and psychological training.\nMayol's lifelong passion for diving was based on his love for the ocean, his personal philosophy, and his desire to explore his own limits. During his lifetime, he helped introduce the then-elitist sport of free-diving into the mainstream. His diving philosophy was to reach a state of mind based on relaxation and yoga breathing, with which he could accomplish apnea. He also contributed to technological advances in the field of free-diving, particularly improving assemblies used by no-limits divers. He was also instrumental in the development of scuba diving's octopus regulator, which was invented by Dave Woodward at UNEXSO in 1965 or 1966. Woodward believed that having safety divers carry two second stages would be a safer and more practical approach than buddy breathing in the event of an emergency.\nMayol was already an experienced free diver when he met the Sicilian Enzo Maiorca, who was the first person to dive below . Mayol reached depth. A friendship, as well as rivalry, between the two men ensued. Their most famous records were set in the no-limits category, in which divers are permitted to use weighted sleds to descend and air balloons for a speedy ascent. Between 1966 and 1983, Mayol was the no-limits world champion eight times. In 1981 he set a world record of in the constant weight discipline, using fins. In 1976, Mayol broke the barrier with a no-limits dive off Elba, Italy. Tests showed that during this dive his heart beat decreased from 60 to 27 beats/min, an aspect of the mammalian diving reflex, a reflex more evident in whales, seals, and dolphins. Mayol's last deep dive followed in 1983 when he reached the depth of , at the age of 56.\nDolphins.\nMayol's fascination with dolphins started in 1955 when he was working as a commercial diver at an aquarium in Miami, Florida. There he met a female dolphin called Clown and formed a close bond with her. Imitating Clown, he learned how to hold his breath longer and how to behave and integrate himself underwater. It is the dolphins that became the foundation of Mayol's life philosophy of \"Homo Delphinus\".\nThroughout his book \"L'Homo Delphinus\" (2000 published in English as \"Homo Delphinus: The Dolphin within Man\" by Idelson Gnocchi Publishers Ltd.) Mayol expounds his theories about man's relationship with the sea, and explores the aquatic ape hypothesis of human origins. He felt man could reawaken his dormant mental and spiritual faculties and the physiological mechanisms from the depths of his psyche and genetic make-up to develop the potential of his aquatic origins, to become a \"Homo delphinus\".\nJacques Mayol predicted that within a couple of generations, some people would be able to dive to and hold their breath for up to ten minutes. Today the no-limits record stands at 253 m (Herbert Nitsch, June 2012). Serbian Branko Petrovi\u0107 holds the record for Static Apnea at 11 minutes and 54 seconds (October 2014). Croatian Budimir \u0160obat holds the record for static apnea on pure oxygen at 24 minutes 37 second (27 March 2021).\nFilm.\nThe film \"The Big Blue\", directed by Luc Besson in 1988, was inspired by his life story and the life story of the Italian diver Enzo Maiorca and their friendship. Mayol was one of the screenwriters.\nMayol was the subject of the 2017 documentary film \"Dolphin Man (L'Homme dauphin, sur les traces de Jacques Mayol)\", directed by Lefteris Charitos.\nDeath.\nOn 22 December 2001 Mayol committed suicide by hanging himself at his villa in Elba, Italy, after struggling with depression. He was 74 years old. His ashes were spread over the Tuscany coast. Friends have erected a monument to him in the sea southeast of Elba at depth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After the war, he studied law and political science at the University of Munich and the University of Freiburg, where he first got involved in politics. Terboven joined the Nazi Party in 1923, participated in the Beer Hall Putsch and eventually rose through the ranks to become the \"Gauleiter\" of Essen and the editor of various Nazi newspapers. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Terboven was promoted to \"SA-Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" and was made a member of the Prussian State Council.\nIn 1940, he was appointed \"Reichskommissar\" for Norway, a position that granted him significant power and control. Terboven established multiple concentration camps in Norway, ruthlessly persecuted the Jewish population and focused on crushing the Norwegian resistance movement. His actions led to numerous atrocities, such as the Beisfjord massacre in which hundreds of Yugoslavian political prisoners and prisoners-of-war were murdered.\nAs the tide of the war turned against Germany, Terboven implemented a scorched earth policy in northern Norway that resulted in the forced evacuation of 50,000 Norwegians and widespread destruction. He hoped to turn Norway into a fortress for the Nazi regime's last stand. However, after Adolf Hitler's suicide, his successor, \"Gro\u00dfadmiral\" Karl D\u00f6nitz, dismissed Terboven from his post as \"Reichskommissar\" on 7 May 1945.\nOn 8 May 1945, the day of Germany's surrender, Terboven died of suicide by detonating 50 kg (110 lbs) of dynamite in a bunker on the Skaugum compound in Norway. His family survived in West Germany, and his wife, Ilse (Stahl) Terboven died in 1972.\nEarly life.\nTerboven was born in Essen, the son of minor landed gentry of Dutch descent. The family name comes from the Low German \"daar boven\" (\"up there\"), referring to a farmstead on a hill. Josef Terboven attended \"Volksschule\" and \"Realschule\" in Essen until 1915 and then volunteered for military service in the First World War. He served with \"Feldartillerie Regiment\" 9 and then with the nascent air force. He was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class, and attained the rank of \"Leutnant\" before being discharged on 22 December 1918. He studied law and political science at the University of Munich and the University of Freiburg, where he first got involved in politics. He dropped out of the university in 1922 without earning a degree and trained as a bank official in Essen, working as a bank clerk through June 1925.\nNazi Party career.\nTerboven joined the Nazi Party in November 1923 with membership number 25,247 and participated in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. As an early Party member, he later would be awarded the Golden Party Badge. When the Party subsequently was outlawed, he continued to work at the bank until after the ban was lifted in February 1925. In August 1925 Terboven went to work full-time for the Party, becoming the head of a small Nazi newspaper and book distributorship in Essen. At this time he also founded the \"Ortsgruppe\" (Local Group) in Essen, becoming its first \"Ortsgruppenleiter\". He also joined the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) becoming the SA-\"F\u00fchrer\" in Essen. He formally re-enrolled in the Party on 15 December 1925. By 1927, he had advanced to \"Bezirksleiter\" (District Leader) of the Essen district in the \"Gro\u00dfgau\" Ruhr. From 1927 to December 1930, Terboven was the editor of the weekly Nazi newspaper \"The New Front: The Weekly Sheet of the Working People.\" In 1929, he was sentenced to three months imprisonment for continuing to publish the proscribed paper. In the 20 May 1928 election, Terboven failed in his attempt to be elected to the Prussian Landtag.\nOn 1 October 1928 upon the dissolution of the \"Gro\u00dfgau\" Ruhr, the Essen district became an independent unit subordinated to the central Party headquarters in Munich. However, on 1 August 1930 the Essen district officially was raised to Gau status and Terboven was named \"Gauleiter\". He would retain this post throughout the Nazi regime.\nIn 1930, Terboven also became a City Councilor in Essen and a member of the Provincial \"Landtag\" of the Rhine Province until it was dissolved in 1933. On 14 September 1930, Terboven was elected to the \"Reichstag\" from electoral constituency 23, D\u00fcsseldorf West and would continue to hold this seat until the end of the Nazi regime. From 15 December 1930, Terboven was also the editor of the \"National-Zeiting in Essen\".\nAfter the Nazi seizure of power, Terboven was promoted to SA-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" on 1 March 1933 and made a member of the Prussian State Council on 10 July 1933. On 28 June 1934, Terboven married Ilse Stahl, Joseph Goebbels's former secretary and mistress. Adolf Hitler was a witness at the wedding, and while in Essen put into play preparations for the Night of the Long Knives. On 5 February 1935, Terboven was appointed \"Oberpr\u00e4sident\" (High President) of Prussia's Rhine Province which included Gau Essen and three other Gaue. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices within his jurisdiction. On 27 April 1935 Terboven received the Golden Party Badge. He was promoted to the rank of SA-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" on 9 November 1936. On the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, he was named Reich Defense Commissioner for \"Wehrkreis\" (Military District) VI, which included his Gau together with Gau Dusseldorf, Gau Cologne-Aachen, most of Gau Westphalia-North and Gau Westphalia-South and part of Gau Weser-Ems. On 16 November 1942, the jurisdiction of the Reich Defense Commissioners was changed from the \"Wehrkreis\" to the Gau level and Terboven remained Commissioner for only his Gau of Essen.\nReichskommissar of Norway.\nTerboven was named \"Reichskommissar\" for Norway on 24 April 1940 even before the military invasion's completion on 10 June. He moved into Skaugum, the official residence of Crown Prince Olav, in September 1940 and made his headquarters in the Norwegian Parliament building. Nothing in Terboven's background and training particularly qualified him for that post, but he had Hitler's full confidence. He was responsible to no one but Hitler, and within the Nazi governmental hierarchy, his office stood on the same level as the Reich Ministries. Terboven regarded himself as virtually an autonomous viceroy with what he termed \"limitless power of command\". His conception of his role resulted in his attempting to ignore any directives not issued by Hitler himself.\n\"Reichskommissar\" Terboven had supervisory authority over only the German civilian administration, which was very small and did not rule Norway directly. Day-to-day governmental affairs were managed by the existing seven-member Norwegian Administrative Council, which had been set up by the Norwegian Supreme Court after the king and cabinet fled into exile. On 25 September 1940, Terboven dismissed the Administrative Council and appointed a thirteen-member Provisional State Council to administer affairs. All the members were Terboven's hand-picked appointees and worked under his control and supervision. A proclamation was issued deposing King Haakon VII, outlawing the government-in-exile, disbanding the Storting and banning all political parties except Vidkun Quisling's Nasjonal Samling. Terboven therefore remained in ultimate charge of Norway until the end of the war in 1945, even after he had permitted the formation of a Norwegian puppet regime on 1 February 1942 under Quisling as minister-president, the so-called Quisling government.\nTerboven also did not have authority over the 400,000 regular German Army forces that were stationed in Norway which were under the command of \"Generaloberst\" Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, but he commanded a personal force of around 6,000 men of whom 800 were part of the secret police. In contrast to the military forces commanded by Falkenhorst, which aimed to reach an understanding with the Norwegian people and were under orders by Falkenhorst to treat Norwegians with courtesy, Terboven behaved in a petty and ruthless way and was widely disliked not only by the Norwegians but also by many Germans. Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, expressed annoyance in his diaries about what he called Terboven's \"bullying tactics\" against the Norwegians, as they alienated the population against the Germans. Terboven's relations with the army commander were strained, but his relations with the Higher SS and Police Leader, Wilhelm Rediess, were very good, and he co-operated in providing Rediess's staff a free hand with their policies of repression.\nRepression and crimes against humanity.\nTerboven established multiple concentration camps in Norway, including Falstad concentration camp near Levanger and Bredtvet concentration camp in Oslo in late 1941. At one of those camps on 18 July 1942 the Beisfjord massacre took place, the murder of hundreds of Yugoslavian political prisoners and prisoners-of-war by German and Norwegian concentration camp guards. Some 288 prisoners were shot to death, and many others were burned to death when the barracks were set on fire. Terboven had ordered the massacre a few days earlier. In July 1942, at least one German guard assigned to the Korgen prison camp was killed. The commandant ordered retribution: execution by gunfire for \"39 prisoners at Korgen and 20 at Osen\";. In the days that followed, Terboven also ordered retribution, and around 400 prisoners shot and killed in various camps.\nFrom 1941, Terboven increasingly focused on crushing the Norwegian resistance movement, which engaged in acts of sabotage and assassination against the Germans. On 17 September, Terboven decreed that special SS and Police Tribunals would have jurisdiction over Norwegian citizens who violated his decrees. They were summary proceedings with the accused provided no adequate defense. The trials were not open to the public, and the proceedings were not published. Sentences were carried out shortly after they were pronounced with no right of appeal. It is estimated that some 150 individuals were sentenced to death by these tribunals. Many more were sentenced to long terms of hard labour.\nOn 26 April 1942, the Nazis learned that two members of the resistance were being sheltered by the inhabitants of Telav\u00e5g, a small fishing village. When the Gestapo arrived, shots were exchanged, and two Gestapo agents were killed. Terboven was outraged and personally led a reprisal raid on 30 April that was quick and brutal. All buildings were burned to the ground, all boats were sunk or confiscated and all livestock taken away. All men in the village were either executed or sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, in Germany. Of the 72 who were deported from Telav\u00e5g, 31 were murdered in captivity. The women and the children were imprisoned for two years. Another 18 Norwegian prisoners unrelated to Telav\u00e5g, who were held at the Trandum internment camp, were also executed as reprisals. In another incident, the shooting of two German police officials on 6 September 1942 led to Terboven personally declaring martial law in Trondheim from 5 to 12 October 1942. He imposed a curfew from 8:00\u00a0p.m. to 5:00\u00a0a.m. and suppressed all newspapers, public assemblies and railroad transportation. On Terboven's orders, ten prominent citizens were executed in reprisal, and their assets were confiscated. In addition, Terboven set up an ad hoc extrajudicial tribunal to try Norwegians considered \"hostile to the state\". An additional 24 men were tried and summarily executed over the next three days.\nDespite the small number of Jews in Norway's population (around 1,800), Terboven persecuted them relentlessly. Some 930 managed to escape to neighboring Sweden, but some 770 were rounded up and deported to Germany. The main deportation occurred on 26 November 1942, when 532 Jews were shipped to Stettin aboard the \"SS Donau\". From there, they were transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and only 9 survived the war. On 25 February 1943, another 158 were similarly deported aboard the M\"S Gotenland\", and only six survived.\nLast months of the war and death.\nOn 25 September 1944, Terboven, in his capacity as \"Gauleiter\" of Essen, was named commander of the \"Volkssturm\" units in the Gau. In reality, it was his Deputy \"Gauleiter\", Fritz Schlessmann, who executed those duties as he had been Acting \"Gauleiter\" in Essen during Terboven's absence in Norway since 1940. In October 1944, in response to the Red Army advance in to the Finnmark region of northern Norway, Terboven instituted a scorched earth policy that resulted in the forced evacuation of 50,000 Norwegians and widespread destruction, including the burning of 10,000 homes, 4,700 farms and hundreds of schools, churches, shops and industrial buildings.\nAs the tide of the war turned against Germany, Terboven wanted to organise \"Festung Norwegen\" (Fortress Norway) for the Nazi regime's last stand. After Hitler's suicide, his successor, \"Gro\u00dfadmiral\" Karl D\u00f6nitz, summoned Terboven to his headquarters in Flensburg on 3 May 1945 and ordered him to cooperate with winding down hostilities. Terboven expressed his desire to continue fighting and D\u00f6nitz dismissed Terboven from his post as \"Reichskommissar\" on 7 May and transferred his powers to \"General der Gebirgstruppe\" Franz B\u00f6hme.\nWith the announcement of the German surrender, Terboven committed suicide on 8 May 1945 by detonating of dynamite in a bunker on the Skaugum compound. He died alongside the body of SS-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" Rediess, who had shot himself earlier. Terboven's family survived in West Germany, although his daughter, Inga, in an event in 1964 unrelated to her father's history, killed her two-year-old daughter by strangulation. Terboven's wife, Ilse, died in 1972.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th-century music, he is referred to by various nicknames, among them \"Mr. Dynamite\", \"the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business\", \"Minister of New Super Heavy Funk\", \"Godfather of Soul\", \"King of Soul\", and \"Soul Brother No. 1\". In a career that lasted more than 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first ten inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on January 23, 1986. His music has been heavily sampled by hip-hop musicians and other artists.\nBrown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He rose to prominence in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads \"Please, Please, Please\" and \"Try Me\", Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album \"Live at the Apollo\" and hit singles such as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\", \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" and \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\".\nDuring the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a new approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" and \"The Payback\". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.\nBrown recorded and released 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was posthumously inducted into the first class of the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in the Top 500 Artists. He is ranked seventh on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and at No. 44 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nJames Joseph Brown was born on May 3, 1933, in Barnwell, South Carolina, to a 16-year-old mixed-race African-American and Asian named Susie (\"n\u00e9e\" Behling; 1917\u20132004), and 21-year-old African-American and Native-American Joseph Gardner Brown (1912\u20131993) in a small wooden shack. Brown's name was supposed to have been Joseph James Brown, but his first and middle names were mistakenly reversed on his birth certificate. The Brown family lived in poverty in Elko, South Carolina, which was an impoverished town in 1933. They moved to Augusta, Georgia when James was four or five. His family first settled at one of his aunts' brothels and later moved into a house shared with another aunt. Brown's mother eventually left the family after a contentious and abusive marriage and moved to New York.\nBrown began singing in talent shows as a young child, first appearing at Augusta's Lenox Theater in 1944, winning the show after singing the ballad \"So Long\". While in Augusta, Brown performed buck dances for change to entertain troops from Camp Gordon at the start of World War II as their convoys traveled over a canal bridge near his aunt's home, where he first heard the legendary blues musician Howlin' Wolf play guitar. He learned to play the piano, guitar, and harmonica during this period, and became inspired to become an entertainer after hearing \"Caldonia\" by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five. In his teen years, Brown briefly had a career as a boxer.\nAt the age of 16, Brown was convicted of robbery and sent to a juvenile detention center in Toccoa. There, he formed a gospel quartet with four cellmates, including Johnny Terry. Brown met singer Bobby Byrd when the two played against each other in a baseball game outside the detention center. Byrd discovered that Brown could sing after hearing of \"a guy called Music Box\", which was Brown's nickname at the prison. Byrd has since said he and his family helped to secure an early release, which led to Brown promising the court he would \"sing for the Lord\".\nBrown was released on a work sponsorship with Toccoa business owner S. C. Lawson, who was impressed with Brown's work ethic and secured his release with a promise to keep him employed for two years. Brown was paroled on June 14, 1952. Brown went on to work with both of Lawson's sons, and came back to visit the family from time to time throughout his career. Shortly after being paroled, he joined the gospel group the Ever-Ready Gospel Singers, featuring Byrd's sister Sarah.\nMusic career.\n1954\u20131961: The Famous Flames.\nBrown joined Bobby Byrd's group in 1954, having evolved from the Gospel Starlighters, an a cappella gospel group, to the Avons, an R&amp;B group. He reputedly joined the band after one of its members, Troy Collins, died in a car crash. Along with Brown and Byrd, the group consisted of Sylvester Keels, Doyle Oglesby, Fred Pulliam, Nash Knox and Nafloyd Scott. Influenced by R&amp;B groups such as Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, the Orioles, and Billy Ward and his Dominoes, the group changed its name, first to the Toccoa Band and then to the Flames. Nafloyd's brother Baroy later joined the group on bass guitar. Brown, Byrd and Keels switched lead positions and instruments, often playing drums and piano. Johnny Terry later joined, by which time Pulliam and Oglesby had long left.\nBerry Trimier became the group's first manager, booking them at parties near college campuses in Georgia and South Carolina. The group had already gained a reputation as a good live act when they renamed themselves the Famous Flames. In 1955, the group contacted Little Richard while performing in Macon. Richard convinced the group to get in contact with his manager at the time, Clint Brantley, at his nightclub. Brantley agreed to manage them after seeing the group audition. He then sent them to a local radio station to record a demo session, where they performed their own composition \"Please, Please, Please\", which was inspired when Little Richard wrote the words of the title on a napkin and Brown was determined to make a song out of it.\nThe Famous Flames eventually signed with King Records' Federal subsidiary in Cincinnati, Ohio, and issued a re-recorded version of \"Please, Please, Please\" in March 1956. The song became the group's first R&amp;B hit, selling more than a million copies. None of their follow-ups gained similar success. In 1957, Brown replaced Clint Brantley as manager and hired Ben Bart, chief of Universal Attractions Agency. In 1957 the original Flames broke up, after Bart changed the name of the group to \"James Brown and The Famous Flames\".\nIn October 1958, Brown released the ballad \"Try Me\", which hit number one on the R&amp;B chart in the beginning of 1959, becoming the first of seventeen chart-topping R&amp;B hits. Shortly afterwards, he recruited his first band, led by J. C. Davis, and reunited with Bobby Byrd who joined a revived Famous Flames lineup that included Eugene \"Baby\" Lloyd Stallworth and Bobby Bennett, with Johnny Terry sometimes coming in as the \"fifth Flame\". Brown, the Flames, and his entire band debuted at the Apollo Theater on April 24, 1959, opening for Brown's idol, Little Willie John.\nFederal Records issued two albums credited to Brown and the Famous Flames. Both contained previously released singles. In 1960, Brown began multi-tasking in the recording studio involving himself, his singing group, the Famous Flames, and his band, a separate entity from the Flames, sometimes named the James Brown Orchestra or the James Brown Band. In 1960, the band released the top ten R&amp;B hit \"(Do the) Mashed Potatoes\" on Dade Records, owned by Henry Stone, billed under the pseudonym \"Nat Kendrick &amp; the Swans\" due to label issues. As a result of its success, King president Syd Nathan shifted Brown's contract from Federal to the parent label, King, which according to Brown in his autobiography meant \"you got more support from the company\". While with King, Brown, under the Famous Flames lineup, released the hit-filled album \"Think!\" and in 1961 released two albums with the James Brown Band earning second billing. With the Famous Flames, Brown sang lead on several more hits, including \"Bewildered\", \"I'll Go Crazy\" and \"Think\", songs that hinted at his emerging style.\n1962\u20131966: Mr. Dynamite.\nIn 1962, Brown and his band scored a hit with their cover of the instrumental \"Night Train\", becoming a top five R&amp;B single. That same year, the ballads \"Lost Someone\" and \"Baby You're Right\", the latter a Joe Tex composition, added to his repertoire and increased his reputation with R&amp;B audiences. On October 24, 1962, Brown financed a live recording of a performance at the Apollo and convinced Syd Nathan to release the album, despite Nathan's belief that no one would buy a live album due to the fact that Brown's singles had already been bought and that live albums were usually bad sellers.\n\"Live at the Apollo\" was released in June 1963 and became an immediate hit, eventually reaching number two on the Top LPs chart and selling more than a million copies, staying on the charts for 14 months. In 1963, Brown scored his first top 20 pop hit with his rendition of the standard \"Prisoner of Love\". He launched his first label, Try Me Records, which included recordings by Tammy Montgomery, later to be famous as Tammi Terrell, Johnny &amp; Bill (Famous Flames associates Johnny Terry and Bill Hollings) and the Poets, which was another name used for Brown's backing band. During this time, Brown began an ill-fated two-year relationship with 17-year-old Tammi Terrell when she sang in his revue. Terrell ended their personal and professional relationship because of Brown's abusive behavior.\nIn 1964, seeking bigger commercial success, Brown and Bobby Byrd formed the production company, Fair Deal, linking the operation to the Mercury imprint, Smash Records. King Records fought against this and was granted an injunction preventing Brown from releasing any recordings for the label. Prior to the injunction, Brown had released three vocal singles, including the blues-oriented hit \"Out of Sight\", which further indicated the direction his music was going to take. Touring throughout the year, Brown and the Famous Flames grabbed more national attention after delivering an explosive show-stopping performance on the live concert film \"The T.A.M.I. Show\". The Flames' dynamic gospel-tinged vocals, polished choreography and timing as well as Brown's energetic dance moves and high-octane singing upstaged the proposed closing act, the Rolling Stones.\nHaving signed a new deal with King, in 1965 Brown released his song \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\", which became his first top-ten pop hit and won him his first Grammy Award. Brown signed a production deal with Loma Records. Later in 1965, he issued \"I Got You\", which became his second single in a row to reach number one on the R&amp;B chart and top ten on the pop chart. Brown followed that up with the ballad \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\", a third Top-10 Pop hit (No. 1 R&amp;B), which confirmed his stance as a top-ranking performer, especially with R&amp;B audiences, from that point on.\n1967\u20131970: Soul Brother No. 1.\nBy 1967, Brown's emerging sound began to be defined as funk music. That year, he released what some critics cited as the first true funk song, \"Cold Sweat\", which hit number-one on the R&amp;B chart (Top 10 Pop) and became one of his first recordings to contain a drum break and the first that featured a harmony that was reduced to a single chord. The instrumental arrangements on tracks such as \"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\" and \"Licking Stick \u2013 Licking Stick\", both recorded in 1968, and \"Funky Drummer\", recorded in 1969, featured a more developed version of Brown's mid-1960s style, with the horn section, guitars, bass and drums meshed together in intricate rhythmic patterns based on multiple interlocking riffs.\nChanges in Brown's style that started with \"Cold Sweat\" established the musical foundation for Brown's later hits, such as \"I Got the Feelin'\" (1968) and \"Mother Popcorn\" (1969). By this time Brown's vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured traces of pitch or melody. This became a major influence on the techniques of rapping, which would come to maturity along with hip hop music in the coming decades. Brown's style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts: strutting bass lines, syncopated drum patterns, and iconic percussive guitar riffs.\nThe main guitar ostinatos for 1969's \"Ain't It Funky\" and \"Give It Up or Turnit a Loose\", are examples of Brown's refinement of New Orleans funk; irresistibly danceable riffs, stripped down to their rhythmic essence. On both recordings, the tonal structure is bare bones. The pattern of attack points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches as if the guitar were an African drum or idiophone. Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from \"New Orleans\u2014through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s\". Those same tracks were later resurrected by countless hip-hop musicians from the 1970s onward. As a result, James Brown remains to this day the world's most sampled recording artist. Two tracks that he wrote, are synonymous with modern dance, especially with house music, jungle music, and drum and bass music, which were sped up exponentially, in the latter two genres.\n\"Bring it Up\" has an Afro-Cuban guajeo-like structure. All three of these guitar riffs are based on an onbeat/offbeat structure. Stewart says that it \"is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\"\nIt was around this time as the musician's popularity increased that he acquired the nickname \"Soul Brother No. 1\", after failing to win the title \"King of Soul\" from Solomon Burke during a Chicago gig two years prior. Brown's recordings during this period influenced musicians across the industry, most notably groups such as Sly and the Family Stone, Funkadelic, Charles Wright &amp; the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s as well as vocalists such as Edwin Starr, David Ruffin and Dennis Edwards from the Temptations, and Michael Jackson, who, throughout his career, cited Brown as his ultimate idol.\nBrown's band during this period employed musicians and arrangers who had come up through the jazz tradition. He was noted for his ability as a bandleader and songwriter to blend the simplicity and drive of R&amp;B with the rhythmic complexity and precision of jazz. Trumpeter Lewis Hamlin and saxophonist/keyboardist Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis, the successor to previous bandleader Nat Jones, led the band. Guitarist Jimmy Nolen provided percussive, deceptively simple riffs for each song, and Maceo Parker's prominent saxophone solos provided a focal point for many performances. Other members of Brown's band included stalwart Famous Flames singer and sideman Bobby Byrd, trombonist Fred Wesley, drummers John \"Jabo\" Starks, Clyde Stubblefield and Melvin Parker, saxophonist St. Clair Pinckney, guitarist Alphonso \"Country\" Kellum and bassist Bernard Odum.\nIn addition to a torrent of singles and studio albums, Brown's output during this period included two more successful live albums, \"Live at the Garden\" (1967) and \"Live at the Apollo, Volume II\" (1968), and a 1968 television special, \"\". His music empire expanded along with his influence on the music scene. As Brown's music empire grew, his desire for financial and artistic independence grew as well. Brown bought radio stations during the late 1960s, including WRDW in his native Augusta, where he shined shoes as a boy. In November 1967, James Brown purchased radio station WGYW in Knoxville, Tennessee, for a reported $75,000, according to the January 20, 1968 \"Record World\" magazine. The call letters were changed to WJBE reflecting his initials. WJBE began on January 15, 1968, and broadcast a Rhythm &amp; Blues format. The station slogan was \"WJBE 1430 Raw Soul\". Brown bought WEBB in Baltimore in 1970.\nBrown branched out to make several recordings with musicians outside his own band. In an attempt to appeal to the older, more affluent, and predominantly white adult contemporary audience, Brown recorded \"Gettin' Down to It\" (1969) and \"Soul on Top\" (1970)\u2014two albums consisting mostly of romantic ballads, jazz standards, and homologous reinterpretations of his earlier hits\u2014with the Dee Felice Trio and the Louie Bellson Orchestra. In 1968, he recorded a number of funk-oriented tracks with the Dapps, a white Cincinnati band, including the hit \"I Can't Stand Myself\". He also released three albums of Christmas music with his own band.\n1970\u20132006: Godfather of Soul.\nIn March 1970, most of Brown's mid-to-late 1960s road band walked out on him due to financial disputes, a development augured by the prior disbandment of the Famous Flames singing group for the same reason in 1968. Brown and erstwhile Famous Flames singer Bobby Byrd, who chose to remain in the band during this tumultuous period as co-frontman, effectively serving as a proto-hype man in live performances, recruited several members of the Pacemakers, a Cincinnati-based ensemble that included bassist Bootsy Collins and his brother, guitarist Phelps \"Catfish\" Collins; augmented by the remaining members of the 1960s road band, including Fred Wesley, who rejoined Brown's outfit in December 1970, and other newer musicians, they formed the nucleus of the J.B.'s, Brown's new backing ensemble.\nShortly following their first performance together, the band entered the studio to record the Brown-Byrd composition, \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\". The \u200cwith its off the beat play Brown called \"The One\"\u2060\u200cand other contemporaneous singles further cemented Brown's influence in the nascent genre of funk music. This iteration of the J.B.'s dissolved after a March 1971 European tour (documented on the 1991 archival release \"Love Power Peace\") due to additional money disputes and Bootsy Collins's use of LSD; a new lineup of the J.B.'s coalesced around Wesley, St. Clair Pinckney and drummer John Starks.\nIn 1971, Brown began recording for Polydor Records in a deal with Starday-King Records which included music publishing and Brown's back catalog. Many of his sidemen and supporting players, including Fred Wesley &amp; the J.B.'s, Bobby Byrd, Lyn Collins, Vicki Anderson and former rival Hank Ballard, released records on the People label.\nDuring the 1972 presidential election, James Brown openly proclaimed his support of Richard Nixon for reelection to the presidency over Democratic candidate George McGovern. The decision led to a boycott of his performances and, according to Brown, cost him a big portion of his black audience. As a result, Brown's record sales and concerts in the United States were in a lull in 1973, as he failed to land a number-one R&amp;B single that year. In 1973 he also faced problems with the IRS for failure to pay back taxes, charging he hadn't paid upwards of $4.5 million; five years earlier, the IRS had claimed he owed nearly $2 million.\nIn 1973, Brown provided the score for the blaxploitation film \"Black Caesar\". In 1974 he returned to the No. 1 spot on the R&amp;B charts with \"The Payback\", with the parent album reaching the same spot on the album charts. He reached No. 1 two more times in 1974, with \"My Thang\" and \"Papa Don't Take No Mess\".\n\"Papa Don't Take No Mess\" was his final single to reach the No. 1 spot on the R&amp;B charts. His other Top Ten R&amp;B hits during this latter period included \"Funky President\" (R&amp;B No. 4) and \"Get Up Offa That Thing\" (R&amp;B No. 4).\n1975-2006: Later career.\nAlthough his records were mainstays of the vanguard New York underground disco scene, exemplified by DJs such as David Mancuso and Francis Grasso, from 1969 onwards, Brown did not consciously yield to the trend until 1975's \"Sex Machine Today\". By 1977, he was no longer a dominant force in R&amp;B. After \"Get Up Offa That Thing\", thirteen of Brown's late 1970s recordings for Polydor failed to reach the Top 10 of the R&amp;B chart, with only \"Bodyheat\" in 1976 and the disco-oriented \"It's Too Funky in Here\" in 1979 reaching the R&amp;B Top 15 and the ballad \"Kiss in '77\" reaching the Top 20.\nAfter 1976's \"Bodyheat\", he failed to appear on the Billboard Hot 100. As a result, Brown's concert attendance began dropping and his reported disputes with the IRS caused his business empire to collapse. In addition, several longtime bandmates, including Wesley and Maceo Parker, had gradually pivoted to Parliament-Funkadelic, which reached its critical and commercial apogee in the mid-to-late 1970s. The emergence of disco forestalled Brown's success on the R&amp;B charts, because its slicker, more commercial style had superseded his rawer, one-chord funk productions.\nBy the release of 1979's \"The Original Disco Man\", Brown seldom contributed to the songwriting and production processes, leaving most of it to producer Brad Shapiro. This resulted in the song \"It's Too Funky in Here\" becoming Brown's most successful single in this period. After two more albums failed to chart, Brown left Polydor in 1981. It was around this time that Brown changed the name of his band from the J.B.'s to the Soul Generals, or Soul G's. The band retained that name until his death.\nDespite Brown's declining record sales, promoters Gary LoConti and Jim Rissmiller helped Brown sell out a string of residency shows at the Reseda Country Club in Los Angeles in early 1982. Brown's compromised commercial standing prevented him from charging a large fee. However, the great success of these shows marked a turning point for Brown's career, and soon he was back on top in Hollywood. Movies followed, including appearances in \"Doctor Detroit\" (1983) and \"Rocky IV\" (1985). He guest-starred in the \"Miami Vice\" episode \"Missing Hours\" (1987). Previously, Brown appeared alongside a litany of other Black musical luminaries in \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980).\nIn 1984, he teamed with rap musician Afrika Bambaataa on the song \"Unity\". A year later he signed with Scotti Brothers Records and issued the moderately successful album \"Gravity\" in 1986 with a popular song \"How Do You Stop\". It included Brown's final Top Ten pop hit, \"Living in America\", marking his first Top 40 entry since 1974 and his first Top Ten pop entry since 1968. Produced and written by Dan Hartman, it featured prominently on the \"Rocky IV\" film and soundtrack. Brown performed the song in the film at Apollo Creed's final fight, shot in the Ziegfeld Room at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, and was credited in the film as the Godfather of Soul. 1986 also saw the publication of his autobiography, \"James Brown: The Godfather of Soul\", co-written with Bruce Tucker. In 1987, Brown won the Grammy for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for \"Living in America\".\nIn 1988, Brown worked with the production team Full Force on the new jack swing-influenced \"I'm Real\". It spawned his final two Top 10 R&amp;B hits, \"I'm Real\" and \"Static\", which peaked at No. 2 and No. 5, respectively. Meanwhile, the drum break from the second version of the original 1969 hit \"Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose\", the recording included on the compilation album \"In the Jungle Groove\", became so popular at hip hop dance parties, especially for breakdance, during the early 1980s that hip hop pioneer Kurtis Blow called the song \"the national anthem of hip hop\".\nAfter his stint in prison during the late 1980s, Brown met Larry Fridie and Thomas Hart who produced the first James Brown biopic, entitled \"James Brown: The Man, the Message, the Music\", released in 1992. He returned to music with the album \"Love Over-Due\" in 1991. It included the single \"(So Tired of Standing Still We Got to) Move On\", which peaked at No. 48 on the R&amp;B chart. His former record label Polydor released the four-CD box set \"Star Time\", spanning Brown's career to date. Brown's release from prison prompted his former record labels to reissue his albums on CD, featuring additional tracks and commentary by music critics and historians.\nIn 1991, Brown appeared on rapper MC Hammer's video for \"Too Legit to Quit\". Hammer had been noted, alongside Big Daddy Kane, for bringing Brown's unique stage shows and their own energetic dance moves to the hip-hop generation. Both listed Brown as their idol. Both musicians sampled his work, with Hammer having sampled the rhythms from \"Super Bad\" for his song \"Here Comes the Hammer\", from his best-selling album \"Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em\". Big Daddy Kane sampled many times. \nOn June 10, 1991, James Brown and a star-filled line up performed before a crowd at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles for a live pay-per-view at-home audience. \"James Brown: Living in America \u2013 Live!\" was the brainchild of Indiana producer Danny Hubbard. It featured\nM.C. Hammer as well as Bell Biv Devoe, Heavy D &amp; the Boys, En Vogue, C+C Music Factory, Quincy Jones, Sherman Hemsley and Keenen Ivory Wayans. Ice-T, Tone Loc and Kool Moe Dee performed paying homage to Brown. This was Brown's first public performance since his parole from the South Carolina prison system in February. He had served two-and-a-half years of two concurrent six-year sentences for aggravated assault and other felonies.\nBrown continued making recordings. In 1993, his album \"Universal James\" was released. It included his final \"Billboard\" charting single, \"Can't Get Any Harder\", which peaked at No. 76 on the US R&amp;B chart and reached No. 59 on the UK chart. Its brief charting in the UK was probably due to the success of a remixed version of \"I Feel Good\" featuring Dakeyne. Brown released the singles \"How Long\" and \"Georgia-Lina\", which failed to chart. In 1995, Brown returned to the Apollo and recorded \"Live at the Apollo 1995\". It included a studio track titled \"Respect Me\", which was released as a single. Again, it failed to chart.\nBrown's final studio albums, \"I'm Back\" and \"The Next Step\", were released in 1998 and 2002 respectively. \"I'm Back\" featured the song \"Funk on Ah Roll\", which peaked at No. 40 in the UK but did not chart in his native US. \"The Next Step\" included Brown's final single, \"Killing Is Out, School Is In\". Both albums were produced by Derrick Monk. Brown's concert success remained unabated and he kept up with a grueling schedule throughout the remainder of his life, living up to his previous nickname, \"The Hardest Working Man in Show Business\", in spite of his advanced age. In 2003, Brown participated in the PBS \"American Masters\" television documentary \"James Brown: Soul Survivor\", which was directed by Jeremy Marre.\nBrown performed in the Super Bowl XXXI halftime show in 1997.\nBrown celebrated his status as an icon by appearing in a variety of entertainment and sports events, including an appearance on the WCW pay-per-view event, SuperBrawl X, where he danced alongside wrestler Ernest \"the Cat\" Miller, who based his character on Brown, during his in-ring skit with the Maestro. Brown appeared in Tony Scott's short film \"\" in 2001. He was featured alongside Clive Owen, Gary Oldman, Danny Trejo and Marilyn Manson. Brown made a cameo appearance in the 2002 Jackie Chan film \"The Tuxedo\", in which Chan was required to finish Brown's act after having accidentally knocked out the singer. In 2002, Brown appeared in \"Undercover Brother\", playing himself.\nIn 2004, Brown opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers at several Hyde Park concerts in London. The beginning of 2005 saw the publication of his second book, \"I Feel Good: A Memoir of a Life of Soul\", written with Marc Eliot. In February and March 2005, he participated in recording sessions for an intended studio album with Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, and other longtime collaborators. Though he lost interest in the album, which remains unreleased, a track from the sessions, \"Gut Bucket\", appeared on a compilation CD included with the August 2006 issue of \"MOJO\".\nBrown appeared at Edinburgh 50,000 \u2013 The Final Push, the final Live 8 concert on July 6, 2005, where he performed a duet with British pop star Will Young on \"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\". In the Black Eyed Peas album \"Monkey Business\", Brown was featured on a track called \"They Don't Want Music\". The previous week he had performed a duet with another British pop star, Joss Stone, on the United Kingdom chat show \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\". In 2006, Brown continued his Seven Decades of Funk World Tour.\nBrown's final major U.S. performance was in San Francisco on August 20, 2006, as headliner at the Festival of the Golden Gate (Foggfest) on the Great Meadow at Fort Mason. The next day, he performed at an 800-seat campus theatre at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California. His last shows were greeted with positive reviews, and one of his final concert appearances at the Irish Oxegen festival in Punchestown in 2006 included a record crowd of 80,000 people. He played a full concert as part of the BBC's Electric Proms on October 27, 2006, at The Roundhouse, supported by the Zutons, with special appearances from Max Beasley and the Sugababes.\nBrown's last televised appearance was at his induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2006, before his death in December. He had been scheduled to perform a duet with singer Annie Lennox on the song \"Vengeance\" for her new album \"Venus\", which was released in 2007.\nArtistry.\nAs a vocalist, Brown performed in a forceful shout style derived from gospel music. Meanwhile, \"his rhythmic grunts and expressive shrieks harked back farther still to ring shouts, work songs, and field cries\", according to the \"Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History\" (1996): \"He reimported the rhythmic complexity from which rhythm and blues, under the dual pressure of rock 'n' roll and pop, had progressively fallen away since its birth from jazz and blues.\"\nFor many years, Brown's touring show was one of the most extravagant productions in American popular music. At the time of Brown's death, his band included three guitarists, two bass guitar players, two drummers, three horns and a percussionist. The bands that he maintained during the late 1960s and 1970s were of comparable size, and the bands also included a three-piece amplified string section that played during the ballads. Brown employed between 40 and 50 people for the James Brown Revue, and members of the revue traveled with him in a bus to cities and towns all over the country, performing upwards of 330 shows a year with almost all of the shows as one-nighters.\nConcert style.\nBefore James Brown appeared on stage, his personal MC gave him an elaborate introduction accompanied by drumrolls, as the MC worked in Brown's various sobriquets along with the names of many of his hit songs. The introduction by Fats Gonder, captured on Brown's 1963 album \"Live at the Apollo\" is a representative example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So now ladies and gentlemen it is \"Star Time\". Are you ready for \"Star Time?\" Thank you and thank you very kindly. It is indeed a great pleasure to present to you at this particular time, national[ly] and international[ly] known as \"The Hardest-Working Man in Show Business\", the man that sings \"I'll Go Crazy\"...\"Try Me\"...\"You've Got the Power\"...\"Think\"...\"If You Want Me\"...\"I Don't Mind\"...\"Bewildered\"... the million dollar seller, \"Lost Someone\"... the very latest release, \"Night Train\"... let's everybody \"Shout and Shimmy\"... \"Mr. Dynamite\", the amazing \"Mr. Please Please\" himself, the star of the show, James Brown and the Famous Flames!!\nJames Brown's performances were famous for their intensity and length. His own stated goal was to \"give people more than what they came for\u00a0\u2014 make them tired, 'cause \"that's\" what they came for.'\" Brown's concert repertoire consisted mostly of his own hits and recent songs, with a few R&amp;B covers mixed in. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the Mashed Potato into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. His horn players and singing group, The Famous Flames, typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the Revue included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear tuxedoes and cummerbunds long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown's own extravagant outfits and his elaborate processed hairdo completed the visual impression. A James Brown concert typically included a performance by a featured vocalist, such as Vicki Anderson or Marva Whitney, and an instrumental feature for the band, which sometimes served as the opening act for the show.\nA trademark feature of Brown's stage shows, usually during the song \"Please, Please, Please\", involved Brown dropping to his knees while clutching the microphone stand in his hands, prompting the show's longtime MC, Danny Ray, to come out, drape a cape over Brown's shoulders and escort him off the stage after he had worked himself to exhaustion during his performance. As Brown was escorted off the stage by the MC, Brown's vocal group, the Famous Flames continued singing the background vocals: \"Please, please don't go-oh\". Brown would then shake off the cape and stagger back to the microphone to perform an encore. Brown's routine was inspired by a similar one used by the professional wrestler Gorgeous George, as well as Little Richard.\nIn his 2005 autobiography \"I Feel Good: A Memoir in a Life of Soul\", Brown, who was a fan of Gorgeous George, credited the wrestler as the inspiration for both his cape routine and concert attire, stating, \"Seeing him on TV helped create the James Brown you see on stage\". Brown performs a version of the cape routine in the film of the \"T.A.M.I. Show\" (1964) in which he and the Famous Flames upstaged the Rolling Stones, and over the closing credits of the film \"Blues Brothers 2000\". The Police refer to \"James Brown on the \"T.A.M.I. Show\"\" in their 1980 song \"When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best of What's Still Around\".\nBand leadership.\nBrown demanded extreme discipline, perfection and precision from his musicians and dancers\u00a0\u2013 performers in his Revue showed up for rehearsals and members wore the right \"uniform\" or \"costume\" for concert performances. During an interview conducted by Terry Gross during the NPR segment \"Fresh Air\" with Maceo Parker, a former saxophonist in Brown's band for most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s and 1980s, Parker offered his experience with the discipline that Brown demanded of the band:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You gotta be on time. You gotta have your uniform. Your stuff's got to be intact. You gotta have the bow tie. \"You got to have it\". You can't come up without the bow tie. You cannot come up without a cummerbund ... [The] patent leather shoes we were wearing at the time gotta be greased. You just gotta have this stuff. This is what [Brown expected] ... [Brown] bought the costumes. He bought the shoes. And if for some reason [the band member decided] to leave the group, [Brown told the person to] please leave my uniforms . ...\nBrown also had a practice of directing, correcting and assessing fines on members of his band who broke his rules, such as wearing unshined shoes, dancing out of sync or showing up late on stage. During some of his concert performances, Brown danced in front of his band with his back to the audience as he slid across the floor, flashing hand signals and splaying his pulsating fingers to the beat of the music. Although audiences thought Brown's dance routine was part of his act, this practice was actually his way of pointing to the offending member of his troupe who played or sang the wrong note or committed some other infraction. Brown used his splayed fingers and hand signals to alert the offending person of the fine that person must pay to him for breaking his rules.\nBrown's demands on his support acts could be harsh. As Fred Wesley recalled of his time as musical director of the JBs, if Brown felt intimidated by a support act he would try to \"undermine their performances by shortening their sets without notice, demanding that they not do certain showstopping songs, and even insisting on doing the unthinkable, playing drums on some of their songs. A sure set killer.\"\nSocial activism.\nEducation advocacy and humanitarianism.\nBrown's main social activism was in preserving the need for education among youths, influenced by his own troubled childhood and his being forced to drop out of the seventh grade for wearing \"insufficient clothes\". Due to heavy dropout rates in the 1960s, Brown released the pro-education song, \"Don't Be a Drop-Out\". Royalties of the song were donated to dropout-prevention charity programs. The success of this led to Brown meeting with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House. Johnson cited Brown for being a positive role model to the youth. In 1968 James Brown endorsed Hubert Humphrey. Later, Brown gained the confidence of President Richard Nixon, to whom he found he had to explain the plight of Black Americans.\nThroughout the remainder of his life, Brown made public speeches in schools and continued to advocate the importance of education in school. Upon filing his will in 2002, Brown advised that most of the money in his estate go into creating the \"I Feel Good, Inc. Trust\" to benefit disadvantaged children and provide scholarships for his grandchildren. His final single, \"Killing Is Out, School Is In\", advocated against murders of young children in the streets. Brown often gave out money and other items to children while traveling to his childhood hometown of Augusta. A week before his death, while looking gravely ill, Brown gave out toys and turkeys to kids at an Atlanta orphanage, something he had done several times over the years.\nCivil rights and self-reliance.\nThough Brown performed at benefit rallies for civil rights organizations in the mid-1960s, Brown often shied away from discussing civil rights in his songs in fear of alienating his crossover audience. In 1968, in response to a growing urge of anti-war advocacy during the Vietnam War, Brown recorded the song, \"America Is My Home\". In the song, Brown performed a rap, advocating patriotism and exhorting listeners to \"stop pitying yoursel[ves] and get up and fight\". At the time of the song's release, Brown had been performing for troops stationed in Vietnam.\nThe Boston Garden concert.\nOn April 5, 1968, a day after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee, Brown provided a free citywide televised concert at the Boston Garden to maintain public order and calm concerned Boston residents, over the objections of the police chief, who wanted to call off the concert, which he thought would incite violence. The show was later released on DVD as \"\". According to the documentary \"The Night James Brown Saved Boston\", then-mayor Kevin White had strongly restrained the Boston police from cracking down on minor violence and protests after the assassination, while religious and community leaders worked to keep tempers from flaring.\nWhite arranged to have Brown's performance broadcast multiple times on Boston's public television station, WGBH, thus keeping potential rioters off the streets, watching the concert for free. Angered by not being told of this, Brown demanded $60,000 for \"gate\" fees, money he thought would be lost from ticket sales on account of the concert being broadcast for free, and then threatened to go public about the secret arrangement when the city balked at paying up afterwards, news of which would have been a political death blow to White and spark riots of its own. White eventually lobbied a behind-the-scenes power-brokering group known as \"The Vault\" to come up with money for Brown's gate fee and other social programs, contributing $100,000. Brown received $15,000 from them via the city. White also persuaded management at the Garden to give up their share of receipts to make up the differences. Following this successful performance, Brown was counseled by President Johnson to urge cities ravaged from riots following King's assassination to not resort to violence, telling them to \"cool it, there's another way\".\nResponding to pressure from black activists, including H. Rap Brown, to take a bigger stance on their issues and from footage of black on black crime committed in inner cities, Brown wrote the lyrics to the song \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\", which his bandleader Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis accompanied with a musical composition. Released late that summer, the song's lyrics helped to make it an anthem for the civil rights movement. Brown only performed the song sporadically following its initial release, and later stated he had regrets about recording it, saying in 1984, \"Now 'Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud' has done more for the black race than any other record, but if I had my choice, I wouldn't have done it, because I don't like defining anyone by race. To teach race is to teach separatism.\" In his autobiography he stated:\nThe song is obsolete now ... But it was necessary to teach pride then, and I think the song did a lot of good for a lot of people ... People called \"Black and Proud\" militant and angry \u2013 maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees. But really, if you listen to it, it sounds like a children's song. That's why I had children in it, so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride ... The song cost me a lot of my crossover audience. The racial makeup at my concerts was mostly black after that. I don't regret it, though, even if it was misunderstood.\nIn 1969, Brown recorded two more songs of social commentary, \"World\" and \"I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing\", the latter song pleading for equal opportunity and self-reliance rather than entitlement. In 1970, in response to some black leaders for not being outspoken enough, he recorded \"Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved\" and \"Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing\". In 1971, he began touring Africa, including Zambia and Nigeria. He was made \"freeman of the city\" in Lagos, Nigeria, by Oba Adeyinka Oyekan, for his \"influence on black people all over the world\". With his company, James Brown Enterprises, Brown helped to provide jobs for blacks in business in the communities. As the 1970s continued, Brown continued to record songs of social commentary, most prominently 1972's \"King Heroin\" and the two-part ballad \"Public Enemy\", which dealt with drug addiction.\nPolitical views.\nDuring the 1968 presidential campaign, Brown endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey and appeared with Humphrey at political rallies. Brown was labeled an \"Uncle Tom\" for supporting Humphrey and for releasing the pro-American funk song, \"America Is My Home\", in which Brown had lambasted protesters of the Vietnam War as well as the politics of pro-black activists. The same year, Brown openly described black militants as \"very misguided.\" Brown began supporting Republican president Richard Nixon after being invited to perform at Nixon's inaugural ball in January 1969.\nBrown's endorsement of Nixon's campaign during the 1972 presidential election negatively impacted his career during that period with several national Black organizations boycotting his records and protesting at his concert shows; a November 1972 show in Cincinnati was picketed with signs saying, \"James Brown: Nixon's Clown\". Brown initially was invited to perform at a Youth Concert following Nixon's inauguration in January 1973 but bailed out due to the backlash he suffered from supporting Nixon. Brown joined fellow black entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., who faced similar backlash, to back out of the concert. Brown blamed it on \"fatigue\".\nBrown later reversed his support of Nixon and composed the song, \"You Can Have Watergate (Just Gimme Some Bucks And I'll Be Straight)\" as a result. After Nixon resigned from office, Brown composed the 1974 hit, \"Funky President (People It's Bad)\", right after Gerald Ford took Nixon's place. Brown later supported Democratic President Jimmy Carter, attending one of Carter's inaugural balls in 1977. Brown openly supported U.S President Ronald Reagan's reelection in 1984.\nBrown stated he was neither Democratic nor Republican despite his support of Republican presidents such as Nixon and Reagan as well as Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. In 1999, when being interviewed by \"Rolling Stone\", the magazine asked him to name a hero in the 20th century. Brown mentioned John F. Kennedy and then-96-year-old U.S. Senator, and former Dixiecrat, Strom Thurmond, stating \"when the young whippersnappers get out of line, whether Democratic or Republican, an old man can walk up and say 'Wait a minute, son, it goes this way.' And that's great for our country. He's like a grandfather to me.\"\nIn 2003, Brown was the featured attraction of a Washington, D.C., fundraiser for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Following the deaths of Ronald Reagan and his friend Ray Charles, Brown said to CNN, \"I'm kind of in an uproar. I love the country and I got \u2013 you know I've been around a long time, through many presidents and everything. So after losing Mr. Reagan, who I knew very well, then Mr. Ray Charles, who I worked with and lived with like, all our life, we had a show together in Oakland many, many years ago and it's like you found the placard.\" Despite his contrarian political views, Brown mentored black activist Rev. Al Sharpton during the 1970s. Despite being a teenage civil rights activist even before befriending Brown in 1971, Sharpton would in fact become a major protege of Brown, who convinced him to be identified as \"Al Sharpton\" rather than \"Alfred Sharpton\" and who Sharpton also became the tour manager of from 1973 from 1980, during this time. \nIn 2022, Sharpton stated in an interview with \"The Guardian\" that \u201cI learned from James Brown that you\u2019re going to have to be dramatic in order to get people to see things that they are not inclined to see. Especially in New York where you are competing with Broadway lights and Times Square \u2013 we had to do extraordinary things to get attention.\u201d In November 1981, Brown and Sharpton would meet with President Reagan to endorse a national Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1962, Tammi Terrell joined the James Brown Revue. Brown became sexually involved with Terrell\u2014even though she was only 17\u2014in a relationship that continued until she escaped his physical abuse. Bobby Bennett, former member of the Famous Flames, told \"Rolling Stone\" about the abuse he witnessed: \"He beat Tammi Terrell terrible\", said Bennett. \"She was bleeding, shedding blood.\" Terrell, who died in 1970, was Brown's girlfriend before she became famous as Marvin Gaye's singing partner in the mid-1960s. \"Tammi left him because she didn't want her butt whipped\", said Bennett, who also claimed he saw Brown kick one pregnant girlfriend down a flight of stairs.\nMarriages and children.\nBrown was married three times. His first marriage was to Velma Warren in 1953. They had one son together. Over a decade later, the couple had separated. They divorced in 1969. They maintained a close friendship that lasted until Brown's death. After Brown's death, Warren contended that the couple had never legally divorced, but her claim was quickly disproven.\nBrown's second marriage was to Deidre \"Deedee\" Jenkins, on October 22, 1970. They had two daughters together. In 1974, they separated after what his daughter describes as years of domestic abuse. They divorced on January 10, 1981.\nHis third marriage was to Adrienne Lois Rodriguez (March 9, 1950 \u2013 January 6, 1996) in 1984. It was a contentious marriage that made headlines due to domestic abuse complaints. Rodriguez filed for divorce in 1988. Rodriguez died in 1996.\nTomi Rae Hynie.\nBrown hired Tomi Rae Hynie to be a backing singer for his band. On December 23, 2002, Brown, 69, and Hynie, 33, held a wedding ceremony that was officiated by the Rev. Larry Flyer. Following Brown's death, the status of the marriage was disputed by Brown's family. Brown's attorney, Albert \"Buddy\" Dallas, argued that the marriage was not valid. Hynie was still married to Javed Ahmed, a man from Bangladesh. Hynie claimed Ahmed married her to obtain residency through a Green Card, and that the marriage was annulled, but the annulment did not occur until April 2004. In an attempt to prove her marriage to Brown was valid, she provided a marriage certificate as proof of her marriage to Brown during an interview on CNN with Larry King, but she did not provide King with court records pointing to an annulment of her marriage to Brown or to Ahmed.\nAccording to Dallas, Brown was angry and hurt that Hynie had concealed her prior marriage from him, and Brown moved to file for annulment from Hynie. Dallas contended that because Hynie's marriage to Ahmed was annulled after she married Brown, the Brown\u2013Hynie marriage was not valid under South Carolina law because Hynie was already married at the time and Brown and Hynie did not properly marry after Hynie's first prior was annulled. In August 2003, Brown took out a full-page public notice in \"Variety\" featuring Hynie, James II and himself on vacation at Disney World to announce that he and Hynie were going their separate ways.\nOn January 27, 2015, a judge ruled Hynie as Brown's legal widow and that she was now Brown's widow for the purpose of determining the distribution of Brown's estate. The decision was based on the grounds that Hynie's previous marriage was invalid \u2013 because Hynie's previous husband, Ahmed, was already married to several women, negating the legality of Hynie and Ahmed's marriage as bigamist \u2013 and that James Brown had abandoned his efforts to annul his own marriage to Hynie. On June 17, 2020, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Hynie was not legally married to Brown due to her failure to annul her previous marriage. The court ruled that she had no right to any part of his estate.\nChildren.\nBrown had numerous children. He acknowledged 11 of them, including 5 sons\u2014Teddy Brown (1954\u20131973), Terry Brown, Larry Brown, Micheal Brown and James Joseph Brown Jr.\u2014and 6 daughters: LaRhonda Petitt, Dr. Yamma Noyola Brown Lumar, Deanna Brown Thomas, Cinnamon Brown, Jeanette Bellinger and Venisha Brown (1964\u20132018). Brown had eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Brown's eldest son, Teddy, died in a car crash on June 14, 1973.\nAccording to an August 2007, article in the British newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\", DNA tests indicate that Brown also fathered at least three extramarital children. The first one of them to be identified is LaRhonda Pettit (born 1962), a retired flight attendant and teacher who lives in Houston. Another alleged son, Michael Deon Brown, was born in September 1968 to Mary Florence Brown. Despite pleading no contest to a paternity suit brought against him in 1983, Brown never officially acknowledged Michael as his son. During contesting of Brown's will, another of the Brown family attorneys, Debra Opri, told Larry King that James Brown wanted a DNA test performed after his death to confirm the paternity of James Brown Jr. (born 2001)\u2014not for Brown Jr.'s sake but for the sake of the other family members. In April 2007, Hynie selected a guardian ad litem whom she wanted the court to appoint to represent her son, James Brown Jr., in the paternity proceedings. James Brown Jr. was confirmed to be his biological son.\nDrug abuse.\nFor most of his career, Brown had a strict drug- and alcohol-free policy for any member in his entourage, including band members. He would fire people who disobeyed orders, particularly those who used or abused drugs. Although early members of the Famous Flames were fired for using alcohol, Brown often served a highball consisting of Delaware Punch and moonshine at his St. Albans, Queens, house in the mid-1960s. Some of the original members of Brown's 1970s band, the J.B.'s, including Catfish and Bootsy Collins, intentionally took LSD during a performance in 1971, causing Brown to fire them after the show because he had suspected them of being on drugs all along.\nAide Bob Patton has asserted that he accidentally shared a PCP-laced cannabis joint with Brown in the mid-1970s and \"hallucinated for hours\", although Brown \"talked about it as if it was only marijuana he was smoking\". By the mid-1980s, it was widely alleged that Brown was using drugs, with Vicki Anderson confirming to journalist Barney Hoskyns that Brown's regular use of PCP, colloquially known as \"angel dust\", \"began before 1982\". After he met and later married Adrienne Rodriguez in 1984, she and Brown began using PCP together.\nThis drug usage often resulted in violent outbursts from him, and he was arrested several times for domestic violence against Rodriguez while high on the drug. By January 1988, Brown faced four criminal charges within a 12-month span relating to driving, PCP, and gun possession. After an April 1988 arrest for domestic abuse, Brown went on the CNN program \"Sonia Live in L.A.\" with host Sonia Friedman. The interview became notorious for Brown's irreverent demeanor, with some asserting that Brown was high.\nOne of Brown's former mistresses recalled in a \"GQ\" magazine article about Brown, some years after his death, that Brown would smoke PCP, \"until that got hard to find\", and cocaine, mixed with tobacco in Kool cigarettes. He engaged in the off-label use of sildenafil, maintaining that it gave him \"extra energy\". Once, while traveling in a car under the influence of PCP, which he continued to procure dependent on its availability, Brown alleged that passing trees contained psychotronic surveillance technology.\nIn January 1998, he spent a week in rehab to deal with an addiction to unspecified prescription drugs. A week after his release, he was arrested for an unlawful use of a handgun and possession of cannabis. Prior to his death in December 2006, traces of cocaine were found in the singer's urine, when Brown entered Emory University Hospital. His widow suggested Brown would \"do crack\" with a female acquaintance.\nLegal issues.\nTheft and assault convictions.\nBrown's personal life was marred by numerous brushes with the law. At the age of 16, he was convicted of theft, and served three years in juvenile prison. In 1963, during a concert held at Club 15 in Macon, Georgia, while Otis Redding was performing alongside his former band Johnny Jenkins and the Pinetoppers, Brown, reportedly wielding two shotguns, tried to shoot his musical rival Joe Tex. \nThe incident led to multiple people being shot and stabbed. Since Brown was still on parole at the time, he relied on his agent Clint Brantley \"and a few thousand dollars to make the situation disappear\". According to Jenkins, \"seven people got shot\", and after the shootout ended, a man appeared and gave \"each one of the injured a hundred dollars apiece not to carry it no further and not to talk to the press\". Brown was never charged for the incident.\nOn July 16, 1978, after performing at the Apollo, Brown was arrested for reportedly failing to turn in records from one of his radio stations after the station was forced to file for bankruptcy.\nBrown was arrested on April 3, 1988, for assault, and again in May 1988 on drug and weapons charges, and again on September 24, 1988, following a high-speed car chase on Interstate 20 near the Georgia\u2013South Carolina state border. He was convicted of carrying an unlicensed pistol and assaulting a police officer, along with various drug-related and driving offenses. He was sentenced to six years in prison. He was released on parole on February 27, 1991, after serving two years of his sentence. Brown's FBI file, released to \"The Washington Post\" in 2007 under the Freedom of Information Act, related Brown's claim that the high-speed chase did not occur as claimed by the police, and that local police shot at his car several times during an incident of police harassment, and assaulted him after his arrest. Local authorities found no merit to Brown's accusations.\nIn 1998, a woman named Mary Simons accused Brown in a civil suit of holding her captive for three days, demanding oral sex and firing a gun in his office. Simons's charge was eventually dismissed. Another civil suit, filed by former background singer Lisa Rushton, alleged that between 1994 and 1999, Brown allegedly demanded sexual favors, and when refused, would cut off her pay and kept her offstage. She claimed that Brown would \"place a hand on her buttocks and loudly told her in a crowded restaurant to not look or speak to any other man besides himself\". Rushton eventually withdrew her lawsuit. In another civil suit, a woman named Lisa Agbalaya, who worked for Brown, said the singer would tell her he had \"bull testicles\", handed her a pair of zebra-print underwear, told her to wear them while he massaged her with oil, and fired her after she refused. A Los Angeles jury cleared the singer of sexual harassment, but found him liable for wrongful termination.\nThe police were summoned to Brown's residence on July 3, 2000, after he was accused of charging at an electric company repairman with a steak knife, when the repairman visited Brown's house to investigate a complaint about having no lights at the residence. In 2003, Brown was pardoned by the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services for past crimes that he was convicted of committing in South Carolina.\nDomestic violence arrests.\nBrown was repeatedly arrested for domestic violence. On four occasions between 1987 and 1995, Brown was arrested on charges of assault against his third wife, Adrienne Rodriguez. In one incident, Rodriguez reported to authorities that Brown beat her with an iron pipe and shot at her car. Rodriguez was hospitalized after the last assault in October 1995. Charges were dropped after she died in January 1996.\nIn January 2004, Brown was arrested in South Carolina on a domestic violence charge, after Tomi Rae Hynie accused him of pushing her to the floor during an argument at their home, where she suffered scratches and bruises to her right arm and hip. In June, Brown pleaded no contest to the domestic violence incident, but served no jail time. Instead, Brown was required to forfeit a US$1,087 bond as punishment.\nRape accusation.\nIn January 2005, a woman named Jacque Hollander filed a lawsuit against James Brown, which stemmed from an alleged 1988 rape. When the case was initially heard before a judge in 2002, Hollander's claims against Brown were dismissed by the court as the limitations period for filing the suit had expired. Hollander claimed that stress from the alleged assault later caused her to develop Graves' disease, a chronic thyroid condition. Hollander claimed that the incident took place in South Carolina while she was employed by Brown as a publicist. Hollander alleged that, during her ride in a van with Brown, Brown pulled over to the side of the road and sexually assaulted her while he threatened her with a shotgun.\nIn her case against Brown, Hollander entered as evidence a DNA sample and a polygraph result. The evidence was not considered due to the limitations defense. Hollander later attempted to bring her case before the South Carolina Supreme Court, but nothing came of her complaint.\nLater life.\nAt the end of his life, James Brown lived in Beech Island, South Carolina, directly across the Savannah River from Augusta, Georgia. According to his longtime manager Charles Bobbit, Brown had been living with Type 2 diabetes, which went undiagnosed for years. In 2004, Brown was successfully treated for prostate cancer. Regardless of his health, Brown maintained his reputation as the \"hardest working man in show business\" by keeping up with his grueling performance schedule.\nIllness.\nOn December 23, 2006, Brown became very ill and arrived at his dentist's office in Atlanta, Georgia, several hours late. His appointment was for dental implant work. During that visit, Brown's dentist observed that he looked \"very bad ... weak and dazed\". Instead of performing the work, the dentist advised Brown to see a physician right away about his medical condition.\nThe following day, Brown went to the Emory Crawford Long Memorial Hospital for medical evaluation and was admitted for observation and treatment. According to Charles Bobbit, his longtime personal manager and friend, Brown had been struggling with a noisy cough since returning from a November trip to Europe. Yet, Bobbit said, the singer had a history of never complaining about being sick and often performed while ill.\nAlthough Brown had to cancel upcoming concerts in Waterbury, Connecticut, and Englewood, New Jersey, he was confident that the doctor would discharge him from the hospital in time for his scheduled New Year's Eve shows at the Count Basie Theatre in New Jersey and the B. B. King Blues Club in New York, in addition to performing a song live on CNN for the Anderson Cooper New Year's Eve special. Brown remained hospitalized and his condition worsened throughout the day.\nDeath.\nBrown died at approximately 1:45\u00a0a.m. EST (06:45 UTC) on Christmas Day 2006, at age 73, from congestive heart failure, resulting from complications of pneumonia. Bobbit was at his bedside and later reported that Brown stuttered, \"I'm going away tonight\", then took three long, quiet breaths and fell asleep before dying.\nThen-President George W. Bush released a statement calling the musician \"an American original.\"\nIn February 2019, an investigation by CNN and other journalists led to suggestions that Brown had been murdered.\nMemorial services.\nAfter Brown's death, his relatives, a host of celebrities and thousands of fans gathered, on December 28, 2006, for a public memorial service at the Apollo Theater in New York City and, on December 30, 2006, at the James Brown Arena in Augusta, Georgia. A separate, private ceremony was held in North Augusta, South Carolina, on December 29, 2006, with Brown's family in attendance. Celebrities at these various memorial events included Michael Jackson, Jimmy Cliff, Joe Frazier, Buddy Guy, Ice Cube, Ludacris, Dr. Dre, Little Richard, Dick Gregory, MC Hammer, Prince, Jesse Jackson, Ice-T, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bootsy Collins, LL Cool J, Lil Wayne, Lenny Kravitz, 50 Cent, Stevie Wonder and Don King. Rev. Al Sharpton officiated at all of Brown's public and private memorial services.\nBrown's memorial ceremonies were all elaborate, complete with costume changes for the deceased and videos featuring him in concert. His body, placed in a Promethean casket\u2014bronze polished to a golden shine\u2014was driven through the streets of New York to the Apollo Theater in a white, glass-encased horse-drawn carriage. In Augusta, Georgia, his memorial procession stopped to pay respects at his statue, en route to the James Brown Arena. During the public memorial there, a video showed Brown's last performance in Augusta, Georgia, with the Ray Charles version of \"Georgia on My Mind\" playing soulfully in the background.\nHis last backup band, the Soul Generals, played some of his hits during the tribute at the arena. The group was joined by Bootsy Collins on bass, with MC Hammer performing a dance in James Brown style. Former Temptations lead singer Ali-Ollie Woodson performed \"Walk Around Heaven All Day\" at the memorial services. Brown was buried in a crypt at his daughter's home in Beech Island, South Carolina.\nLast will and testament.\nBrown signed his last will and testament on August 1, 2000, before J. Strom Thurmond Jr., an attorney for the estate. The irrevocable trust, separate and apart from Brown's will, was created on his behalf, that same year, by his attorney, Albert \"Buddy\" Dallas, one of three personal representatives of Brown's estate. His will covered the disposition of his personal assets, such as clothing, cars, and jewelry, while the irrevocable trust covered the disposition of the music rights, business assets of James Brown Enterprises, and his Beech Island, South Carolina estate.\nDuring the reading of the will on January 11, 2007, Thurmond revealed that Brown's six adult living children, Terry Brown, Larry Brown, Daryl Brown, Yamma Brown Lumar, Deanna Brown Thomas and Venisha Brown, were named in the document. Hynie and James II were not mentioned as heirs. Brown's will was signed 10 months before James II was born and more than a year before Brown's marriage to Tomi Rae Hynie. Like Brown's will, his irrevocable trust omitted Hynie and James II as recipients of Brown's property. The irrevocable trust had been established before, and not amended since, the birth of James II.\nOn January 24, 2007, Brown's children filed a lawsuit, petitioning the court to remove the personal representatives from the estate, including Brown's attorney, as well as trustee Albert \"Buddy\" Dallas, and appoint a special administrator because of perceived impropriety and alleged mismanagement of Brown's assets. On January 31, 2007, Hynie filed a lawsuit against Brown's estate, challenging the validity of the will and the irrevocable trust. Hynie's suit asked the court both to recognize her as Brown's widow and to appoint a special administrator for the estate.\nOn January 27, 2015, Judge Doyet Early III ruled that Tomi Rae Hynie Brown was officially the widow of James Brown. The decision was based on the grounds that Hynie's previous marriage was invalid and that James Brown had abandoned his efforts to annul his own marriage to Hynie.\nOn February 19, 2015, the South Carolina Supreme Court intervened, halting all lower court actions in the estate and undertaking to review previous actions itself. The South Carolina Court of Appeals in July 2018 ruled that Hynie was, in fact, Mr. Brown's wife. In 2020, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Hynie had not been legally married to Brown and did not have a right to his estate. It was reported in July 2021 that Brown's family had reached a settlement ending the 15-year battle over the estate.\nLegacy.\nBrown received awards and honors throughout his lifetime and after his death. In 1993, the City Council of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, conducted a poll of residents to choose a new name for the bridge that crossed the Yampa River on Shield Drive. The winning name, with 7,717 votes, was \"James Brown Soul Center of the Universe Bridge\". The bridge was officially dedicated in September 1993, and Brown appeared at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the event. A petition was started by local ranchers to return the name to \"Stockbridge\" for historical reasons, but they backed off after citizens defeated their efforts because of the popularity of Brown's name. Brown returned to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on July 4, 2002, for an outdoor festival, performing with bands such as the String Cheese Incident.\nDuring his long career, Brown received many prestigious music industry awards and honors. In 1983 he was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Brown was one of the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction dinner in New York on January 23, 1986. At that time, the members of his original vocal group, the Famous Flames, Bobby Byrd, Johnny Terry, Bobby Bennett, and Lloyd Stallworth, were not inducted. On April 14, 2012, the Famous Flames were automatically and retroactively inducted into the Hall of Fame alongside Brown, without the need for nomination and voting, on the basis that they should have been inducted with him in 1986.\nOn February 25, 1992, Brown was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 34th annual Grammy Awards. Exactly a year later, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 4th annual Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation Pioneer Awards. A ceremony was held for Brown on January 10, 1997, to honor him with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nOn June 15, 2000, Brown was honored as an inductee to the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame. On August 6, 2002, he was honored as the first BMI Urban Icon at the BMI Urban Awards. His BMI accolades include an impressive ten R&amp;B Awards and six Pop Awards. On November 14, 2006, Brown was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and he was one of several inductees to perform at the ceremony. In recognition of his accomplishments as an entertainer, Brown was a recipient of Kennedy Center Honors on December 7, 2003. In 2004 \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked James Brown as No. 7 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Rick Rubin wrote in appreciation: In one sense, James Brown is like Johnny Cash. Johnny is considered one of the kings of country music, but there are a lot of people who like Johnny but don't like country music. It's the same with James Brown and R&amp;B. His music is singular \u2014 the feel and tone of it. James Brown is his own genre. He was a great editor \u2014 as a songwriter, producer and bandleader. He kept things sparse. He knew that was important. And he had the best players, the funkiest of all bands. If Clyde Stubblefield had been drumming on a Motown session, they would not have let him play what he did with James on \"Funky Drummer.\" James's vision allowed that music to get out. And the music always came from the groove, whereas for so many R&amp;B and Motown artists at the time it was more about conventional songs. James Brown's songs are not conventional. \"I Got You,\" \"Out of Sight\" \u2014 they are ultimately vehicles for unique, even bizarre grooves... I first saw James Brown around 1980, between my junior and senior years in high school. It was in Boston. It was in a catering hall, with folding chairs. And it was one of the greatest musical experiences of my life. His dancing and singing were incredible, and he played a Hammond B3 organ tufted with red leather, with \"Godfather\" in studs written across the front.\nIn a 2010 article for \"Rolling Stone\", Robert Christgau called Brown \"the greatest musician of the rock era\". He appeared on the BET Awards June 24, 2003, and received the Lifetime Achievement Award presented by Michael Jackson, and performed with him. In 2004, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Aretha Franklin.\nBrown was honored in his hometown of Augusta, Georgia, for his philanthropy and civic activities. In November 1993, Mayor Charles DeVaney of Augusta held a ceremony to dedicate a section of 9th Street between Broad and Twiggs Streets, renamed \"James Brown Boulevard\", in the entertainer's honor. In May 2005, as a 72nd birthday present for Brown, the city of Augusta unveiled a life-sized bronze James Brown statue on Broad Street. The statue was to have been dedicated a year earlier, but the ceremony was put on hold because of a domestic abuse charge that Brown faced at the time.\nIn 2005, Charles \"Champ\" Walker and the We Feel Good Committee went before the County commission and received approval to change Augusta's slogan to \"We Feel Good\". Afterward, officials renamed the city's civic center the James Brown Arena. James Brown attended a ceremony for the unveiling of the namesake center on October 15, 2006.\nOn December 30, 2006, during the public memorial service at the James Brown Arena, Shirley A. R. Lewis, president of Paine College, a historically black college in Augusta, Georgia, posthumously bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Brown, in recognition and honor of his many contributions to the school in its times of need. Brown had originally been scheduled to receive the honorary doctorate from Paine College during its May 2007 commencement.\nDuring the 49th Annual Grammy Awards presentation on February 11, 2007, James Brown's famous cape was draped over a microphone by Danny Ray at the end of a montage in honor of notable people in the music industry who died during the previous year. Earlier that evening, Christina Aguilera delivered an impassioned performance of Brown's hit \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" followed by a standing ovation, while Chris Brown performed a dance routine in honor of James Brown.\nIn August 2013, the R&amp;B Music Hall of Fame honored and inducted James Brown at a ceremony held at the Waetjen Auditorium at Cleveland State University.\nART THE BOX began in early 2015 as a collaboration between three organizations: the City of Augusta, the Downtown Development Authority and the Greater Augusta Arts Council. 19 local artists were selected by a committee to create art on 23 local traffic signal control cabinets (TSCCs). A competition was held to create the James Brown Tribute Box on the corner of James Brown Blvd. (9th Ave.) and Broad St. This box was designed and painted by local artist, Ms. Robbie Pitts Bellamy and has become a favorite photo opportunity to visitors and locals in Augusta, Georgia.\n\"I have a lot of musical heroes but I think James Brown is at the top of the list\", remarked Public Enemy's Chuck D. \"Absolutely the funkiest man on Earth ... In a black household, James Brown is part of the fabric \u2013 Motown, Stax, Atlantic and James Brown.\" Tom Waits recalls \"I first saw James Brown in 1962 at an outdoor theatre in San Diego and it was indescribable... it was like putting a finger in a light socket... It was really like seeing mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Christmas.\" In 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Brown at No. 44 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nOn April 24, 2023, James Brown was inducted into the newly established Atlantic City Walk Of Fame presented by The National R&amp;B Music Society Inc. Brown's daughter Deanna Brown Thomas accepted the honor on his behalf. The unveiling and induction ceremony took place at Brighton Park in Atlantic City, NJ. Brown was inducted by Bowlegged Lou of the production team Full Force. Other inductees included, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, The Delfonics and Grover Washington Jr.\nTributes.\nAs a tribute to James Brown, the Rolling Stones covered the song, \"I'll Go Crazy\" from Brown's \"Live at the Apollo\" album, during their 2007 European tour. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page has remarked, \"He [James Brown] was almost a musical genre in his own right and he changed and moved forward the whole time so people were able to learn from him.\"\nOn December 22, 2007, the first annual \"Tribute Fit For the King of King Records\" in honor of James Brown was held at the Madison Theater in Covington, Kentucky. The tribute, organized by Bootsy Collins, featured Tony Wilson as Young James Brown with appearances by Afrika Bambaataa, Chuck D of Public Enemy, the Soul Generals, Buckethead, Freekbass, Triage and many of Brown's surviving family members. Comedian Michael Coyer was the MC for the event. During the show, the mayor of Cincinnati proclaimed December 22 as James Brown Day.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn other media.\nGames\nTelevision\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

He is known principally for being the Editor of the Request for Comment (RFC) document series, for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and for administering the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) until his death.\nDuring his lifetime he was referred to as the \"god of the Internet\" for his comprehensive influence; Postel himself noted that this \"compliment\" came with a barb, the suggestion that he should be replaced by a \"professional,\" and responded with typical self-effacing matter-of-factness: \"Of course, there isn\u2019t any 'God of the Internet.' The Internet works because a lot of people cooperate to do things together.\"\nCareer.\nPostel attended Van Nuys High School, and then UCLA where he earned his B.S. (1966) as well as his M.S. (1968) in Engineering. There he completed his Ph.D. in computer science in 1974, with Dave Farber as his thesis advisor.\nPostel started work at UCLA on 23 December 1969 as a Postgraduate Research Engineer (I) where he was involved in early work on the ARPANET. He was involved in the development of the Internet domain system and, at his instigation, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed a second set of protocols for handling data between networks, which is now known as Internet protocol suite. Together with Cerf and Steve Crocker, Postel worked on implementing most of the ARPANET protocols. Cerf would later become one of the principal designers of the TCP/IP standard, which works because of the sentence known as Postel's Law.\nPostel worked with ARPANET until 24 August 1973 when he left to join MITRE Corporation. He assisted with Network Information Center, which was being set up at SRI by Elizabeth Feinler. In March 1977, he joined the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California as a research scientist.\nPostel was the RFC Editor from 1969 until his death, and wrote and edited many important RFCs, including RFC 791, RFC 792 and RFC 793, which define the basic protocols of the Internet protocol suite, and RFC 2223, \"Instructions to RFC Authors\". Between 1982 and 1984 Postel co-authored the RFCs which became the foundation of today's DNS (RFC 819, RFC 881, RFC 882 and RFC 920) which were joined in 1995 by RFC 1591 which he also co-wrote. In total, he wrote or co-authored more than 20 RFCs.\nPostel served on the Internet Architecture Board and its predecessors for many years. He was the Director of the names and number assignment clearinghouse, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), from its inception. He was the first member of the Internet Society, and was on its Board of Trustees. He was the original and long-time .us Top-Level Domain administrator. He also managed the Los Nettos Network.\nAll of the above were part-time activities he assumed in conjunction with his primary position as Director of the Computer Networks Division, Division 7, of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.\nDNS Root Authority test, U.S. response.\nOn January 28, 1998, Postel, as a test, emailed eight of the twelve operators of Internet's regional root nameservers on his own authority and instructed them to reconfigure their servers, changing the root zone server from then SAIC subsidiary Network Solutions' A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (198.41.0.4) to IANA's DNSROOT.IANA.ORG (198.32.1.98). The operators complied with Postel's instructions, thus dividing control of Internet naming between the non-government operators with IANA and the 4 remaining U.S. Government roots at NASA, DoD, and BRL with NSI. Though usage of the Internet was not interrupted, Postel was threatened by US Presidential science advisor Ira Magaziner with the statement \"You'll never work on the Internet again\" and was ordered to end the test, which he did. Within a week, the US NTIA issued \"A proposal to improve technical management of Internet names and addresses\", including changes to authority over the Internet DNS root zone, which ultimately, and controversially, increased U.S. control.\nDeath.\nOn October 16, 1998, Postel died of complications from heart surgery in Los Angeles. He was recovering from a surgery to replace a leaking heart valve.\nLegacy.\nThe significance of Jon Postel's contributions to building the Internet, both technical and personal, were such that a memorial recollection of his life and his work forms part of the core technical literature sequence of the Internet in the form of , written by Vint Cerf.\nThe Postel Center at Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, is named in his honor, as is the annual Postel Award. In 2012, Postel was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. The Channel Islands' Domain Registry building was named after him in early 2016.\nAnother tribute, , was written by Danny Cohen.\nPerhaps his most famous legacy is from , which includes a robustness principle often called Postel's law: \"an implementation should be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior\" (reworded in as: \"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.\").\nThe \"Jonathan B. Postel Service Award\" is an award named after Postel. The award has been presented most years since 1999 by the Internet Society to \"honor a person who has made outstanding contributions in service to the data communications community.\" The first recipient of the award was Postel himself, posthumously. The award was created by Vint Cerf as chairman of the Internet Society and announced in \"I remember IANA\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During Easter, the name is (from ', \"Easter\"). During the rest of the year, it is sometimes sold under the name \"must\". The content is the same regardless of the marketing name, and the drink is most closely associated with Christmas. 45 million litres of \"julmust\" are consumed during December, which is around 50% of the total soft drink volume in December and 75% of the total yearly must sales. Must was created by Harry Roberts and his father Robert Roberts in 1910 as a non-alcoholic alternative to beer.\nIngredients.\nThe syrup is still made exclusively by Roberts in \u00d6rebro. The syrup is sold to different soft drink manufacturers who then make the final product in their own way. This means that the must from different companies does not taste the same, although they are made of the same syrup. \nMust is made of carbonated water, sugar, hop extract, malt extract, spices, caramel colouring, citric acid, and preservatives. The hops and malt extracts give the must a somewhat root beer-like taste without the sassafras \u2013 or British/Caribbean malt drinks such as Supermalt. It can be aged provided it is stored in a glass bottle. Some people buy \"julmust\" in December only to store it a year before drinking it. In 2013, a rumour occurred that the EU would ban julmust due to a directive banning the selling of malt beverages containing caramel colouring. The rumour however turned out to be false since julmust is not a fermented beverage and hence not affected by the directive.\n\"Julmust\" and Coca-Cola.\nIn Sweden, \"julmust\" outsells Coca-Cola during the Christmas season; in fact, the consumption of Coca-Cola drops by as much as 50% over the holiday. This was quoted as one of the main reasons that The Coca-Cola Company broke away from their contract with the local brewer Pripps and started Coca-Cola Drycker Sverige AB instead. Coca-Cola Drycker Sverige AB produced its own \"julmust\", with The Coca-Cola Company's name occupying only a small space on the label. Their \"julmust\" was never advertised until 2004, when Coca-Cola started marketing their \"julmust\" under the brand \"Bj\u00e4re julmust\", but they bought the syrup from Roberts AB. By 2007, the \"Bj\u00e4re julmust\" was only sold at McDonald's restaurants and it had completely disappeared from Coca-Colas range of products by Christmas 2008, only to return for Christmas 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15770", "revid": "50675200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15770", "title": "Jules Verne", "text": "French writer (1828\u20131905)\nJules Gabriel Verne (; ; 8 February 1828 \u2013 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright. \nHis collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the \"Voyages extraordinaires\", a series of bestselling adventure novels including \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" (1864), \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\" (1870), and \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" (1872). His novels are generally set in the second half of the 19th century, taking into account contemporary scientific knowledge and the technological advances of the time.\nIn addition to his novels, he wrote numerous plays, short stories, autobiographical accounts, poetry, songs, and scientific, artistic and literary studies. His work has been adapted for film and television since the beginning of cinema, as well as for comic books, theater, opera, music and video games.\nVerne is considered to be an important author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. His reputation was markedly different in the Anglosphere where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children's books, largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed. Since the 1980s, his literary reputation has improved.\nJules Verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979, ranking below Agatha Christie and above William Shakespeare. He has sometimes been called the \"father of science fiction\", a title that has also been given to H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback. In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared \"Jules Verne Year\" on the occasion of the centenary of the writer's death.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nVerne was born on 8 February 1828, on \u00cele Feydeau, a then small artificial island on the river Loire within the town of Nantes (later filled in and incorporated into the surrounding land area), in No. 4 Rue Olivier-de-Clisson, the house of his maternal grandmother Dame Sophie Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Julienne Allotte de La Fu\u00ffe (born Guillochet de La Perri\u00e8re). His parents were Pierre Verne, an \"avou\u00e9\" originally from Provins, and Sophie Allotte de La Fu\u00ffe, a Nantes woman from a local family of navigators and shipowners, of distant Scottish descent. In 1829, the Verne family moved some hundred metres away to No. 2 Quai Jean-Bart, where Verne's brother Paul was born the same year. Three sisters, Anne \"Anna\" (1836), Mathilde (1839), and Marie (1842), followed.\nIn 1834, at the age of six, Verne was sent to boarding school at 5 Place du Bouffay in Nantes. The teacher, Madame Sambin, was the widow of a naval captain who had disappeared some 30 years before. Madame Sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like Robinson Crusoe from his desert island paradise. The theme of the robinsonade would stay with Verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels, some of which include \"The Mysterious Island\" (1874), \"The Castaways of the Flag\" (1900), and \"The School for Robinsons\" (1882).\nIn 1836, Verne went on to \u00c9cole Saint\u2011Stanislas, a Catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father. Verne quickly distinguished himself in \"m\u00e9moire\" (recitation from memory), geography, Greek, Latin, and singing. In the same year, 1836, Pierre Verne bought a vacation house at 29 Rue des R\u00e9form\u00e9s in the village of Chantenay (now part of Nantes) on the Loire. In his brief memoir \"Souvenirs d'enfance et de jeunesse\" (\"Memories of Childhood and Youth\", 1890), Verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many merchant vessels navigating it. He also took vacations at Brains, in the house of his uncle Prudent Allotte, a retired shipowner, who had gone around the world and served as mayor of Brains from 1828 to 1837. Verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the Game of the Goose with his uncle, and both the game and his uncle's name would be memorialized in two late novels (\"The Will of an Eccentric\" (1900) and \"Robur the Conqueror\" (1886), respectively).\nLegend has it that in 1839, at the age of 11, Verne secretly procured a spot as cabin boy on the three-mast ship \"Coralie\" with the intention of traveling to the Indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin Caroline. The evening the ship set out for the Indies, it stopped first at Paimb\u0153uf where Pierre Verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel \"only in his imagination\". It is now known that the legend is an exaggerated tale invented by Verne's first biographer, his niece Marguerite Allotte de la F\u00fcye, though it may have been inspired by a real incident.\nIn 1840, the Vernes moved again to a large apartment at No. 6 Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, where the family's youngest child, Marie, was born in 1842. In the same year Verne entered another religious school, the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Saint-Donatien, as a lay student. His unfinished novel \"Un pr\u00eatre en 1839\" (\"A Priest in 1839\"), written in his teens and the earliest of his prose works to survive, describes the seminary in disparaging terms. From 1844 to 1846, Verne and his brother were enrolled in the Lyc\u00e9e Royal (now the Lyc\u00e9e Georges-Clemenceau) in Nantes. After finishing classes in rhetoric and philosophy, he took the baccalaur\u00e9at at Rennes and received the grade \"Good Enough\" on 29 July 1846.\nBy 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of Victor Hugo, beginning \"Un pr\u00eatre en 1839\" and seeing two verse tragedies, \"Alexandre VI\" and \"La Conspiration des poudres\" (\"The Gunpowder Plot\"), to completion. However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice.\nIn 1847, Verne's father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in law school, and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes. His cousin Caroline, with whom he was in love, was married on 27 April 1847, to \u00c9mile Dezaunay, a man of 40, with whom she would have five children.\nAfter a short stay in Paris, where he passed first-year law exams, Verne returned to Nantes for his father's help in preparing for the second year. (Provincial law students were in that era required to go to Paris to take exams.) While in Nantes, he met Rose Herminie Arnaud Grosseti\u00e8re, a young woman one year his senior, and fell intensely in love with her. He wrote and dedicated some thirty poems to her, including \"La Fille de l'air\" (\"The Daughter of Air\"), which describes her as \"blonde and enchanting / winged and transparent\". His passion seems to have been reciprocated, at least for a short time, but Grosseti\u00e8re's parents frowned upon the idea of their daughter marrying a young student of uncertain future. They married her instead to Armand Terrien de la Haye, a rich landowner ten years her senior, on 19 July 1848.\nThe sudden marriage sent Verne into deep frustration. He wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother, apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness, in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery. This requited but aborted love affair seems to have permanently marked the author and his work, and his novels include a significant number of young women married against their will (G\u00e9rande in \"Master Zacharius\" (1854), Sava in \"Mathias Sandorf\" (1885), Ellen in \"A Floating City\" (1871), etc.), to such an extent that the scholar Christian Chelebourg attributed the recurring theme to a \"Hermione complex\". The incident also led Verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and Nantes society, which he criticized in his poem \"La sixi\u00e8me ville de France\" (\"The Sixth City of France\").\nStudies in Paris.\nIn July 1848, Verne left Nantes again for Paris, where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession. He obtained permission from his father to rent a furnished apartment at 24 Rue de l'Ancienne-Com\u00e9die, which he shared with \u00c9douard Bonamy, another student of Nantes origin. (On his 1847 Paris visit, Verne had stayed at 2 Rue Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, the house of his aunt Charuel, on the Butte Saint-Roch.)\nVerne arrived in Paris during a time of political upheaval: the French Revolution of 1848. In February, Louis Philippe I had been overthrown and had fled; on 24 February, a provisional government of the French Second Republic took power, but political demonstrations continued, and social tension remained. In June, barricades went up in Paris, and the government sent Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac to crush the insurrection. Verne entered the city shortly before the election of Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte as the first president of the Republic, a state of affairs that would last until the French coup of 1851. In a letter to his family, Verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent June Days uprising but assured them that the anniversary of Bastille Day had gone by without any significant conflict.\nVerne used his family connections to make an entrance into Paris society. His uncle Francisque de Chat\u00eaaubourg introduced him into literary salons, and Verne particularly frequented those of Mme de Barr\u00e8re, a friend of his mother's. While continuing his law studies, he fed his passion for the theater, writing numerous plays. Verne later recalled: \"I was greatly under the influence of Victor Hugo, indeed, very excited by reading and re-reading his works. At that time I could have recited by heart whole pages of \"Notre Dame de Paris\", but it was his dramatic work that most influenced me.\" Another source of creative stimulation came from a neighbor: living on the same floor in the Rue de l'Ancienne-Com\u00e9die apartment house was a young composer, Aristide Hignard, with whom Verne soon became good friends, and Verne wrote several texts for Hignard to set as chansons.\nDuring this period, Verne's letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent stomach cramps, the first of many he would suffer from during his life. (Modern scholars have hypothesized that he suffered from colitis; Verne believed the illness to have been inherited from his mother's side.) Rumors of an outbreak of cholera in March 1849 exacerbated these medical concerns. Yet another health problem would strike in 1851 when Verne suffered the first of four attacks of facial paralysis. These attacks, rather than being psychosomatic, were due to an inflammation in the middle ear, though this cause remained unknown to Verne during his life.\nIn the same year, Verne was required to enlist in the French army, but the sortition process spared him, to his great relief. He wrote to his father: \"You should already know, dear papa, what I think of the military life, and of these domestic servants in livery. ... You have to abandon all dignity to perform such functions.\" Verne's strong antiwar sentiments, to the dismay of his father, would remain steadfast throughout his life.\nThough writing profusely and frequenting the salons, Verne diligently pursued his law studies and graduated with a \"licence en droit\" in January 1851.\nLiterary debut.\nThanks to his visits to salons, Verne came into contact in 1849 with Alexandre Dumas through the mutual acquaintance of a celebrated chirologist of the time, the Chevalier d'Arpentigny. Verne became close friends with Dumas' son, Alexandre Dumas fils, and showed him a manuscript for a stage comedy, \"Les Pailles rompues\" (\"The Broken Straws\"). The two young men revised the play together, and Dumas, through arrangements with his father, had it produced by the Op\u00e9ra-National at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique in Paris, opening on 12 June 1850.\nIn 1851, Verne met with a fellow writer from Nantes, Pierre-Michel-Fran\u00e7ois Chevalier (known as \"Pitre-Chevalier\"), the editor-in-chief of the magazine \"Mus\u00e9e des familles\" (\"The Family Museum\"). Pitre-Chevalier was looking for articles about geography, history, science, and technology, and was keen to make sure that the educational component would be made accessible to large popular audiences using a straightforward prose style or an engaging fictional story. Verne, with his delight in diligent research, especially in geography, was a natural for the job. Verne first offered him a short historical adventure story, \"The First Ships of the Mexican Navy\", written in the style of James Fenimore Cooper, whose novels had deeply influenced him. Pitre-Chevalier published it in July 1851, and in the same year published a second short story by Verne, \"A Voyage in a Balloon\" (August 1851). The latter story, with its combination of adventurous narrative, travel themes, and detailed historical research, would later be described by Verne as \"the first indication of the line of novel that I was destined to follow\".\nDumas fils put Verne in contact with Jules Seveste, a stage director who had taken over the directorship of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique and renamed it the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique. Seveste offered Verne the job of secretary of the theater, with little or no salary attached. Verne accepted, using the opportunity to write and produce several comic operas written in collaboration with Hignard and the prolific librettist Michel Carr\u00e9. To celebrate his employment at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique, Verne joined with ten friends to found a bachelors' dining club, the \"Onze-sans-femme\" (\"Eleven Bachelors\").\nFor some time, Verne's father pressed him to abandon his writing and begin a business as a lawyer. However, Verne argued in his letters that he could only find success in literature. The pressure to plan for a secure future in law reached its climax in January 1852, when his father offered Verne his own Nantes law practice. Faced with this ultimatum, Verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job, writing: \"Am I not right to follow my own instincts? It's because I know who I am that I realize what I can be one day.\"\nMeanwhile, Verne was spending much time at the , conducting research for his stories and feeding his passion for science and recent discoveries, especially in geography. It was in this period that Verne met the illustrious geographer and explorer Jacques Arago, who continued to travel extensively despite his blindness (he had lost his sight completely in 1837). The two men became good friends, and Arago's innovative and witty accounts of his travels led Verne toward a newly developing genre of literature: that of travel writing.\nIn 1852, two new pieces from Verne appeared in the \"Mus\u00e9e des familles\": \"Martin Paz\", a novella set in Lima, which Verne wrote in 1851 and published 10 July through 11 August 1852, and \"Les Ch\u00e2teaux en Californie, ou, Pierre qui roule n'amasse pas mousse\" (\"The Castles in California, or, A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss\"), a one-act comedy full of racy double entendres. In April and May 1854, the magazine published Verne's short story \"Master Zacharius\", an E. T. A. Hoffmann-like fantasy featuring a sharp condemnation of scientific hubris and ambition, followed soon afterward by \"A Winter Amid the Ice\", a polar adventure story whose themes closely anticipated many of Verne's novels. The \"Mus\u00e9e\" also published some nonfiction popular science articles which, though unsigned, are generally attributed to Verne. Verne's work for the magazine was cut short in 1856 when he had a serious quarrel with Pitre-Chevalier and refused to continue contributing (a refusal he would maintain until 1863, when Pitre-Chevalier died, and the magazine went to new editorship).\nWhile writing stories and articles for Pitre-Chevalier, Verne began to form the idea of inventing a new kind of novel, a \"Roman de la Science\" (\"novel of science\"), which would allow him to incorporate large amounts of the factual information he so enjoyed researching in the Biblioth\u00e8que. He is said to have discussed the project with the elder Alexandre Dumas, who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel, \"Isaac Laquedem\", and who enthusiastically encouraged Verne's project.\nAt the end of 1854, another outbreak of cholera led to the death of Jules Seveste, Verne's employer at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique and by then a good friend. Though his contract only held him to a further year of service, Verne remained connected to the theater for several years after Seveste's death, seeing additional productions to fruition. He also continued to write plays and musical comedies, most of which were not performed.\nFamily.\nIn May 1856, Verne travelled to Amiens to be the best man at the wedding of a Nantes friend, Auguste Lelarge, to an Amiens woman named Aim\u00e9e du Fraysne de Viane. Verne, invited to stay with the bride's family, took to them warmly, befriending the entire household and finding himself increasingly attracted to the bride's sister, Honorine Anne H\u00e9b\u00e9e Morel (n\u00e9e du Fraysne de Viane), a widow aged 26 with two young children. Hoping to find a secure source of income, as well as a chance to court Morel in earnest, he jumped at her brother's offer to go into business with a broker. Verne's father was initially dubious but gave in to his son's requests for approval in November 1856. With his financial situation finally looking promising, Verne won the favor of Morel and her family, and the couple were married on 10 January 1857.\nVerne plunged into his new business obligations, leaving his work at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique and taking up a full-time job as an \"agent de change\" on the Paris Bourse, where he became the associate of the broker Fernand Eggly. Verne woke up early each morning so that he would have time to write, before going to the Bourse for the day's work; in the rest of his spare time, he continued to consort with the \"Onze-Sans-Femme\" club (all eleven of its \"bachelors\" had by this time married). He also continued to frequent the Biblioth\u00e8que to do scientific and historical research, much of which he copied onto notecards for future use\u2014a system he would continue for the rest of his life. According to the recollections of a colleague, Verne \"did better in repartee than in business\".\nIn July 1858, Verne and Aristide Hignard seized an opportunity offered by Hignard's brother: a sea voyage, at no charge, from Bordeaux to Liverpool and Scotland. The journey, Verne's first trip outside France, deeply impressed him, and upon his return to Paris he fictionalized his recollections to form the backbone of a semi-autobiographical novel, \"Backwards to Britain\" (written in the autumn and winter of 1859\u20131860 and not published until 1989). A second complimentary voyage in 1861 took Hignard and Verne to Stockholm, from where they traveled to Christiania and through Telemark. Verne left Hignard in Denmark to return in haste to Paris, but missed the birth on 3 August 1861 of his only biological son, Michel.\nMeanwhile, Verne continued work on the idea of a \"Roman de la Science\", which he developed in a rough draft, inspired, according to his recollections, by his \"love for maps and the great explorers of the world\". It took shape as a story of travel across Africa and would eventually become his first published novel, \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\".\nHetzel.\nIn 1862, through their mutual acquaintance Alfred de Br\u00e9hat, Verne came into contact with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, and submitted to him the manuscript of his developing novel, then called \"Voyage en Ballon\". Hetzel, already the publisher of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, George Sand, Victor Hugo, and other well-known authors, had long been planning to launch a high-quality family magazine in which entertaining fiction would combine with scientific education. He saw Verne, with his demonstrated inclination toward scrupulously researched adventure stories, as an ideal contributor for such a magazine, and accepted the novel, giving Verne suggestions for improvement. Verne made the proposed revisions within two weeks and returned to Hetzel with the final draft, now titled \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\". It was published by Hetzel on 31 January 1863.\nTo secure his services for the planned magazine, to be called the \"Magasin d'\u00c9ducation et de R\u00e9cr\u00e9ation\" (\"Magazine of Education and Recreation\"), Hetzel also drew up a long-term contract in which Verne would give him three volumes of text per year, each of which Hetzel would buy outright for a flat fee. Verne, finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last, accepted immediately. For the rest of his lifetime, most of his novels would be serialized in Hetzel's \"Magasin\" before their appearance in book form, beginning with his second novel for Hetzel, \"The Adventures of Captain Hatteras\" (1864\u201365).\nWhen \"The Adventures of Captain Hatteras\" was published in book form in 1866, Hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for Verne's novels by saying in a preface that Verne's works would form a novel sequence called the \"Voyages extraordinaires\" (\"Extraordinary Voyages\" or \"Extraordinary Journeys\"), and that Verne's aim was \"to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe\". Late in life, Verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels: \"My object has been to depict the earth, and not the earth alone, but the universe... And I have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style. It is said that there can't be any style in a novel of adventure, but it isn't true.\" However, he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious: \"Yes! But the Earth is very large, and life is very short! In order to leave a completed work behind, one would need to live to be at least 100 years old!\"\nHetzel influenced many of Verne's novels directly, especially in the first few years of their collaboration, for Verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes Hetzel suggested. For example, when Hetzel disapproved of the original climax of \"Captain Hatteras\", including the death of the title character, Verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which Hatteras survived. Hetzel also rejected Verne's next submission, \"Paris in the Twentieth Century\", believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine. (The manuscript, believed lost for some time after Verne's death, was finally published in 1994.)\nThe relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869 when Verne and Hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\". Verne had initially conceived of the submariner Captain Nemo as a Polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the Russians who had killed his family during the January Uprising. Hetzel, not wanting to alienate the lucrative Russian market for Verne's books, demanded that Nemo be made an enemy of the slave trade, a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero. Verne, after fighting vehemently against the change, finally invented a compromise in which Nemo's past is left mysterious. After this disagreement, Verne became notably cooler in his dealings with Hetzel, taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright.\nFrom that point, Verne published two or more volumes a year. The most successful of these are: (\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\", 1864); (\"From the Earth to the Moon\", 1865); \"Vingt mille lieues sous les mers\" (\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\", 1869); and \"Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours\" (\"Around the World in Eighty Days\"), which first appeared in \"Le Temps\" in 1872. Verne could now live on his writings, but most of his wealth came from the stage adaptations of \"Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours\" (1874) and \"Michel Strogoff\" (1876), which he wrote with Adolphe d'Ennery.\nIn 1867, Verne bought a small boat, the \"Saint-Michel\", which he successively replaced with the \"Saint-Michel II\" and the \"Saint-Michel III\" as his financial situation improved. On board the \"Saint-Michel III\", he sailed around Europe. After his first novel, most of his stories were first serialised in the \"Magazine d'\u00c9ducation et de R\u00e9cr\u00e9ation\", a Hetzel biweekly publication, before being published in book form. His brother Paul contributed to \"40th French climbing of the Mont-Blanc\" and a collection of short stories \u2013 \"Doctor Ox\" \u2013 in 1874. Verne became wealthy and famous.\nMeanwhile, Michel Verne married an actress against his father's wishes, had two children by an underage mistress and buried himself in debts. The relationship between father and son improved as Michel grew older.\nLater years.\nThough raised as a Roman Catholic, Verne gravitated towards deism.\nSome scholars believe his novels reflect a deist philosophy, as they often involve the notion of God or divine providence but rarely mention the concept of Christ.\nOn 9 March 1886, as Verne returned home, his twenty-six-year-old nephew, Gaston, shot at him twice with a pistol. The first bullet missed, but the second one entered Verne's left leg, giving him a permanent limp that could not be overcome. This incident was not publicised in the media, but Gaston spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum.\nAfter the deaths of both his mother and Hetzel (who died in 1886), Jules Verne began publishing darker works. In 1888 he entered politics and was elected town councillor of Amiens, where he championed several improvements and served for fifteen years.\nVerne was made a knight of France's Legion of Honour on 9 April 1870, and subsequently promoted in Legion of Honour rank to Officer on 19 July 1892.\nDeath and posthumous publications.\nOn 24 March 1905, while ill with chronic diabetes and complications from a stroke which paralyzed his right side, Verne died at his home in Amiens, 44 Boulevard Longueville (now Boulevard Jules-Verne). His son, Michel Verne, oversaw the publication of the novels \"Invasion of the Sea\" and \"The Lighthouse at the End of the World\" after Jules's death. The \"Voyages extraordinaires\" series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year. It was later discovered that Michel Verne had made extensive changes in these stories, and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the Jules Verne Society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jules Verne). In 1919, Michel Verne published \"The Barsac Mission\" (), whose original drafts contained references to Esperanto, a language that his father had been very interested in. In 1989, Verne's great-grandson discovered his ancestor's as-yet-unpublished novel \"Paris in the Twentieth Century\", which was subsequently published in 1994.\nWorks.\nVerne's largest body of work is the \"Voyages extraordinaires\" series, which includes all of his novels except for the two rejected manuscripts \"Paris in the Twentieth Century\" and \"Backwards to Britain\" (published posthumously in 1994 and 1989, respectively) and for projects left unfinished at his death (many of which would be posthumously adapted or rewritten for publication by his son Michel). Verne also wrote many plays, poems, song texts, operetta libretti, and short stories, as well as a variety of essays and miscellaneous non-fiction.\nLiterary reception.\nAfter his debut under Hetzel, Verne was enthusiastically received in France by writers and scientists alike, with George Sand and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier among his earliest admirers. Several notable contemporary figures, from the geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin to the critic Jules Claretie, spoke highly of Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes.\nHowever, Verne's growing popularity among readers and playgoers (due especially to the highly successful stage version of \"Around the World in Eighty Days\") led to a gradual change in his literary reputation. As the novels and stage productions continued to sell, many contemporary critics felt that Verne's status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller, rather than a serious author worthy of academic study.\nThis denial of formal literary status took various forms, including dismissive criticism by such writers as \u00c9mile Zola and the lack of Verne's nomination for membership in the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, and was recognized by Verne himself, who said in a late interview: \"The great regret of my life is that I have never taken any place in French literature.\" To Verne, who considered himself \"a man of letters and an artist, living in the pursuit of the ideal\", this critical dismissal on the basis of literary ideology could only be seen as the ultimate snub.\nThis bifurcation of Verne as a popular genre writer but a critical \"persona non grata\" continued after his death, with early biographies (including one by Verne's own niece, Marguerite Allotte de la Fu\u00ffe) focusing on error-filled and embroidered hagiography of Verne as a popular figure rather than on Verne's actual working methods or his output. Meanwhile, sales of Verne's novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in Verne's home country, with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place.\nHowever, the decades after Verne's death also saw the rise in France of the \"Jules Verne cult\", a steadily growing group of scholars and young writers who took Verne's works seriously as literature and willingly noted his influence on their own pioneering works. Some of the cult founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jules Verne, the first academic society for Verne scholars; many others became highly respected \"avant garde\" and surrealist literary figures in their own right. Their praise and analyses, emphasizing Verne's stylistic innovations and enduring literary themes, proved highly influential for literary studies to come.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known French scholars and writers, Verne's reputation skyrocketed in France. Roland Barthes' seminal essay \"Nautilus et Bateau Ivre\" (\"The Nautilus and the Drunken Boat\") was influential in its exegesis of the \"Voyages extraordinares\" as a purely literary text, while book-length studies by such figures as Marcel Mor\u00e9 and Jean Chesneaux considered Verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points.\nFrench literary journals devoted entire issues to Verne and his work, with essays by such imposing literary figures as Michel Butor, Georges Borgeaud, Marcel Brion, Pierre Versins, Michel Foucault, Ren\u00e9 Barjavel, Marcel Lecomte, Francis Lacassin, and Michel Serres; meanwhile, Verne's entire published opus returned to print, with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by Livre de Poche and \u00c9ditions Rencontre. The wave reached its climax in Verne's sesquicentennial year 1978, when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle, and \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" was accepted for the French university system's \"agr\u00e9gation\" reading list. Since these events, Verne has been consistently recognized in Europe as a legitimate member of the French literary canon, with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing.\nVerne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a na\u00efve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological prophet or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality English translations and very loosely adapted Hollywood film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne. However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's anglophone reputation may currently be underway.\nEnglish translations.\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story \"A Voyage in a Balloon\" (1851) was published in the American journal \"Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art\" in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur. Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\" (originally published in 1863), and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print. Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the \"Voyages extraordinaires\", the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries, implying that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author.\nThese early English-language translations have been widely criticized for their extensive textual omissions, errors, and alterations, and are not considered adequate representations of Verne's actual novels. In an essay for \"The Guardian\", British writer Adam Roberts commented: I'd always liked reading Jules Verne and I've read most of his novels; but it wasn't until recently that I really understood I hadn't been reading Jules Verne at all ... It's a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in. Indeed, I can't think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation.\nSimilarly, the American novelist Michael Crichton observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Verne's prose is lean and fast-moving in a peculiarly modern way ... [but] Verne has been particularly ill-served by his English translators. At best they have provided us with clunky, choppy, tone-deaf prose. At worst \u2013 as in the notorious 1872 \"translation\" [of \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\"] published by Griffith &amp; Farran \u2013 they have blithely altered the text, giving Verne's characters new names, and adding whole pages of their own invention, thus effectively obliterating the meaning and tone of Verne's original.\nSince 1965, a considerable number of more accurate English translations of Verne have appeared. However, the older, deficient translations continue to be republished due to their public domain status, and in many cases their easy availability in online sources.\nRelationship with science fiction.\nThe relationship between Verne's \"Voyages extraordinaires\" and the literary genre science fiction is a complex one. Verne, like H. G. Wells, is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre, and his profound influence on its development is indisputable; however, many earlier writers, such as Lucian of Samosata, Voltaire, and Mary Shelley, have also been cited as creators of science fiction, an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and history of the genre.\nA primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether Verne's works count as science fiction to begin with. Maurice Renard claimed that Verne \"never wrote a single sentence of scientific-marvelous\". Verne himself argued repeatedly in interviews that his novels were not meant to be read as scientific, saying \"I have invented nothing\". His own goal was rather to \"depict the earth [and] at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style\", as he pointed out in an example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I wrote \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\", not as a story about ballooning, but as a story about Africa. I always was greatly interested in geography, history and travel, and I wanted to give a romantic description of Africa. Now, there was no means of taking my travellers through Africa otherwise than in a balloon, and that is why a balloon is introduced... I may say that at the time I wrote the novel, as now, I had no faith in the possibility of ever steering balloons...\nClosely related to Verne's science-fiction reputation is the often-repeated claim that he is a \"prophet\" of scientific progress, and that many of his novels involve elements of technology that were fantastic for his day but later became commonplace. These claims have a long history, especially in America, but the modern scholarly consensus is that such claims of prophecy are heavily exaggerated. In a 1961 article critical of \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\"' scientific accuracy, Theodore L. Thomas speculated that Verne's storytelling skill and readers' faulty memories of a book they read as children caused people to \"remember things from it that are not there. The impression that the novel contains valid scientific prediction seems to grow as the years roll by\". As with science fiction, Verne himself flatly denied that he was a futuristic prophet, saying that any connection between scientific developments and his work was \"mere coincidence\" and attributing his indisputable scientific accuracy to his extensive research: \"even before I began writing stories, I always took numerous notes out of every book, newspaper, magazine, or scientific report that I came across.\"\nLegacy.\nVerne's novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works; writers known to have been influenced by Verne include Marcel Aym\u00e9, Roland Barthes, Ren\u00e9 Barjavel, Michel Butor, Blaise Cendrars, Paul Claudel, Jean Cocteau, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Rick Riordan, Raymond Roussel, Claude Roy, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, and Jean-Paul Sartre, while scientists and explorers who acknowledged Verne's inspiration have included Richard E. Byrd, Yuri Gagarin, Simon Lake, Hubert Lyautey, Guglielmo Marconi, Fridtjof Nansen, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Wernher von Braun, and Jack Parsons. Verne is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre, a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology.\nRay Bradbury summarized Verne's influence on literature and the science world: \"We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.\"\nThe highest trim level of the French luxury vehicle manufacturer DS's cars, is named the Jules Verne Edition, to honour the figure as an integral part of French cultural heritage and history.\nNotes.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A member of the Social Democratic Party, he previously served as the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1978 to 1998. In the latter role, he also served as President of the Bundesrat in 1982/83 and in 1994/95.\nEducation and work.\nRau was born in the Barmen part of Wuppertal, Rhine Province, as the third of five children. His family was strongly Protestant. As a schoolboy, Rau was active in the Confessing Church, which resisted Nazism.\nRau left school in 1949 and worked as a publisher, especially with the Protestant Youth Publishing House.\nPolitical career.\nRau was a member of the All-German People's Party (GVP), which was founded by Gustav Heinemann. The party was known for proposing German reunification from 1952 until it was disbanded in 1957.\nIn 1958, the pacifist Rau and his political mentor, Gustav Heinemann, joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), where he was active in the Wuppertal chapter. He served as deputy chairman of the SPD party of Wuppertal and was elected later on to the City Council (1964\u20131978), where he served as chairman of the SPD Group (1964\u20131967) and later as Mayor (1969\u20131970).\nIn July 1958, Rau was elected for the first time as member of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1967, he became chairman of the SPD fraction in the Landtag, and from 1970 to 1975, he was Minister of Science and Education in the second cabinet of Minister President Heinz K\u00fchn. He soon gained a reputation as a reformer. As part of the mass education campaign of the 1970s, he founded five universities, each at different sites, in North Rhine-Westphalia and initiated Germany's first distance learning university at Hagen (modelled on the British \"Open University\").\nIn 1977, Rau became Chairman of the SPD North Rhine-Westphalia and, in 1978, Minister President of the state, which he remained until 1998, with four successful elections for the SPD, which became strongest party in the Landtag each time and gained an absolute majority three times, in 1980, 1985, 1990 and finally 1995. \nFrom 1995 onwards, Rau led an SPD-Greens coalition in North Rhine-Westphalia. Rau twice served as President of the Bundesrat in 1982/83 and 1994/95.\nIn 1987, Rau was his party's candidate to become chancellor of Germany for the SPD, but he lost the 1987 West German federal election against Helmut Kohl\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU). In 1994, Rau was a candidate to become President of Germany but lost the 1994 German presidential election to Roman Herzog.\nIn June 1998, Rau stepped down from his positions as SPD chairman and Minister President, and in the 1999 German presidential election on 23 May 1999, he was elected President of Germany by the Federal Assembly of Germany to succeed Roman Herzog (CDU). \nOn 1 July 2004, he was succeeded by Horst K\u00f6hler. In common with all other Federal presidents Rau was honored by a Gro\u00dfer Zapfenstreich. At his request the hymn \"Jesus bleibet meine Freude\" (literally \"that Jesus remain my Joy\", but commonly Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring) was included.\nIn February 2000, Rau became the first German head of state to address the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in German. \nThe controversial step prompted some Israeli delegates to walk out. However, Israeli President Moshe Katsav supported and praised him for bridging the gap between the two states. Rau had a deep and lifelong commitment to bringing reconciliation between Germany and its past.\nDeath.\nRau had a long history of heart disease and died 11 days after his 75th birthday on 27 January 2006. The funeral took place on 7 February following a funeral act of state on the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in Berlin in the closest of family and friends.\nMotto and maxim.\nThe maxim of Rau was \"to reconcile, not divide\".\nAs his personal motto, Rau adopted the Confessing Church dictum \"teneo, quia teneor\" (I hold because I am held).\nIn his acceptance speech after his election, Rau claimed \"I never want to be a nationalist but rather a patriot. A patriot is someone who loves his fatherland. A nationalist is someone who condemns the fatherland of others.\" The quote can be attributed to the French writer Romain Gary.\nPrizes and medals.\nRau was awarded 15 honorary doctorates. \nIn 2001, he received the Leo Baeck Medal for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice.\nPrivate life.\nRau was known as a practising Christian (sometimes known as , \"Brother John\", in ridicule of his intense Christian position. He held lay positions in and was a member of the Synod of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland, a member church of the Protestant Church in Germany.\nOn 9 August 1982, Rau married the political scientist Christina Delius (born 1956). Christina Rau is a granddaughter of her husband's mentor, Gustav Heinemann, former President of Germany. The couple had three children: Anna Christina, born 1983, Philip Immanuel, born 1985 and Laura Helene, born 1986.\nOn 18 August 2004, Rau had to undergo serious heart surgery, in which an artificial heart valve was inserted. Only two months later (19 October 2004), a hematoma in the abdominal cavity was surgically removed.\nAfter leaving office, Rau lived with his family in the federal capital, Berlin. However, they also kept a house in Wuppertal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of Adolf Hitler's closest and most devoted followers, known for his skills in public speaking and his virulent antisemitism which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of Jews and other groups in the Holocaust.\nBorn in Rheydt, Goebbels aspired to be an author and obtained a doctorate in philology from the University of Heidelberg in 1922. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924 and worked with Gregor Strasser in its northern branch. He was appointed \"Gauleiter\" of Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry quickly gained control over the news media, arts and information in Nazi Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempts to shape morale.\nIn 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce \"total war\", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments manufacture and the Wehrmacht.\nAs the war drew to a close and Germany faced defeat, Magda Goebbels and the Goebbels children joined Hitler in Berlin. They moved into the underground \"Vorbunker\", part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April. In accordance with Hitler's will, Goebbels succeeded him as Chancellor of Germany; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife, Magda, committed suicide, after having poisoned their six children with a cyanide compound.\nEarly life, education, and relationships.\nPaul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in Rheydt, an industrial town south of M\u00f6nchengladbach near D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Both of his parents were Roman Catholics with modest family backgrounds. His father, Fritz, was a German factory clerk; his mother, Katharina Maria (n\u00e9e\u00a0Odenhausen), was born to Dutch and German parents in a Dutch village close to the border with Germany. Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893\u20131949), Hans (1895\u20131947), Maria (1896\u20131896), Elisabeth (1901\u20131915) and Maria (1910\u20131949), who married the German filmmaker Max W. Kimmich in 1938. In 1932 Goebbels commissioned the publication of a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his maternal grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.\nDuring childhood Goebbels experienced ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot, which turned inwards due to a congenital disorder or an infection in the bone. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. Just prior to starting grammar school he underwent an operation, which failed to correct the problem. Goebbels wore a metal brace and a special shoe because of his shortened leg and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I because of this condition.\nGoebbels was educated at a \"Gymnasium\", where he completed his \"Abitur\" (university entrance examination) in 1917. He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour of speaking at the awards ceremony. His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, which Goebbels seriously considered. He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, W\u00fcrzburg, Freiburg and Munich, aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society. By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.\nHistorians, including Richard J. Evans and Roger Manvell, speculate that Goebbels' lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disability. At Freiburg he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior. She went on to W\u00fcrzburg to continue studying, as did Goebbels. By 1920 the relationship with Anka was over; the break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide. In 1921 he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, \"Michael\", a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived. Goebbels felt he was writing his \"own story\". Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by Goebbels shortly before the book was published in 1929 by Eher-Verlag, the publishing house of the Nazi Party.\nAt the University of Heidelberg Goebbels wrote his doctoral thesis on Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz, a minor 19th-century romantic dramatist. He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of Friedrich Gundolf, a literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. As he was no longer teaching, Gundolf directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg, who was also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels received his PhD on 21 April 1922. By 1940 he had written 14 books.\nGoebbels returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing antisemitism and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922 he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher. After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the \"enchantment [was] ruined.\" Nevertheless he continued to see her on and off until 1927.\nHe continued for several years to try to become a published author. His diaries, which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write. The lack of income from his literary works \u2013 he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold \u2013 forced him to take employment as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested. He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt. During this period he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book \"The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century\" (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany. He also began to study the social question and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske. According to German historian Peter Longerich, Goebbels's diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied with \"religious-philosophical\" issues and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries from mid-December 1923 onwards show Goebbels was moving towards the \"V\u00f6lkisch\" nationalist movement.\nNazi activist.\nGoebbels first took an interest in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924. In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of 8\u20139 November 1923. The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda. Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year, including pre-trial detention. Goebbels was drawn to the Nazi Party mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs. He joined the Nazi Party around this time, becoming member number 8762. In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was \"Gauleiter\" (Nazi Party district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and undertake secretarial work for the regional party offices. He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia. Strasser founded the National Socialist Working Association on 10 September 1925, a short-lived group of about a dozen northern and western German \"Gauleiter\"; Goebbels became its business manager and the editor of its biweekly journal, \"NS-Briefe\". Members of Strasser's northern branch of the Nazi Party, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich. Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.\nHitler viewed Strasser's actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60\u00a0\"Gauleiters\" and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a special conference in Bamberg, in Streicher's \"Gau\" of Franconia, where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser's new political programme. Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean \"political bolshevization of Germany.\" Further, there would be \"no princes, only Germans,\" and a legal system with no \"Jewish system of exploitation\u00a0... for plundering of our people.\" The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east. Goebbels was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as \"a Jewish creation\" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: \"I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That's the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away.\"\nAfter reading Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\", Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler's assertion of a \"Jewish doctrine of Marxism\". In February 1926, Goebbels gave a speech titled \"Bolshevism or National-socialism? Lenin or Hitler?\" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a \"socialist nationalist state\" to arise in Russia. In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled \"Nazi-Sozi\" which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.\nIn hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr \"Gau\" leaders, including Goebbels. Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening, Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally. The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them. Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: \"I love him\u00a0... He has thought through everything,\" \"Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius.\" He later wrote: \"Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius.\" As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, the National Socialist Working Association was disbanded. Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded, the original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.\nPropagandist in Berlin.\nAt Hitler's invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual Party Congress, held in Weimar in 1926. For the following year's event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.\nGauleiter.\nGoebbels was first offered the position of party \"Gauleiter\" for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern \"Gauleiters\" group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the \"Gau\". Goebbels was given control over the local \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) and \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.\nLike Hitler, Goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience. He used loudspeakers, decorative flames, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.\nGoebbels' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the Nazi Party, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the Nazi Party from the city on 5 May 1927. Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets. Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October. During this period, he founded the newspaper \"Der Angriff\" (\"The Attack\") as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone; 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point. To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic. Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police Bernhard Wei\u00df. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname \"Isidore\" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit. Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book \"Michael\" finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (\"Der Wanderer\" and \"Die Saat\" (\"The Seed\")). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting. During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.\n1928 election.\nThe ban on the Nazi Party was lifted before the \"Reichstag\" elections on 20 May 1928. The Nazi Party lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote. Goebbels was one of the first 12 Nazi Party members to gain election to the \"Reichstag\". This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Wei\u00df. The \"Reichstag\" changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in \"Der Angriff\" over the course of the previous year. Goebbels continued to be elected to the \"Reichstag\" at every subsequent election during the Weimar and Nazi regimes.\nIn his newspaper \"Berliner Arbeiterzeitung\" (\"Berlin Workers Newspaper\"), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.\nBy 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich. That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by two members of the KPD. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march \"Die Fahne hoch\" (\"Raise the flag\"), renamed as the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\", to be the Nazi Party anthem.\nGreat Depression.\nThe Great Depression greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment. During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the \"Nationaler Sozialist\". Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism. Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be \"pushed to the wall\". In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of Nazi Party propaganda. One of Goebbels' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the \"Nationaler Sozialist\". Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party's national newspaper, the \"V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter\" (\"People's Observer\"). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the Nazi Party. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the \"crisis\" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.\nThe rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. Paul von Hindenburg appointed Heinrich Br\u00fcning as chancellor. A new cabinet was formed, and Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. Goebbels took charge of the Nazi Party's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second-largest party in the country. \nIn late 1930 Goebbels met Magda Quandt, a divorc\u00e9e who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organise his private papers. Her flat on \"Reichskanzlerplatz\" soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other Nazi Party officials. Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931 at a Protestant church. Hitler was his best man.\nAt the 24 April 1932 Prussian state election, Goebbels won a seat in the Landtag of Prussia. For the two \"Reichstag\" elections held in 1932, Goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan \"the F\u00fchrer over Germany\". Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism. He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on gramophone records and as pamphlets. Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of silent films that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium. Many of Goebbels' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as \"International High Finance\". His propaganda characterised the opposition as \"November criminals\", \"Jewish wire-pullers\", or a communist threat.\nRole in Hitler's government.\nSupport for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.\nTo celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann G\u00f6ring. Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post that Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other Nazi Party officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The Nazi Party took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship\u2014headed by Hitler\u2014in its place. On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War. While the Nazi Party increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership. Goebbels received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933.\nThe role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life. On 25 March 1933, Goebbels said that he hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the Nazi Party had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population. One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March. He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April. Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.\nGoebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the Nazi Party. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run German Labour Front was created to take their place. \"We are the masters of Germany,\" he commented in his diary entry of 3 May. Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the Nazi book burning in Berlin on 10 May, a ceremony he suggested.\nMeanwhile, the Nazi Party began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise. The first Nazi concentration camps (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power. In a process termed \"Gleichschaltung\" (coordination), the Nazi Party proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the Nazi Party were the army and the churches. On 2 June 1933, Hitler appointed Goebbels a \"Reichsleiter\", the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. On 3 October 1933, on the formation of the Academy for German Law, Goebbels was made a member and given a seat on its executive committee. \nIn a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the \"Schriftleitergesetz\" (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press. Modelled to some extent on the system in Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy, the law defined a \"Schriftleiter\" as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria. The law required journalists to \"regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government.\"\nIn 1934, Goebbels published (lit.\u2009'From the Kaiserhof to the Reich Chancellery'), his account of Hitler's seizure of power, which he based on his diary from 1 January 1932 to 1 May 1933. The book sought to glorify both Hitler and the author. It sold around 660,000 copies, making it Goebbels's best-selling publication during his lifetime. An English translation was published in 1935 under the title \"My Part in Germany's Fight\".\nAt the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader Ernst R\u00f6hm in Munich. On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" (leader and chancellor).\nWorkings of the Ministry.\nThe propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic. Goebbels's style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public. Goebbels was successful at his job, however; \"Life\" wrote in 1938 that \"[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department.\" John Gunther wrote in 1940 that Goebbels \"is the cleverest of all the Nazis\", but could not succeed Hitler because \"everybody hates him\".\nThe Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933. Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages. Under the auspices of the \"Reichskulturkammer\" (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre. As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced. In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored. Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.\nGoebbels was particularly interested in controlling the radio, which was then still a fairly new mass medium. Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly Prussia, headed by G\u00f6ring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the \"Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft\" (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934. Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called \"Volksempf\u00e4nger\" (people's receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans. On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty. Albert Speer, Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime \"made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought.\"\nA major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a cult of personality. Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels' propaganda work. Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film \"Triumph of the Will\", one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by Leni Riefenstahl. It won the gold medal at the 1935 Venice Film Festival. At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that \"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\"\nGoebbels was involved in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.\nChurch struggle.\nIn 1933, Hitler signed the \"Reichskonkordat\" (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the \"Kirchenkampf\" (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.\nIn response to the persecution, Pope Pius XI had the \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (\"With Burning Concern\") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church. In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime. Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.\nAntisemitism and the Holocaust.\nGoebbels was antisemitic from a young age. After joining the Nazi Party and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society. In 1930, he criticised Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini for his relative lack of hostility towards Jews, stating that \"Mussolini appears to have not recognized the Jewish question.\" After the Nazis seized control, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews. Despite his extreme antisemitism, Goebbels spoke of the \"rubbish of race-materialism\" and of the unnecessity of biological racism for the Nazi ideology. He also described Himmler's ideology as \"in many regards, mad\" and thought Alfred Rosenberg's racial theories were ridiculous.\nThe Nazi Party's goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether. In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and other actions. Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.\nIn November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath was killed in Paris by the young Jewish man Herschel Grynszpan. In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called \"Kristallnacht\" (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where G\u00f6ring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.\nGoebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!\nWhile Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry. Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as Riga and Kaunas. In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews wear an identifying yellow badge as of 5 September 1941. On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference, which indicated indirectly that the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to extermination camps in occupied areas of Poland and killed. His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. \"In general, it can probably be established that 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 per cent can be put to work.\u00a0... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved,\" he wrote on 27 March 1942.\nGoebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met. He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He was one of the few top Nazi officials to do so publicly.\nWorld War II.\nAs early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: \"[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing.\" In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing \"war panic\" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the Western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.\nAfter the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control access to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision-making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.\nThe Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens. Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department. The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play. Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans. Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people. From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in \"Das Reich\" which were later read aloud over the radio. He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio. At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).\nGoebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be. For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front. At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more \"entertaining material\" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment. As \"Gauleiter\" of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse. Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim. The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period \u2013 the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) \u2013 were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won. On 16 November 1942 Goebbels, like all \"Gauleiters\", was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for his \"Gau\". This enabled him to issue direct instructions to authorities within his jurisdiction in matters concerning the civilian war effort. On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings. In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local \"Gauleiters\", and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.\nBy early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\" (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Martin Bormann, who controlled the party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the \"Dreierausschu\u00df\" (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.\nPartly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce \"total war\", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, G\u00f6ring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available. After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war. His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway. The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well. During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the \"extermination\" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.\nGoebbels' efforts had little impact for the time being, because Hitler, who in principle was in favour of total war, was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Soviet NKVD in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other Western Allies.\nPlenipotentiary for total war.\nAfter the Allied invasion of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet victory in the Battle of Kursk (July\u2013August 1943), Goebbels began to recognise that the war could no longer be won. Following the Allied invasion of Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.\nAs Germany's military and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 \"Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took the lives of thousands of people. In December 1943, Hitler asked Goebbels to take on the job of \"Stadtpr\u00e4sident\" (City President) of Berlin, and Goebbels agreed to this as a means of obtaining more direct control over the municipal authorities, though Hitler delayed the formal appointment for several months. Goebbels took over direct administrative control of the city when he was formally named \"Stadtpr\u00e4sident\" on 7 April 1944, thus uniting under his control the city's most powerful party and governmental offices. As air raids on Berlin continued, G\u00f6ring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.\nThroughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer continued to press Hitler to bring the economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played into the hands of those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of G\u00f6ring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise, the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.\nHitler ordered a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service \u2014 the \"Volkssturm\" (People's Storm) \u2014 to be formed on 25 September 1944; it was launched on 18 October. In his capacity as \"Gauleiter\" and Reich Defense Commissioner, Goebbels was named \"F\u00fchrer des Deutschen Volkssturms im Gau Gro\u00df-Berlin\" on 25 September 1944, and he administered the oath of allegiance to the assembled Berlin \"Volkssturm\" troops on 12 November. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his \"Gau\" alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.\nGoebbels realised that his influence would diminish in wartime. He suffered a series of setbacks as propaganda became less important compared to warfare, the war economy, and the Allied bombing of German cities. Historian Michael Balfour states that from 1942 onward, Goebbels, \"lost control over Nazi policy toward the press and over the handling of news in general.\" Rival agencies expanded. The foreign ministry took charge of propaganda outside Germany. The military set up its own propaganda division, providing daily reports on the progress of the war and the conditions of the armed forces. The Nazi Party also generated and distributed its own propaganda during the war. Goebbels was still influential when he had the opportunity to meet with Hitler, who became less available as he moved his headquarters closer to the military front lines. They were together perhaps one day a month. Furthermore, Hitler rarely gave speeches or rallies of the sort that had dominated propaganda in the 1930s. After Hitler returned to Berlin in 1945, Goebbels' ministry was destroyed by an Allied air raid on 13 March, and Goebbels had great difficulty disseminating propaganda. In April 1945, he finally bested the rival agencies and took full charge of propaganda, but by then the Soviet Red Army had already entered Berlin. Goebbels was an astute observer of the war, and historians have exhaustively mined his diary for insights on how the Nazi leadership tried to maintain public morale.\nDefeat and death.\nIn the last months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine River, he could no longer disguise the inevitability of German defeat. Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery, and even \"Volkssturm\" units were in short supply, as almost everything and everyone had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the Western Allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose Hitler's confidence.\nWhen other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the National Redoubt in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin. His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end. He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January. He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime and had no desire to subject himself to the \"debacle\" of a trial. He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.\nGoebbels knew how to play on Hitler's fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April. Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as Goebbels proclaimed is not known. By this time, Goebbels had gained the position he had wanted so long\u2014at Hitler's side. G\u00f6ring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April. Himmler, whose appointment as commander of Army Group Vistula had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler. Most of Hitler's inner circle, including G\u00f6ring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler's birthday celebration on 20 April. Even Bormann was \"not anxious\" to meet his end at Hitler's side. On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself. Goebbels moved with his family into the \"Vorbunker\", connected to the lower \"F\u00fchrerbunker\" under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day. He told Vice-Admiral Hans-Erich Voss that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape. On 23 April, Goebbels made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I call on you to fight for your city. Fight with everything you have got, for the sake of your wives and your children, your mothers and your parents. Your arms are defending everything we have ever held dear, and all the generations that will come after us. Be proud and courageous! Be inventive and cunning! Your \"Gauleiter\" is amongst you. He and his colleagues will remain in your midst. His wife and children are here as well. He, who once captured the city with 200 men, will now use every means to galvanize the defence of the capital. The battle for Berlin must become the signal for the whole nation to rise up in battle.\nAfter midnight on 29 April, with the Soviets advancing ever closer to the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the \"F\u00fchrerbunker\". Afterward, he hosted a modest wedding breakfast. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Goebbels and Bormann were two of the witnesses.\nIn his last will and testament, Hitler named no successor as F\u00fchrer or leader of the Nazi Party. Instead, he appointed Goebbels as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz, who was at Flensburg near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister. Goebbels wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would \"categorically refuse\" to obey Hitler's order to leave Berlin\u2014as he put it, \"the first time in my life\" that he had not complied with Hitler's orders. He felt compelled to remain with Hitler \"for reasons of humanity and personal loyalty\". His wife and children would stay as well. They would end their lives \"side by side with the F\u00fchrer\".\nIn the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself. Goebbels was depressed, and said he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling. Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: \"It is a great pity that such a man [Hitler] is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one Hitler chose. I shall follow his example.\"\nOn 1 May, Goebbels carried out his sole official act as Chancellor: he dictated a letter to General Vasily Chuikov and ordered German General Hans Krebs to deliver it under a white flag. Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.\nLater on 1 May, Voss saw Goebbels for the last time: \"While saying goodbye I asked Goebbels to join us. But he replied: 'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine'.\" On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of a cyanide compound could be then crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but Magda Goebbels and SS-\"Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, administered the cyanide.\nAt around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they killed themselves. There are several different accounts of this event. One is that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried and were given a coup de gr\u00e2ce immediately afterward. Goebbels' SS adjutant G\u00fcnther Schw\u00e4germann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard shots. Schw\u00e4germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw\u00e4germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move. In a contradictory account, SS- Rochus Misch claimed that mechanic Johannes Hentschel told him that early on 2 May, Goebbels killed himself in his room in the \"F\u00fchrerbunker\", while Magda did so in the \"Vorbunker\".\nThe corpses were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried. A few days later, the Soviets brought Voss back to the bunker to identify the Goebbels' partly burned bodies. The remains of the Goebbels family, Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. They were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.\nFamily life.\nHitler was very fond of Magda and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax. Magda had a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.\nIn 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1 and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship. Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. He arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October. Goebbels also had short-term affairs and relationships with numerous other women. Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with Kurt L\u00fcdecke in 1933 and Karl Hanke in 1938.\nThe Goebbels family included Harald Quandt (Magda's son from her first marriage; b. 1921), plus Helga (b. 1932), Hilde (b. 1934), Helmut (b. 1935), Holde (b. 1937), Hedda (b. 1938), and Heide (b. 1940). Harald was the only member of the family to survive the war. He died in an aeroplane crash in 1967.\nReferences.\nInformational notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their films span many genres and styles, which they frequently subvert or parody. Among their most acclaimed works are \"Blood Simple\" (1984), \"Raising Arizona\" (1987), \"Miller's Crossing\" (1990), \"Barton Fink\" (1991), \"Fargo\" (1996), \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998), \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000), \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007), \"A Serious Man\" (2009), \"True Grit\" (2010), and \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" (2013).\nThe brothers generally write, direct and produce their films jointly, although due to DGA regulations, Joel received sole directing credit while Ethan received sole production credit until \"The Ladykillers\" (2004), from which point on they would be credited together as directors and producers; they also shared editing credits under the alias Roderick Jaynes. The duo started directing separately in the 2020s, beginning with Joel's \"The Tragedy of Macbeth\" (2021) and Ethan's \"\" (2022) and \"Drive-Away Dolls\" (2024). They have been nominated for 13 Academy Awards together, plus one individual nomination for each, sharing wins for Best Original Screenplay for \"Fargo\", and Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for \"No Country for Old Men\". \"Barton Fink\" won the at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe Coens have written films for other directors, including Sam Raimi's \"Crimewave\" (1985), Angelina Jolie's World War II biopic \"Unbroken\" (2014) and Steven Spielberg's Cold War drama \"Bridge of Spies\" (2015). They produced Terry Zwigoff's \"Bad Santa\" (2003) and John Turturro's \"Romance and Cigarettes\" (2005). Ethan is also a writer of short stories, theater and poetry.\n\"No Country for Old Men\", \"A Serious Man\" and \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" were included on the BBC's 2016 poll of the greatest films since 2000. In 1998, the American Film Institute ranked \"Fargo\" among the 100 greatest American movies. They are known for their distinctive stylistic trademarks including genre hybridity. Richard Corliss wrote of the Coens: \"Dexterously flipping and reheating old movie genres like so many pancakes, they serve them up fresh, not with syrup but with a coating of comic arsenic.\"\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nJoel Daniel Coen (born November 29, 1954) and Ethan Jesse Coen (born September 21, 1957) were born and raised in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. Their mother, Rena (n\u00e9e Neumann; 1925\u20132001), was an art historian at St. Cloud State University, and their father, Edward Coen (1919\u20132012), was a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota. The brothers have an older sister, Deborah, who is a psychiatrist in Israel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn regards to whether our background influences our film making ... who knows? We don't think about it ... There's no doubt that our Jewish heritage affects how we see things.\n\u2014Joel Coen\nBoth sides of the Coen family were Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. Their paternal grandfather, Victor Coen, was a barrister in the Inns of Court in London before retiring to Hove with their grandmother. Edward Coen was an American citizen born in the United States, but grew up in Croydon, London and studied at the London School of Economics. Afterwards he moved to the United States, where he met the Coens' mother, and served in the United States Army during World War II.\nThe Coens developed an early interest in cinema through television. They grew up watching Italian films (ranging from the works of Federico Fellini to the \"Sons of Hercules\" films) aired on a Minneapolis station, the Tarzan films, and comedies (Jerry Lewis, Bob Hope and Doris Day).\nIn the mid-1960s, Joel saved money from mowing lawns to buy a Vivitar Super 8 camera. Together, the brothers remade movies they saw on television, with their neighborhood friend Mark Zimering (\"Zeimers\") as the star. Cornel Wilde's \"The Naked Prey\" (1965) became their \"Zeimers in Zambezi\", which featured Ethan as a native with a spear. \"Lassie Come Home\" (1943) was reinterpreted as their \"Ed... A Dog\", with Ethan playing the mother role in his sister's tutu. They also made original films like \"Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go\", \"Lumberjacks of the North\" and \"The Banana Film\".\nEducation.\nJoel and Ethan graduated from St. Louis Park High School in 1973 and 1976, respectively, and from Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.\nAfter Simon's Rock, Joel spent four years in the undergraduate film program at New York University, where he made a 30-minute thesis film, \"Soundings\". In 1979, he briefly enrolled in the graduate film program at the University of Texas at Austin, following a woman he had married who was in the graduate linguistics program. The marriage soon ended in divorce and Joel left UT Austin after nine months.\nEthan went on to Princeton University and earned an undergraduate degree in philosophy in 1979. His senior thesis was a 41-page essay, \"Two Views of Wittgenstein's Later Philosophy\", which was supervised by Raymond Geuss.\nCareer.\n1980s.\nAfter graduating from New York University, Joel worked as a production assistant on a variety of industrial films and music videos. He developed a talent for film editing and met Sam Raimi while assisting Edna Ruth Paul in editing Raimi's first feature film, \"The Evil Dead\" (1981).\nThe duo made their debut with \"Blood Simple\" (1984). Set in Texas, it tells the tale of a bar owner (Dan Hedaya) who hires a detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill his wife and her lover (Frances McDormand and John Getz, respectively). It contains elements that point to their future direction: distinctive homages to genre movies (in this case noir and horror), plot twists layered over a simple story, snappy dialogue and dark humor. Janet Maslin wrote: \"The camera work by Barry Sonnenfeld is especially dazzling. So is the fact that Mr. Coen, unlike many people who have directed great-looking film noir efforts, knows better than to let handsomeness become the film's entire raison d'\u00eatre. In addition to its stylishness, \"Blood Simple\" has the kind of purposefulness and coherence that show Mr. Coen to be headed for bigger, even better, things.\" Joel's direction was recognized at the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards. It was the first film shot by Sonnenfeld, who collaborated with the Coens on their two subsequent films and went on to be a director. It marked the first of many collaborations between the Coens and composer Carter Burwell. It was also the screen debut of McDormand, who went on to feature in many of the Coens' films (and to marry Joel).\nTheir next project was \"Crimewave\" (Raimi, 1985), written by the Coens and Raimi. Joel and Raimi also made cameos in \"Spies Like Us\" (1985).\nThe brothers wanted to follow their debut with something fast-paced and funny. \"Raising Arizona\" (1987) follows an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. (Nicolas Cage) and police officer Ed (Holly Hunter), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When furniture tycoon Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they \"are more than we can handle\", H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own. The film featured McDormand, William Forsythe, Sam McMurray, Randall \"Tex\" Cobb and marked the first of many collaborations between the Coens and John Goodman. Pauline Kael noted its \"cornpone-surreal quality\" and wrote that the Coens \"are going with their strengths. They're making a contraption, and they're good at it because they know how to make the camera behave mechanically, which is just right here\u2014it mirrors the mechanics of farce ... The Sunsets look marvellously ultra-vivid; the paint doesn't seem to be dry\u2014it's like opening day at a miniature-golf course.\"\n1990s.\n\"Miller's Crossing\" (1990) is a gangster film inspired by Dashiell Hammett's \"Red Harvest\" (1929) and \"The Glass Key\" (1931). It stars Gabriel Byrne as Irish mobster Tom Reagan and features Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, Steve Buscemi, Jon Polito and John Turturro. The film was released almost simultaneously with \"Goodfellas\" and was not a commercial success, but received positive reviews. Christopher Orr calls it \"a distillation of all the tropes and themes and moods of the classic gangster film.\" It was the Coens' first collaboration with production designer Dennis Gassner.\nWhile puzzling over the plot of \"Miller's Crossing\", the brothers wrote \"Barton Fink\" (1991) in a matter of weeks. Set in 1941, it follows a New York playwright, the eponymous Fink (Turturro), who moves to Los Angeles to write a B-picture for a venal movie mogul (Michael Lerner). Fink is modeled on playwright Clifford Odets, and the character W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney) is based on William Faulkner. \"Barton Fink\" was a critical success, earning Oscar nominations and winning Best Director, Best Actor and at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. It was their first film with cinematographer Roger Deakins, a key collaborator for the next 25 years.\n\"The Hudsucker Proxy\" (1994) is an homage to the screwball comedies of Frank Capra and Howard Hawks. Co-written with Raimi, the film follows a mailroom clerk (Tim Robbins) who is promoted to president of the Hudsucker Corporation by a cynical director (Paul Newman) in a scheme to devalue the company's stock; a fast-talking newspaperwoman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) tries to scoop the story. Critics praised the production design but criticized the tone. It was a box office bomb ($30 million budget, $3 million gross in the US).\nThe brothers bounced back with the \"homespun murder story\" \"Fargo\" (1996), set in their home state of Minnesota. In it, car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who has serious financial problems, has his wife kidnapped so that his wealthy father-in-law (Harve Presnell) will pay the ransom, which he plans to split with the kidnappers (Buscemi and Peter Stormare). Complications ensue, and local cop Marge Gunderson (McDormand) starts to investigate. Produced on a small budget of $7 million, \"Fargo\" was a critical and commercial success, winning Oscars for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress for McDormand and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Picture. Maslin wrote that \"Perversely, the frozen north even brings out some uncharacteristic warmth in these coolly cerebral film makers, although anyone seeking the milk of human kindness would be well advised to look elsewhere. ... \"Fargo\" has been hauntingly photographed by Roger Deakins with great, expressive use of white-outs that sometimes make the characters appear to be moving through a dream. Roads disappear, swallowed up in a snowy void, making \"Fargo\" look eerily remote. As the title suggests, there is a steady sense of distance and uncharted territory.\" Roger Ebert wrote that \"To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, gotten away with them, and have made a movie that is completely original, and as familiar as an old shoe \u2013 or a rubber-soled hunting boot from Land's End, more likely.\"\n\"The Big Lebowski\" (1998) is a crime comedy about Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), a Los Angeles slacker who is involved in a kidnapping case after being mistaken for a millionaire of the same name (David Huddleston.) It features Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lebowski's flunky, Goodman and Buscemi as The Dude's bowling buddies and Julianne Moore as his \"special lady friend\". It was influenced by Raymond Chandler's \"The Big Sleep\" (1939) and Robert Altman's \"The Long Goodbye\". It has become a cult classic. An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in 2002, and many adhere to the philosophy of \"Dudeism\". Andrew Sarris wrote that the Coens had made a \"cubist collage of an old genre with a new frankness. The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there\u2019ll be anything else like it the rest of this year.\" It was the first collaboration between the Coens and T Bone Burnett, credited as \"Music Archivist\".\n2000s.\nThe Coen brothers' next film, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000), was another critical and commercial success. The title was borrowed from the Preston Sturges film \"Sullivan's Travels\" (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned to make a film with that title. Based loosely on Homer's \"Odyssey\" (complete with a Cyclops, sirens, \"et al.\"), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried\u2014but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit. It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading. The film's soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, \"Down from the Mountain.\"\nThe Coens next produced another noirish thriller, \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" (2001).\nThe Coens directed the 2003 film \"Intolerable Cruelty\", starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, a throwback to the romantic comedies of the 1940s. It focuses on hotshot divorce lawyer Miles Massey and a beautiful divorc\u00e9e whom Massey managed to prevent from receiving any money in her divorce. She vows to get even with him while, at the same time, he becomes smitten with her. \"Intolerable Cruelty\" received generally positive reviews, although it is considered one of the duo's weaker films. Also that year, they executive produced and did an uncredited rewrite of the Christmas black comedy \"Bad Santa\", which garnered positive reviews.\nIn 2004, the Coens made \"The Ladykillers\", a remake of the British classic by Ealing Studios. A professor, played by Tom Hanks, assembles a team to rob a casino. They rent a room in an elderly woman's home to plan the heist. When the woman discovers the plot, the gang decides to murder her to ensure her silence. The Coens received some of the most lukewarm reviews of their careers in response to this film.\nThey directed two short films for two separate anthology films\u2014\"Paris, je t'aime\" (\"Tuileries\", 2006) starring Steve Buscemi, and \"To Each His Own Cinema\" (\"World Cinema\", 2007) starring Josh Brolin. Both films received highly positive reviews.\n\"No Country for Old Men\", released in November 2007, closely follows the 2005 novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), living near the Texas/Mexico border, stumbles upon, and decides to take, two million dollars in drug money. He must then go on the run to avoid those trying to recover the money, including sociopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who confounds both Llewelyn and local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). The plotline is a return to noir themes, but in some respects it was a departure for the Coens; with the exception of Stephen Root, none of the stable of regular actors appears in the film. \"No Country\" received nearly universal critical praise, garnering a 94% \"Fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes. It won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, all of which were received by the Coens, as well as Best Supporting Actor received by Bardem. The Coens, as \"Roderick Jaynes\", were also nominated for Best Editing, but lost. It was the first time since 1961 (when Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise won for \"West Side Story\") that two directors received the Academy Award for Best Director at the same time.\nIn January 2008, Ethan Coen's play \"Almost an Evening\" premiered off-Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company Stage 2, opening to mostly enthusiastic reviews. The initial run closed on February 10, 2008, but the same production was moved to a new theatre for a commercial off-Broadway run at the Bleecker Street Theater in New York City. Produced by The Atlantic Theater Company, it ran there from March 2008 through June 1, 2008. and Art Meets Commerce. In May 2009, the Atlantic Theater Company produced Coen's \"Offices\", as part of their mainstage season at the Linda Gross Theater.\n\"Burn After Reading\", a comedy starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney, was released September 12, 2008, and portrays a collision course between two gym instructors, spies and Internet dating. Released to positive reviews, it debuted at No. 1 in North America.\nIn 2009, the Coens directed a television commercial titled \"Air Freshener\" for the Reality Coalition.\nThey next directed \"A Serious Man\", released October 2, 2009, a \"gentle but dark\" period comedy (set in 1967) with a low budget. The film is based loosely on the Coens' childhoods in an academic family in the largely Jewish suburb of Saint Louis Park, Minnesota; it also drew comparisons to the \"Book of Job\". Filming took place late in the summer of 2008, in the neighborhoods of Roseville and Bloomington, Minnesota, at Normandale Community College, and at St. Olaf College. The film was nominated for the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.\n2010s.\n\"True Grit\" (2010) is based on the 1968 novel of the same name by Charles Portis. Filming was done in Texas and New Mexico. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Mattie Ross along with Jeff Bridges as Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin also appear in the movie. \"True Grit\" was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture.\nEthan Coen wrote the one-act comedy \"Talking Cure\", which was produced on Broadway in 2011 as part of \"Relatively Speaking\", an anthology of three one-act plays by Coen, Elaine May, and Woody Allen.\nIn 2011, the Coen brothers won the $1 million Dan David Prize for their contribution to cinema and society.\n\"Inside Llewyn Davis\" (2013) is a treatise on the 1960s folk music scene in New York City's Greenwich Village, and very loosely based on the life of Dave Van Ronk. The film stars Oscar Isaac, Justin Timberlake, and Carey Mulligan. It won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, where it was highly praised by critics. They received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song for \"Please Mr. Kennedy\", which is heard in the film.\n\"Fargo\", a television series inspired by their film of the same name, premiered in April 2014 on the FX network. It is created by Noah Hawley and executive produced by the brothers.\nThe Coens also contributed to the screenplay for \"Unbroken\", along with Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. The film is directed by Angelina Jolie and based on Laura Hillenbrand's non-fiction book, \"\" (2010) which itself was based on the life of Louis Zamperini. It was released on December 25, 2014, to average reviews.\nThe Coens co-wrote, with playwright Matt Charman, the screenplay for the dramatic historical thriller \"Bridge of Spies\", about the 1960 U-2 Incident. The film was directed by Steven Spielberg, and released on October 4, 2015, to critical acclaim. They were nominated for the Best Original Screenplay at the 88th Academy Awards.\nThe Coens directed the film \"Hail, Caesar!\", about a \"fixer\" in 1950s Hollywood trying to discover what happened to a cast member who vanishes during filming. It stars Coen regulars George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton, as well as Channing Tatum, Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich. The film was released on February 5, 2016.\nIn 2016, the Coens gave to their longtime friend and collaborator John Turturro the right to use his character of Jesus Quintana from \"The Big Lebowski\" in his own spin-off, \"The Jesus Rolls\", which he would also write and direct. The Coens have no involvement in the production. In August 2016, the film began principal photography.\nThe Coens first wrote the script for \"Suburbicon\" in 1986. The film was eventually directed by George Clooney and began filming in October 2016. It was released by Paramount Pictures in the fall of 2017.\nThe Coens directed \"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\", a Western anthology starring Tim Blake Nelson, Liam Neeson, and James Franco. It began streaming on Netflix on November 16, 2018, after a brief theatrical run.\n2020s.\nIt was announced in March 2019 that Joel Coen would be directing an adaptation of \"Macbeth\" starring Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand. The film, titled \"The Tragedy of Macbeth\", was Joel's first directorial effort without his brother, who was taking a break from films to focus on theater. The film premiered at the 2021 New York Film Festival. The 2022 Cannes Film Festival had a special screening of \"\", an archival documentary film directed solely by Ethan Coen and edited by his wife Tricia Cooke. In 2022, it was announced that Ethan Coen would be directing \"Drive-Away Dolls\" for Focus Features and Working Title from a script he co-wrote with Cooke. It was Ethan's first narrative film without his brother. The film was released in February 2024. He and Cooke subsequently collaborated on the 2025 film \"Honey Don't!\" Joel Coen will next direct the upcoming mystery film \"Jack of Spades.\"\nIn 2025, in an interview with \"Collider\", Ethan Coen acknowledged the hiatus since the brothers' last collaboration, saying that it was due to them being \"out of sync\" with each other due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic, while stressing that they never formally decided to stop making movies together.\nProduction company.\nThe Coen brothers' own film production company, Mike Zoss Productions located in New York City, has been credited on their films from \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" onwards. It was named after Mike Zoss Drug, an independent pharmacy in St. Louis Park since 1950 that was the brothers' beloved hangout when they were growing up in the Twin Cities. The name was also used for the pharmacy in \"No Country for Old Men\". The Mike Zoss logo consists of a crayon drawing of a horse, standing in a field of grass with its head turned around as it looks back over its hindquarters.\nDirecting distinctions.\nUp to 2003, Joel received sole credit for directing and Ethan for producing, due to guild rules that disallowed multiple director credits to prevent dilution of the position's significance. The only exception to this rule is if the co-directors are an \"established duo\". Since 2004 they have been able to share the director credit and the Coen brothers have become only the third duo to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director.\nWith four Academy Award nominations for \"No Country for Old Men\" for the duo (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing as Roderick Jaynes), the Coen brothers matched the record for the most nominations by a single nominee (counting an \"established duo\" as one nominee) for the same film. Orson Welles set the record in 1941 with \"Citizen Kane\" being nominated for Best Picture (though at the time, individual producers were not named as nominees), Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay. Warren Beatty received the same nominations, first for \"Heaven Can Wait\" in 1978 and again in 1981 with \"Reds\". Alan Menken also then achieved the same feat when he was nominated for Best Score and triple-nominated for Best Song for \"Beauty and the Beast\" in 1991. More recently Chlo\u00e9 Zhao matched this record in 2021 when she was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing for \"Nomadland\" (which also starred McDormand in her third Oscar-winning role). In 2025, Sean Baker matched this record at the 97th Academy Awards with his nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Editing for \"Anora\", winning all four to become the first person to win four Oscars in the same year since Walt Disney in 1953, and the first person to win four Oscars in the same night for the same film.\nPersonal lives.\nJoel has been married to actress Frances McDormand since 1984. In 1995, they adopted a son from Paraguay when he was six months old. McDormand has acted in a number of Coen brothers films: \"Blood Simple\", \"Raising Arizona\", \"Miller's Crossing\", \"Barton Fink\", \"Fargo\", \"The Man Who Wasn't There\", \"Burn After Reading\", \"Hail, Caesar!\", and \"The Tragedy of Macbeth\". For her performance in \"Fargo\", she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nEthan married film editor Tricia Cooke in 1993. They have two children: a daughter and a son. The two describe their relationship as \"nontraditional\"; Cooke is both queer and a lesbian and Ethan is straight, and the two have separate partners. They co-wrote the film \"Drive-Away Dolls\", which Ethan directed and Tricia edited. Ethan published \"Gates of Eden\", a collection of short stories, in 1998. The same year, he co-wrote the comedy \"The Naked Man\", directed by their storyboard artist J. Todd Anderson.\nEthan Coen and family live in New York, while Joel Coen and Frances McDormand live in Marin County, California.\nAccolades.\nDirected Academy Award performances.\nUnder the Coen brothers' direction, these actors have received Academy Award nominations (and wins) for their performances in their respective roles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15781", "revid": "24927429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15781", "title": "Jorge Luis Borges", "text": "Argentine writer (1899\u20131986)\nJorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges ( ; ; 24 August 1899 \u2013 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator regarded as a key figure in Spanish-language and international literature. His best-known works, (transl.\u2009\"Fictions\") and (transl.\u2009\"The Aleph\"), published in the 1940s, are collections of short stories exploring motifs such as dreams, labyrinths, chance, infinity, archives, mirrors, fictional writers, and mythology. Borges's works have contributed to philosophical literature and the fantasy genre, and have had a major influence on the magical realist movement in 20th century Latin American literature.\nBorn in Buenos Aires, Borges later moved with his family to Switzerland in 1914, where he studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve. The family travelled widely in Europe, including Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955, he was appointed director of the National Public Library and professor of English Literature at the University of Buenos Aires. He became completely blind by the age of 55. Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination. By the 1960s, his work was translated and published widely in the United States and Europe. Borges himself was fluent in several languages.\nIn 1961, Borges came to international attention when he received the first International Formentor Prize, which he shared with Samuel Beckett. In 1971, he won the Jerusalem Prize. His international reputation was consolidated in the 1960s, aided by the growing number of English translations, the Latin American Boom, and by the success of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\". He dedicated his final work, \"The Conspirators\", to the city of Geneva, Switzerland. Writer and essayist J. M. Coetzee said of him: \"He, more than anyone, renovated the language of fiction and thus opened the way to a remarkable generation of Spanish-American novelists.\" David Foster Wallace wrote: \"The truth, briefly stated, is that Borges is arguably the great bridge between modernism and post-modernism in world literature... His stories are inbent and hermetic, with the oblique terror of a game whose rules are unknown and its stakes everything.\"\nLife and career.\nEarly life and education.\nJorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges was born into an educated middle-class family on 24 August 1899. They lived in Palermo, a then-poor area of Buenos Aires. Borges's mother, Leonor Acevedo Su\u00e1rez, worked as a translator and came from a family of criollo (Spanish) origin. Her family had been much involved in the European settling of South America and the Argentine War of Independence, and she spoke often of their heroic actions.\nHis 1929 book \"Cuaderno San Mart\u00edn\" includes the poem \"Isidoro Acevedo\", commemorating his grandfather, Isidoro de Acevedo Laprida, a soldier of the Buenos Aires Army. A descendant of the Argentine lawyer and politician Francisco Narciso de Laprida, Acevedo Laprida fought in the battles of Cepeda in 1859, Pav\u00f3n in 1861, and Los Corrales in 1880. Acevedo Laprida died of pulmonary congestion in the house where his grandson Jorge Luis Borges was born. According to a study by Antonio Andrade, Jorge Luis Borges had Portuguese ancestry: Borges's great-grandfather, Francisco, was born in Portugal in 1770, and lived in Torre de Moncorvo, in the north of the country, before he emigrated to Argentina, where he married Carmen Lafinur.\nBorges's own father, Jorge Guillermo Borges Haslam, was a lawyer and wrote the novel \"El caudillo\" in 1921. Borges Haslam was born in Entre R\u00edos of Spanish, Portuguese, and English descent, the son of Francisco Borges Lafinur, a colonel, and Frances Ann Haslam, an Englishwoman. Borges Haslam grew up speaking English at home. The family frequently traveled to Europe. Borges Haslam wedded Leonor Acevedo Su\u00e1rez in 1898 and their children also included the painter Norah Borges, sister of Jorge Luis Borges.\nAt age ten, Jorge Luis Borges translated Oscar Wilde's \"The Happy Prince\" into Spanish. It was published in a local journal, but Borges's friends thought the real author was his father. Borges Haslam was a lawyer and psychology teacher who harboured literary aspirations. Borges said his father \"tried to become a writer and failed in the attempt\", despite the 1921 opus \"El caudillo\". Jorge Luis Borges wrote, \"As most of my people had been soldiers and I knew I would never be, I felt ashamed, quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action.\"\nJorge Luis Borges was taught at home until the age of 11 and was bilingual in Spanish and English, reading Shakespeare in the latter at the age of twelve. The family lived in a large house with an English library of over one thousand volumes; Borges would later remark that \"if I were asked to name the chief event in my life, I should say my father's library.\"\nHis father gave up practicing law due to the failing eyesight that would eventually affect his son. In 1914, the family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and spent the next decade in Europe. In Geneva, Borges Haslam was treated by an eye specialist, while his son and daughter attended school. Jorge Luis learned French, read Thomas Carlyle in English, and began to read philosophy in German. In 1917, when he was eighteen, he met writer Maurice Abramowicz and began a literary friendship that lasted for the remainder of his life. He received his baccalaur\u00e9at from the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve in 1918. The Borges family decided that, due to political unrest in Argentina, they would remain in Switzerland during the war. After World War I, the family spent three years living in various cities: Lugano, Barcelona, Mallorca, Seville, and Madrid. They remained in Europe until 1921.\nAt that time, Borges discovered the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer and Gustav Meyrink's \"The Golem\" (1915), which became influential to his work. In Spain, Borges became a member of the avant-garde, anti-Modernismo Ultraist literary movement, inspired by Guillaume Apollinaire and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, close to the Imagists. His first poem, \"Hymn to the Sea\", written in the style of Walt Whitman, was published in the magazine \"Grecia\". While in Spain, he met such noted Spanish writers as Rafael Cansinos Assens and Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna.\nEarly writing career.\nIn 1921, Borges returned with his family to Buenos Aires. He had little formal education, no qualifications and few friends. He wrote to a friend that Buenos Aires was now \"overrun by arrivistes, by correct youths lacking any mental equipment, and decorative young ladies\". He brought with him the doctrine of Ultraism and launched his career, publishing surreal poems and essays in literary journals. In 1923, Borges first published his poetry, a collection called \"Fervor de Buenos Aires\", and contributed to the avant-garde review \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\". Borges co-founded the journals \"Prisma\", a broadsheet distributed largely by pasting copies to walls in Buenos Aires, and \"Proa\". Later in life, Borges regretted some of these early publications, attempting to purchase all known copies to ensure their destruction.\nBy the mid-1930s, he began to explore existential questions and fiction. He worked in a style that Argentine critic Ana Mar\u00eda Barrenechea has called \"irreality\". Many other Latin American writers, such as Juan Rulfo, Juan Jos\u00e9 Arreola, and Alejo Carpentier, were investigating these themes, influenced by the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger. In this vein, Borges biographer Edwin Williamson underlines the danger of inferring an autobiographically inspired basis for the content or tone of certain of his works: books, philosophy, and imagination were as much a source of real inspiration to him as his own lived experience, if not more so. \nFrom the first issue, Borges was a regular contributor to \"Sur\", founded in 1931 by Victoria Ocampo. It was then Argentina's most important literary journal and helped Borges find his fame. Ocampo introduced Borges to Adolfo Bioy Casares, another well-known figure of Argentine literature who was to become a frequent collaborator and close friend. They wrote a number of works together, some under the \"nom de plume\" H. Bustos Domecq, including a parody detective series and fantasy stories. During these years, a family friend, Macedonio Fern\u00e1ndez, became a major influence on Borges. The two would preside over discussions in caf\u00e9s, at country retreats, or in Fernandez's tiny apartment in the Balvanera district. He appears by name in Borges's \"Dialogue about a Dialogue\", in which the two discuss the immortality of the soul.\nIn 1933, Borges gained an editorial appointment at \"Revista Multicolor de los S\u00e1bados\" (the literary supplement of the Buenos Aires newspaper \"Cr\u00edtica\"), where he first published the pieces collected as \"Historia universal de la infamia\" (\"A Universal History of Infamy\") in 1935. The book includes two types of writing: the first lies somewhere between non-fiction essays and short stories, using fictional techniques to tell essentially true stories. The second consists of literary forgeries, which Borges initially passed off as translations of passages from famous but seldom-read works.\nIn the following years, he served as a literary adviser for the publishing house Emec\u00e9 Editores, and from 1936 to 1939 wrote weekly columns for \"El Hogar\". In 1938, Borges found work as the first assistant at the Miguel Can\u00e9 Municipal Library. It was in a working-class area and there were so few books that cataloging more than one hundred books per day, he was told, would leave little to do for the other staff and would make them look bad. The task took him about an hour each day and the rest of his time he spent in the basement of the library, writing and translating.\nLater career.\nBorges's father died in 1938, shortly before his 64th birthday. On Christmas Eve that year, Borges had a severe head injury; during treatment, he nearly died of sepsis. While recovering from the accident, Borges began exploring a new style of writing for which he would become famous. His first story written after his accident, \"Pierre Menard, Author of the \"Quixote\",\" came out in May 1939. One of his most famous works, \"Menard\" examines the nature of authorship, as well as the relationship between an author and his historical context. His first collection of short stories, \"El jard\u00edn de senderos que se bifurcan\" (\"The Garden of Forking Paths\"), appeared in 1941, composed mostly of works previously published in \"Sur\".\nThe title story concerns a Chinese professor in England, Dr. Yu Tsun, who spies for Germany during World War I, in an attempt to prove to the authorities that an Asian person is able to obtain the information that they seek. A combination of book and maze, it can be read in many ways. Through it, Borges arguably invented the hypertext novel and went on to describe a theory of the universe based upon the structure of such a novel.\nComposed of stories taking up over sixty pages, the book was generally well received, but \"El jard\u00edn de senderos que se bifurcan\" failed to garner for him the literary prizes many in his circle expected. Victoria Ocampo dedicated a large portion of the July 1942 issue of \"Sur\" to a \"Reparation for Borges\". Numerous leading writers and critics from Argentina and throughout the Spanish-speaking world contributed writings to the \"reparation\" project.\nWith his vision beginning to fade in his early thirties and unable to support himself as a writer, Borges began a new career as a public lecturer. He became an increasingly public figure, obtaining appointments as president of the Argentine Society of Writers and as professor of English and American Literature at the Argentine Association of English Culture. His short story \"Emma Zunz\" was made into a film (under the name of \"D\u00edas de odio\", \"Days of Hate\", directed in 1954 by Leopoldo Torre Nilsson). Around this time, Borges also began writing screenplays.\nThe American novelist William Faulkner was already a well-known writer in the Spanish-speaking world when Borges translated his novel \"The Wild Palms\" in 1940. Borges was a great admirer of Faulkner, but it is likely that his choice to translate a lesser novel was born out of opportunity and need. The novel had been published in the US in 1939, and Borges may have needed the money such work would bring. Nevertheless, his translation formed an indelible bridge between contemporary Latin American literature and the writer of the southern United States. Borges' intuitive understanding of and ability to render Faulkner's style was an important influence on a later generation of writers such as Juan Rulfo, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.\nIn 1955, Borges became director of the Argentine National Library. By the late 1950s he had become completely blind. Neither the coincidence nor the irony of his blindness as a writer escaped Borges:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHis later collection of poetry, \"Elogio de la Sombra\" (\"In Praise of Darkness\"), develops this theme. In 1956 the University of Cuyo awarded Borges the first of many honorary doctorates and the following year he received the National Prize for Literature. From 1956 to 1970, Borges also held a position as a professor of literature at the University of Buenos Aires and other temporary appointments at other universities. He received a British honorary knighthood in 1964. In the fall of 1967 and spring of 1968, he delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University.\nAs his eyesight deteriorated, Borges relied increasingly on his mother's help. When he was not able to read and write anymore (he never learned to read Braille), his mother, to whom he had always been close, became his personal secretary. When Per\u00f3n returned from exile and was re-elected president in 1973, Borges immediately resigned as director of the National Library.\nInternational renown.\nEight of Borges's poems appear in the 1943 anthology of Spanish American Poets by H. R. Hays. \"The Garden of Forking Paths\", one of the first Borges stories to be translated into English, appeared in the August 1948 issue of \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\", translated by Anthony Boucher. Though several other Borges translations appeared in literary magazines and anthologies during the 1950s (and one story appeared in the fantasy and science fiction magazine \"Fantastic Universe\" in 1960), his international fame dates from the early 1960s.\nIn 1961, Borges received the first \"Prix International\", which he shared with Samuel Beckett. While Beckett had garnered a distinguished reputation in Europe and America, Borges had been largely unknown and untranslated in the English-speaking world and the prize stirred great interest in his work. The Italian government named Borges \"Commendatore\" and the University of Texas at Austin appointed him for one year to the Tinker Chair. This led to his first lecture tour in the United States. In 1962, two major anthologies of Borges's writings were published in English by New York presses: \"Ficciones\" and \"Labyrinths\". In that year, Borges began lecture tours of Europe. Numerous honors were to accumulate over the years such as a Special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America \"for distinguished contribution to the mystery genre\" (1976), the Balzan Prize (for philology, linguistics and literary criticism) and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca, the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (all 1980), as well as the French Legion of Honour (1983) and the Diamond Konex Award for Literature Arts as the most important writer in the last decade in his country.\nIn 1967, Borges began a five-year period of collaboration with the American translator Norman Thomas di Giovanni, through whom he became better known in the English-speaking world. Di Giovanni contended that Borges's popularity was due to his writing with multiple languages in mind and deliberately using Latin words as a bridge from Spanish to English.\nBorges continued to publish books, among them \"El libro de los seres imaginarios\" (\"Book of Imaginary Beings\", 1967, co-written with Margarita Guerrero), \"El informe de Brodie\" (\"Dr. Brodie's Report\", 1970), and \"El libro de arena\" (\"The Book of Sand\", 1975). He lectured prolifically. Many of these lectures were anthologized in volumes such as \"Siete noches\" (\"Seven Nights\") and \"Nueve ensayos dantescos\" (\"Nine Dantesque Essays\").\nHis presence in 1967 on campus at the University of Virginia (UVA) in the U.S. mirrored William Faulkner's tenure there ten years earlier as UVa's first writer-in-residence and influenced a group of students among whom was Jared Loewenstein, who would later become founder and curator of the Jorge Luis Borges Collection at UVA, one of the largest repositories of documents and manuscripts pertaining to Borges's early works. In 1984, he travelled to Athens, Greece, and later to Rethymnon, Crete, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the School of Philosophy at the University of Crete.\nLater personal life.\nIn the mid-1960s, Borges became acquainted with Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the future Pope Francis, who was at the time a young Jesuit priest. In 1979, Borges spoke appreciatively and at some length about Bergoglio to the Argentine poet and essayist Roberto Alifano.\nIn 1967, Borges married the recently widowed Elsa Astete Mill\u00e1n. Friends believed that his mother, who was 90 and anticipating her own death, wanted to find someone to care for her blind son. The marriage lasted less than three years. After a legal separation, Borges moved back in with his mother, with whom he lived until her death at age 99. Thereafter, he lived alone in the small flat he had shared with her, cared for by Fanny, their housekeeper of many decades.\nFrom 1975 until the time of his death, Borges traveled internationally. He was often accompanied in these travels by his personal assistant Mar\u00eda Kodama, an Argentine woman of Japanese and German ancestry. In April 1986, a few months before his death, he married her via an attorney in Paraguay, in what was then a common practice among Argentines wishing to circumvent the Argentine laws of the time regarding divorce. According to Kodama, Borges drank as a young man, but eventually gave up alcohol as he aged and \"felt more secure.\" On his religious views, Borges declared himself an agnostic, clarifying: \"Being an agnostic means all things are possible, even God, even the Holy Trinity. This world is so strange that anything may happen, or may not happen.\" Borges was taught to read the Bible by his English Protestant grandmother and he prayed the Our Father each night because of a promise he made to his mother. He also died in the presence of a priest.\nDeath.\nDuring his final days in Geneva, Borges began brooding about the possibility of an afterlife. Although calm and collected about his own death, Borges began probing Kodama as to whether she inclined more towards the Shinto beliefs of her father or the Catholicism of her mother. Kodama \"had always regarded Borges as an Agnostic, as she was herself\", but given the insistence of his questioning, she offered to call someone more \"qualified\". Borges responded, \"You are asking me if I want a priest.\" He then instructed her to call two clergymen, a Catholic priest, in memory of his mother, and a Protestant minister, in memory of his English grandmother. He was visited first by Father Pierre Jacquet and by Pastor Edouard de Montmollin.\nBorges died of liver cancer on 14 June 1986, aged 86, in Geneva. His burial was preceded by an ecumenical service at the Protestant St. Pierre Cathedral on 18 June. With many Swiss and Argentine dignitaries present, Pastor de Montmollin read the First Chapter of St John's Gospel. He then preached that \"Borges was a man who had unceasingly searched for the right word, the term that could sum up the whole, the final meaning of things.\" He said, however, that no man can reach that word through his own efforts and in trying becomes lost in a labyrinth. Pastor de Montmollin concluded, \"It is not man who discovers the word, it is the Word that comes to him.\"\nFather Jacquet also preached, saying that, when visiting Borges before his death, he had found \"a man full of love, who received from the Church the forgiveness of his sins\". After the funeral, Borges was laid to rest in Geneva's Cimeti\u00e8re de Plainpalais. His grave, marked by a rough-hewn headstone, is adorned with carvings derived from Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse art and literature.\nLegacy.\nMaria Kodama, his widow and heir on the basis of the marriage and two wills, gained control over his works. Her assertive administration of his estate resulted in a bitter dispute with the French publisher Gallimard regarding the republication of the complete works of Borges in French, with Pierre Assouline in \"Le Nouvel Observateur\" (August 2006) calling her \"an obstacle to the dissemination of the works of Borges\". Kodama took legal action against Assouline, considering the remark unjustified and defamatory, asking for a symbolic compensation of one euro. Kodama also rescinded all publishing rights for existing collections of his work in English, including the translations by Norman Thomas di Giovanni, in which Borges himself had collaborated, and from which di Giovanni would have received an unusually high fifty percent of the royalties. Kodama commissioned new translations by Andrew Hurley, which have become the official translations in English. At the time of her death, Kodama left no will and the status of the Borges estate is in limbo.\nPolitical opinions.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Borges was a vocal supporter of Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen and the social democratic Radical Civic Union. In 1945, Borges signed a manifesto calling for an end to military rule and the establishment of political liberty and democratic elections. By the 1960s, he had grown more skeptical of democracy. During a 1971 conference at Columbia University, a creative writing student asked Borges what he regarded as \"a writer's duty to his time\". Borges replied, \"I think a writer's duty is to be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, I think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings\u2014except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six-Day War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don't want to intrude into them, I'm writing fiction, not fables.\" In the 1980s, towards the end of his life, Borges regained his earlier faith in democracy and held it out as the only hope for Argentina. In 1983, Borges applauded the election of the Radical Civic Union's Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn and welcomed the end of military rule with the following words: \"I once wrote that democracy is the abuse of statistics\u00a0... On October 30, 1983, Argentine democracy refuted me splendidly. Splendidly and resoundingly.\"\nAnti-communism.\nBorges recurrently declared himself a \"Spencerian anarchist who believes in the individual and not in the State\" due to his father's influence. In an interview with Richard Burgin during the late 1960s, Borges described himself as a \"mild\" adherent of classical liberalism. He further recalled that his opposition to communism and to Marxism was absorbed in his childhood, stating: \"Well, I have been brought up to think that the individual should be strong and the State should be weak. I couldn't be enthusiastic about theories where the State is more important than the individual.\" After the overthrow via coup d'\u00e9tat of President Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n in 1955, Borges supported efforts to purge Argentina's Government of Peronists and dismantle the former President's welfare state. He was enraged that the Communist Party of Argentina opposed these measures and sharply criticized them in lectures and in print. Borges's opposition to the Party in this matter ultimately led to a permanent rift with his longtime lover, Argentine Communist Estela Canto.\nIn a 1956 interview given to \"El Hogar\", Borges stated that communists \"are in favor of totalitarian regimes and systematically combat freedom of thought, oblivious of the fact that the principal victims of dictatorships are, precisely, intelligence and culture.\" He elaborated: \"Many people are in favor of dictatorships because they allow them to avoid thinking for themselves. Everything is presented to them ready-made. There are even agencies of the State that supply them with opinions, passwords, slogans, and even idols to exalt or cast down according to the prevailing wind or in keeping with the directives of the thinking heads of the single party.\"\nIn later years, Borges frequently expressed contempt for Marxist and communist authors, poets, and intellectuals. In an interview with Burgin, Borges referred to Chilean poet Pablo Neruda as \"a very fine poet\" but a \"very mean man\" for unconditionally supporting the Soviet Union and demonizing the United States. Borges commented about Neruda, \"Now he knows that's rubbish.\" In the same interview, Borges also criticized famed poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who was abducted by Nationalist soldiers and executed without trial during the Spanish Civil War. In Borges's opinion, Lorca's poetry and plays, when examined against his tragic death, appeared better than they actually were.\nAnti-fascism.\nIn 1934, Argentine ultra-nationalists, sympathetic to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, asserted Borges was secretly Jewish and by implication not truly Argentinian. Borges responded with the essay \"Yo, Jud\u00edo\" (\"I, a Jew\"), a reference to the old phrase \"Yo, Argentino\" (\"I, an Argentine\") uttered by potential victims during pogroms against Argentine Jews to signify one was not Jewish. In the essay, Borges declares he would be proud to be a Jew, and remarks that any pure Castilian is likely to come from ancient Jewish descent, from a millennium ago. Both before and during the Second World War, Borges regularly published essays attacking the Nazi police state and its racist ideology. His outrage was fueled by his deep love for German literature. In an essay published in 1937, Borges attacked the Nazi Party's use of children's books to inflame antisemitism. He wrote, \"I don't know if the world can do without German civilization, but I do know that its corruption by the teachings of hatred is a crime.\"\nIn a 1938 essay, Borges reviewed an anthology which rewrote German authors of the past to fit the Nazi party line. He was disgusted by what he described as Germany's \"chaotic descent into darkness\" and the attendant rewriting of history. He argued that such books sacrificed the German people's culture, history and integrity in the name of restoring their national honour. Such use of children's books for propaganda he writes, \"perfect the criminal arts of barbarians.\" In a 1944 essay, Borges postulated,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nazism suffers from unreality, like Erigena's hell. It is uninhabitable; men can only die for it, lie for it, wound and kill for it. No one, in the intimate depths of his being, can wish it to triumph. I shall risk this conjecture: \"Hitler wants to be defeated\". Hitler is blindly collaborating with the inevitable armies that will annihilate him, as the metal vultures and the dragon (which must have known that they were monsters) collaborated, mysteriously, with Hercules.\"\nIn 1946, Borges published the short story \"Deutsches Requiem\", which masquerades as the last testament of a condemned Nazi war criminal named Otto Dietrich zur Linde. In a 1971 conference at Columbia University, Borges was asked about the story by a student from the creative writing program. He recalled, \"When the Germans were defeated I felt great joy and relief, but at the same time I thought of the German defeat as being somehow tragic, because here we have perhaps the most educated people in Europe, who have a fine literature, a fine tradition of philosophy and poetry. Yet these people were bamboozled by a madman named Adolf Hitler, and I think there is tragedy there.\"\nIn a 1967 interview with Burgin, Borges recalled how his interactions with Argentina's Nazi sympathisers led him to create the story. He recalled, \"And then I realized that those people that were on the side of Germany, that they never thought of German victories or the German glory. What they really liked was the idea of the Blitzkrieg, of London being on fire, of the country being destroyed. As to the German fighters, they took no stock in them. Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from this nightmare, but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I'll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis. And then I created the ideal Nazi.\"\nAt Columbia University in 1971, Borges further elaborated on the story's creation, \"I tried to imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for the fact that there was something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted me to feel sorry for them as well.\"\nAnti-Peronism.\nIn 1946, Argentine President Juan Per\u00f3n began transforming Argentina into a one-party state with the assistance of his wife, Evita. Almost immediately, the spoils system was the rule of the day, as ideological critics of the ruling \"Partido Justicialista\" were fired from government jobs. During this period, Borges was informed that he was being \"promoted\" from his position at the Miguel Can\u00e9 Library to a post as inspector of poultry and rabbits at the Buenos Aires municipal market. Upon demanding to know the reason, Borges was told, \"Well, you were on the side of the Allies, what do you expect?\" Borges resigned the following day. Per\u00f3n's treatment of Borges became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the Argentine intelligentsia. The Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) held a formal dinner in his honour. At the dinner, a speech was read which Borges had written for the occasion. It said:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still is the fact that they breed idiocy. Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of caudillos, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking\u00a0... Fighting these sad monotonies is one of the duties of a writer. Need I remind readers of \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\" or \"Don Segundo\" that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.\nIn the aftermath, Borges found himself much in demand as a lecturer and one of the intellectual leaders of the Argentine opposition. In 1951 he was asked by anti-Peronist friends to run for president of SADE. Borges, then having depression caused by a failed romance, reluctantly accepted. He later recalled that he would awake every morning and remember that Per\u00f3n was president and feel deeply depressed and ashamed. Per\u00f3n's government had seized control of the Argentine mass media and regarded SADE with indifference. Borges later recalled, however, \"Many distinguished men of letters did not dare set foot inside its doors.\" Meanwhile, SADE became an increasing refuge for critics of the Per\u00f3n government. SADE official Luisa Mercedes Levinson noted, \"We would gather every week to tell the latest jokes about the ruling couple and even dared to sing the songs of the French Resistance, as well as 'La Marseillaise'\".\nAfter Evita Per\u00f3n's death on 26 July 1952, Borges received a visit from two policemen, who ordered him to put up two portraits of the ruling couple on the premises of SADE. Borges indignantly refused, calling it a ridiculous demand. The policemen replied that he would soon face the consequences. The Justicialist Party placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to sit in on his lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down. Like much of the Argentine opposition to Per\u00f3n, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained. According to Edwin Williamson,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Borges had agreed to stand for the presidency of the SADE in order [to] fight for intellectual freedom, but he also wanted to avenge the humiliation he believed he had suffered in 1946, when the Peronists had proposed to make him an inspector of chickens. In his letter of 1950 to Attilio Rossi, he claimed that his infamous promotion had been a clever way the Peronists had found of damaging him and diminishing his reputation. The closure of the SADE meant that the Peronists had damaged him a second time, as was borne out by the visit of the Spanish writer Juli\u00e1n Mar\u00edas, who arrived in Buenos Aires shortly after the closure of the SADE. It was impossible for Borges, as president, to hold the usual reception for the distinguished visitor; instead, one of Borges's friends brought a lamb from his ranch, and they had it roasted at a tavern across the road from the SADE building on Calle Mexico. After dinner, a friendly janitor let them into the premises, and they showed Mar\u00edas around by candlelight. That tiny group of writers leading a foreign guest through a dark building by the light of guttering candles was vivid proof of the extent to which the SADE had been diminished under the rule of Juan Per\u00f3n.\nOn 16 September 1955, General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu's \"Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora\" toppled the ruling party and forced Per\u00f3n into exile. Borges was overjoyed and joined demonstrators marching through the streets of Buenos Aires. According to Williamson, Borges shouted, \"Viva la Patria\", until his voice grew hoarse. Due to the influence of Borges's mother and his own role on the opposition to Peron, the provisional government appointed Borges as the Director of the National Library.\nIn his essay \"L'Illusion Comique\", Borges wrote there were two histories of Peronism in Argentina. The first he described as \"the criminal one\", composed of the police state tactics used against both real and imagined anti-Peronists. The second history was, according to Borges, \"the theatrical one\" composed of \"tales and fables made for consumption by dolts.\" He argued that, despite their claims to detest capitalism, Juan and Eva Per\u00f3n \"copied its methods, dictating names and slogans to the people\" in the same way that multi-national corporations \"impose their razor blades, cigarettes, and washing machines.\" Borges then listed the numerous conspiracy theories the ruling couple dictated to their followers and how those theories were accepted without question. Borges concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is useless to list the examples; one can only denounce the duplicity of the fictions of the former regime, which can't be believed and were believed. It will be said that the public's lack of sophistication is enough to explain the contradiction; I believe that the cause is more profound. Coleridge spoke of the \"willing suspension of disbelief,\" that is, poetic faith; Samuel Johnson said, in defense of Shakespeare, that the spectators at a tragedy do not believe they are in Alexandria in the first act and Rome in the second but submit to the pleasure of a fiction. Similarly, the lies of a dictatorship are neither believed nor disbelieved; they pertain to an intermediate plane, and their purpose is to conceal or justify sordid or atrocious realities. They pertain to the pathetic or the clumsily sentimental. Happily, for the enlightenment and security of the Argentines, the current regime has understood that the function of government is not to inspire pathos.\nIn a 1967 interview, Borges said, \"Per\u00f3n was a humbug, and he knew it, and everybody knew it. But Per\u00f3n could be very cruel. I mean, he had people tortured, killed. And his wife was a common prostitute.\" When Per\u00f3n returned from exile in 1973 and regained the Presidency, Borges was enraged. In a 1975 interview for \"National Geographic\", he said \"Damn, the snobs are back in the saddle. If their posters and slogans again defile the city, I'll be glad I've lost my sight. Well, they can't humiliate me as they did before my books sold well.\"\nAfter being accused of being unforgiving, Borges quipped, \"I resented Per\u00f3n's making Argentina look ridiculous to the world\u00a0... as in 1951, when he announced control over thermonuclear fusion, which still hasn't happened anywhere but in the sun and the stars. For a time, Argentines hesitated to wear band aids for fear friends would ask, 'Did the atomic bomb go off in your hand?' A shame, because Argentina really has world-class scientists.\" After Borges's death in 1986, the Peronist \"Partido Justicialista\" declined to send a delegate to the writer's memorial service in Buenos Aires. A spokesman for the Party said that this was in reaction to \"certain declarations he had made about the country.\" Later, at the City Council of Buenos Aires, Peronist politicians refused to honor Borges as an Argentine, commenting that he \"chose to die abroad.\" When infuriated politicians from the other parties demanded to know the real reason, the Peronists finally explained that Borges had made statements about Evita Per\u00f3n which they called \"unacceptable\".\nMilitary junta.\nDuring the 1970s, Borges at first expressed support for Argentina's military junta, but was scandalized by the junta's actions during the Dirty War. In protest against their support of the regime, Borges ceased publishing in the newspaper \"La Naci\u00f3n\". In 1985, he wrote a short poem about the Falklands War called \"Juan L\u00f3pez y John Ward\", about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to \"islands that were too famous\". He also said about the war: \"The Falklands thing was a fight between two bald men over a comb.\"\nBorges was an observer at the trials of the military junta in 1985 and wrote that \"not to judge and condemn the crimes would be to encourage impunity and to become, somehow, its accomplice.\" Borges added that \"the news of the missing people, the crimes and atrocities [the military] committed\" had inspired him to return to his earlier Emersonian faith in democracy.\nIndigenous cultures.\nBorges believed that indigenous peoples in what is now called Argentina had no traditions: \"There's no native tradition of any kind since the Indians here were mere barbarians. We have to fall back on the European tradition, why not? It's a very fine tradition.\"\nWorks.\nWardrip-Fruin and Montfort argue that Borges \"may have been the most important figure in Spanish-language literature since Cervantes. He was clearly of tremendous influence, writing intricate poems, short stories, and essays that instantiated concepts of dizzying power.\" Borges's work has been compared to that of Homer and Milton. Indeed, the critic Harold Bloom numbers Borges among the key figures of the Western literary canon.\nIn addition to short stories, for which he is most noted, Borges also wrote poetry, essays, screenplays, and literary criticism, and edited numerous anthologies. His longest work of fiction is a fourteen-page story, \"The Congress\", first published in 1971. His late-onset blindness strongly influenced his later writing. Borges wrote: \"When I think of what I've lost, I ask, 'Who know themselves better than the blind?' \u2013 for every thought becomes a tool.\" Paramount among his intellectual interests were elements of mythology, mathematics, theology, integrating these through literature, sometimes playfully, sometimes with great seriousness.\nBorges composed poetry throughout his life. As his eyesight waned (it came and went, with a struggle between advancing age and advances in eye surgery), he increasingly focused on writing poetry, since he could memorize an entire work in progress. His poems embrace the same wide range of interests as his fiction, along with issues that emerge in his critical works and translations, and from more personal musings. For example, his interest in idealism runs through his work, reflected in the fictional world of Tl\u00f6n in \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\" and in his essay \"A New Refutation of Time\".\nTranslations by Borges.\nBorges was a notable translator. He translated works of literature in English, French, German, Old English, and Old Norse into Spanish. His first publication, for a Buenos Aires newspaper, was a translation of Oscar Wilde's story \"The Happy Prince\" into Spanish when he was ten. At the end of his life he produced a Spanish-language version of a part of Snorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\". He also translated (while simultaneously subtly transforming) the works of, among others, Ambrose Bierce, William Faulkner, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka, Rudyard Kipling, Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, and Virginia Woolf. Borges wrote and lectured extensively on the art of translation, holding that a translation may improve upon the original, may even be unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory renderings of the same work can be equally valid. Borges employed the devices of literary forgery and the review of an imaginary work, both forms of modern pseudo-epigrapha.\nDiscography.\nBorges\u2019 recorded work includes readings of his poems, a collaboration with Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla, and a series of lectures on a characteristically wide range of topics, from Buddhism to the nature of poetry.\nMusic.\nPolydor \u2013 20291\nPoetry.\nAMB Discografica \u2013 123 \u2013 1\nUniversidad Nacional Autonoma De Mexico \u2013 VVAL-13, UNAM-113/114\nLectures and other works.\nMicrofon \u2013 SUP 955\nMicrofon \u2013 SUP 959\nMicrofon \u2013 SUP 958\nMicrofon \u2013 SUP 960\nMicrofon \u2013 SUP 957\nEMI \u2013 8569/70\nHoaxes and forgeries.\nBorges's best-known set of literary forgeries date from his early work as a translator and literary critic with a regular column in the Argentine magazine \"El Hogar\". Along with publishing numerous legitimate translations, he also published original works, for example, in the style of Emanuel Swedenborg or \" One Thousand and One Nights\", originally claiming them to be translations of works he had chanced upon. In another case, he added three short, falsely attributed pieces into his otherwise legitimate and carefully researched anthology \"El matrero\". Several of these are gathered in \"A Universal History of Infamy\". While Borges was the great popularizer of the review of an imaginary work, he had developed the idea from Thomas Carlyle's \"Sartor Resartus\", a book-length review of a non-existent German transcendentalist work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In \"This Craft of Verse\", Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva \"[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read \"Sartor Resartus\", and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart.\"\nIn the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, \"The Garden of Forking Paths\", Borges remarks, \"It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way to go about it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them.\" He then cites both \"Sartor Resartus\" and Samuel Butler's \"The Fair Haven\", remarking, however, that \"those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write \"notes\" on imaginary books.\" On the other hand, some works were wrongly attributed to Borges, like the poem \"Instantes\".\nCriticism of Borges's work.\nBorges's change in style from regionalist \"criollismo\" to a more cosmopolitan style brought him much criticism from journals such as \"\", a leftist, Sartre-influenced Argentine publication founded by David Vi\u00f1as and his brother, along with other intellectuals such as No\u00e9 Jitrik and Adolfo Prieto. In the post-Peronist Argentina of the early 1960s, \"Contorno\" met with wide approval from the youth who challenged the authenticity of older writers such as Borges and questioned their legacy of experimentation. Magic realism and exploration of universal truths, they argued, had come at the cost of responsibility and seriousness in the face of society's problems. The \"Contorno\" writers acknowledged Borges and Eduardo Mallea for being \"doctors of technique\" but argued that their work lacked substance due to their lack of interaction with the reality that they inhabited, an existentialist critique of their refusal to embrace existence and reality in their artwork.\nSexuality and perception of women.\nThe story \"The Sect of the Phoenix\" is famously interpreted to allude to the ubiquity of sexual intercourse among humans \u2013 a concept whose essential qualities the narrator of the story is not able to relate to. With a few notable exceptions, women are almost entirely absent from Borges's fiction. However, there are some instances in Borges's later writings of romantic love, for example the story \"Ulrikke\" from \"The Book of Sand\". The protagonist of the story \"El muerto\" also lusts after the \"splendid, contemptuous, red-haired woman\" of Azevedo Bandeira and later \"sleeps with the woman with shining hair\". Although they do not appear in the stories, women are significantly discussed as objects of unrequited love in his short stories \"The Zahir\" and \"The Aleph\". The plot of \"La Intrusa\" was based on a true story of two friends. Borges turned their fictional counterparts into brothers, excluding the possibility of a homosexual relationship.\n\"Emma Zunz\" is a story with an eminent female protagonist. Originally published in 1948, this work tells the tale of a young Jewish woman who kills a man in order to avenge the disgrace and suicide of her father. She carefully plans the crime, submitting to an unpleasant sexual encounter with a stranger in order to create the appearance of sexual impropriety in her intended victim. Despite the fact that she premeditates and executes a murder, the eponymous heroine of this story is surprisingly likable, both because of intrinsic qualities in the character (interestingly enough, she believes in nonviolence) and because the story is narrated from a \"remote but sympathetic\" point of view that highlights the poignancy of her situation.\nNobel Prize omission.\nBorges was never awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, something which continually distressed the writer. He was one of several distinguished authors who never received the honour. Borges commented, \"Not granting me the Nobel Prize has become a Scandinavian tradition; since I was born they have not been granting it to me.\" Some observers speculated that Borges did not receive the award in his later life because of his conservative political views, or more specifically because he had accepted an honour from Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. This view was indeed expressed by Nobel committee member Artur Lundkvist, who in 1979 wrote that Borges' \"hasty political gestures, now with fascist tendencies, make him in my view an improper Nobel laureate, for ethical and humane reasons.\"\nBorges was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature over thirty times, and was among the short-listed candidates several times. In 1965 he was considered along with Vladimir Nabokov, Pablo Neruda, and Mikhail Sholokhov, and in 1966 a shared prize to Borges and Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias was proposed. Borges was nominated again in 1967, and was among the final three choices considered by the committee according to Nobel records unsealed on the 50th anniversary in 2017. The committee considered Borges, Graham Greene and Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias, choosing Asturias as the winner.\nFact, fantasy and non-linearity.\nMany of Borges's best-known stories deal with themes of time (\"The Secret Miracle\"), infinity (\"The Aleph\"), mirrors (\"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\") and labyrinths (\"The Two Kings and the Two Labyrinths\", \"The House of Asterion\", \"The Immortal\", and \"The Garden of Forking Paths\"). Williamson writes, \"His basic contention was that fiction did not depend on the illusion of reality; what mattered ultimately was an author's ability to generate 'poetic faith' in his reader.\"\nHis stories often have fantastical themes, such as a library containing every possible 410-page text (\"The Library of Babel\"), a man who forgets nothing he experiences (\"Funes, the Memorious\"), an artifact through which the user can see everything in the universe (\"The Aleph\"), and a year of still time given to a man standing before a firing squad (\"The Secret Miracle\"). Borges told realistic stories of South American life, of folk heroes, street fighters, soldiers, gauchos, detectives, and historical figures. He mixed the real and the fantastic, fact with fiction. His interest in compounding fantasy, philosophy, and the art of translation are evident in articles such as \"The Translators of \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\"\". In the \"Book of Imaginary Beings\", a thoroughly researched bestiary of mythical creatures, Borges wrote, \"There is a kind of lazy pleasure in useless and out-of-the-way erudition.\" Borges's interest in fantasy was shared by Bioy Casares, with whom he coauthored several collections of tales between 1942 and 1967.\nOften, especially early in his career, the mixture of fact and fantasy crossed the line into the realm of hoax or literary forgery. \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" (1941) presents the idea of forking paths through networks of time, none of which is the same, all of which are equal. Borges uses the recurring image of \"a labyrinth that folds back upon itself in infinite regression\" so we \"become aware of all the possible choices we might make.\" The forking paths have branches to represent these choices that ultimately lead to different endings. Borges saw man's search for meaning in a seemingly infinite universe as fruitless and instead uses the maze as a riddle for time, not space. He examined the themes of universal randomness (\"The Lottery in Babylon\") and madness (\"The Zahir\"). Due to the success of the \"Forking Paths\" story, the term \"Borgesian\" came to reflect a quality of narrative non-linearity.\nBorges and science fiction.\nJohn Clute writes: \"as was earlier the case with Franz Kafka, a collection of whose work he translated as \"La Metamorfosis\" (coll. 1938), Borges's influence on twentieth century literature worldwide has been so deep and pervasive that any sf written in English since about 1960 may consciously or subliminally reflect his work. Any sf story whose structure or arguments question or play with the nature of reality \u2013 or which makes fantastic use of images of the Labyrinth, the Mirror, the Library, the Map, and/or the Book and/or the Dream to inform the world \u2013 will necessarily navigate seas of imagination he has already plumbed, apodictically, in ten or twenty short stories.\" Clute notes that Borges \"revealed a first-hand (if at points inaccurate) knowledge of sf and its authors, including H. P. Lovecraft, Robert A Heinlein, A. E. van Vogt and Ray Bradbury\" and cites Philip K. Dick, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut and Gene Wolfe as being directly influenced by Borges.\nWilliam Gibson recalls \"the sensation, both complex and eerily simple\", of reading \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\" in \"Labyrinths\" as a young man, seated at a writing desk said to have belonged to Francis Marion: Had the concept of software been available to me, I imagine I would have felt as though I were installing something that exponentially increased what one day would be called bandwidth, though bandwidth of \"what\", exactly, I remain unable to say. This sublime and cosmically comic fable of utterly pure information (i.e. the utterly fictive) gradually and relentlessly infiltrating and eventually consuming the quotidian, opened something within me which has never yet closed... Works we all our lives recall reading for the first time are among the truest milestones, but \"Labyrinths\" was a profoundly singular one, for me, and I believe I knew that, then, in my early adolescence. It was demonstrated to me, that afternoon. Proven. For, by the time I had finished with \"Tl\u00f6n\" (though one never finishes with Tl\u00f6n, nor indeed any story by Borges) and had traversed \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" and had wondered, literally bug-eyed, at \"Pierre Menaud, Author of the \"Quixote\"\", I discovered that I had ceased to be afraid of any influence that might dwell within Francis Marion's towering desk.\"\nBorgesian conundrum.\nThe philosophical term \"Borgesian conundrum\" is named after him and has been defined as the ontological question of \"whether the writer writes the story, or it writes him.\" The original concept was put forward by Borges in his essay \"Kafka and His Precursors\". After reviewing works that were written before those of Kafka, Borges wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If I am not mistaken, the heterogeneous pieces I have enumerated resemble Kafka; if I am not mistaken, not all of them resemble each other. The second fact is the more significant. In each of these texts we find Kafka's idiosyncrasy to a greater or lesser degree, but if Kafka had never written a line, we would not perceive this quality; in other words, it would not exist. The poem by Browning foretells Kafka's work, but our reading of Kafka perceptibly sharpens and deflects our reading of the poem. Browning did not read it as we do now. In the critics' vocabulary, the word 'precursor' is indispensable, but it should be cleansed of all connotation of polemics or rivalry. The fact is that every writer creates his own precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future.\"\nCulture and Argentine literature.\n\"Mart\u00edn Fierro\" and Argentine tradition.\nAlong with other young Argentine writers of his generation, Borges initially rallied around the fictional character of Mart\u00edn Fierro. \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\", a poem by Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, was a dominant work of 19th-century Argentine literature. Its eponymous hero became a symbol of Argentine sensibility, untied from European values \u2013 a gaucho, free, poor, \"pampas\"-dwelling. The character Fierro is illegally drafted to serve at a border fort to defend it against the indigenous population but ultimately deserts to become a \"gaucho matrero\", the Argentine equivalent of a North American western outlaw. Borges contributed keenly to the avant garde \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\" magazine in the early 1920s.\nAs Borges matured, he came to a more nuanced attitude toward the Hern\u00e1ndez poem. In his book of essays on the poem, Borges separates his admiration for the aesthetic virtues of the work from his mixed opinion of the moral virtues of its protagonist. In his essay \"The Argentine Writer and Tradition\" (1951), Borges celebrates how Hern\u00e1ndez expresses the Argentine character. In a key scene in the poem, Mart\u00edn Fierro and El Moreno compete by improvising songs on universal themes such as time, night, and the sea, reflecting the real-world gaucho tradition of \"payadas\", improvised musical dialogues on philosophical themes. Borges points out that Hern\u00e1ndez evidently knew the difference between actual gaucho tradition of composing poetry versus the \"gauchesque\" fashion among Buenos Aires literati.\nIn his works he refutes the arch-nationalist interpreters of the poem and disdains others, such as critic Eleuterio Tiscornia, for their Europeanising approach. Borges denies that Argentine literature should distinguish itself by limiting itself to \"local colour\", which he equates with cultural nationalism. Racine and Shakespeare's work, he says, looked beyond their countries' borders. Neither, he argues, need the literature be bound to the heritage of old-world Spanish or European tradition. Nor should it define itself by the conscious rejection of its colonial past. He asserts that Argentine writers need to be free to define Argentine literature anew, writing about Argentina and the world from the point of view of those who have inherited the whole of world literature. Williamson says \"Borges's main argument is that the very fact of writing from the margins provides Argentine writers with a special opportunity to innovate without being bound to the canons of the centre,\u00a0... at once a part of and apart from the centre, which gives them much potential freedom\".\nArgentine culture.\nBorges focused on universal themes, but also composed a substantial body of literature on themes from Argentine folklore and history. His first book, the poetry collection \"Fervor de Buenos Aires\" (\"Passion for Buenos Aires\"), appeared in 1923. Borges's writings on things Argentine include Argentine culture (\"History of the Tango\"; \"Inscriptions on Horse Wagons\"), folklore (\"Juan Mura\u00f1a\", \"Night of the Gifts\"), literature (\"The Argentine Writer and Tradition\", \"Almafuerte\"; \"Evaristo Carriego\"), and national concerns (\"Celebration of the Monster\", \"Hurry, Hurry\", \"The Mountebank\", \"Pedro Salvadores\"). Ultranationalists, however, continued to question his Argentine identity. Borges's interest in Argentine themes reflects in part the inspiration of his family tree. Borges had an English paternal grandmother who, around 1870, married the \"criollo\" Francisco Borges, a man with a military command and a historic role in the Argentine Civil Wars in what are now Argentina and Uruguay.\nSpurred by pride in his family's heritage, Borges often used those civil wars as settings in fiction and quasi-fiction (for example, \"The Life of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz\", \"The Dead Man\", \"Avelino Arredondo\") as well as poetry (\"General Quiroga Rides to His Death in a Carriage\"). Borges's maternal great-grandfather, Manuel Isidoro Su\u00e1rez, was another military hero, whom Borges immortalized in the poem \"A Page to Commemorate Colonel Su\u00e1rez, Victor at Jun\u00edn\".\nHis nonfiction explores many of the themes found in his fiction. Essays such as \"The History of the Tango\" or his writings on the epic poem \"Mart\u00edn Fierro\" explore Argentine themes, such as the identity of the Argentine people and of various Argentine subcultures. The varying genealogies of characters, settings, and themes in his stories, such as \"La muerte y la br\u00fajula\", used Argentine models without pandering to his readers or framing Argentine culture as \"exotic\".\nIn fact, contrary to what is usually supposed, the geographies found in his fictions often do not correspond to those of real-world Argentina. In his essay \"El escritor argentino y la tradici\u00f3n\", Borges notes that the very absence of camels in the Qur'an was proof enough that it was an Arabian work, despite the fact that camels are mentioned in the Qur'an. He suggested that only someone trying to write an \"Arab\" work would purposefully include a camel. He uses this example to illustrate how his dialogue with universal existential concerns was just as Argentine as writing about gauchos and tangos. Borges detested football.\nMulticultural influences.\nAt the time of the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816, the population was predominantly \"criollo\" (of Spanish ancestry). From the mid-1850s on, waves of immigration from Europe, especially Italy and Spain, arrived in the country, and in the following decades the Argentine national identity diversified. Borges was writing in a strongly European literary context, immersed in Spanish, English, French, German, Italian, Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse literature. He also read translations of Near Eastern and Far Eastern works. Borges's writing is also informed by scholarship of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism, including prominent religious figures, heretics, and mystics. Religion and heresy are explored in such stories as \"Averroes's Search\", \"The Writing of the God\", \"The Theologians\", and \"Three Versions of Judas\". The curious inversion of mainstream Christian concepts of redemption in the last story is characteristic of Borges's approach to theology in his literature. In describing himself, Borges said, \"I am not sure that I exist, actually. I am all the writers that I have read, all the people that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities that I have visited, all my ancestors.\" As a young man, he visited the frontier \"pampas\" which extend beyond Argentina into Uruguay and Brazil. Borges said that his father wished him \"to become a citizen of the world, a great cosmopolitan,\" in the way of Henry and William James.\nBorges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student. As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in Geneva, where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges's work belittled nationalism and racism. However, Borges also scorned his own Basque ancestry and criticised the abolition of slavery in America because he believed black people were happier remaining uneducated and without freedom. Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book \"Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi\" (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and \"Death and the Compass\". Borges wrote that he considered Mexican writer Alfonso Reyes to be \"the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time.\" Borges was also an admirer of Asian culture, e.g. the ancient Chinese board game of Go, about which he penned some verses, while \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" had a strong Chinese theme.\nInfluences.\nModernism.\nBorges was rooted in the Modernism predominant in its early years and was influenced by Symbolism. Like Vladimir Nabokov and James Joyce, he combined an interest in his native culture with broader perspectives, also sharing their multilingualism and inventiveness with language. However, while Nabokov and Joyce tended toward progressively larger works, Borges remained a miniaturist. His work progressed \"away\" from what he referred to as \"the baroque\": his later style is far more transparent and naturalistic than his earlier works. Borges represented the humanist view of media that stressed the social aspect of art driven by emotion. If art represented the tool, then Borges was more interested in how the tool could be used to relate to people.\nExistentialism saw its apogee during the years of Borges's greatest artistic production. It has been argued that his choice of topics largely ignored existentialism's central tenets. Critic Paul de Man notes, \"Whatever Borges's existential anxieties may be, they have little in common with Sartre's robustly prosaic view of literature, with the earnestness of Camus' moralism, or with the weighty profundity of German existential thought. Rather, they are the consistent expansion of a purely poetic consciousness to its furthest limits.\"\nMathematics.\nThe essay collection \"Borges y la Matem\u00e1tica\" (Borges and Mathematics, 2003) by Argentine mathematician and writer Guillermo Mart\u00ednez outlines how Borges used concepts from mathematics in his work. Mart\u00ednez states that Borges had, for example, at least a superficial knowledge of set theory, which he handles with elegance in stories such as \"The Book of Sand\". Other books such as \"The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges' Library of Babel\" by William Goldbloom Bloch (2008) and \"Unthinking Thinking: Jorge Luis Borges, Mathematics, and the New Physics\" by Floyd Merrell (1991) also explore this relationship.\nPhilosophy.\nFritz Mauthner, philosopher of language and author of the \"W\u00f6rterbuch der Philosophie\" (\"Dictionary of Philosophy\"), had an important influence on Borges. Borges always recognized the influence of this German philosopher. According to the literary review \"Sur\", the book was one of the five books most noted and read by Borges. The first time that Borges mentioned Mauthner was in 1928 in his book \"The language of the Argentines\" (El idioma de los argentinos). In a 1962 interview Borges described Mauthner as possessing a fine sense of humor as well as great knowledge and erudition.\nIn an interview, Denis Dutton asked Borges who were the \"philosophers who have influenced your works, in whom you've been the most interested\". In reply, Borges named Berkeley and Schopenhauer. He was also influenced by Spinoza, about whom Borges wrote a famous poem. It is not without humour that Borges once wrote: \"\" (\"I always imagined Paradise to be some kind of a library.\")\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15782", "revid": "1175300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15782", "title": "Jane Austen", "text": "English novelist (1775\u20131817)\nJane Austen ( ; 16 December 1775\u00a0\u2013 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six novels, which implicitly interpret, critique, and comment on the English landed gentry at the end of the 18th century.\nAusten's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage for the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works are implicit critiques of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of social commentary, realism, wit, and irony have earned her acclaim amongst critics and scholars.\nAusten wrote major novels before the age of 22, but she was not published until she was 35. The anonymously published \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814), and \"Emma\" (1816) were moderate successes, but they didn't bring her public fame in her lifetime. (She was privately known to be the author of these novels, including by notable people such as the Prince Regent.) She wrote two other novels\u2014\"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", both published posthumously in 1817\u2014and began another, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", but it was left unfinished on her death. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, the short epistolary novel \"Lady Susan\", and the unfinished novel \"The Watsons\".\nSince her death Austen's novels have rarely been out of print. A significant transition in her reputation occurred in 1833, when they were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series (illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering and sold as a set). They gradually gained wide acclaim and popular readership. In 1869 her nephew published \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\". Her work has inspired a large number of critical essays and has been included in many literary anthologies. Her novels have been adapted in numerous films, including \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1940), \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995), \"Pride &amp; Prejudice\" (2005), \"Emma\" (2020), and an adaptation of \"Lady Susan\", \"Love &amp; Friendship\" (2016), as well as the film \"Persuasion\" and the miniseries \"Pride and Prejudice\", both released in 1995 by the BBC.\nBiographical sources.\nThe scant biographical information about Austen comes from her surviving letters and a number of sketches her family members and contemporaries wrote about her.\nOnly about 160 of the approximately 3,000 letters Austen would have written in the course of her lifetime have survived and been published. It is believed that Cassandra Austen destroyed the bulk of the letters she received from her sister, by burning or otherwise. One theory is that she wanted to ensure that the \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members.\" In the interest of protecting reputations from Jane's penchant for honesty and forthrightness, Cassandra, it is surmised, may have omitted details of illnesses, unhappiness and anything she considered unsavoury. It is certainly the case that important details about her life and the actions of the Austen family were elided by intention, such as any mention of Austen's brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to have him raised away from its home, as was common for the time, or of wealthy Aunt Jane Leigh-Perrot, who was arrested, tried, and acquitted on charges of grand larceny.\nThe first Austen biography was her brother Henry Thomas Austen's 1818 \"Biographical Notice\". It appeared in a posthumous edition of \"Northanger Abbey\" and included extracts from two letters, apparently published against the judgement of other family members. Details of Austen's life continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters\", published in 1913, all of which included additional letters.\nAusten's family and relatives built a legend of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying her as a woman in a happy domestic situation, whose family was the mainstay of her life. Critics have long taken issue with this depiction of a \"mild\" Austen. Modern biographers include details excised from the letters and family biographies, but the biographer Jan Fergus writes that the challenge is to keep the view balanced, not to present her languishing in periods of deep unhappiness as \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family.\"\nEarly years to age 20.\nFamily.\nJane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775. Her father, George Austen (1731\u20131805), wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother, Cassandra, \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago.\" He added that the newborn infant was \"a present plaything for Cassy and a future companion.\" The winter of 1775-1776 was particularly harsh, and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church and christened Jane.\nGeorge served as the rector of the Anglican parishes of Steventon and Deane. The Reverend Austen came from an old and wealthy family of wool merchants. As each generation of eldest sons received inheritances, George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. In 1745, at the age of fifteen, George's sister Philadelphia was apprenticed to a milliner in Covent Garden. At the age of sixteen, George entered St John's College, Oxford, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739\u20131827). She came from the prominent Leigh family. Her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot.\nGeorge Austen and Cassandra Leigh were engaged, probably around 1763, when they exchanged miniatures. He received the living of the Steventon parish from Thomas Knight, the wealthy husband of his second cousin. They married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by licence, in a simple ceremony, two months after Cassandra's father died. Their income was modest, with George's small \"per annum\" living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death.\nAfter the living at the nearby Deane rectory had been purchased for George by his wealthy uncle Francis Austen, the Austens took up temporary residence there, until Steventon rectory, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then place it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.\nSteventon.\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time, Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He had seizures and may have been deaf and mute. At this time she chose to send him to be fostered. In 1773 Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.\nAccording to the biographer Park Honan, the Austen home had an \"open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere\", in which the ideas of those with whom members of the Austen family might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.\nThe family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. The elder Cassandra spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter, and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents upon her return, \"...\u00a0and almost home they were when they met Jane &amp; Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, &amp; have the pleasure of riding home in it.\" Le Faye writes that \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"\nFrom 1773 until 1796 George supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home. He had an annual income of \u00a3200 () from his two livings. This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about \u00a3100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between \u00a31,000 and \u00a35,000. He also rented the 200-acre Cheesedown farm from his benefactor Thomas Knight, which could make a profit of \u00a3300 () a year.\nDuring this period of her life, Jane attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours, and read novels\u2014often of her own composition\u2014aloud to her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall. Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".\nEducation.\nIn 1783 Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Ann Cawley, who took them to Southampton later that year. That autumn both girls were sent home after catching typhus, of which Jane nearly died. She was from then home-educated, until she attended boarding school with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls' School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle. The curriculum probably included French, spelling, needlework, dancing, music and drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. After 1786 Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".\nHer education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry. Irene Collins said that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\". Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqu\u00e9 experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" (1775) and David Garrick's \"Bon Ton\". Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12 she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.\nJuvenilia (1787\u20131793).\nFrom at least the time she was aged eleven, Austen wrote poems and stories to amuse herself and her family. She exaggerated mundane details of daily life and parodied common plot devices in \"stories [] full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to Janet Todd. Austen compiled fair copies of twenty-nine early works from 1787 to 1793 into three bound notebooks with 90,000 words, now known as the Juvenilia, named \"Volume the First\", \"Volume the Second\" and \"Volume the Third\". The Juvenilia are often, according to the scholar Richard Jenkyns, \"boisterous\" and \"anarchic\"; he compares them to the work of the 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.\nAmong these works is a satirical novel in letters titled \"Love and Freindship\" [\"sic\"], written when aged fourteen in 1790, in which she mocked popular novels of sensibility. The next year, she wrote \"The History of England\", a manuscript of thirty-four pages accompanied by thirteen watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen's \"History\" parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's \"History of England\" (1764). Honan speculates that not long after writing \"Love and Freindship\" Austen decided to \"write for profit, to make stories her central effort\", that is, to become a professional writer. When she was around eighteen years old, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.\nIn August 1792, aged seventeen, Austen started \"Catharine or the Bower\", which presaged her mature work, especially \"Northanger Abbey\", but was left unfinished until picked up in \"Lady Susan\", which Todd describes as less prefiguring than \"Catharine\". A year later she began, but abandoned, a short play, later titled \"Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts\", which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, \"The History of Sir Charles Grandison\" (1753) by Samuel Richardson.\nWhen Austen became an aunt for the first time aged eighteen, she sent her newborn niece Fanny Catherine Austen Knight \"five short pieces of ... the Juvenilia now known collectively as 'Scraps' .., purporting to be her 'Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women'\". For Jane-Anna-Elizabeth Austen (also born in 1793), her aunt wrote \"two more 'Miscellanious Morsels', dedicating them to [Anna] on 2 June 1793, 'convinced that if you seriously attend to them, You will derive from them very important Instructions, with regard to your Conduct in Life.'\" There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1811 (when she was 36), and that her niece and nephew Anna and James Edward Austen made further additions as late as 1814.\nBetween 1793 and 1795 (aged eighteen to twenty), Austen wrote \"Lady Susan\", a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work. It is unlike any of Austen's other works. Austen's biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration\u00a0... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.\nAccording to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza's French husband was guillotined in 1794 during the Reign of Terror amidst the French Revolution; she married Jane's brother Henry Austen in 1797.\nAges 20 to 34.\nTom Lefroy.\nWhen Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane never saw him again. In November 1798 Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.\nEarly manuscripts (1796\u20131798).\nAfter finishing \"Lady Susan\", Austen began her first full-length novel \"Elinor and Marianne\". Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as \"Sense and Sensibility\".\nAusten began a second novel, \"First Impressions\" (later published as \"Pride and Prejudice\"), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\". At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels; in November 1797 he wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing \"First Impressions\". Cadell returned George's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\". Jane may not have known of her father's efforts. Following the completion of \"First Impressions\", Austen returned to \"Elinor and Marianne\" and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to \"Sense and Sensibility\".\nIn 1797 Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law) Eliza de Feuillide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feuillide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feuillide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life.\nDuring the middle of 1798, after finishing revisions of \"Elinor and Marianne\", Austen began writing a third novel with the working title \"Susan\"\u2014later \"Northanger Abbey\"\u2014a satire on the popular Gothic novel. Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803, Henry Austen offered \"Susan\" to Benjamin Crosby, a London publisher, who paid \u00a310 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being \"in the press\", but did nothing more. The manuscript remained in Crosby's hands, unpublished, until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816.\nBath and Southampton.\nIn December 1800 George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath, Somerset. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving away from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived in Bath. She was able to make some revisions to \"Susan\", and she began and then abandoned a new novel, \"The Watsons\", but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795\u20131799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died. It is often claimed that Austen was unhappy in Bath, which caused her to lose interest in writing, but it is just as possible that Austen's social life in Bath prevented her from spending much time writing novels. The critic Robert Irvine argued that if Austen spent more time writing novels when she was in the countryside, it might just have been because she had more spare time as opposed to being more happy in the countryside as is often argued. Furthermore, Austen frequently both moved and travelled over southern England during this period, which was hardly a conducive environment for writing a long novel. Austen sold the rights to publish \"Susan\" to the publisher Crosby &amp; Company, who paid her \u00a310 (). Crosby &amp; Company advertised \"Susan\", but never published it.\nThe years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive\u2014he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. Irvine described Bigg-Wither as somebody who \"...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love\".\nIn 1814 Austen wrote a letter to her niece Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around &amp; entreat you not to commit yourself farther, &amp; not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection\". The scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had \"had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife\u00a0... All of her heroines\u00a0... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love\". A possible autobiographical element in \"Sense and Sensibility\" occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates \"the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life\" with an unsuitable man.\nIn 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started, but did not complete, her novel \"The Watsons\". The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as \"a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women's lives\". Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.\nHer father's relatively sudden death left Jane, Cassandra, and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen (known as Frank) pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters. For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage. It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of \"Lady Susan\" and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806, the family moved to Southampton, where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family.\nOn 5 April 1809, about three months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of \"Susan\" if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the \u00a310 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.\nAges 34 to 41.\nChawton.\nAround early 1809, Austen's brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled life\u2014the use of a large cottage in Chawton village which was part of the estate around Edward's nearby property Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family's move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the family's life in Chawton as \"a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write.\"\nPublished author.\nLike many women authors at the time, Austen published her books anonymously. At the time, the ideal roles for a woman were as wife and mother, and writing for women was regarded at best as a secondary form of activity; a woman who wished to be a full-time writer was felt to be degrading her femininity, so books by women were usually published anonymously in order to maintain the conceit that the female writer was only publishing as a sort of part-time job, and was not seeking to become a \"literary lioness\" (i.e. a celebrity). Another reason noted is that the novel was still seen as a lesser form of literature at the time compared with poetry, and many female and male authors published novels anonymously, whereas works of poetry, by both female and male writers, were almost always attributed to the author.\nDuring her time at Chawton, Austen published four generally well-received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish \"Sense and Sensibility\", which, like all of Austen's novels except \"Pride and Prejudice\", was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author's financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them. The alternative to selling via commission was by selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with \"Pride and Prejudice\". Austen's experience with \"Susan\" (the manuscript that became \"Northanger Abbey\") where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby &amp; Sons for \u00a310, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing. The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription. \"Sense and Sensibility\" appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\". As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings ().\nReviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or fewer to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen's novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of \"Sense and Sensibility\" to about 2,000 copies of \"Emma\". It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen's novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen's books were originally published \"on commission\", the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra's after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger.\nAusten made \u00a3140 () from \"Sense and Sensibility\", which provided her with some financial and psychological independence. After the success of \"Sense and Sensibility\", all of Austen's subsequent books were billed as written \"By the author of \"Sense and Sensibility\"\" and Austen's name never appeared on her books during her lifetime. Egerton then published \"Pride and Prejudice\", a revision of \"First Impressions\", in January 1813. Austen sold the copyright to \"Pride and Prejudice\" to Egerton for \u00a3110 (). To maximise profits, he used cheap paper and set the price at 18 shillings (). He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. Had Austen sold \"Pride and Prejudice\" on commission, she would have made a profit of \u00a3475, or twice her father's annual income. By October 1813, Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition. \"Mansfield Park\" was published by Egerton in May 1814. While \"Mansfield Park\" was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen's earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels.\nWithout Austen's knowledge or approval, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented in 1953 that, given the prevailing rage in France at the time for lush romantic fantasies, it was remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. King cautioned that Austen's chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of \"imitations\" than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when \"Persuasion\" was published in 1821 as \"La Famille Elliot ou L'Ancienne Inclination\".\nAusten learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815 the Prince Regent's librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince's London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming \"Emma\" to the Prince. Though Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways, and generally disreputable behaviour. She later wrote \"Plan of a Novel, According to Hints from Various Quarters\", a satiric outline of the \"perfect novel\" based on the librarian's many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke's often pompous literary advice, and the \"Plan of a Novel\" parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.\nIn mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray, a better-known publisher in London, who published \"Emma\" in December 1815 and a second edition of \"Mansfield Park\" in February 1816. \"Emma\" sold well, but the new edition of \"Mansfield Park\" did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from \"Emma\". These were the last of Austen's novels to be published during her lifetime.\nWhile Murray prepared \"Emma\" for publication, Austen began \"The Elliots\", later published as \"Persuasion\". She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, shortly after the publication of \"Emma\", Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for \"Susan\" from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and costing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.\nIllness and death.\nAusten was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Zachary Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing: \"I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought on a relapse\u00a0... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves.\"\nAusten continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of \"The Elliots\", she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began \"The Brothers\" (titled \"Sanditon\" when published in 1925), completing twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes \"Sanditon\"'s heroine, Diana Parker, as an \"energetic invalid\". In the novel Austen mocked hypochondriacs, and although she describes the heroine as \"bilious\", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning \"every wrong colour\" and living \"chiefly on the sofa\". She put down her pen on 18\u00a0March 1817, making a note of it.\nAusten made light of her condition, describing it as \"bile\" and rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May, Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death.\nAusten died in Winchester on 18\u00a0July 1817 at the age of 41. Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation, and mentions the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.\nPosthumous publication.\nIn the months after Austen's death in July 1817, Cassandra, Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of \"Persuasion\" and \"Northanger Abbey\" as a set. Henry Austen contributed a \"Biographical Note\" dated December 1817, which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as \"a loving and polished eulogy\". Sales were good for a year\u2014only 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818.\nAlthough Austen's six novels were out of print in England in the 1820s, they were still being read through copies housed in private libraries and circulating libraries. Austen had early admirers. The first piece of fiction using her as a character (what might now be called real person fiction) appeared in 1823 in a letter to the editor in \"The Lady's Magazine\". It refers to Austen's genius and suggests that aspiring authors were envious of her powers.\nIn 1832 Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels, and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his \"Standard Novels\" series. In October 1833 Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then, Austen's novels have been continuously in print.\nGenre and style.\nAusten's works implicitly critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. The earliest English novelists, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, and Tobias Smollett, were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Sir Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, and Oliver Goldsmith, whose style and genre Austen repudiated, returning the novel on a \"slender thread\" to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a \"realistic study of manners\". In the mid-20th century the literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of \"irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\nWalter Scott noted Austen's \"resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fiction\u2014'the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries'\". Yet her relationship with these genres is complex, as evidenced by \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Emma\". Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the \"Preface\" to his \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows \"that rhetorically less is artistically more.\" She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word \"abbey\" in their title). Yet in \"Northanger Abbey\" she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine's \"novel-fueled\" desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, yet her imprisonment is mundane and real\u2014regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In \"Sense and Sensibility\" Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to the critic Tom Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, \"Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world\u00a0... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be miserable. It was a wretched business, indeed! Such an overthrow of everything she had been wishing for! Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!\n \u2014 example of free indirect speech, Jane Austen, \"Emma\"\nRichardson's \"Pamela\", the prototype for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story with a happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech\u2014she was the first English novelist to do so extensively\u2014through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.\nAusten had a natural ear for speech and dialogue, according to the scholar Mary Lascelles: \"Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters.\" Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a character's traits and their tone; \"syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary\" is utilised to indicate social variants. Dialogue reveals a character's mood\u2014frustration, anger, happiness\u2014each treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennet rejects Darcy, her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her:\nFrom the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\nAusten's plots highlight women's traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as \"the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life\". Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy \"is the saving grace of life\". Part of Austen's fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson's influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write \"a representation of life as may excite mirth\".\nHer humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority, allowing her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with \"ethical sensibility\", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, \"To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule\u00a0... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good.\"\nReception.\nContemporaneous responses.\nAs Austen's works were published anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious, most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels.\nSir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, anonymously wrote a review of \"Emma\" in 1815, using it to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel and praising Austen's realism, \"the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and William Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.\n19th century.\nBecause Austen's novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\", some 19th-century critics preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. Notwithstanding Walter Scott's positivity, Austen's work did not win over those who preferred the prevailing aesthetic values of the elite Romantic zeitgeist. Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold steadily. Austen's six books were included in the canon-making Standard Novels series by publisher Richard Bentley, which increased their stature. That series referred to her as \"the founder of a school of novelists\" and called her a genius.\nThe first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philar\u00e8te Chasles in an 1842 essay, dismissing her in two sentences as a boring, imitative writer with no substance. Austen was not widely appreciated in France until 1878, when the French critic L\u00e9on Boucher published the essay , in which he called Austen a \"genius\", the first French author to do so. The first accurate translation of Austen into French occurred in 1899 when F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on translated \"Northanger Abbey\" as \"Catherine Morland\".\nIn Britain and North America, Austen gradually grew in the estimation of both the public and the literati. In the United States, Austen was being recommended as reading in schools as early as 1838, according to Professor Devoney Looser. The philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes published a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. Later in the century, the novelist Henry James referred to Austen several times with approval, and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as amongst \"the fine painters of life\".\nThe publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1869 introduced Austen's life story to a wider public as \"dear aunt Jane\", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred another reissue of Austen's novels. Editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed. The author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". Around the start of the 20th century, an intellectual clique of \"Janeites\" reacted against the popularisation of Austen, distinguishing their deeper appreciation from the vulgar enthusiasm of the masses.\nIn response, Henry James decried \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the \"anti-Janites\" in the 19th and 20th centuries comprised a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, D. H. Lawrence, and Kingsley Amis, but in \"every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relatively untouched\".\nModern.\nAusten's works have attracted legions of scholars. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. Another early academic analysis came from a 1911 essay by the Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley, who grouped Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic book devoted to Austen in France was \"Jane Austen\" by Paul and Kate Rague (1914), who set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, L\u00e9onie Villard published \"Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres\", originally her PhD thesis, the first serious academic study of Austen in France. In 1923, R.W. Chapman published the first scholarly edition of Austen's collected works, which was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles' \"Jane Austen and Her Art\", the academic study of Austen took hold. Lascelles analysed the books Austen read and their influence on her work, and closely examined Austen's style and \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were obscuring the appreciation of Austen with increasingly esoteric theories, a debate that has continued since.\nThe period since the Second World War has seen a diversity of critical approaches to Austen, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The divide has widened between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and academic judgements. In 1994 the literary critic Harold Bloom placed Austen among the .\nIn the People's Republic of China after 1949, writings of Austen were regarded as too frivolous, and thus during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966\u201376, Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\". In the late 1970s, when Austen's works were re-published in China, her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people generally read books for enjoyment, not political edification.\nThe conservative American professor Gene Koppel claimed that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\", i.e. Conservatives in opposition to the liberal Whigs. Although several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock claimed Austen for their own cause, Koppel argued that different people react to a work of literature in different subjective ways, as explained by the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. Thus competing interpretations of Austen's work can be equally valid, provided they are grounded in textual and historical analysis: it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency-era society and as a conservative upholding its values.\nAdaptations.\nWritten.\nAusten's novels have resulted in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations.\nDrama, film and television.\nThe first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's \"Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance\", and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, \"The Bennets\" (1901).\nThe first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations released in the 1970s and 1980s attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\", class is subtly downplayed, and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.\nFrom 1995 many Austen adaptations appeared, with Ang Lee's film of \"Sense and Sensibility\", for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award, and the BBC's immensely popular television miniseries \"Pride and Prejudice\", starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A 2005 British production of \"Pride &amp; Prejudice\", directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was followed in 2007 by ITV's \"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", and in 2016 by \"Love &amp; Friendship\" starring Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan, a film version of \"Lady Susan\", that borrowed the title of Austen's \"Love and Freindship\" [\"sic\"].\nHonours.\nIn 2013 Austen's works featured on a series of British postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the bicentenary of the publication of \"Pride and Prejudice\". Austen is on the \u00a310 note issued by the Bank of England which was introduced in 2017, replacing Charles Darwin. In July 2017 a statue of Austen was erected in Basingstoke, Hampshire, on the 200th anniversary of her death. A statue of Austen by Martin Jennings was unveiled in October 2025 at The Close, near Winchester Cathedral.\nList of works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMuseums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFan sites and societies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its length is 30 days. June succeeds May and precedes July. This month marks the start of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and contains the summer solstice, which is the day with the most daylight hours. In the Southern Hemisphere, June is the start of winter and contains the winter solstice, the day with the fewest hours of daylight out of the year.\nIn places north of the Arctic Circle, the June solstice is when the midnight sun occurs, during which the Sun remains visible even at midnight. The Atlantic hurricane season\u2014when tropical or subtropical cyclones are most likely to form in the north Atlantic Ocean\u2014begins on 1 June and lasts until 30 November. Several monsoons and subsequent wet seasons also commence in the Northern Hemisphere during this month. Multiple meteor showers occur annually in June, including the Arietids, which are among the most intense daylight meteor showers of the year; they last between 22 May and 2 July, peaking in intensity on 8 June.\nNumerous observances take place in June. Midsummer, the celebration of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is celebrated in several countries. In Catholicism, this month is dedicated to the devotion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and known as the Month of the Sacred Heart. In the United States, June is dedicated to Pride Month, a month-long observance of the LGBTQ community. Father's Day, which honours fathers and fatherhood, occurs on the third Sunday in June in most countries.\nOverview.\nJune is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars\u2014the latter the most widely used calendar in the world. Containing 30 days, June succeeds May and precedes July. It is one of four months that have 30 days\u2014alongside April, September and November\u2014and is the second 30-day month of the year, following April, the fourth month of the year, and preceding September\u2014the ninth month of the year. June is in the second quarter (Q2) of a calendar year, alongside April and May, and the sixth and final month in the first half of the year (January\u2013June). Under the ISO week date system, June incidentally begins in either the 22nd or 23rd week of the year.\nDuring each calendar year, no other month starts on the same day of the week as June. The Julian calendar\u2014which also has June and is still used as a ceremonial religious calendar by some of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy\u2014is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar. Thus, in this calendar, 1 June begins on 14 June. It will be 14 days behind in 2100. June is abbreviated as \"Jun\", and may be spelled with or without a concluding period (full stop).\nEtymology.\n\"June\" is ultimately derived from the Latin month of \"Iunius\", named after the ancient Roman goddess Juno (Latin: ). The present English spelling was influenced by the Anglo-Norman \"join\", \"junye\" and \"junie\". It was also written in Middle English as \"Iun\" and \"Juin\", while the spelling variant \"Iune\" was in use until the 17th century. It displaced the Old English name for June, \"\u00e6rra li\u00fea\".\nHistory.\nJune originates from the month of \"Iunius\" (also called lit.\u2009'month of June') in the original Roman calendar used during the Roman Republic. The origin of this calendar is obscure. \"Iunius\" was originally the fourth month of the year, and had 29 days alongside (\"April\"), (later renamed \"August\"), , and . It is not known when the Romans reset the course of the year so that (\"January\") and (\"February\"), originally the 11th and 12th months respectively, came first\u2014thus moving \"Iunius\" to the sixth month of the year\u2014but later Roman scholars generally dated this to 153 BC.\nIn ancient Rome, the period from mid-May through mid-June may have been considered inauspicious for marriages. The Roman poet Ovid claimed to have consulted the \"flaminica Dialis\", the high priestess of the god Jupiter, about setting a date for his daughter's wedding, but was advised to wait until after 15 June. The Greek philosopher and writer Plutarch, however, implied that the entire month of June was more favorable for weddings than May.\nIn 46 BC, Julius Caesar reformed the calendar, which thus became known as the Julian calendar after himself. This reform fixed the calendar to 365 days with a leap year every fourth year, and made June 30 days long; however, this reform resulted in the average year of the Julian calendar being 365.25 days long, slightly more than the actual solar year of 365.2422 days (the current value, which varies).\nIn AD 65, June was renamed as \"Germanicus\" in honour of the Roman emperor Nero. As recalled by the Roman historian Tacitus in his \"Annals\", the Roman senator Cornelius Orfitus, who made the proposal, claimed that the name \"Junius\" had become inauspicious due to the executions of Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus and Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus in AD 49 and AD 64, respectively. The names did not survive and were likely erased when Nero was subjected to \"damnatio memoriae\". In AD 184, Roman Emperor Commodus briefly renamed all of the months after a name in his full title; June became \"Aelius\". However, this decision was repealed after his death in AD 192.\nIn 1582, Pope Gregory XIII promulgated a revised calendar\u2014the Gregorian calendar\u2014that reduced the average length of the calendar year from 365.25 days to 365.2425, correcting the Julian calendar's drift against the solar year.\nClimate, daylight and astronomy.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, June marks the commencement of summer, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the start of winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, the beginning of the traditional astronomical summer is 21 June, while meteorological summer commences on 1 June. In the Southern Hemisphere, astronomical winter starts on 21 June while meteorological winter begins on 1 June.\nThe June solstice\u2014known as the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere\u2014occurs for one-day between 20\u201322 June (most often on 21 June), marking the longest day of the year in terms of daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest day in the Southern Hemisphere. In places north of the Arctic Circle, this is when the midnight sun occurs for the longest period, during which the Sun remains visible even at midnight. Conversely, it is polar night in places within the Antarctic Circle, during which the Sun remains below the horizon for more than 24 hours.\nIn astronomy, certain meteor showers occur annually during this month. The Arietids\u2014among the most intense daylight meteor showers of the year\u2014last from 22 May until 2 July, peaking in intensity on 8 June; the Beta Taurids take place between 5 June and 18 July, peaking on 28 June; and the June Bootids commence between 22 June and 2 July, peaking on 27 June. The full moon that occurs in June is most commonly known as the strawberry moon because it coincides with the strawberry-picking season; other names for it include the \"rose moon\", \"honey moon\" and the poetic \"midsummer moon\".\nClimate.\nJune is one of the hottest months in the Northern Hemisphere, alongside July and August, with July being the hottest; in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the inverse. For instance, the lowest temperature ever recorded in South America occurred on 1 June 1907 in the town of Sarmiento in the Chubut Province of Argentina, measuring -32.8\u00b0C (-27\u00b0F). June 2024 was the hottest June in recorded history at 1.22\u00b0C (2.20\u00b0F) above the 20th-century global average, beating the previous record held by June 2023.\nThe Atlantic hurricane season\u2014when tropical or subtropical cyclones are most likely to form in the north Atlantic Ocean\u2014begins on 1 June and lasts until 30 November. In the Indian Ocean north of the equator, around the Indian subcontinent, year-round tropical cyclones appear frequently between May and June. In contrast, Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones are least likely to form in June because of the dry season of the Mediterranean having stable air.\nThe East Asian, North American, South Asian (Indian) and West African monsoons generally begin in June, while the European monsoon season intensifies that month. The East Asian monsoon commences the East Asian rainy season. The highest volume of rainfall ever recorded in a one-hour period occurred on 22 June 1947 in the small city of Holt, Missouri in the United States, measuring 305 mm (12 inches) of rainfall. The greatest rainfall within a 48-hour period occurred between 15\u201316 June 1995 in the town of Cherrapunji in Meghalaya, India, with 2.493 metres (98.15 inches) of rainfall recorded.\nAgriculture.\nThe crops which are harvested this month include several varieties of corn; wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, rice, rye and sorghum in most of the Northern Hemisphere, and maize, cotton, pearl millet, sorghum and soybeans in most of the Southern Hemisphere. In much of the Northern Hemisphere, apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, mangoes, raspberries, strawberries and watermelons are fruits which are considered to be in season or at their peak in June. Vegetables that are in season in this hemisphere during June include asparagus, beetroot, cucumbers, lettuce, peas, radishes, spinach, tomatoes and zucchini (courgettes). In much of the Southern Hemisphere, the fruits which are in season are avocados, bananas, citrus (such as grapefruit, lemons, mandarins and oranges), kiwifruit and pears.\nObservances.\nIn Catholicism, June is dedicated to the devotion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This observance is called the Month of the Sacred Heart. In Canada, June is ALS Awareness Month, a campaign to spread awareness and raise funds for a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Filipino Heritage Month. In the United States, June is Pride Month, which is the celebration of the LGBTQ community. Caribbean-American Heritage Month also occurs annually in June, as well as Men's Mental Health Month. In Brazil, the \"Festas Juninas\" (June Festivals) occur throughout the entire month to celebrate the harvest.\nIt is also National Safety Month in the United States, a month-long observance aimed at increasing awareness of, and ultimately decreasing, the number of unintentional injuries and deaths in the country. National Smile Month, the largest oral health campaign in the United Kingdom and organised by the Oral Health Foundation, commences between alternating dates from mid-May to mid-June. In Barbados, June is part of the Season of Emancipation which takes place between 14 April and 23 August to commemorate the emancipation of slaves of African descent.\nGlobal single-day observances.\nThe first day of June commences with World Milk Day and International Children's Day in several countries. International Whores' Day, an observance to honour sex workers (prostitutes) and recognise their often exploited and poor working conditions, occurs on 2 June. Several memorials and other commemorations are held around the world on 4 June to honour the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre that occurred in China. Similar annual memorials are held for the Normandy landings (D-Day), the largest seaborne invasion in history, which occurred on 6 June 1944 as part of the Second World War. Global Wind Day is on 15 June, and on 16 June is the International Day of the African Child, which raises awareness for the need of improved education provided to children in Africa. Autistic Pride Day occurs on 18 June.\n19 June is World Sauntering Day, which encourages people to slow down (\"saunter\") and enjoy life. Go Skateboarding Day and World Hydrography Day both occur on 21 June. Midsummer, the various celebrations of the commencement of summer, happens on 21 June; it is also associated with the F\u00eate de la Musique (World Music Day). 25 June is the observation of World Vitiligo Day, which aims to decrease negative sentiments regarding vitiligo\u2014a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes patches of skin to lose pigment or colour. 26 June is World Refrigeration Day.\nGlobal Running Day occurs on the first Wednesday in June. Father's Day, which honours fathers and fatherhood, most often occurs on the third Sunday in June. The King's Official Birthday, which celebrates the birthday of the monarch of the Commonwealth realms (presently Charles III), occurs in either May or June. It includes the British Trooping the Colour commemoration. The Dragon Boat Festival, observed in China and by the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, may commence for one-day between late May and mid-June as the date is decided by the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar.\nUnited Nations.\nThe following are global holidays which are formally observed by the United Nations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReligious single-day observances.\nAs Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon, which is the first full moon on or after 21 March (a fixed approximation of the March equinox), Ascension Day, observed 39 days after Easter, can occur in June. Pentecost is the fiftieth day after Easter Sunday, while Trinity Sunday is the first Sunday after Pentecost. The Catholic Church also observes the Feast of the Sacred Heart, which happens on the Friday following the second Sunday after Pentecost. The Feast of Corpus Christi, observed by the Latin Church and certain Western Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican churches, takes place on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. The feast of Saints Peter and Paul, a liturgical feast observed by numerous denominations, always occurs on 29 June.\nIn Buddhism, Vesak (Buddha Day), the most significant Buddhist festival, occurs on 2 June in Singapore and on 3 June in Thailand as of 2024. Shavuot, one of the biblically-ordained Three Pilgrimage Festivals observed in Judaism, takes place during the month of Sivan in the Hebrew calendar, which corresponds to being between May and June in the Gregorian calendar. Islamic holidays are determined by the Hijri calendar (colloquially the Islamic calendar), a lunar calendar of 354 or 355 days; thus, Islamic observances do not align with those of the Gregorian calendar. This is the same for Hindu holidays, which are based on the Hindu calendar.\nOther events.\nThe quadrennial FIFA World Cup, an international association football tournament and the most-watched sporting event on television, usually commences in June. The annual Wimbledon Championships, the oldest tennis tournament in the world and widely regarded as the most prestigious, traditionally occurred on the last Monday in June. Glastonbury Festival, a major music festival in the United Kingdom, also takes place in June, attracting over 100,000 attendees.\nPeople.\nJune is a female given name that can be given to a person born in June. In astrology, the Zodiac signs for people born between 21 May and 21 June is Gemini (\u264a\ufe0e); for those born between 22 June and 22 July, their sign is Cancer (\u264b\ufe0e). The birthstones associated with June in the United States are pearl, moonstone and alexandrite. The birth flowers of June are rose and honeysuckle.\nBirths.\nNoteworthy people born in June include:\nDeaths.\nNoteworthy people who died in June include:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nLiterary sources cited on multiple occasions:"}

{"id": "15807", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15807", "title": "John Horton Conway", "text": "English mathematician (1937\u20132020)\nJohn Horton Conway (26 December 1937 \u2013 11 April 2020) was an English mathematician. He was active in the theory of finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. He also made contributions to many branches of recreational mathematics, most notably the invention of the cellular automaton called the Game of Life.\nBorn and raised in Liverpool, Conway spent the first half of his career at the University of Cambridge before moving to the United States, where he held the John von Neumann Professorship at Princeton University for the rest of his career. On 11 April 2020, at age 82, he died of complications from COVID-19.\nEarly life and education.\nConway was born on 26 December 1937 in Liverpool, the son of Cyril Horton Conway and Agnes Boyce. He became interested in mathematics at a very early age. By the time he was 11, his ambition was to become a mathematician. After leaving sixth form, he studied mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. A \"terribly introverted adolescent\" in school, he took his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into an extrovert, a change which would later earn him the nickname of \"the world's most charismatic mathematician\".\nConway was awarded a BA in 1959 and, supervised by Harold Davenport, began to undertake research in number theory. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers, Conway became interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, where he became an avid backgammon player, spending hours playing the game in the common room.\nIn 1964, Conway was awarded his doctorate and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.\nAfter leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the John von Neumann Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University. There, he won the Princeton University Pi Day pie-eating contest.\nConway and Martin Gardner.\nConway's career was intertwined with that of Martin Gardner. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his Mathematical Games column in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity. Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work. For instance, he discussed Conway's game of Sprouts (July 1967), Hackenbush (January 1972), and his angel and devil problem (February 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book \"On Numbers and Games\" and even managed to explain Conway's surreal numbers.\nConway was a prominent member of Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the Penrose tilings which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings. Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column. The cover of that issue of \"Scientific American\" features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.\nMajor areas of research.\nRecreational mathematics.\nConway invented the Game of Life, one of the early examples of a cellular automaton. His initial experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed. Since Conway's game was popularized by Martin Gardner in \"Scientific American\" in 1970, it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles. It is a staple of recreational mathematics. The LifeWiki is devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game. From the earliest days, it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. Conway came to dislike how discussions of him heavily focused on his Game of Life, feeling that it overshadowed deeper and more important things he had done, although he remained proud of his work on it. The game helped to launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of cellular automata.\nThe Game of Life is known to be Turing complete.\nCombinatorial game theory.\nConway contributed to combinatorial game theory (CGT), a theory of partisan games. He developed the theory with Elwyn Berlekamp and Richard Guy, and also co-authored the book \"Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays\" with them. He also wrote \"On Numbers and Games\" (\"ONAG\") which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\nHe was also one of the inventors of the game sprouts, as well as philosopher's football. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the Soma cube, peg solitaire, and Conway's soldiers. He came up with the angel problem, which was solved in 2006.\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the surreal numbers, which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by Donald Knuth. He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly large numbers, the Conway chained arrow notation. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of \"ONAG\".\nGeometry.\nIn the mid-1960s with Michael Guy, Conway established that there are sixty-four convex uniform polychora excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the grand antiprism in the process, the only non-Wythoffian uniform polychoron. Conway also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing polyhedra called Conway polyhedron notation.\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the Conway criterion which is a fast way to identify many prototiles that tile the plane.\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the Leech lattice.\nGeometric topology.\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the Alexander polynomial and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial. After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel knot polynomials. Conway further developed tangle theory and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, now known as Conway notation, while correcting a number of errors in the 19th-century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. The Conway knot is named after him.\nConway's conjecture that, in any thrackle, the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices, is still open.\nGroup theory.\nHe was the primary author of the \"ATLAS of Finite Groups\" giving properties of many finite simple groups. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and Simon P. Norton he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the sporadic groups. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the Leech lattice, which have been designated the Conway groups. This work made him a key player in the successful classification of the finite simple groups.\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician John McKay, Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as monstrous moonshine. This subject, named by Conway, relates the monster group with elliptic modular functions, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014finite groups and complex function theory. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to string theory.\nConway introduced the Mathieu groupoid, an extension of the Mathieu group M12 to 13 points.\nNumber theory.\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a conjecture by Edward Waring, that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though Chen Jingrun solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published. In 1972, Conway proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is algorithmically undecidable. Related to that, he developed the esoteric programming language FRACTRAN. While lecturing on the Collatz conjecture, Terence Tao (who was taught by him in graduate school) mentioned Conway's result and said that he was \"always very good at making extremely weird connections in mathematics\".\nAlgebra.\nConway wrote a textbook on Stephen Kleene's theory of state machines, and published original work on algebraic structures, focusing particularly on quaternions and octonions. Together with Neil Sloane, he invented the icosians.\nAnalysis.\nHe invented his base 13 function as a counterexample to the converse of the intermediate value theorem: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a Darboux property but is \"not\" continuous.\nAlgorithmics.\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the Doomsday algorithm. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on finite-state machines.\nTheoretical physics.\nIn 2004, Conway and Simon B. Kochen, another Princeton mathematician, proved the free will theorem, a version of the \"no hidden variables\" principle of quantum mechanics. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. Conway said that \"if experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particles.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nConway was married three times. With his first two wives he had two sons and four daughters. He married Diana in 2001 and had another son with her. He had three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\nOn 8 April 2020, Conway developed symptoms of COVID-19. On 11 April, he died in New Brunswick, New Jersey, at the age of 82.\nAwards and honours.\nConway received the Berwick Prize (1971), was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (1981), became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992, was the first recipient of the P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS) (1987), won the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics (1998) and received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (2000) of the American Mathematical Society. In 2001 he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Liverpool, and in 2014 one from Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.\nHis Fellow of the Royal Society nomination in 1981 reads: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2017 Conway was given honorary membership of the British Mathematical Association.\nConferences called Gathering 4 Gardner are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics."}

{"id": "15821", "revid": "50454883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15821", "title": "Jack Lemmon", "text": "American actor (1925\u20132001)\nJohn Uhler Lemmon III (February 8, 1925 \u2013 June 27, 2001) was an American actor. Considered proficient in both dramatic and comic roles, he was known for his anxious, middle-class everyman screen persona in comedy-drama films. He received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, three BAFTA Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards and one Volpi Cup. He also received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1988, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1991, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 1996. \"The Guardian\" labeled him as \"the most successful tragi-comedian of his age\".\nLemmon received two Academy Awards: for Best Supporting Actor for \"Mister Roberts\" (1955) and for Best Actor for \"Save the Tiger\" (1973). He was Oscar-nominated for \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), \"The Apartment\" (1960), \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (1962), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Tribute\" (1980), and \"Missing\" (1982). He is also known for his roles in \"Irma la Douce\" (1963), \"The Great Race\" (1965), and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992). He produced two films in which he did not appear, \"Cool Hand Luke\" (1967) and \"Kotch\" (1971), the latter of which he also directed, both through his production company, Jalem Productions.\nFor his work on television he received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" (1999). He was Emmy-nominated for \"The Entertainer\" (1975), \"The Murder of Mary Phagan\" (1988), \"12 Angry Men\" (1997), and \"Inherit the Wind\" (1999). On stage, Lemmon made his Broadway debut in the play \"Room Service\" (1953). He went on to receive two Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nominations for his roles in the Bernard Slade play \"Tribute\" (1978) and in the Eugene O'Neill revival \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" (1986).\nHe had a long-running collaboration with actor and friend Walter Matthau, which \"The New York Times\" called \"one of Hollywood's most successful pairings\", that spanned ten films between 1966 and 1998 including \"The Fortune Cookie\" (1966), \"The Odd Couple\" (1968), \"The Front Page\" (1974) and \"Grumpy Old Men\" (1993).\nEarly life and education.\nLemmon was born on February 8, 1925, in an elevator at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts. He was the only child of Mildred Burgess (\"n\u00e9e\" LaRue; 1896\u20131967) and John Uhler Lemmon Jr. (1893\u20131962), who rose to vice-president of sales&lt;ref name=\"encyclopedia/lemmon-john-uhler-iii\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of the Doughnut Corporation of America. John Uhler Lemmon Jr. was of Irish heritage, and Jack Lemmon was raised Catholic. His parents had a difficult marriage, and separated permanently when Lemmon was 18, but never divorced. Often unwell as a child, Lemmon had three significant operations on his ears before he turned 10. He had spent two years in hospital by the time he turned 12.\nDuring his acceptance of his lifetime achievement award, he stated that he knew he wanted to be an actor from the age of eight. He began to act in school productions. Lemmon attended John Ward Elementary School, Rivers Country Day School (Class of 1939) and Phillips Andover Academy (Class of 1943), where he pursued track sports with success. He entered Harvard College (Class of 1947), where he lived in Eliot House. At Harvard, he was president of the Hasty Pudding Club and vice president of Dramatic and Delphic Clubs. Except for drama and music, however, he was an unexceptional student.\nForbidden to act onstage due to academic probation, Lemmon broke Harvard rules to appear in roles using pseudonyms such as Timothy Orange.\nA member of the V-12 Navy College Training Program, Lemmon was commissioned by the United States Navy, serving briefly with the rank of ensign as a communications officer on the aircraft carrier during World War II before returning to Harvard after completing his military service. After graduation with a bachelor's degree in war service sciences in 1947, he studied acting under coach Uta Hagen at HB Studio in New York City. He was also a pianist, who became devoted to the instrument at age 14 and learned to play by ear. For about a year in New York City, he worked unpaid as a waiter and master of ceremonies at the Old Knick bar on Second Avenue. He also played the piano at the venue.\nCareer.\n1949\u20131958: Early roles and Broadway debut.\nLemmon became a professional actor, working on radio and Broadway. His film debut was a bit part as a plasterer in the film \"The Lady Takes a Sailor\" (1949), but he had already appeared in television shows, which numbered about 400 from 1948 to 1953. Lemmon believed his stage career was about to take off when he was appearing on Broadway for the first time in a 1953 revival of the comedy \"Room Service\", but the production closed after two weeks. Despite this setback, he was spotted by talent scout Max Arnow, who was then working for Columbia, and Lemmon's focus shifted to films and Hollywood. Columbia's head, Harry Cohn, wanted to change Lemmon's name, in case it was used to describe the quality of the actor's films, but he successfully resisted. His first role as a leading man was in the comedy \"It Should Happen to You\" (1954), which also featured the established Judy Holliday in the female lead. Bosley Crowther in his review for \"The New York Times\" described Lemmon as possessing \"a warm and appealing personality. The screen should see more of him.\" The two leads soon reunited in \"Phffft\" (also 1954). Kim Novak had a secondary role as a brief love interest for Lemmon's character. \"If it wasn't for Judy, I'm not sure I would have concentrated on films\", he told \"The Washington Post\" in 1986 saying early in his career he had a snobbish attitude towards films over the stage.\nHe managed to negotiate a contract with Columbia allowing him leeway to pursue other projects, some of the terms of which he said \"nobody had gotten before\". He signed a seven-year contract, but ended up staying with Columbia for 10 years. Lemmon's appearance as Ensign Pulver in \"Mister Roberts\" (1955), with James Cagney, Henry Fonda, and William Powell for Warner Bros., gained Lemmon the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Director John Ford decided to cast Lemmon after seeing his Columbia screen test, which had been directed by Richard Quine. At an impromptu meeting on the studio lot, Ford persuaded the actor to appear in the film, although Lemmon did not realize he was in conversation with Ford at the time. In the military farce \"Operation Mad Ball\" (1957) set in a U.S. Army base in France after World War II, Lemmon played a calculating private. He met comedian Ernie Kovacs, who co-starred, and they became close friends, appearing together in two subsequent films, as a warlock in \"Bell, Book and Candle\" (1958, a film he apparently disliked) and \"It Happened to Jane\" (1959), all three under the direction of Richard Quine. Lemmon starred in six films directed by Quine. The others were \"My Sister Eileen\" (1955), \"The Notorious Landlady\" (1962) and \"How to Murder Your Wife\" (1965).\n1959\u20131969: Breakthrough and stardom.\nLemmon worked with director Billy Wilder on seven films. Their association began with the gender-bending comedy \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), with Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. The role required him to perform 80% of it in drag. People who knew his mother, Millie Lemmon, said he had mimicked her personality and even her hairstyle. Critic Pauline Kael said he was \"demonically funny\" in the part.\nAfter his success with \"Some Like It Hot\", and with his exclusive contract to Columbia Pictures expiring, Lemmon was finally free to form his own independent film production company in early 1960, Jalem Productions. Lemmon later joked about the banality of the company's name being made up of the first letters of his names, admitting that he could not find another name that he both liked and was also available to use. Lemmon was president and director of the company, his father was vice-president and co-director, and William Freedman was secretary-treasurer. The first production through Jalem was the stage play \"Face of a Hero\", starring Lemmon and directed by Alexander Mackendrick and was presented in October\u2013November 1960. In August 1964, Lemmon appointed producer Gordon Carroll vice president of Jalem Productions.\nThe sequence of films with Wilder continued with \"The Apartment\" (1960) alongside Shirley MacLaine. The film received mixed reviews from critics at the time, although it has been re-evaluated as a classic today. It received 11 nominations, winning five Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Lemmon received Oscar nominations for his performances in \"Some Like it Hot\" and \"The Apartment\". He reunited with MacLaine in \"Irma la Douce\" (1963). MacLaine, observing the director's relationship with his male lead, believed it amounted to \"professional infatuation\".\nLemmon's first role in a film directed by Blake Edwards was in \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (1962) portraying Joe Clay, a young alcoholic businessman. The role, for which he was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, was one of Lemmon's favorites. By this time, he had appeared in 15 comedies, a Western and an adventure film. \"The movie people put a label attached to your big toe \u2014 'light comedy' \u2014 and that's the only way they think of you\", he commented in an interview during 1984. \"I knew damn well I could play drama. Things changed following \"Days of Wine and Roses\". That was as important a film as I've ever done.\" \"Days of Wine and Roses\" was the first film where Lemmon was involved with production of the film via his Jalem production company. Lemmon's association with Edwards continued with \"The Great Race\" (1965), which reunited him with Tony Curtis. His salary this time was $1\u00a0million, but the film did not return its large budget at the box office. \"Variety\", in its December 31, 1964, review, commented: \"never has there been a villain so dastardly as Jack Lemmon\".\nIn 1966, Lemmon began the first of his many collaborations with actor Walter Matthau in \"The Fortune Cookie\". The film has been described by the British film critic Philip French as their \"one truly great film\". Matthau went on to win an Academy Award for his performance in the film. Another nine films with them co-starring eventually followed, including \"The Odd Couple\" (1968), \"The Front Page\" (1974), and \"Buddy Buddy\" (1981). In 1967, Lemmon's production company Jalem produced the film \"Cool Hand Luke\", which starred Paul Newman in the lead role. The film was a box-office and critical success. Newman, in gratitude, offered him the role of the Sundance Kid in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", but Lemmon turned it down. The best-known Lemmon-Matthau film is \"The Odd Couple\" (1968), based on the Neil Simon play, with the lead characters being the mismatched Felix Unger (Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Matthau), respectively neurotical and cynical.\n1970\u20131989: Established actor.\nThe much-admired comedy \"Kotch\" (1971), the only film Lemmon directed, starred Matthau, who was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. \"The Out-of-Towners\" (1970) was another Neil Simon-scripted film in which Lemmon appeared. In 1972, at the 44th Academy Awards, Jack Lemmon presented the Honorary Academy Award to silent screen legend Charlie Chaplin. Lemmon starred with Juliet Mills in \"Avanti!\" (1972) and appeared with Matthau in \"The Front Page\" (1974). Both films were directed by Wilder. He felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; Wilder's biography \"Nobody's Perfect\" quotes the director as saying, \"Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat.\" Wilder, though, also once said: \"Happiness is working with Jack Lemmon\". Lemmon in \"Save the Tiger\" (1973) plays Harry Stoner, a businessman in the garment trade who finds someone to commit arson by burning down his warehouse to avoid bankruptcy. The project was rejected by multiple studios, but Paramount was prepared to make the film if it were budgeted for only $1\u00a0million. Lemmon was so keen to play the part that he worked for union scale, then $165 a week. The role was demanding; like the character, Lemmon came close to breaking point: \"I started to crack as the character did,\" he recalled. \"I just kept getting deeper and deeper into the character's despair.\" For this film, Lemmon won the Best Actor Oscar. Having won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for \"Mister Roberts\", he became the first actor to achieve that particular double, although Helen Hayes had achieved this feat three years earlier in the equivalent female categories.\nLemmon was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role in \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), for which he was also awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. In \"Tribute\", a stage drama first performed in 1979, he played a press agent who has cancer while trying to mend his relationship with his son. The Broadway production ran for 212 performances, but it gained mixed reviews. Nevertheless, Lemmon was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. For his role in the 1980 film version, Lemmon gained another Oscar nomination. His final Oscar nomination was for \"Missing\" (1982), as a conservative father whose son has vanished in Chile during the period the country was under the rule of Augusto Pinochet; he won another Cannes award for his performance. A contemporary failure was his last film with Billy Wilder, \"Buddy Buddy\" (1981). Lemmon's character attempts suicide in a hotel while a hitman (Matthau) is in the next suite. Another flop at the box office was his final film with Blake Edwards, another of his friends; in \"That's Life!\" (1986), he appeared in the director's self-autobiographical part with Edwards's wife, Julie Andrews. A seductress role was played by Lemmon's wife, Felicia Farr. His later career is said to have been affected by other bad choices, such as \"Mass Appeal\" (1984), about a conservative Catholic priest, \"Macaroni\" (1985), a tale about old Army friends with Marcello Mastroianni, and \"That's Life\". Lemmon received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1988.\nLemmon was nominated for a Tony Award the second and last time for a revival of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" in 1986; Lemmon had taken the lead role of James Tyrone in a production directed by Jonathan Miller. It had a London run in 1987, Lemmon's first theatre work in the city, and a television version followed. A return to London in 1989 for the antiwar play \"Veterans' Day\", with Michael Gambon, was poorly received by critics, and following modest audiences, soon closed. Lemmon also worked with Kevin Spacey in the films \"The Murder of Mary Phagan\" (1987), \"Dad\" (1989), and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992), as well as the production of \"Long Day's Journey into Night\".\n1990\u20132001: Television work and later roles.\nLemmon and Matthau had small parts in Oliver Stone's film \"JFK\" (1991), in which both men appeared without sharing screen time. The duo reunited in \"Grumpy Old Men\" (1993). The film was a surprise hit. Later in the decade, they starred together in \"The Grass Harp\" (1995), \"Grumpier Old Men\" (1995), \"Out to Sea\" (1997), and \"The Odd Couple II\" (1998). While \"Grumpier Old Men\" grossed slightly more than its predecessor, \"The Odd Couple II\" was a box-office disappointment.\nIn 1996, Lemmon was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Or Nonmusical Album for his narration on \"Harry S Truman: A Journey To Independence\". Around the same time, Lemmon starred along with James Garner in the comedy \"My Fellow Americans\" (1996) as two feuding ex-presidents. The supporting cast included Dan Aykroyd and Lauren Bacall. That same year, he played Marcellus in Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film version of \"Hamlet\".\nFor his role in the William Friedkin-directed version of \"12 Angry Men\" (1997), Lemmon was nominated for Best Actor in a Made-for-TV Movie in the 1998 Golden Globe Awards.\nThe award ceremony was memorable because Ving Rhames, who won the Golden Globe for his portrayal of \"Don King: Only in America\", stunned the A-list crowd and television audience by calling Lemmon up to the stage and handing him the award. Lemmon tried not to accept but Rhames insisted. The emotional crowd gave Lemmon a standing ovation to which he replied that, \"This is one of the nicest, sweetest moments I have ever known in my life.\"\nThe role was as the contentious juror, played in the original 1957 film version by Henry Fonda. Lemmon appeared in the remake with George C. Scott and reunited with him in another television film, this time \"Inherit the Wind\" (1999).\nLemmon was a guest voice on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"The Twisted World of Marge Simpson\" (1997), as the owner of the pretzel business. For his role as Morrie Schwartz in his final television role, \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" (1999), Lemmon won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. His final film role was uncredited: the narrator in Robert Redford's 2000 film \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\".\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and family.\nLemmon was married twice. He and his first wife, actress Cynthia Stone\u2014with whom he had a son, Chris Lemmon (born 1954)\u2014divorced. Lemmon married actress Felicia Farr on August 17, 1962, while shooting \"Irma La Douce\" in Paris. The couple's daughter, Courtney, was born in 1966. Lemmon was the stepfather to Denise, from Farr's previous marriage to Lee Farr. He was close friends with actors Tony Curtis and Kevin Spacey, among others.\nHis publicist Geraldine McInerney said, \"I remember Jack once telling me he lived in terror his whole life that he'd never get another job. Here was one of America's most established actors and yet he was without any confidence. It was like every job was going to be his last\". As the 1970s progressed, Lemmon increased his drinking to cope with stress. He was fined for driving under the influence in 1976, finally quitting alcohol in the early 1980s. On a 1998 episode of the television program \"Inside the Actors Studio\", he stated that he was a recovering alcoholic.\nInterests.\nLemmon was known as the \"star\" of the celebrity-packed, third-round telecast of the annual AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links each February. Lemmon's packed gallery was there not only for his humor, but also to root him on in his lifelong quest to \"make the cut\" to round four, something he was never able to achieve. The amateur who helps his team most in the Pro-Am portion is annually awarded the Jack Lemmon Award. During the 1980s and 1990s, Lemmon served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute. Lemmon was a registered Democrat.\nFinal years and death.\nLemmon was hospitalized in December 2000 due to diverticulitis in his colon. He had accepted the Hollywood Women's Press Club Buddy Rogers Legend Award, presented by actor Angela Lansbury, accepting via phone. In May 2001, he underwent gallbladder surgery after being hospitalized with pneumonia.\nLemmon died of bladder cancer on June 27, 2001, approximately 9\u00a0p.m. at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center at age 76. He had privately suffered from the disease for two years before his death. His body is interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California. Lemmon's gravestone reads like a title screen from a film: \"JACK LEMMON in\". Guests who attended the private ceremony included Billy Wilder, Shirley MacLaine, Kevin Spacey, Gregory Peck, Sidney Poitier, Kirk Douglas, Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Frank Sinatra's widow Barbara and Walter Matthau's son Charlie.\nFilm critic Stanley Kauffmann described Lemmon as \"easily one of the most expert American actors of his generation\". Kevin Spacey said, \"Jack Lemmon was unique in the world of show business. He always treated people with respect and never let Hollywood glory affect his basic decency.\" Billy Wilder stated, \"I loved him dearly and he was the best actor I ever worked with.\"\nActing credits and accolades.\nLemmon received eight Academy Award nominations and won for \"Mister Roberts\" (1955) and \"Save the Tiger\" (1973). He was nominated for \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), \"The Apartment\" (1960), \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (1962), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Tribute\" (1981) and \"Missing\" (1982). He received two Tony Award nominations for his performances in \"Tribute\" (1979), and \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" (1986).\nHe received four Golden Globe Awards from 21 nominations, as well as two Cannes Film Festival Awards, two Volpi Cups, one Silver Bear, three BAFTA Awards, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.\nLemmon received numerous honorary awards including the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures in 1986 the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award in 1988, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1990, and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1991. In 1995, Lemmon was awarded the inaugural Harvard Arts Medal and the Kennedy Center Honors in 1996. In 1996, Lemmon was awarded the Honorary Golden Bear award at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language and \u2013 though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties (always with a strong foreign accent) \u2013 became a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature.\nHe wrote novels and stories, many in nautical settings, that depicted crises of human individuality in the midst of what he saw as an indifferent, inscrutable, and amoral world.\nConrad is considered a literary impressionist by some and an early modernist by others, though his works also contain elements of 19th-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters, as in \"Lord Jim\", have influenced numerous authors. Many dramatic films have been adapted from and inspired by his works.\nNumerous writers and critics have commented that his fictional works, written mostly in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.\nWriting near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew on the national experiences of his native Poland\u2014during nearly all his life, parcelled out among three occupying empires\u2014and on his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world\u2014including imperialism and colonialism\u2014and that profoundly explore the human psyche.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nConrad was born on 3 December 1857, in Berdychiv (), Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire; the region had once been part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. He was the only child of Apollo Korzeniowski\u2014a writer, translator, political activist, and would-be revolutionary\u2014and his wife Ewa Bobrowska. He was christened \"J\u00f3zef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski\" after his maternal grandfather J\u00f3zef, his paternal grandfather Teodor, and the heroes (both named \"Konrad\") of two poems by Adam Mickiewicz, \"Dziady\" and \"Konrad Wallenrod\". His family called him \"Konrad\", rather than \"J\u00f3zef\".\nThough the vast majority of the surrounding area's inhabitants were Ukrainians, and the great majority of Berdychiv's residents were Jewish, almost all the countryside was owned by the Polish \"szlachta\" (nobility), to which Conrad's family belonged as bearers of the Na\u0142\u0119cz coat-of-arms. Polish literature, particularly patriotic literature, was held in high esteem by the area's Polish population.\nPoland had been divided among Prussia, Austria and Russia in 1795. The Korzeniowski family had played a significant role in Polish attempts to regain independence. Conrad's paternal grandfather Teodor had served under Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski during Napoleon's Russian campaign and had formed his own cavalry squadron during the November 1830 Uprising of Poland-Lithuania against the Russian Empire. Conrad's fiercely patriotic father Apollo belonged to the \"Red\" political faction, whose goal was to re-establish the pre-partition boundaries of Poland and that also advocated land reform and the abolition of serfdom. Conrad's subsequent refusal to follow in Apollo's footsteps, and his choice of exile over resistance, were a source of lifelong guilt for Conrad.\nBecause of the father's attempts at farming and his political activism, the family moved repeatedly. In May 1861, they moved to Warsaw, where Apollo joined the resistance against the Russian Empire. He was arrested and imprisoned in Pavilion X \u2013 the dread Tenth Pavilion \u2013 of the Warsaw Citadel. Conrad would write: \"[I]n the courtyard of this Citadel\u2014characteristically for our nation\u2014my childhood memories begin.\" On 9 May 1862, Apollo and his family were exiled to Vologda, north of Moscow and known for its bad climate. In January 1863, Apollo's sentence was commuted, and the family was sent to Chernihiv in northeast Ukraine, where conditions were much better. However, on 18 April 1865, Ewa died of tuberculosis.\nApollo did his best to teach Conrad at home. The boy's early reading introduced him to the two elements that later dominated his life: in Victor Hugo's \"Toilers of the Sea\", he encountered the sphere of activity to which he would devote his youth; Shakespeare brought him into the orbit of English literature. Most of all, though, he read Polish Romantic poetry. Half a century later, he explained that \n\"The Polishness in my works comes from Mickiewicz and S\u0142owacki. My father read [Mickiewicz's] \"Pan Tadeusz\" aloud to me and made me read it aloud... I used to prefer [Mickiewicz's] \"Konrad Wallenrod\" [and] \"Gra\u017cyna\". Later I preferred S\u0142owacki. You know why S\u0142owacki?... [He is the soul of all Poland]\".\nIn the autumn of 1866, young Conrad was sent for a year-long retreat, for health reasons, to Kiev and his mother's family estate at Novofastiv.\nIn December 1867, Apollo took his son to the Austrian-held part of Poland, which for two years had been enjoying considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After sojourns in Lw\u00f3w and several smaller localities, on 20 February 1869, they moved to Krak\u00f3w (until 1596 the capital of Poland), likewise in Austrian Poland. A few months later, on 23 May 1869, Apollo Korzeniowski died, leaving Conrad orphaned at the age of eleven. Like Conrad's mother, Apollo had been gravely ill with tuberculosis. \nThe young Conrad was placed in the care of Ewa's brother, Tadeusz Bobrowski. Conrad's poor health and his unsatisfactory schoolwork caused his uncle constant problems and no end of financial outlay. Conrad was not a good student; despite tutoring, he excelled only in geography. At that time he likely received only private tutoring, as there is no evidence he attended any school regularly. Since the boy's ill health was clearly of nervous origin, the physicians supposed that fresh air and physical work would harden him; his uncle hoped that well-defined duties and the rigors of work would teach him discipline. Since he showed little inclination to study, it was essential that he learn a trade; his uncle thought he could work as a sailor-cum-businessman, who would combine maritime skills with commercial activities. In the autumn of 1871, thirteen-year-old Conrad announced his intention to become a sailor. He later recalled that as a child he had read (apparently in French translation) Leopold McClintock's book about his 1857\u201359 expeditions in the \"Fox\", in search of Sir John Franklin's lost ships ' and '. Conrad also recalled having read books by the American James Fenimore Cooper and the English Captain Frederick Marryat. A playmate of his adolescence recalled that Conrad spun fantastic yarns, always set at sea, presented so realistically that listeners thought the action was happening before their eyes.\nIn August 1873, Bobrowski sent fifteen-year-old Conrad to Lw\u00f3w to a cousin who ran a small boarding house for boys orphaned by the 1863 Uprising; group conversation there was in French. The owner's daughter recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He stayed with us ten months... Intellectually he was extremely advanced but [he] disliked school routine, which he found tiring and dull; he used to say... he... planned to become a great writer... He disliked all restrictions. At home, at school, or in the living room he would sprawl unceremoniously. He... suffer[ed] from severe headaches and nervous attacks...\nConrad had been at the establishment for just over a year when in September 1874, for uncertain reasons, his uncle removed him from school in Lw\u00f3w and took him back to Krak\u00f3w.\nOn 13 October 1874, Bobrowski sent the sixteen-year-old to Marseille, France, for Conrad's planned merchant-marine career on French merchant ships, providing him with a monthly stipend of 150 francs. Though Conrad had not completed secondary school, his accomplishments included fluency in French (with a correct accent), some knowledge of Latin, German and Greek; probably a good knowledge of history, some geography, and probably already an interest in physics. He was well read, particularly in Polish Romantic literature. He belonged to the second generation in his family that had had to earn a living outside the family estates. They were born and reared partly in the milieu of the working intelligentsia, a social class that was starting to play an important role in Central and Eastern Europe. He had absorbed enough of the history, culture and literature of his native land to be able eventually to develop a distinctive world view and make unique contributions to the literature of his adoptive Britain.\nTensions that originated in his childhood in Poland and increasing in his adulthood abroad contributed to Conrad's greatest literary achievements. Zdzis\u0142aw Najder, himself an emigrant from Poland, observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Living away from one's natural environment\u2014family, friends, social group, language\u2014even if it results from a conscious decision, usually gives rise to... internal tensions, because it tends to make people less sure of themselves, more vulnerable, less certain of their... position and... value... The Polish \"szlachta\" and... intelligentsia were social strata in which reputation... was felt... very important... for a feeling of self-worth. Men strove... to find confirmation of their... self-regard... in the eyes of others... Such a psychological heritage forms both a spur to ambition and a source of constant stress, especially if [one has been inculcated with] the idea of [one]'s public duty...\nSome critics have suggested that when Conrad left Poland, he wanted to break once and for all with his Polish past. In refutation of this, Najder quotes from Conrad's 14 August 1883 letter to family friend Stefan Buszczy\u0144ski, written nine years after Conrad had left Poland:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... I always remember what you said when I was leaving [Krak\u00f3w]: \"Remember\"\u2014you said\u2014\"wherever you may sail, you are sailing towards Poland!\"\nThat I have never forgotten, and never will forget!\nMerchant marine.\nIn Marseille, Conrad had an intense social life, often stretching his budget. A trace of these years can be found in the northern Corsica town of Luri, where there is a plaque to a Corsican merchant seaman, Dominique Cervoni, whom Conrad befriended. Cervoni became the inspiration for some of Conrad's characters, such as the title character of the 1904 novel \"Nostromo\". Conrad visited Corsica with his wife in 1921, partly in search of connections with his long-dead friend and fellow merchant seaman.\nIn late 1877, Conrad's maritime career was interrupted by the refusal of the Russian consul to provide documents needed for him to continue his service. As a result, Conrad fell into debt and, in March 1878, he attempted suicide. He survived, and received further financial aid from his uncle, allowing him to resume his normal life. After nearly four years in France and on French ships, Conrad joined the British merchant marine, enlisting in April 1878 (he had most likely started learning English shortly before).\nFor the next fifteen years, he served under the Red Ensign. He worked on a variety of ships as crew member (steward, apprentice, able seaman) and then as third, second and first mate, until eventually achieving captain's rank. During the 19 years from the time that Conrad had left Krak\u00f3w, in October 1874, until he signed off the \"Adowa\", in January 1894, he had worked in ships, including long periods in port, for 10 years and almost 8 months. He had spent just over 8 years at sea\u20149 months of it as a passenger. His sole captaincy took place in 1888\u201389, when he commanded the barque \"Otago\" from Sydney to Mauritius.\nDuring a brief call in India in 1885\u201386, 28-year-old Conrad sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion, a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at Cardiff in June 1885, just before sailing for Singapore in the clipper ship \"Tilkhurst\". These letters are Conrad's first preserved texts in English. His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish syntax and phraseology.\nMore importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881\u201383. He had abandoned \"hope for the future\" and the conceit of \"sailing [ever] toward Poland\", and his Panslavic ideas. He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge. While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914.\nThe year 1890 marked Conrad's first return to Poland, where he would visit his uncle and other relatives and acquaintances. This visit took place while he was waiting to proceed to the Congo Free State, having been hired by Albert Thys, deputy director of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo\". Conrad's association with the Belgian company, on the Congo River, would inspire his novella, \"Heart of Darkness\". During this 1890 period in the Congo, Conrad befriended Roger Casement, who was also working for Thys, operating a trading and transport station in Matadi. In 1903, as British Consul to Boma, Casement was commissioned to investigate abuses in the Congo, and later in Amazonian Peru, and was knighted in 1911 for his advocacy of human rights. Casement later became active in Irish Republicanism after leaving the British consular service.\nConrad left Africa at the end of December 1890, arriving in Brussels by late January of the following year. He rejoined the British merchant marines, as first mate, in November. When he left London on 25 October 1892 aboard the passenger clipper ship \"Torrens\", one of the passengers was William Henry Jacques, a consumptive Cambridge University graduate who died less than a year later on 19 September 1893. According to Conrad's \"A Personal Record\", Jacques was the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of Conrad's \"Almayer's Folly\". Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel.\nConrad completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman on 26 July 1893 when the \"Torrens\" docked at London and \"J. Conrad Korzemowin\"\u2014per the certificate of discharge\u2014debarked.\nWhen the \"Torrens\" had left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers had included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and New Zealand: 25-year-old lawyer and future novelist John Galsworthy; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys' preparatory school at Elstree. They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship and he would remain in touch with both. In one of Galsworthy's first literary attempts, \"The Doldrums\" (1895\u201396), the protagonist\u2014first mate Armand\u2014is modelled after Conrad.\nAt Cape Town, where the \"Torrens\" remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines. Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad. Later that year, Conrad would visit his relatives in Poland and Ukraine once again.\nWriter.\nIn the autumn of 1889, Conrad began writing his first novel, \"Almayer's Folly\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he son of a writer, praised by his [maternal] uncle [Tadeusz Bobrowski] for the beautiful style of his letters, the man who from the very first page showed a serious, professional approach to his work, presented his start on \"Almayer's Folly\" as a casual and non-binding incident... [Y]et he must have felt a pronounced need to write. Every page right from th[e] first one testifies that writing was not something he took up for amusement or to pass time. Just the contrary: it was a serious undertaking, supported by careful, diligent reading of the masters and aimed at shaping his own attitude to art and to reality... [W]e do not know the sources of his artistic impulses and creative gifts. \nConrad's later letters to literary friends show the attention that he devoted to analysis of style, to individual words and expressions, to the emotional tone of phrases, to the atmosphere created by language. In this, Conrad in his own way followed the example of Gustave Flaubert, notorious for searching days on end for \"le mot juste\"\u2014for the right word to render the \"essence of the matter.\" Najder opined:\n\"[W]riting in a foreign language admits a greater temerity in tackling personally sensitive problems, for it leaves uncommitted the most spontaneous, deeper reaches of the psyche, and allows a greater distance in treating matters we would hardly dare approach in the language of our childhood. As a rule it is easier both to swear and to analyze dispassionately in an acquired language.\"\nIn 1894, aged 36, Conrad reluctantly gave up the sea, partly because of poor health, partly due to unavailability of ships, and partly because he had become so fascinated with writing that he had decided on a literary career. \"Almayer's Folly\", set on the east coast of Borneo, was published in 1895. Its appearance marked his first use of the pen name \"Joseph Conrad\"; \"Konrad\" was, of course, the third of his Polish given names, but his use of it\u2014in the anglicised version, \"Conrad\"\u2014may also have been an homage to the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz's patriotic narrative poem, \"Konrad Wallenrod\".\nEdward Garnett, a young publisher's reader and literary critic who would play one of the chief supporting roles in Conrad's literary career, had\u2014like Unwin's first reader of \"Almayer's Folly\", Wilfrid Hugh Chesson\u2014been impressed by the manuscript, but Garnett had been \"uncertain whether the English was good enough for publication.\" Garnett had shown the novel to his wife, Constance Garnett, later a translator of Russian literature. She had thought Conrad's foreignness a positive merit.\nWhile Conrad had only limited personal acquaintance with the peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia, the region looms large in his early work. According to Najder, Conrad, the exile and wanderer, was aware of a difficulty that he confessed more than once: the lack of a common cultural background with his Anglophone readers meant he could not compete with English-language authors writing about the English-speaking world. At the same time, the choice of a non-English colonial setting freed him from an embarrassing division of loyalty: \"Almayer's Folly\", and later \"An Outpost of Progress\" (1897, set in a Congo exploited by King Leopold II of Belgium) and \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899, likewise set in the Congo), contain bitter reflections on colonialism. The Malay states came theoretically under the suzerainty of the Dutch government; Conrad did not write about the area's British dependencies, which he never visited. He \"was apparently intrigued by... struggles aimed at preserving national independence. The prolific and destructive richness of tropical nature and the dreariness of human life within it accorded well with the pessimistic mood of his early works.\"\n\"Almayer's Folly\", together with its successor, \"An Outcast of the Islands\" (1896), laid the foundation for Conrad's reputation as a romantic teller of exotic tales\u2014a misunderstanding of his purpose that was to frustrate him for the rest of his career.\nAlmost all of Conrad's writings were first published in newspapers and magazines: influential reviews like \"The Fortnightly Review\" and the \"North American Review\"; avant-garde publications like the \"Savoy\", \"New Review\", and \"The English Review\"; popular short-fiction magazines like \"The Saturday Evening Post\" and \"Harper's Magazine\"; women's journals like the \"Pictorial Review\" and \"Romance\"; mass-circulation dailies like the \"Daily Mail\" and the \"New York Herald\"; and illustrated newspapers like \"The Illustrated London News\" and the \"Illustrated Buffalo Express\". He also wrote for \"The Outlook\", an imperialist weekly magazine, between 1898 and 1906.\nFinancial success long eluded Conrad, who often requested advances from magazine and book publishers, and loans from acquaintances such as John Galsworthy. Eventually a government grant (\"civil list pension\") of \u00a3100 per annum, awarded on 9 August 1910, somewhat relieved his financial worries, and in time collectors began purchasing his manuscripts. Though his talent was early on recognised by English intellectuals, popular success eluded him until the 1913 publication of \"Chance\", which is often considered one of his weaker novels.\nPersonal life.\nTemperament and health.\nConrad was a reserved man, wary of showing emotion. He scorned sentimentality; his manner of portraying emotion in his books was full of restraint, scepticism and irony. In the words of his uncle Bobrowski, as a young man Conrad was \"extremely sensitive, conceited, reserved, and in addition excitable. In short [...] all the defects of the \"Na\u0142\u0119cz\" family.\"\nConrad suffered throughout life from ill health, physical and mental. A newspaper review of a Conrad biography suggested that the book could have been subtitled \"Thirty Years of Debt, Gout, Depression and Angst\". In 1891 he was hospitalised for several months, suffering from gout, neuralgic pains in his right arm and recurrent attacks of malaria. He also complained of swollen hands \"which made writing difficult\". Taking his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski's advice, he convalesced at a spa in Switzerland. Conrad had a phobia of dentistry, neglecting his teeth until they had to be extracted. In one letter he remarked that every novel he had written had cost him a tooth. Conrad's physical afflictions were, if anything, less vexatious than his mental ones. In his letters he often described symptoms of depression; \"the evidence\", writes Najder, \"is so strong that it is nearly impossible to doubt it.\"\nAttempted suicide.\nIn March 1878, at the end of his Marseille period, 20-year-old Conrad attempted suicide, by shooting himself in the chest with a revolver. According to his uncle, who was summoned by a friend, Conrad had fallen into debt. Bobrowski described his subsequent \"study\" of his nephew in an extensive letter to , his own ideological opponent and a friend of Conrad's late father Apollo. To what extent the suicide attempt had been made in earnest likely will never be known, but it is suggestive of a situational depression.\nRomance and marriage.\nIn 1888 during a stop-over on Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, Conrad developed a couple of romantic interests. One of these would be described in his 1910 story \"A Smile of Fortune\", which contains autobiographical elements (e.g., one of the characters is the same Chief Mate Burns who appears in \"The Shadow-Line\"). The narrator, a young captain, flirts ambiguously and surreptitiously with Alice Jacobus, daughter of a local merchant living in a house surrounded by a magnificent rose garden. Research has confirmed that in Port Louis at the time there was a 17-year-old Alice Shaw, whose father, a shipping agent, owned the only rose garden in town.\nMore is known about Conrad's other, more open flirtation. An old friend, Captain Gabriel Renouf of the French merchant marine, introduced him to the family of his brother-in-law. Renouf's eldest sister was the wife of Louis Edward Schmidt, a senior official in the colony; with them lived two other sisters and two brothers. Though the island had been taken over in 1810 by Britain, many of the inhabitants were descendants of the original French colonists, and Conrad's excellent French and perfect manners opened all local salons to him. He became a frequent guest at the Schmidts', where he often met the Misses Renouf. A couple of days before leaving Port Louis, Conrad asked one of the Renouf brothers for the hand of his 26-year-old sister Eugenie. She was already, however, engaged to marry her pharmacist cousin. After the rebuff, Conrad did not pay a farewell visit but sent a polite letter to Gabriel Renouf, saying he would never return to Mauritius and adding that on the day of the wedding his thoughts would be with them.\nOn 24 March 1896 Conrad married an Englishwoman, Jessie George. The couple had two sons, Borys and John. The elder, Borys, proved a disappointment in scholarship and integrity. Jessie was an unsophisticated, working-class girl, sixteen years younger than Conrad. To his friends, she was an inexplicable choice of wife, and the subject of some rather disparaging and unkind remarks. (See Lady Ottoline Morrell's opinion of Jessie in Impressions.) However, according to other biographers such as Frederick Karl, Jessie provided what Conrad needed, namely a \"straightforward, devoted, quite competent\" companion. Similarly, Jones remarks that, despite whatever difficulties the marriage endured, \"there can be no doubt that the relationship sustained Conrad's career as a writer\", which might have been much less successful without her.\nWhen in 1923 Jessie Conrad published \"A Handbook of Cookery for a Small House\", it came with a preface from Joseph Conrad praising \"the conscientious preparation of the simple food of everyday life, not the... concoction of idle feasts and rare dishes.\"\nThe couple rented a long series of successive homes, mostly in the English countryside. Conrad, who suffered frequent depressions, made great efforts to change his mood; the most important step was to move into another house. His frequent changes of home were usually signs of a search for psychological regeneration. Between 1910 and 1919 Conrad's home was Capel House in Orlestone, Kent, which was rented to him by Lord and Lady Oliver. It was here that he wrote \"The Rescue\", \"Victory\", and \"The Arrow of Gold\".\nExcept for several vacations in France and Italy, a 1914 vacation in his native Poland, and a 1923 visit to the United States, Conrad lived the rest of his life in England.\nSojourn in Poland.\nThe 1914 vacation with his wife and sons in Poland, at the urging of J\u00f3zef Retinger, coincided with the outbreak of World War I. On 28 July 1914, the day war broke out between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, Conrad and the Retingers arrived in Krak\u00f3w (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), where Conrad visited childhood haunts.\nAs the city lay only a few miles from the Russian border, there was a risk of being stranded in a battle zone. With wife Jessie and younger son John ill, Conrad decided to take refuge in the mountain resort town of Zakopane. They left Krak\u00f3w on 2 August. A few days after arrival in Zakopane, they moved to the Konstantyn\u00f3wka \"pension\" operated by Conrad's cousin Aniela Zag\u00f3rska; it had been frequented by celebrities including the statesman J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and Conrad's acquaintance, the young concert pianist Artur Rubinstein.\nZag\u00f3rska introduced Conrad to Polish writers, intellectuals, and artists who had also taken refuge in Zakopane, including novelist Stefan \u017beromski and Tadeusz Nalepi\u0144ski, a writer friend of anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski. Conrad aroused interest among the Poles as a famous writer and an exotic compatriot from abroad. He charmed new acquaintances, especially women.\nHowever, Marie Curie's physician sister, Bronis\u0142awa D\u0142uska, wife of fellow physician and eminent socialist activist Kazimierz D\u0142uski, openly berated Conrad for having used his great talent for purposes other than bettering the future of his native land.\nBut thirty-two-year-old Aniela Zag\u00f3rska (daughter of the \"pension\" keeper), Conrad's niece who would translate his works into Polish in 1923\u201339, idolised him, kept him company, and provided him with books. He particularly delighted in the stories and novels of the ten-years-older, recently deceased Boles\u0142aw Prus (who also had visited Zakopane), read everything by his fellow victim of Poland's 1863 Uprising\u2014\"my beloved Prus\"\u2014that he could get his hands on, and pronounced him \"better than Dickens\"\u2014a favourite English novelist of Conrad's.\nConrad, who was noted by his Polish acquaintances to still be fluent in his native tongue, participated in their impassioned political discussions. He declared presciently, as J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski had earlier in 1914 in Paris, that in the war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the Central Powers must in turn be beaten by France and Britain.\nAfter many travails and vicissitudes, at the beginning of November 1914 Conrad managed to bring his family back to England. On his return, he was determined to work on swaying British opinion in favour of restoring Poland's sovereignty.\nJessie Conrad would later write in her memoirs: \"I understood my husband so much better after those months in Poland. So many characteristics that had been strange and unfathomable to me before, took, as it were, their right proportions. I understood that his temperament was that of his countrymen.\"\nPolitics.\nBiographer Zdzis\u0142aw Najder wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Conrad was passionately concerned with politics. [This] is confirmed by several of his works, starting with \"Almayer's Folly\". [...] \"Nostromo\" revealed his concern with these matters more fully; it was, of course, a concern quite natural for someone from a country [Poland] where politics was a matter not only of everyday existence but also of life and death. Moreover, Conrad himself came from a social class that claimed exclusive responsibility for state affairs, and from a very politically active family. Norman Douglas sums it up: \"Conrad was first and foremost a Pole and like many Poles a politician and moralist \"malgr\u00e9 lui\" [French: \"in spite of himself\"]. These are his fundamentals.\" [What made] Conrad see political problems in terms of a continuous struggle between law and violence, anarchy and order, freedom and autocracy, material interests and the noble idealism of individuals [...] was Conrad's historical awareness. His Polish experience endowed him with the perception, exceptional in the Western European literature of his time, of how winding and constantly changing were the front lines in these struggles.\nThe most extensive and ambitious political statement that Conrad ever made was his 1905 essay, \"Autocracy and War\", whose starting point was the Russo-Japanese War (he finished the article a month before the Battle of Tsushima Strait). The essay begins with a statement about Russia's incurable weakness and ends with warnings against Prussia, the dangerous aggressor in a future European war. For Russia he predicted a violent outburst in the near future, but Russia's lack of democratic traditions and the backwardness of her masses made it impossible for the revolution to have a salutary effect. Conrad regarded the formation of a representative government in Russia as unfeasible and foresaw a transition from autocracy to dictatorship. He saw western Europe as torn by antagonisms engendered by economic rivalry and commercial selfishness. In vain might a Russian revolution seek advice or help from a materialistic and egoistic western Europe that armed itself in preparation for wars far more brutal than those of the past.\nConrad's distrust of democracy sprang from his doubts whether the propagation of democracy as an aim in itself could solve any problems. He thought that, in view of the weakness of human nature and of the \"criminal\" character of society, democracy offered boundless opportunities for demagogues and charlatans. Conrad kept his distance from partisan politics, and never voted in British national elections.\nHe accused social democrats of his time of acting to weaken \"the national sentiment, the preservation of which [was his] concern\"\u2014of attempting to dissolve national identities in an impersonal melting-pot. \"I look at the future from the depth of a very black past and I find that nothing is left for me except fidelity to a cause lost, to an idea without future.\" It was Conrad's hopeless fidelity to the memory of Poland that prevented him from believing in the idea of \"international fraternity\", which he considered, under the circumstances, just a verbal exercise. He resented some socialists' talk of freedom and world brotherhood while keeping silent about his own partitioned and oppressed Poland.\nBefore that, in the early 1880s, letters to Conrad from his uncle Tadeusz show Conrad apparently having hoped for an improvement in Poland's situation not through a liberation movement but by establishing an alliance with neighbouring Slavic nations. This had been accompanied by a faith in the Panslavic ideology\u2014\"surprising\", Najder writes, \"in a man who was later to emphasize his hostility towards Russia, a conviction that... Poland's [superior] civilization and... historic... traditions would [let] her play a leading role... in the Panslavic community, [and his] doubts about Poland's chances of becoming a fully sovereign nation-state.\"\nConrad's alienation from \"partisan\" politics went together with an abiding sense of the thinking man's burden imposed by his personality, as described in an 1894 letter by Conrad to a relative-by-marriage and fellow author, Marguerite Poradowska (\"n\u00e9e\" Gachet, and cousin of Vincent van Gogh's physician, Paul Gachet) of Brussels:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We must drag the chain and ball of our personality to the end. This is the price one pays for the infernal and divine privilege of thought; so in this life it is only the chosen who are convicts\u2014a glorious band which understands and groans but which treads the earth amidst a multitude of phantoms with maniacal gestures and idiotic grimaces. Which would you rather be: idiot or convict?\nConrad wrote H. G. Wells that the latter's 1901 book, \"Anticipations\", an ambitious attempt to predict major social trends, \"seems to presuppose... a sort of select circle to which you address yourself, leaving the rest of the world outside the pale. [In addition,] you do not take sufficient account of human imbecility which is cunning and perfidious.\"\nIn a 23 October 1922 letter to mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell, in response to the latter's book, \"The Problem of China\", which advocated socialist reforms and an oligarchy of sages who would reshape Chinese society, Conrad explained his own distrust of political panaceas:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have never [found] in any man's book or... talk anything... to stand up... against my deep-seated sense of fatality governing this man-inhabited world... The only remedy for Chinamen and for the rest of us is [a] change of hearts, but looking at the history of the last 2000 years there is not much reason to expect [it], even if man has taken to flying\u2014a great \"uplift\" no doubt but no great change...\nLeo Robson writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Conrad... adopted a broader ironic stance\u2014a sort of blanket incredulity, defined by a character in \"Under Western Eyes\" as the negation of all faith, devotion, and action. Through control of tone and narrative detail... Conrad exposes what he considered to be the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of movements like anarchism and socialism, and the self-serving logic of such historical but \"naturalized\" phenomena as capitalism (piracy with good PR), rationalism (an elaborate defense against our innate irrationality), and imperialism (a grandiose front for old-school rape and pillage). To be ironic is to be awake\u2014and alert to the prevailing \"somnolence.\" In \"Nostromo\"... the journalist Martin Decoud... ridicul[es] the idea that people \"believe themselves to be influencing the fate of the universe.\" (H. G. Wells recalled Conrad's astonishment that \"I could take social and political issues seriously.\")\nBut, writes Robson, Conrad is no moral nihilist:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If irony exists to suggest that there's more to things than meets the eye, Conrad further insists that, when we pay close enough attention, the \"more\" can be endless. He doesn't reject what [his character] Marlow [introduced in \"Youth\"] calls \"the haggard utilitarian lies of our civilisation\" in favor of nothing; he rejects them in favor of \"something\", \"some saving truth\", \"some exorcism against the ghost of doubt\"\u2014an intimation of a deeper order, one not easily reduced to words. Authentic, self-aware emotion\u2014feeling that doesn't call itself \"theory\" or \"wisdom\"\u2014becomes a kind of standard-bearer, with \"impressions\" or \"sensations\" the nearest you get to solid proof.\nIn an August 1901 letter to the editor of \"The New York Times Saturday Book Review\", Conrad wrote: \"Egoism, which is the moving force of the world, and altruism, which is its morality, these two contradictory instincts, of which one is so plain and the other so mysterious, cannot serve us unless in the incomprehensible alliance of their irreconcilable antagonism.\"\nDeath.\nOn 3 August 1924, Conrad died at his house, Oswalds, in Bishopsbourne, Kent, England, probably of a heart attack. He was interred at Canterbury Cemetery, Canterbury, under a misspelled version of his original Polish name, as \"Joseph Teador Conrad Korzeniowski\". Inscribed on his gravestone are the lines from Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\" which he had chosen as the epigraph to his last complete novel, \"The Rover\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sleep after toyle, port after stormie seas,&lt;br&gt;\nEase after warre, death after life, doth greatly please\nConrad's modest funeral took place amid great crowds. His old friend Edward Garnett recalled bitterly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To those who attended Conrad's funeral in Canterbury during the Cricket Festival of 1924, and drove through the crowded streets festooned with flags, there was something symbolical in England's hospitality and in the crowd's ignorance of even the existence of this great writer. A few old friends, acquaintances and pressmen stood by his grave.\nAnother old friend of Conrad's, Cunninghame Graham, wrote Garnett: \"Aubry was saying to me... that had Anatole France died, all Paris would have been at his funeral.\"\nConrad's wife Jessie died twelve years later, on 6 December 1936, and was interred with him.\nIn 1996 his grave was designated a Grade II listed structure.\nConrad, though nominally a Catholic, is described by biographer Jeffrey Meyers as having been an atheist.\nWriting style.\nThemes and style.\nDespite the opinions even of some who knew Conrad personally, such as fellow-novelist Henry James, Conrad\u2014even when only writing elegantly crafted letters to his uncle and acquaintances\u2014was always at heart a writer who sailed, rather than a sailor who wrote. He used his sailing experiences as a backdrop for many of his works, but he also produced works of similar world view, without the nautical motifs. The failure of many critics to appreciate this caused him much frustration.\nHe wrote more often about life at sea and in exotic parts than about life on British land because\u2014unlike, for example, his friend John Galsworthy, author of \"The Forsyte Saga\"\u2014he knew little about everyday domestic relations in Britain. When Conrad's \"The Mirror of the Sea\" was published in 1906 to critical acclaim, he wrote to his French translator: \"The critics have been vigorously swinging the censer to me.\u00a0... Behind the concert of flattery, I can hear something like a whisper: 'Keep to the open sea! Don't land!' They want to banish me to the middle of the ocean.\" Writing to his friend Richard Curle, Conrad remarked that \"the public mind fastens on externals\" such as his \"sea life\", oblivious to how authors transform their material \"from particular to general, and appeal to universal emotions by the temperamental handling of personal experience\".\nNevertheless, Conrad found much sympathetic readership, especially in the United States. H. L. Mencken was one of the earliest and most influential American readers to recognise how Conrad conjured up \"the general out of the particular\". F. Scott Fitzgerald, writing to Mencken, complained about having been omitted from a list of Conrad imitators. Since Fitzgerald, dozens of other American writers have acknowledged their debts to Conrad, including William Faulkner, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, and Thomas Pynchon.\nAn October 1923 visitor to Oswalds, Conrad's home at the time\u2014Cyril Clemens, a cousin of Mark Twain\u2014quoted Conrad as saying: \"In everything I have written there is always one invariable intention, and that is to capture the reader's attention.\"\nConrad the artist famously aspired, in the words of his preface to \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus\"' (1897), \"by the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel\u00a0... before all, to make you \"see\". That\u2014and no more, and it is everything. If I succeed, you shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement, consolation, fear, charm\u2014all you demand\u2014and, perhaps, also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask.\"\nWriting in what to the visual arts was the age of Impressionism, and what to music was the age of impressionist music, Conrad showed himself in many of his works a prose poet of the highest order: for instance, in the evocative \"Patna\" and courtroom scenes of \"Lord Jim\"; in the scenes of the \"melancholy-mad elephant\" and the \"French gunboat firing into a continent\", in \"Heart of Darkness\"; in the doubled protagonists of \"The Secret Sharer\"; and in the verbal and conceptual resonances of \"Nostromo\" and \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus\"'.\nConrad used his own memories as literary material so often that readers are tempted to treat his life and work as a single whole. His \"view of the world\", or elements of it, is often described by citing at once both his private and public statements, passages from his letters, and citations from his books. Najder warns that this approach produces an incoherent and misleading picture. \"An\u00a0... uncritical linking of the two spheres, literature and private life, distorts each. Conrad used his own experiences as raw material, but the finished product should not be confused with the experiences themselves.\"\nMany of Conrad's characters were inspired by actual persons he had met, including, in his first novel, \"Almayer's Folly\" (completed 1894), William Charles Olmeijer, the spelling of whose surname Conrad probably altered to \"Almayer\" inadvertently. The historic trader Olmeijer, whom Conrad encountered on his four short visits to Berau in Borneo, subsequently haunted Conrad's imagination. Conrad often borrowed the authentic names of actual individuals, e.g., Captain McWhirr (\"Typhoon\"), Captain Beard and Mr. Mahon (\"Youth\"), Captain Lingard (\"Almayer's Folly\" and elsewhere), and Captain Ellis (\"The Shadow-Line\"). \"Conrad\", writes J. I. M. Stewart, \"appears to have attached some mysterious significance to such links with actuality.\" Equally curious is \"a great deal of namelessness in Conrad, requiring some minor virtuosity to maintain.\" Thus we never learn the surname of the protagonist of \"Lord Jim\". In \"Heart of Darkness\", among \"nameless characters, chapters, rivers, rites and landscapes\", \"Marlow and Kurtz are the only living persons introduced with a proper name\". Conrad also preserves, in \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus\"', the authentic name of the ship, the \"Narcissus\", in which he sailed in 1884.\nApart from Conrad's own experiences, a number of episodes in his fiction were suggested by past or contemporary publicly known events or literary works. The first half of the 1900 novel \"Lord Jim\" (the \"Patna\" episode) was inspired by the real-life 1880 story of the ; the second part, to some extent by the life of James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. The 1901 short story \"Amy Foster\" was inspired partly by an anecdote in Ford Madox Ford's \"The Cinque Ports\" (1900), wherein a shipwrecked sailor from a German merchant ship, unable to communicate in English, and driven away by the local country people, finally found shelter in a pigsty.\nIn \"Nostromo\" (completed 1904), the theft of a massive consignment of silver was suggested to Conrad by a story he had heard in the Gulf of Mexico and later read about in a \"volume picked up outside a second-hand bookshop.\" The novel's political strand, according to Maya Jasanoff, is related to the creation of the Panama Canal. \"In January 1903\", she writes, \"just as Conrad started writing \"Nostromo\", the US and Colombian secretaries of state signed a treaty granting the United States a one-hundred-year renewable lease on a six-mile strip flanking the canal\u00a0... While the [news]papers murmured about revolution in Colombia, Conrad opened a fresh section of \"Nostromo\" with hints of dissent in Costaguana\", his fictional South American country. He plotted a revolution in the Costaguanan fictional port of Sulaco that mirrored the real-life secessionist movement brewing in Panama. When Conrad finished the novel on 1 September 1904, writes Jasanoff, \"he left Sulaco in the condition of Panama. As Panama had gotten its independence instantly recognized by the United States and its economy bolstered by American investment in the canal, so Sulaco had \"its\" independence instantly recognized by the United States, and its economy underwritten by investment in the [fictional] San Tom\u00e9 [silver] mine.\"\n\"The Secret Agent\" (completed 1906) was inspired by the French anarchist Martial Bourdin's 1894 death while apparently attempting to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. Conrad's story \"The Secret Sharer\" (completed 1909) was inspired by an 1880 incident when Sydney Smith, first mate of the \"Cutty Sark\", had killed a seaman and fled from justice, aided by the ship's captain. The plot of \"Under Western Eyes\" (completed 1910) is kicked off by the assassination of a brutal Russian government minister, modelled after the real-life 1904 assassination of Russian Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve. The near-novella \"Freya of the Seven Isles\" (completed in March 1911) was inspired by a story told to Conrad by a Malaya old hand and fan of Conrad's, Captain Carlos M. Marris.\nFor the natural surroundings of the high seas, the Malay Archipelago and South America, which Conrad described so vividly, he could rely on his own observations. What his brief landfalls could not provide was a thorough understanding of exotic cultures. For this he resorted, like other writers, to literary sources. When writing his Malayan stories, he consulted Alfred Russel Wallace's \"The Malay Archipelago\" (1869), James Brooke's journals, and books with titles like \"Perak and the Malays\", \"My Journal in Malayan Waters\", and \"Life in the Forests of the Far East\". When he set about writing his novel \"Nostromo\", set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, he turned to \"The War between Peru and Chile\"; Edward Eastwick, \"Venezuela: or, Sketches of Life in a South American Republic\" (1868); and George Frederick Masterman, \"Seven Eventful Years in Paraguay\" (1869). As a result of relying on literary sources, in \"Lord Jim\", as J. I. M. Stewart writes, Conrad's \"need to work to some extent from second-hand\" led to \"a certain thinness in Jim's relations with the\u00a0... peoples\u00a0... of Patusan...\" This prompted Conrad at some points to alter the nature of Charles Marlow's narrative to \"distanc[e] an uncertain command of the detail of Tuan Jim's empire.\"\nIn keeping with his scepticism and melancholy, Conrad almost invariably gives lethal fates to the characters in his principal novels and stories. Almayer (\"Almayer's Folly\", 1894), abandoned by his beloved daughter, takes to opium, and dies. Peter Willems (\"An Outcast of the Islands\", 1895) is killed by his jealous lover A\u00efssa. The ineffectual \"Nigger\", James Wait (\"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus\"', 1897), dies aboard ship and is buried at sea. Mr. Kurtz (\"Heart of Darkness\", 1899) expires, uttering the words, \"The horror! The horror!\" \"Tuan\" Jim (\"Lord Jim\", 1900), having inadvertently precipitated a massacre of his adoptive community, deliberately walks to his death at the hands of the community's leader. In Conrad's 1901 short story, \"Amy Foster\", a Pole transplanted to England, Yanko Goorall (an English transliteration of the Polish \"Janko G\u00f3ral\", \"Johnny Highlander\"), falls ill and, suffering from a fever, raves in his native language, frightening his wife Amy, who flees; next morning Yanko dies of heart failure, and it transpires that he had simply been asking in Polish for water. Captain Whalley (\"The End of the Tether\", 1902), betrayed by failing eyesight and an unscrupulous partner, drowns himself. Gian' Battista Fidanza, the eponymous respected Italian-immigrant \"Nostromo\" () of the novel \"Nostromo\" (1904), illicitly obtains a treasure of silver mined in the South American country of \"Costaguana\" and is shot dead due to mistaken identity. Mr. Verloc, \"The Secret Agent\" (1906) of divided loyalties, attempts a bombing, to be blamed on terrorists, that accidentally kills his mentally defective brother-in-law Stevie, and Verloc himself is killed by his distraught wife, who drowns herself by jumping overboard from a channel steamer. In \"Chance\" (1913), Roderick Anthony, a sailing-ship captain, and benefactor and husband of Flora de Barral, becomes the target of a poisoning attempt by her jealous disgraced financier father who, when detected, swallows the poison himself and dies (some years later, Captain Anthony drowns at sea). In \"Victory\" (1915), Lena is shot dead by Jones, who had meant to kill his accomplice Ricardo and later succeeds in doing so, then himself perishes along with another accomplice, after which Lena's protector Axel Heyst sets fire to his bungalow and dies beside Lena's body.\nWhen a principal character of Conrad's does escape with his life, he sometimes does not fare much better. In \"Under Western Eyes\" (1911), Razumov betrays a fellow University of St. Petersburg student, the revolutionist Victor Haldin, who has assassinated a savagely repressive Russian government minister. Haldin is tortured and hanged by the authorities. Later Razumov, sent as a government spy to Geneva, a centre of anti-tsarist intrigue, meets the mother and sister of Haldin, who share Haldin's liberal convictions. Razumov falls in love with the sister and confesses his betrayal of her brother; later, he makes the same avowal to assembled revolutionists, and their professional executioner bursts his eardrums, making him deaf for life. Razumov staggers away, is knocked down by a streetcar, and finally returns as a cripple to Russia.\nConrad was keenly conscious of tragedy in the world and in his works. In 1898, at the start of his writing career, he had written to his Scottish writer-politician friend Cunninghame Graham: \"What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it. [A]s soon as you know of your slavery the pain, the anger, the strife\u2014the tragedy begins.\" But in 1922, near the end of his life and career, when another Scottish friend, Richard Curle, sent Conrad proofs of two articles he had written about Conrad, the latter objected to being characterised as a gloomy and tragic writer. \"That reputation\u00a0... has deprived me of innumerable readers\u00a0... I absolutely object to being called a \"tragedian\".\"\nConrad claimed that he \"never kept a diary and never owned a notebook.\" John Galsworthy, who knew him well, described this as \"a statement which surprised no one who knew the resources of his memory and the brooding nature of his creative spirit.\" Nevertheless, after Conrad's death, Richard Curle published a heavily modified version of Conrad's diaries describing his experiences in the Congo; in 1978 a more complete version was published as \"The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces\". The first accurate transcription was published in Robert Hampson's Penguin edition of \"Heart of Darkness\" in 1995; Hampson's transcription and annotations were reprinted in the Penguin edition of 2007.\nUnlike many authors who make it a point not to discuss work in progress, Conrad often did discuss his current work and even showed it to select friends and fellow authors, such as Edward Garnett, and sometimes modified it in the light of their critiques and suggestions. Conrad frequently suffered from writer's block.\nEdward Said was struck by the sheer quantity of Conrad's correspondence with friends and fellow writers; by 1966, it \"amount[ed] to eight published volumes\". Said comments: \"[I]t seemed to me that if Conrad wrote of himself, of the problem of self-definition, with such sustained urgency, some of what he wrote must have had meaning for his fiction. [I]t [was] difficult to believe that a man would be so uneconomical as to pour himself out in letter after letter and then not use and reformulate his insights and discoveries in his fiction.\" Said found especially close parallels between Conrad's letters and his shorter fiction. \"Conrad\u00a0... believed\u00a0... that artistic distinction was more tellingly demonstrated in a shorter rather than a longer work... He believed that his [own] life was like a series of short episodes... because he was himself so many different people\u00a0...: he was a Pole and an Englishman, a sailor and a writer.\" Another scholar, Najder, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Throughout almost his entire life Conrad was an outsider and felt himself to be one. An outsider in exile; an outsider during his visits to his family in the Ukraine; an outsider\u2014because of his experiences and bereavement\u2014in [Krak\u00f3w] and Lw\u00f3w; an outsider in Marseilles; an outsider, nationally and culturally, on British ships; an outsider as an English writer.\u00a0... Conrad called himself (to Graham) a \"bloody foreigner.\" At the same time\u00a0... [h]e regarded \"the national spirit\" as the only truly permanent and reliable element of communal life.\nConrad borrowed from other, Polish- and French-language authors, to an extent sometimes skirting plagiarism. When the Polish translation of his 1915 novel \"Victory\" appeared in 1931, readers noted striking similarities to Stefan \u017beromski's kitschy novel, \"The History of a Sin\" (\"Dzieje grzechu\", 1908), including their endings. Comparative-literature scholar Yves Hervouet has demonstrated in the text of \"Victory\" a whole mosaic of influences, borrowings, similarities and allusions. He further lists hundreds of concrete borrowings from other, mostly French authors in nearly all of Conrad's works, from \"Almayer's Folly\" (1895) to his unfinished \"Suspense\". Conrad seems to have used eminent writers' texts as raw material of the same kind as the content of his own memory. Materials borrowed from other authors often functioned as allusions. Moreover, he had a phenomenal memory for texts and remembered details, \"but [writes Najder] it was not a memory strictly categorized according to sources, marshalled into homogeneous entities; it was, rather, an enormous receptacle of images and pieces from which he would draw.\"\nContinues Najder: \"[H]e can never be accused of outright plagiarism. Even when lifting sentences and scenes, Conrad changed their character, inserted them within novel structures. He did not imitate, but (as Hervouet says) 'continued' his masters. He was right in saying: 'I don't resemble anybody.' Ian Watt put it succinctly: 'In a sense, Conrad is the least derivative of writers; he wrote very little that could possibly be mistaken for the work of anyone else.' Conrad's acquaintance George Bernard Shaw says it well: \"[A] man can no more be completely original [...] than a tree can grow out of air.\"\nConrad, like other artists, faced constraints arising from the need to propitiate his audience and confirm their own favourable self-regard. This may account for his describing the admirable crew of the \"Judea\" in his 1898 story \"Youth\" as \"Liverpool hard cases\", whereas the crew of the \"Judea\"'s actual 1882 prototype, the \"Palestine\", had included not a single Liverpudlian, and half the crew had been non-Britons; and for Conrad's transforming the real-life 1880 criminally negligent British captain J. L. Clark, of the , in his 1900 novel \"Lord Jim\", into the captain of the fictitious \"Patna\"\u2014\"a sort of renegade New South Wales German\" so monstrous in physical appearance as to suggest \"a trained baby elephant\". Similarly, in his letters Conrad\u2014during most of his literary career, struggling for sheer financial survival\u2014often adjusted his views to the predilections of his correspondents.\nHistorians have also noted that Conrad's works which were set in European colonies and intended to critique the effects of colonialism were set in Dutch and Belgian colonies, instead of the British Empire.\nThe singularity of the universe depicted in Conrad's novels, especially compared to those of near-contemporaries like his friend and frequent benefactor John Galsworthy, is such as to open him to criticism similar to that later applied to Graham Greene. But where \"Greeneland\" has been characterised as a recurring and recognisable atmosphere independent of setting, Conrad is at pains to create a sense of place, be it aboard ship or in a remote village; often he chose to have his characters play out their destinies in isolated or confined circumstances. In the view of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, it was not until the first volumes of Anthony Powell's sequence, \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", were published in the 1950s, that an English novelist achieved the same command of atmosphere and precision of language with consistency, a view supported by later critics like A. N. Wilson; Powell acknowledged his debt to Conrad. Leo Gurko, too, remarks, as \"one of Conrad's special qualities, his abnormal awareness of place, an awareness magnified to almost a new dimension in art, an ecological dimension defining the relationship between earth and man.\"\nT. E. Lawrence, one of many writers whom Conrad befriended, offered some perceptive observations about Conrad's writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He's absolutely the most haunting thing in prose that ever was: I wish I knew how every paragraph he writes (... they are all paragraphs: he seldom writes a single sentence\u00a0...) goes on sounding in waves, like the note of a tenor bell, after it stops. It's not built in the rhythm of ordinary prose, but on something existing only in his head, and as he can never say what it is he wants to say, all his things end in a kind of hunger, a suggestion of something he can't say or do or think. So his books always look bigger than they are. He's as much a giant of the subjective as Kipling is of the objective. Do they hate one another? \nThe Irish novelist-poet-critic Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn captures something similar:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Joseph Conrad's heroes were often alone, and close to hostility and danger. Sometimes, when Conrad's imagination was at its most fertile and his command of English at its most precise, the danger came darkly from within the self. At other times, however, it came from what could not be named. Conrad sought then to evoke rather than delineate, using something close to the language of prayer. While his imagination was content at times with the tiny, vivid, perfectly observed detail, it was also nourished by the need to suggest and symbolize. Like a poet, he often left the space in between strangely, alluringly vacant.\nHis own vague terms\u2014words like \"ineffable\", \"infinite\", \"mysterious\", \"unknowable\"\u2014were as close as he could come to a sense of our fate in the world or the essence of the universe, a sense that reached beyond the time he described and beyond his characters' circumstances. This idea of \"beyond\" satisfied something in his imagination. He worked as though between the intricate systems of a ship and the vague horizon of a vast sea.\nThis irreconcilable distance between what was precise and what was shimmering made him much more than a novelist of adventure, a chronicler of the issues that haunted his time, or a writer who dramatized moral questions. This left him open to interpretation\u2014and indeed to attack [by critics such as the novelists V.S. Naipaul and Chinua Achebe].\nIn a letter of 14 December 1897 to his Scottish friend, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, Conrad wrote that science tells us, \"Understand that thou art nothing, less than a shadow, more insignificant than a drop of water in the ocean, more fleeting than the illusion of a dream.\"\nIn a letter of 20 December 1897 to Cunninghame Graham, Conrad metaphorically described the universe as a huge machine:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It evolved itself (I am severely scientific) out of a chaos of scraps of iron and behold!\u2014it knits. I am horrified at the horrible work and stand appalled. I feel it ought to embroider\u2014but it goes on knitting. You come and say: \"this is all right; it's only a question of the right kind of oil. Let us use this\u2014for instance\u2014celestial oil and the machine shall embroider a most beautiful design in purple and gold.\" Will it? Alas no. You cannot by any special lubrication make embroidery with a knitting machine. And the most withering thought is that the infamous thing has made itself; made itself without thought, without conscience, without foresight, without eyes, without heart. It is a tragic accident\u2014and it has happened. You can't interfere with it. The last drop of bitterness is in the suspicion that you can't even smash it. In virtue of that truth one and immortal which lurks in the force that made it spring into existence it is what it is\u2014and it is indestructible!\nIt knits us in and it knits us out. It has knitted time space, pain, death, corruption, despair and all the illusions\u2014and nothing matters.\nConrad wrote Cunninghame Graham on 31 January 1898:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Faith is a myth and beliefs shift like mists on the shore; thoughts vanish; words, once pronounced, die; and the memory of yesterday is as shadowy as the hope of to-morrow.\u00a0...\nIn this world\u2014as I have known it\u2014we are made to suffer without the shadow of a reason, of a cause or of guilt.\u00a0...\nThere is no morality, no knowledge and no hope; there is only the consciousness of ourselves which drives us about a world that\u00a0... is always but a vain and fleeting appearance.\u00a0...\nA moment, a twinkling of an eye and nothing remains\u2014but a clod of mud, of cold mud, of dead mud cast into black space, rolling around an extinguished sun. Nothing. Neither thought, nor sound, nor soul. Nothing.\nLeo Robson suggests that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What [Conrad] really learned as a sailor was not something empirical\u2014an assembly of \"places and events\"\u2014but the vindication of a perspective he had developed in childhood, an impartial, unillusioned view of the world as a place of mystery and contingency, horror and splendor, where, as he put it in a letter to the \"London Times\", the only indisputable truth is \"our ignorance.\"\nAccording to Robson,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Conrad's] treatment of knowledge as contingent and provisional commands a range of comparisons, from \"Rashomon\" to [the views of philosopher] Richard Rorty; reference points for Conrad's fragmentary method [of presenting information about characters and events] include Picasso and T. S. Eliot\u2014who took the epigraph of \"The Hollow Men\" from \"Heart of Darkness\".\u00a0... Even Henry James's late period, that other harbinger of the modernist novel, had not yet begun when Conrad invented Marlow, and James's earlier experiments in perspective (\"The Spoils of Poynton\", \"What Maisie Knew\") don't go nearly as far as \"Lord Jim\".\nLanguage.\nConrad spoke his native Polish and the French language fluently from childhood and only acquired English in his twenties. He would probably have spoken some Ukrainian as a child; he certainly had to have some knowledge of German and Russian. His son Borys records that, though Conrad had insisted that he spoke only a few words of German, when they reached the Austrian frontier in the family's attempt to leave Poland in 1914, Conrad spoke German \"at considerable length and extreme fluency\". Russia, Prussia, and Austria had divided up Poland among them, and he was officially a Russian subject until his naturalization as a British subject. As a result, up to this point, his official documents were in Russian. His knowledge of Russian was good enough that his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski wrote him (22 May 1893) advising that, when Conrad came to visit, he should \"telegraph for horses, but in Russian, for Orat\u00f3w doesn't receive or accept messages in an 'alien' language.\"\nConrad chose, however, to write his fiction in English. He says in his preface to \"A Personal Record\" that writing in English was for him \"natural\", and that the idea of his having made a deliberate choice between English and French, as some had suggested, was in error. He explained that, though he had been familiar with French from childhood, \"I would have been afraid to attempt expression in a language so perfectly 'crystallized'.\" In 1915, as Jo Davidson sculpted his bust, Conrad answered his question: \"Ah\u2026 to write French you have to know it. English is so plastic\u2014if you haven't got a word you need you can make it, but to write French you have to be an artist like Anatole France.\" These statements, as so often in Conrad's \"autobiographical\" writings, are subtly disingenuous. In 1897 Conrad was visited by a fellow Pole, the philosopher Wincenty Lutos\u0142awski, who asked Conrad, \"Why don't you write in Polish?\" Lutos\u0142awski recalled Conrad explaining: \"I value our beautiful Polish literature too much to bring into it my clumsy efforts. But for the English my gifts are sufficient and secure my daily bread.\"\nConrad wrote in \"A Personal Record\" that English was \"the speech of my secret choice, of my future, of long friendships, of the deepest affections, of hours of toil and hours of ease, and of solitary hours, too, of books read, of thoughts pursued, of remembered emotions\u2014of my very dreams!\" In 1878 Conrad's four-year experience in the French merchant marine had been cut short when the French discovered he did not have a permit from the Imperial Russian consul to sail with the French. This, and some typically disastrous Conradian investments, had left him destitute and had precipitated a suicide attempt. With the concurrence of his mentor-uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski, who had been summoned to Marseille, Conrad decided to seek employment with the British merchant marine, which did not require Russia's permission. Thus began Conrad's sixteen years' seafarer's acquaintance with the British and with the English language.\nHad Conrad remained in the Francophone sphere or had he returned to Poland, the son of the Polish poet, playwright, and translator Apollo Korzeniowski\u2014from childhood exposed to Polish and foreign literature, and ambitious to himself become a writer\u2014he might have ended up writing in French or Polish instead of English. Certainly his Uncle Tadeusz thought Conrad might write in Polish; in an 1881 letter he advised his 23-year-old nephew:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As, thank God, you do not forget your Polish... and your writing is not bad, I repeat what I have... written and said before\u2014you would do well to write... for \"W\u0119drowiec\" [The Wanderer] in Warsaw. We have few travelers, and even fewer genuine correspondents: the words of an eyewitness would be of great interest and in time would bring you... money. It would be an exercise in your native tongue\u2014that thread which binds you to your country and countrymen\u2014and finally a tribute to the memory of your father who always wanted to and did serve his country by his pen.\nIn the opinion of some biographers, Conrad's third language, English, remained under the influence of his first two languages\u2014Polish and French. This makes his English seem unusual. Najder writes that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[H]e was a man of three cultures: Polish, French, and English. Brought up in a Polish family and cultural environment... he learned French as a child, and at the age of less than seventeen went to France, to serve... four years in the French merchant marine. At school he must have learned German, but French remained the language he spoke with greatest fluency (and no foreign accent) until the end of his life. He was well versed in French history and literature, and French novelists were his artistic models. But he wrote all his books in English\u2014the tongue he started to learn at the age of twenty. He was thus an English writer who grew up in other linguistic and cultural environments. His work can be seen as located in the borderland of auto-translation. \nInevitably for a trilingual Polish\u2013French\u2013English-speaker, Conrad's writings occasionally show linguistic spillover: \"Franglais\" or \"Poglish\"\u2014the inadvertent use of French or Polish vocabulary, grammar, or syntax in his English writings. In one instance, Najder used \"several slips in vocabulary, typical for Conrad (Gallicisms) and grammar (usually Polonisms)\" as part of internal evidence against Conrad's sometime literary collaborator Ford Madox Ford's claim to have written a certain instalment of Conrad's novel \"Nostromo\", for publication in \"T. P.'s Weekly\", on behalf of an ill Conrad.\nThe impracticality of working with a language which has long ceased to be one's principal language of daily use is illustrated by Conrad's 1921 attempt at translating into English the Polish physicist, columnist, story-writer, and comedy-writer Bruno Winawer's short play, \"The Book of Job\". Najder writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he [play's] language is easy, colloquial, slightly individualized. Particularly Herup and a snobbish Jew, \"Bolo\" Bendziner, have their characteristic ways of speaking. Conrad, who had had little contact with everyday spoken Polish, simplified the dialogue, left out Herup's scientific expressions, and missed many amusing nuances. The action in the original is quite clearly set in contemporary Warsaw, somewhere between elegant society and the demimonde; this specific cultural setting is lost in the translation. Conrad left out many accents of topical satire in the presentation of the dramatis personae and ignored not only the ungrammatical speech (which might have escaped him) of some characters but even the Jewishness of two of them, Bolo and Mosan.\nAs a practical matter, by the time Conrad set about writing fiction, he had little choice but to write in English. Poles who accused Conrad of cultural apostasy because he wrote in English instead of Polish missed the point\u2014as do Anglophones who see, in Conrad's default choice of English as his artistic medium, a testimonial to some sort of innate superiority of the English language.\nAccording to Conrad's close friend and literary assistant Richard Curle, the fact of Conrad writing in English was \"obviously misleading\" because Conrad \"is no more completely English in his art than he is in his nationality\". Conrad, according to Curle, \"could never have written in any other language save the English language...for he would have been dumb in any other language but the English.\"\nConrad always retained a strong emotional attachment to his native language. He asked his visiting Polish niece Karola Zag\u00f3rska, \"Will you forgive me that my sons don't speak Polish?\" In June 1924, shortly before his death, he apparently expressed a desire that his son John marry a Polish girl and learn Polish, and toyed with the idea of returning for good to now independent Poland.\nConrad bridled at being referred to as a Russian or \"Slavonic\" writer. The only Russian writer he admired was Ivan Turgenev. \"The critics\", he wrote to an acquaintance on 31 January 1924, six months before his death, \"detected in me a new note and as, just when I began to write, they had discovered the existence of Russian authors, they stuck that label on me under the name of Slavonism. What I venture to say is that it would have been more just to charge me at most with Polonism.\" However, though Conrad protested that Dostoyevsky was \"too Russian for me\" and that Russian literature generally was \"repugnant to me hereditarily and individually\", \"Under Western Eyes\" is viewed as Conrad's response to the themes explored in Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\".\nConrad had an awareness that, in any language, individual expressions \u2013 words, phrases, sentences \u2013 are fraught with connotations. He once wrote: \"No English word has clean edges.\" All expressions, he thought, carried so many connotations as to be little more than \"instruments for exciting blurred emotions.\" This might help elucidate the impressionistic quality of many passages in his writings. It also explains why he chose to write his literary works not in Polish or French but in English, with which for decades he had had the greatest contact.\nControversy.\nIn 1975 the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe published an essay, \"\", which provoked controversy by calling Conrad a \"thoroughgoing racist\". Achebe's view was that \"Heart of Darkness\" cannot be considered a great work of art because it is \"a novel which celebrates... dehumanisation, which depersonalises a portion of the human race.\" Referring to Conrad as a \"talented, tormented man\", Achebe notes that Conrad (via the protagonist, Charles Marlow) reduces and degrades Africans to \"limbs\", \"ankles\", \"glistening white eyeballs\", etc., while simultaneously (and fearfully) suspecting a common kinship between himself and these natives\u2014leading Marlow to sneer the word \"ugly\". Achebe also cited Conrad's description of an encounter with an African: \"A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days.\" Achebe's essay, a landmark in postcolonial discourse, provoked debate, and the questions it raised have been addressed in most subsequent literary criticism of Conrad.\nAchebe's critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlow's view from Conrad's, which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella. In their view, Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically, and refers sarcastically to, and condemns outright, the supposedly noble aims of European colonists, thereby demonstrating his skepticism about the moral superiority of white men. Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained, emaciated slaves, the novelist remarks: \"After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.\" Some observers assert that Conrad, whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers, empathised by default with other subjugated peoples. Jeffrey Meyers notes that Conrad, like his acquaintance Roger Casement, \"was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress, a dominant idea in Europe from the Renaissance to the Great War, to attack the hypocritical justification of colonialism and to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa.\" Likewise, E.D. Morel, who led international opposition to King Leopold II's rule in the Congo, saw Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" as a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as \"the most powerful thing written on the subject.\" More recently, Nidesh Lawtoo complicated the race debate by showing that Conrad's images of \"frenzy\" depict rituals of \"possession trance\" that are equally central to Achebe's \"Things Fall Apart\".\nConrad scholar Peter Firchow writes that \"nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators, personified or otherwise, claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference.\" If Conrad or his novel is racist, it is only in a weak sense, since \"Heart of Darkness\" acknowledges racial distinctions \"but does not suggest an essential superiority\" of any group. Achebe's reading of \"Heart of Darkness\" can be (and has been) challenged by a reading of Conrad's other African story, \"An Outpost of Progress\", which has an omniscient narrator, rather than the embodied narrator, Marlow. Some younger scholars, such as Masood Ashraf Raja, have also suggested that if we read Conrad beyond \"Heart of Darkness\", especially his Malay novels, racism can be further complicated by foregrounding Conrad's positive representation of Muslims.\nIn 1998 H.S. Zins wrote in \"Pula: Botswana Journal of African Studies\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Conrad made English literature more mature and reflective because he called attention to the sheer horror of political realities overlooked by English citizens and politicians. The case of Poland, his oppressed homeland, was one such issue. The colonial exploitation of Africans was another. His condemnation of imperialism and colonialism, combined with sympathy for its persecuted and suffering victims, was drawn from his Polish background, his own personal sufferings, and the experience of a persecuted people living under foreign occupation. Personal memories created in him a great sensitivity for human degradation and a sense of moral responsibility.\"\nAdam Hochschild makes a similar point:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What gave [Conrad] such a rare ability to see the arrogance and theft at the heart of imperialism?... Much of it surely had to do with the fact that he himself, as a Pole, knew what it was like to live in conquered territory... [F]or the first few years of his life, tens of millions of peasants in the Russian empire were the equivalent of slave laborers: serfs.\nConrad's poet father, Apollo Korzeniowski, was a Polish nationalist and an opponent of serfdom... [The] boy [Konrad] grew up among exiled prison veterans, talk of serfdom, and the news of relatives killed in uprisings [and he] was ready to distrust imperial conquerors who claimed they had the right to rule other peoples.\nConrad's experience in the Belgian-run Congo made him one of the fiercest critics of the \"white man's mission\". It was also, writes Najder, Conrad's most daring and last \"attempt to become a \"homo socialis\", a cog in the mechanism of society. By accepting the job in the trading company, he joined, for once in his life, an organized, large-scale group activity on land. [...] It is not accidental that the Congo expedition remained an isolated event in Conrad's life. Until his death he remained a recluse in the social sense and never became involved with any institution or clearly defined group of people.\"\nCitizenship.\nConrad was a Russian subject, having been born in the Russian part of what had once been the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. After his father's death, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski had attempted to secure Austrian citizenship for him\u2014to no avail, probably because Conrad had not received permission from Russian authorities to remain abroad permanently and had not been released from being a Russian subject. Conrad could not return to the Russian Empire\u2014he would have been liable to many years of military service and, as the son of political exiles, to harassment.\nIn a letter of 9 August 1877, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski broached two important subjects: the desirability of Conrad's naturalisation abroad (tantamount to release from being a Russian subject) and Conrad's plans to join the British merchant marine. \"[D]o you speak English?... I never wished you to become naturalized in France, mainly because of the compulsory military service... I thought, however, of your getting naturalized in Switzerland...\" In his next letter, Bobrowski supported Conrad's idea of seeking citizenship of the United States or of \"one of the more important Southern [American] Republics\".\nEventually Conrad would make his home in England. On 2 July 1886 he applied for British nationality, which was granted on 19 August 1886. Yet, in spite of having become a subject of Queen Victoria, Conrad had not ceased to be a subject of Tsar Alexander III. To achieve his freedom from that subjection, he had to make many visits to the Russian Embassy in London and politely reiterate his request. He would later recall the Embassy's home at Belgrave Square in his novel \"The Secret Agent\". Finally, on 2 April 1889, the Russian Ministry of Home Affairs released \"the son of a Polish man of letters, captain of the British merchant marine\" from the status of Russian subject.\nMemorials.\nAn anchor-shaped monument to Conrad at Gdynia, on Poland's Baltic Seacoast, features a quotation from him in Polish: \"Nic tak nie n\u0119ci, nie rozczarowuje i nie zniewala, jak \u017cycie na morzu\" (\"[T]here is nothing more enticing, disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea\" \u2013 ).\nIn Circular Quay, Sydney, Australia, a plaque in a \"writers walk\" commemorates Conrad's visits to Australia between 1879 and 1892. The plaque notes that \"Many of his works reflect his 'affection for that young continent.'\"\nIn San Francisco in 1979, a small triangular square at Columbus Avenue and Beach Street, near Fisherman's Wharf, was dedicated as \"Joseph Conrad Square\" after Conrad. The square's dedication was timed to coincide with the release of Francis Ford Coppola's \"Heart of Darkness\"-inspired film, \"Apocalypse Now\". Conrad does not appear to have ever visited San Francisco.\nIn the latter part of World War II, the Royal Navy cruiser \"HMS Danae\" was rechristened ORP \"Conrad\" and served as part of the Polish Navy.\nNotwithstanding the undoubted sufferings that Conrad endured on many of his voyages, sentimentality and canny marketing place him at the best lodgings in several of his destinations. Hotels across the Far East still lay claim to him as an honoured guest, with, however, no evidence to back their claims: Singapore's Raffles Hotel continues to claim he stayed there though he lodged, in fact, at the Sailors' Home nearby. His visit to Bangkok also remains in that city's collective memory, and is recorded in the official history of The Oriental Hotel (where he never, in fact, stayed, lodging aboard his ship, the \"Otago\") along with that of a less well-behaved guest, Somerset Maugham, who pilloried the hotel in a short story in revenge for attempts to eject him.\nA plaque commemorating \"Joseph Conrad\u2013Korzeniowski\" has been installed near Singapore's Fullerton Hotel.\nConrad is also reported to have stayed at Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel\u2014at a port that, in fact, he never visited. Later literary admirers, notably Graham Greene, followed closely in his footsteps, sometimes requesting the same room and perpetuating myths that have no basis in fact. No Caribbean resort is yet known to have claimed Conrad's patronage, although he is believed to have stayed at a Fort-de-France \"pension\" upon arrival in Martinique on his first voyage, in 1875, when he travelled as a passenger on the \"Mont Blanc\".\nIn April 2013, a monument to Conrad was unveiled in the Russian town of Vologda, where he and his parents lived in exile in 1862\u201363. The monument was removed, with unclear explanation, in June 2016.\nLegacy.\nConrad is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language. After the publication of \"Chance\" in 1913, he was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship, and his circle of friends, which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications, included authors and other leading lights in the arts, such as Henry James, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, John Galsworthy, Galsworthy's wife Ada Galsworthy (translator of French literature), Edward Garnett, Garnett's wife Constance Garnett (translator of Russian literature), Stephen Crane, Hugh Walpole, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells (whom Conrad dubbed \"the historian of the ages to come\"), Arnold Bennett, Norman Douglas, Jacob Epstein, T. E. Lawrence, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Maurice Ravel, Valery Larbaud, Saint-John Perse, Edith Wharton, James Huneker, anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski, J\u00f3zef Retinger (later a founder of the European Movement, which led to the European Union, and author of \"Conrad and His Contemporaries\"). In the early 1900s Conrad composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford.\nIn 1919 and 1922 Conrad's growing renown and prestige among writers and critics in continental Europe fostered his hopes for a Nobel Prize in Literature. It was apparently the French and Swedes\u2014not the English\u2014who favoured Conrad's candidacy.\nIn April 1924 Conrad, who possessed a hereditary Polish status of nobility and coat-of-arms (\"Na\u0142\u0119cz\"), declined a (non-hereditary) British knighthood offered by Labour Party Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Conrad kept a distance from official structures\u2014he never voted in British national elections\u2014and seems to have been averse to public honours generally; he had already refused honorary degrees from Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Yale universities.\nIn the Polish People's Republic, translations of Conrad's works were openly published, except for \"Under Western Eyes\", which in the 1980s was published as an underground \"bibu\u0142a\".\nConrad's narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors, including T. S. Eliot, Maria D\u0105browska, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Gerald Basil Edwards, Ernest Hemingway, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, George Orwell, Graham Greene, William Golding, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Peter Matthiessen, John le Carr\u00e9, V. S. Naipaul, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, Thomas Pynchon J. M. Coetzee, and Salman Rushdie. Many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, Conrad's works.\nImpressions.\nA portrait of Conrad, aged about 46, was drawn by the historian and poet Henry Newbolt, who met him about 1903:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One thing struck me at once\u2014the extraordinary difference between his expression in profile and when looked at full face. [W]hile the profile was aquiline and commanding, in the front view the broad brow, wide-apart eyes and full lips produced the effect of an intellectual calm and even at times of a dreaming philosophy. Then [a]s we sat in our little half-circle round the fire, and talked on anything and everything, I saw a third Conrad emerge\u2014an artistic self, sensitive and restless to the last degree. The more he talked the more quickly he consumed his cigarettes... And presently, when I asked him why he was leaving London after... only two days, he replied that... the crowd in the streets... terrified him. \"Terrified? By that dull stream of obliterated faces?\" He leaned forward with both hands raised and clenched. \"Yes, terrified: I see their personalities all leaping out at me like \"tigers\"!\" He acted the tiger well enough almost to terrify his hearers: but the moment after he was talking again wisely and soberly as if he were an average Englishman with not an irritable nerve in his body.\nOn 12 October 1912, American music critic James Huneker visited Conrad and later recalled being received by \"a man of the world, neither sailor nor novelist, just a simple-mannered gentleman, whose welcome was sincere, whose glance was veiled, at times far-away, whose ways were French, Polish, anything but 'literary,' bluff or English.\"\nAfter respective separate visits to Conrad in August and September 1913, two British aristocrats, the socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell and the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell\u2014who were lovers at the time\u2014recorded their impressions of the novelist. In her diary, Morrell wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I found Conrad himself standing at the door of the house ready to receive me... [His] appearance was really that of a Polish nobleman. His manner was perfect, almost too elaborate; so nervous and sympathetic that every fibre of him seemed electric... He talked English with a strong accent, as if he tasted his words in his mouth before pronouncing them; but he talked extremely well, though he had always the talk and manner of a foreigner... He was dressed very carefully in a blue double-breasted jacket. He talked... apparently with great freedom about his life\u2014more ease and freedom indeed than an Englishman would have allowed himself. He spoke of the horrors of the Congo, from the moral and physical shock of which he said he had never recovered... [His wife Jessie] seemed a nice and good-looking fat creature, an excellent cook, ... a good and reposeful mattress for this hypersensitive, nerve-wracked man, who did not ask from his wife high intelligence, only an assuagement of life's vibrations... He made me feel so natural and very much myself, that I was almost afraid of losing the thrill and wonder of being there, although I was vibrating with intense excitement inside ... His eyes under their pent-house lids revealed the suffering and the intensity of his experiences; when he spoke of his work, there came over them a sort of misty, sensuous, dreamy look, but they seemed to hold deep down the ghosts of old adventures and experiences\u2014once or twice there was something in them one almost suspected of being wicked... But then I believe whatever strange wickedness would tempt this super-subtle Pole, he would be held in restraint by an equally delicate sense of honour... In his talk he led me along many paths of his life, but I felt that he did not wish to explore the jungle of emotions that lay dense on either side, and that his apparent frankness had a great reserve. \nA month later, Bertrand Russell visited Conrad at Capel House in Orlestone, and the same day on the train wrote down his impressions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was \"wonderful\"\u2014I \"loved\" him &amp; I think he liked me. He talked a great deal about his work &amp; life &amp; aims, &amp; about other writers... Then we went for a little walk, &amp; somehow grew very intimate. I plucked up courage to tell him what I find in his work\u2014the boring down into things to get to the very bottom below the apparent facts. He seemed to feel I had understood him; then I stopped &amp; we just looked into each other's eyes for some time, &amp; then he said he had grown to wish he could live on the surface and write differently, that he had grown frightened. His eyes at the moment expressed the inward pain &amp; terror that one feels him always fighting... Then he talked a lot about Poland, &amp; showed me an album of family photographs of the [18]60's\u2014spoke about how dream-like all that seems, &amp; how he sometimes feels he ought not to have had any children, because they have no roots or traditions or relations.\nRussell's \"Autobiography\", published over half a century later in 1968, confirms his original experience:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My first impression was one of surprise. He spoke English with a very strong foreign accent, and nothing in his demeanour in any way suggested the sea. He was an aristocratic Polish gentleman to his fingertips... At our very first meeting, we talked with continually increasing intimacy. We seemed to sink through layer after layer of what was superficial, till gradually both reached the central fire. It was an experience unlike any other... I have known. We looked into each other's eyes, half appalled and half intoxicated to find ourselves together in such a region. The emotion was as intense as passionate love, and at the same time all-embracing. I came away bewildered, and hardly able to find my way among ordinary affairs.\nIt was not only Anglophones who remarked Conrad's strong foreign accent when speaking English. After French poet Paul Val\u00e9ry and French composer Maurice Ravel made Conrad's acquaintance in December 1922, Val\u00e9ry wrote in 1924 of having been astonished at Conrad's \"horrible\" accent in English.\nThe subsequent friendship and correspondence between Conrad and Russell lasted, with long intervals, to the end of Conrad's life. Notably, Russell made Conrad the godfather to his first child, John Conrad, and named his second child Conrad Sebastian Robert. In one letter, Conrad avowed his \"deep admiring affection, which, if you were never to see me again and forget my existence tomorrow will be unalterably yours \"\".\" Conrad in his correspondence often used the Latin expression meaning \"to the very end\", which he seems to have adopted from his faithful guardian, mentor and benefactor, his maternal uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski.\nConrad was less optimistic than Russell about the possibilities of scientific and philosophical knowledge. In a 1913 letter to acquaintances who had invited Conrad to join their society, he reiterated his belief that it was impossible to understand the essence of either reality or life: both science and art penetrate no further than the outer shapes.\nNajder describes Conrad as \"[a]n alienated \u00e9migr\u00e9... haunted by a sense of the unreality of other people \u2013 a feeling natural to someone living outside the established structures of family, social milieu, and country\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Throughout almost his entire life Conrad was an outsider and felt himself to be one. An outsider in exile; an outsider during his visits to his family in... Poland; an outsider\u2014because of his experiences and bereavement\u2014in [Krak\u00f3w] and Lw\u00f3w; an outsider in Marseilles; an outsider, nationally and culturally, on British ships; an outsider as an English writer.\nConrad's sense of loneliness throughout his life in exile found memorable expression in the 1901 short story \"Amy Foster\".\nWorks.\nNovels.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdaptations.\nA number of works in various genres and media have been based on, or inspired by, Conrad's writings, including:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nSources\nPortals and biographies\nLiterary criticism\nMiscellanea\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Return to top of page."}
{"id": "15824", "revid": "38001712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15824", "title": "John Updike", "text": "American writer (1932\u20132009)\nJohn Hoyer Updike (March 18, 1932 \u2013 January 27, 2009) was an American novelist, poet, short-story writer, art critic, and literary critic. One of only four writers to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction more than once (the others being Booth Tarkington, William Faulkner, and Colson Whitehead), Updike published more than twenty novels, more than a dozen short-story collections, as well as poetry, art and literary criticism and children's books during his career.\nHundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in \"The New Yorker\" starting in 1954. He also wrote regularly for \"The New York Review of Books\". His most famous work is his \"Rabbit\" series (the novels \"Rabbit, Run\"; \"Rabbit Redux\"; \"Rabbit Is Rich\"; \"Rabbit at Rest\"; and the novella \"Rabbit Remembered\"), which chronicles the life of the middle-class everyman Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom over the course of several decades, from young adulthood to death. Both \"Rabbit Is Rich\" (1981) and \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1990) were awarded the Pulitzer Prize.\nDescribing his subject as \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", critics recognized his careful craftsmanship, his unique prose style, and his prolific output\u00a0\u2013 a book a year on average. Updike populated his fiction with characters who \"frequently experience personal turmoil and must respond to crises relating to religion, family obligations, and marital infidelity\".\nHis fiction is distinguished by its attention to the concerns, passions, and suffering of average Americans, its emphasis on Christian theology, and its preoccupation with sexuality and sensual detail. His work has attracted significant critical attention and praise, and he is widely considered one of the great American writers of his time. Updike's highly distinctive prose style features a rich, unusual, sometimes arcane vocabulary as conveyed through the eyes of \"a wry, intelligent authorial voice that describes the physical world extravagantly while remaining squarely in the realist tradition\". He described his style as an attempt \"to give the mundane its beautiful due\".\nEarly life and education.\nUpdike was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the only child of Linda Grace (n\u00e9e Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised at his childhood home in the nearby small town of Shillington. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's attempts to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. \"One of my earliest memories\", he later recalled, \"is of seeing her at her desk ... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper. And I remember the brown envelopes that stories would go off in\u2014and come back in.\"\nThese early years in Berks County, Pennsylvania, would influence the environment of the Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, as well as many of his early novels and short stories. Updike graduated from Shillington High School as co-valedictorian and class president in 1950 and received a full scholarship to Harvard University, where he was the roommate of Christopher Lasch during their first year. Updike had already received recognition for his writing as a teenager by winning a Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Award, and at Harvard he soon became well known among his classmates as a talented and prolific contributor to \"The Harvard Lampoon\", of which he was president. He studied with dramatist Robert Chapman, the director of Harvard's Loeb Drama Center. He graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1954 with a degree in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\nUpon graduation, Updike attended the Ruskin School of Art at the University of Oxford with the ambition of becoming a cartoonist. After returning to the United States, Updike and his family moved to New York, where he became a regular contributor to \"The New Yorker\". This was the beginning of his professional writing career.\nCareer as a writer.\n1950s.\nUpdike stayed at \"The New Yorker\" as a full staff writer for only two years, writing \"Talk of the Town\" columns and submitting poetry and short stories to the magazine. In New York, Updike wrote the poems and stories that came to fill his early books like \"The Carpentered Hen\" (1958) and \"The Same Door\" (1959). These works were influenced by Updike's early engagement with \"The New Yorker\". This early work also featured the influence of J. D. Salinger (\"A&amp;P\"); John Cheever (\"Snowing in Greenwich Village\"); and the Modernists Marcel Proust, Henry Green, James Joyce, and Vladimir Nabokov.\nDuring this time, Updike underwent a profound spiritual crisis. Suffering from a loss of religious faith, he began reading S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and the theologian Karl Barth. Both deeply influenced his own religious beliefs, which in turn figured prominently in his fiction. He believed in Christianity for the remainder of his life. Updike said, \"As to critics, it seems to be my fate to disappoint my theological friends by not being Christian enough, while I'm too Christian for Harold Bloom's blessing. So be it.\"\n1960s\u20131970s.\nLater, Updike and his family relocated to Ipswich, Massachusetts. Many commentators, including a columnist in the local \"Ipswich Chronicle\", asserted that the fictional town of Tarbox in \"Couples\" was based on Ipswich. Updike denied the suggestion in a letter to the paper. Impressions of Updike's day-to-day life in Ipswich during the 1960s and 1970s are included in a letter to the same paper published soon after Updike's death and written by a friend and contemporary. In Ipswich, Updike wrote \"Rabbit, Run\" (1960), on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and \"The Centaur\" (1963), two of his most acclaimed and famous works; the latter won the National Book Award.\n\"Rabbit, Run\" featured Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom, a former high school basketball star and middle-class paragon who would become Updike's most enduring and critically acclaimed character. Updike wrote three additional novels about him. \"Rabbit, Run\" was featured in \"Time\"'s All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels.\nShort stories.\nUpdike's career and reputation were nurtured and expanded by his long association with \"The New Yorker\", which published him frequently throughout his career, despite the fact that he had departed the magazine's employment after only two years. Updike's memoir indicates that he stayed in his \"corner of New England to give its domestic news\" with a focus on the American home from the point of view of a male writer. Updike's contract with the magazine gave it right of first offer for his short-story manuscripts, but William Shawn, \"The New Yorker\"'s editor from 1952 to 1987, rejected several as too explicit.\nThe Maple short stories, collected in \"Too Far To Go\" (1979), reflected the ebb and flow of Updike's first marriage; \"Separating\" (1974) and \"Here Come the Maples\" (1976) related to his divorce. These stories also reflect the role of alcohol in 1970s America. They were the basis for the television movie also called \"Too Far To Go\", broadcast by NBC in 1979.\nUpdike's short stories were collected in several volumes published by Alfred A. Knopf over five decades. In 2013, the Library of America issued a two-volume boxed edition of 186 stories under the title \"The Collected Stories\".\nNovels.\nIn 1971, Updike published a sequel to \"Rabbit, Run\" called \"Rabbit Redux\", his response to the 1960s; Rabbit reflected much of Updike's resentment and hostility towards the social and political changes that beset the United States during that time.\nUpdike's early Olinger period was set in the Pennsylvania of his youth; it ended around 1965 with the lyrical \"Of the Farm\".\nAfter his early novels, Updike became most famous for his chronicling infidelity, adultery, and marital unrest, especially in suburban America; and for his controversial depiction of the confusion and freedom inherent in this breakdown of social mores. He once wrote that it was \"a subject which, if I have not exhausted, has exhausted me\". The most prominent of Updike's novels in this vein is \"Couples\" (1968), about adultery in a fictional Massachusetts town. It garnered Updike an appearance on the cover of \"Time\" magazine with the headline \"The Adulterous Society\". \"Time\"'s article and the novel contributed to national concern about whether U.S. society was abandoning its standards of conduct in sexual matters.\n\"The Coup\" (1978), a lauded novel about an African dictatorship inspired by a visit he made to Africa, found Updike working in new territory.\n1980s\u20132000s.\nIn 1980, he published another novel featuring Harry Angstrom, \"Rabbit Is Rich\", which won the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction\u2014all three major American literary prizes. The novel found \"Rabbit the fat and happy owner of a Toyota dealership\". Updike found it difficult to end the book, because he was \"having so much fun\" in the imaginary county Rabbit and his family inhabited.\nAfter writing \"Rabbit Is Rich\", Updike published \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984), a playful novel about witches living in Rhode Island. He described it as an attempt to \"make things right with my, what shall we call them, feminist detractors\". One of Updike's most popular novels, it was adapted as a film and included on Harold Bloom's list of canonical 20th-century literature (in \"The Western Canon\"). In 2008 Updike published \"The Widows of Eastwick\", a return to the witches in their old age. It was his last published novel.\nIn 1986, he published the unconventional \"Roger's Version\", the second volume of the so-called \"Scarlet Letter\" trilogy, about an attempt to prove God's existence using a computer program. Author and critic Martin Amis called it a \"near-masterpiece\". The novel \"S.\" (1989), uncharacteristically featuring a female protagonist, concluded Updike's reworking of Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\".\nUpdike enjoyed working in series; in addition to the Rabbit novels and the Maples stories, a recurrent Updike alter ego is the moderately well-known, unprolific Jewish novelist and eventual Nobel laureate Henry Bech, chronicled in three comic short-story cycles: \"Bech, a Book\" (1970), \"Bech Is Back\" (1981) and \"Bech at Bay: A Quasi-Novel\" (1998). These stories were compiled as \"The Complete Henry Bech\" (2001) by Everyman's Library. Bech is a comical and self-conscious antithesis of Updike's own literary persona: Jewish, a World War II veteran, reclusive, and unprolific to a fault.\nIn 1990, he published the last Rabbit novel, \"Rabbit at Rest\", which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Over 500 pages long, the novel is among Updike's most celebrated. In 2000, Updike included the novella \"Rabbit Remembered\" in his collection \"Licks of Love\", drawing the Rabbit saga to a close. His Pulitzers for the last two Rabbit novels make Updike one of only four writers to have won two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, the others being William Faulkner, Booth Tarkington, and Colson Whitehead.\nIn 1995, Everyman's Library collected and canonized the four novels as the omnibus \"Rabbit Angstrom\"; Updike wrote an introduction in which he described Rabbit as \"a ticket to the America all around me. What I saw through Rabbit's eyes was more worth telling than what I saw through my own, though the difference was often slight.\" Updike later called Rabbit \"a brother to me, and a good friend. He opened me up as a writer.\"\nAfter the publication of \"Rabbit at Rest\", Updike spent the rest of the 1990s and early 2000s publishing novels in a wide range of genres; the work of this period was frequently experimental in nature. These styles included the historical fiction of \"Memories of the Ford Administration\" (1992), the magical realism of \"Brazil\" (1994), the science fiction of \"Toward the End of Time\" (1997), the postmodernism of \"Gertrude and Claudius\" (2000), and the experimental fiction of \"Seek My Face\" (2002).\nIn the midst of these, he wrote what was for him a more conventional novel, \"In the Beauty of the Lilies\" (1996), a historical saga spanning several generations and exploring themes of religion and cinema in America. It is considered the most successful novel of Updike's late career. Some critics have predicted that posterity may consider the novel a \"late masterpiece overlooked or praised by rote in its day, only to be rediscovered by another generation\", while others, though appreciating the English mastery in the book, thought it overly dense with minute detail and swamped by its scenic depictions and spiritual malaise. In \"Villages\" (2004), Updike returned to the familiar territory of infidelities in New England. His 22nd novel, \"Terrorist\" (2006), the story of a fervent young extremist Muslim in New Jersey, garnered media attention but little critical praise.\nIn 2003, Updike published \"\", a large collection of his short fiction spanning the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. More than 800 pages long, with over one hundred stories, it has been called \"a richly episodic and lyrical \"Bildungsroman\" ... in which Updike traces the trajectory from adolescence, college, married life, fatherhood, separation and divorce\". It won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 2004. This lengthy volume nevertheless excluded several stories found in his short-story collections of the same period.\nUpdike worked in a wide array of genres, including fiction, poetry (most of it compiled in \"Collected Poems: 1953\u20131993\", 1993), essays (collected in nine separate volumes), a play (\"Buchanan Dying\", 1974), and a memoir (\"Self-Consciousness\", 1989).\nAt the end of his life, Updike was working on a novel about St. Paul and early Christianity.\nPersonal life.\nBiographer Adam Begley wrote that Updike \"transmuted the minutiae of his life\" in prose, which enriched his readers at the cost of being \"willing to sacrifice the happiness of people around him for his art\".\nIn 1953, while a student at Harvard, Updike married Mary Entwistle Pennington, an art student at Radcliffe College and daughter of a prominent Unitarian minister. She accompanied him to Oxford, England, where she attended art school and their first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1955. The couple had three more children together: David (born 1957), Michael (born 1959), and Miranda (born 1960).\nUpdike was a lifelong Democrat. He endorsed Barack Obama in 2008.\nUpdike was serially unfaithful, and eventually left the marriage in 1974 for Martha Ruggles Bernhard. In 1977, Updike and Bernhard married. In 1982, his first wife married an MIT academic. Updike and Bernhard lived for more than 30 years in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. Updike had three stepsons through Bernhard.\nDeath.\nUpdike died of lung cancer at a hospice in Danvers, Massachusetts, on January 27, 2009, at age 76. He was survived by his wife, his four children, three stepsons, his first wife, and seven grandchildren and seven step-grandchildren.\nPoetry.\nUpdike published eight volumes of poetry over his career, including his first book \"The Carpentered Hen\" (1958), and one of his last, the posthumous \"Endpoint\" (2009). The \"New Yorker\" published excerpts of \"Endpoint\" in its March 16, 2009 issue. Much of Updike's poetical output was recollected in Knopf's \"Collected Poems\" (1993). He wrote that \"I began as a writer of light verse, and have tried to carry over into my serious or lyric verse something of the strictness and liveliness of the lesser form.\" The poet Thomas M. Disch noted that because Updike was such a well-known novelist, his poetry \"could be mistaken as a hobby or a foible\"; Disch saw Updike's light verse instead as a poetry of \"epigrammatical lucidity\". His poetry has been praised for its engagement with \"a variety of forms and topics\", its \"wit and precision\", and for its depiction of topics familiar to American readers.\nBritish poet Gavin Ewart praised Updike for the metaphysical quality of his poetry and for his ability \"to make the ordinary seem strange\", and called him one of the few modern novelists capable of writing good poetry. Reading \"Endpoint\" aloud, the critic Charles McGrath claimed that he found \"another, deeper music\" in Updike's poetry, finding that Updike's wordplay \"smooths and elides itself\" and has many subtle \"sound effects\". John Keenan, who praised the collection \"Endpoint\" as \"beautiful and poignant\", noted that his poetry's engagement with \"the everyday world in a technically accomplished manner seems to count against him\".\nLiterary criticism and art criticism.\nUpdike was also a critic of literature and art, one frequently cited as one of the best American critics of his generation. In the introduction to \"Picked-Up Pieces,\" his 1975 collection of prose, he listed his personal rules for literary criticism:\nTo these concrete five might be added a vaguer sixth, having to do with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, never\u00a0... try to put the author \"in his place,\" making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.\nHe reviewed \"nearly every major writer of the 20th century and some 19th-century authors\", typically in \"The New Yorker\", always trying to make his reviews \"animated\". He also championed young writers, comparing them to his own literary heroes including Vladimir Nabokov and Marcel Proust. Good reviews from Updike were often seen as a significant achievement in terms of literary reputation and even sales; some of his positive reviews helped jump-start the careers of such younger writers as Erica Jong, Thomas Mallon and Jonathan Safran Foer.\nBad reviews by Updike sometimes caused controversy. In 2008, he gave a \"damning\" review of Toni Morrison's novel \"A Mercy\", and in 1999 he criticized Alan Hollinghurst's novels for being \"relentlessly gay in their personnel\". In response to criticism of the latter remark, he said: \"I\u2019d be happy not to discuss [homosexuality]. Hollinghurst made it kind of tough.\"\nUpdike was praised for his literary criticism's conventional simplicity and profundity, for being an aestheticist critic who saw literature on its own terms, and for his longtime commitment to the practice of literary criticism.\nMuch of Updike's art criticism appeared in \"The New York Review of Books\", where he often wrote about American art. His art criticism involved an aestheticism like that of his literary criticism.\nUpdike's 2008 Jefferson Lecture, \"The Clarity of Things: What's American About American Art?\", dealt with the uniqueness of American art from the 18th century to the 20th. In the lecture he argued that American art, until the expressionist movement of the 20th century in which America declared its artistic \"independence\", is characterized by an insecurity not found in the artistic tradition of Europe.\nIn Updike's own words:\nTwo centuries after Jonathan Edwards sought a link with the divine in the beautiful clarity of things, William Carlos Williams wrote in introducing his long poem \"Paterson\" that \"for the poet there are no ideas but in things.\" \"No ideas but in things.\" The American artist, first born into a continent without museums and art schools, took Nature as his only instructor, and things as his principal study. A bias toward the empirical, toward the evidential object in the numinous fullness of its being, leads to a certain lininess, as the artist intently maps the visible in a New World that feels surrounded by chaos and emptiness.\nCritical reputation and style.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe is certainly one of the great American novelists of the 20th century.\n \u2014Martin Amis\nUpdike is considered one of the greatest American fiction writers of his generation. He was widely praised as America's \"last true man of letters\", with an immense and far-reaching influence on many writers. The excellence of his prose style is acknowledged even by critics skeptical of other aspects of Updike's work.\nSeveral scholars have called attention to the importance of place, and especially of southeast Pennsylvania, in Updike's life and work. Bob Batchelor has described \"Updike's Pennsylvania sensibility\" as one with profound reaches that transcend time and place, such that in his writing, he used \"Pennsylvania as a character\" that went beyond geographic or political boundaries. SA Zylstra has compared Updike's Pennsylvania to Faulkner's Mississippi: \"As with the Mississippi of Faulkner's novels, the world of Updike's novels is fictional (as are such towns as Olinger and Brewer), while at the same time it is recognizable as a particular American region.\" Sanford Pinsker observes that \"Updike always felt a bit out of place\" in places like \"Ipswich, Massachusetts, where he lived for most of his life. In his heart\u2014and, more important, in his imagination\u2014Updike remained a staunchly Pennsylvania boy.\" Similarly, Sylvie Math\u00e9 maintains that \"Updike's most memorable legacy appears to be his homage to Pennsylvania.\"\nCritics emphasize his \"inimitable prose style\" and \"rich description and language\", often favorably compared to Proust and Nabokov. Some critics consider the fluency of his prose to be a fault, questioning the intellectual depth and thematic seriousness of his work given the polish of his language and the perceived lightness of his themes, while others criticized Updike for misogynistic depictions of women and sexual relationships.\nOther critics argue that Updike's \"dense vocabulary and syntax functions as a distancing technique to mediate the intellectual and emotional involvement of the reader\". On the whole, however, Updike is extremely well regarded as a writer who mastered many genres, wrote with intellectual vigor and a powerful prose style, with \"shrewd insight into the sorrows, frustrations, and banality of American life\".\nUpdike's character Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom, the protagonist of the series of novels widely considered his \"magnum opus\", has been said to have \"entered the pantheon of signal American literary figures\", along with Huckleberry Finn, Jay Gatsby, Holden Caulfield and others. A 2002 list by \"Book\" magazine of the 100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 listed Rabbit in the top five. The Rabbit novels, the Henry Bech stories, and the Maples stories have been canonized by Everyman's Library.\nAfter Updike's death, Harvard's Houghton Library acquired his papers, manuscripts, and letters, naming the collection the John Updike Archive. 2009 also saw the founding of the John Updike Society, a group of scholars dedicated to \"awakening and sustaining reader interest in the literature and life of John Updike, promoting literature written by Updike, and fostering and encouraging critical responses to Updike's literary works\". The Society will begin publishing \"The John Updike Review\", a journal of critical scholarship in the field of Updike studies. The John Updike Society First Biennial Conference took place in 2010 at Alvernia University.\nEulogizing Updike in January 2009, the British novelist Ian McEwan wrote that Updike's \"literary schemes and pretty conceits touched at points on the Shakespearean\", and that Updike's death marked \"the end of the golden age of the American novel in the 20th century's second half\".\nMcEwan said the Rabbit series is Updike's \"masterpiece and will surely be his monument\", and concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Updike is a master of effortless motion\u2014between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.\nThis is at the heart of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an exercise in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, \"and not chop them down to what you think is the right size.\"\nJonathan Raban, highlighting many of the virtues that have been ascribed to Updike's prose, called \"Rabbit at Rest\" \"one of the very few modern novels in English\u00a0... that one can set beside the work of Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Joyce, and not feel the draft\u00a0... It is a book that works by a steady accumulation of a mass of brilliant details, of shades and nuances, of the byplay between one sentence and the next, and no short review can properly honor its intricacy and richness.\"\nThe novelist Philip Roth, considered one of Updike's chief literary rivals, wrote, \"John Updike is our time's greatest man of letters, as brilliant a literary critic and essayist as he was a novelist and short story writer. He is and always will be no less a national treasure than his 19th-century precursor, Nathaniel Hawthorne.\"\nThe noted critic James Wood called Updike \"a prose writer of great beauty, but that prose confronts one with the question of whether beauty is enough, and whether beauty always conveys all that a novelist must convey\". In a review of \"Licks of Love\" (2001), Wood concluded that Updike's \"prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons\" but that there often exists in his work a \"hard, coarse, primitive, misogynistic worldview\". Wood both praised and criticized Updike's language for having \"an essayistic saunter; the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics, and hovers slightly above its subjects, generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract\". According to Wood, Updike is capable of writing \"the perfect sentence\" and his style is characterized by a \"delicate deferral\" of the sentence. Of the beauty of Updike's language and his faith in the power of language that floats above reality, Wood wrote:\nFor some time now Updike's language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer. Updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss. For all his fabled Protestantism, both American Puritan and Lutheran-Barthian, with its cold glitter, its insistence on the aching gap between God and His creatures, Updike seems less like Hawthorne than Balzac, in his unstopping and limitless energy, and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued; the very form of the Rabbit books\u2014here extended a further instance\u2014suggests continuance. Updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail us\u2014'life's gallant, battered ongoingness ', indeed\u2014and part of the difficulty he has run into, late in his career, is that he shows no willingness, verbally, to acknowledge silence, failure, interruption, loss of faith, despair and so on. Supremely, better than almost any other contemporary writer, he can always describe these feelings and states; but they are not inscribed in the language itself. Updike's language, for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse, testifies instead to its own uncanny success: to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season.\nIn direct contrast to Wood's evaluation, the Oxford critic Thomas Karshan asserted that Updike is \"intensely intellectual\", with a style that constitutes his \"manner of thought\" not merely \"a set of dainty curlicues\". Karshan calls Updike an inheritor of the \"traditional role of the epic writer\". According to Karshan, \"Updike's writing picks up one voice, joins its cadence, and moves on to another, like Rabbit himself, driving south through radio zones on his flight away from his wife and child.\"\nDisagreeing with Wood's critique of Updike's alleged over-stylization, Karshan evaluates Updike's language as convincingly naturalistic:\nUpdike's sentences at their frequent best are not a complacent expression of faith. Rather, like Proust's sentences in Updike's description, they \"seek an essence so fine the search itself is an act of faith.\" Updike aspires to \"this sense of self-qualification, the kind of timid reverence towards what exists that C\u00e9zanne shows when he grapples for the shape and shade of a fruit through a mist of delicate stabs.\" Their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles, readjust and pass on. If life is bountiful in New England, it is also evasive and easily missed. In the stories Updike tells, marriages and homes are made only to be broken. His descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world. But love is precarious, Updike is always saying, since it thrives on obstructions and makes them if it cannot find them.\nHarold Bloom once called Updike \"a minor novelist with a major style. A quite beautiful and very considerable stylist\u00a0... He specializes in the easier pleasures.\" Bloom also edited an important collection of critical essays on Updike in 1987, in which he concluded that Updike possessed a major style and was capable of writing beautiful sentences which are \"beyond praise\"; nevertheless, Bloom went on, \"the American sublime will never touch his pages\".\nOn \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in 1981, the novelist and short-story writer John Cheever was asked why he did not write book reviews and what he would say if given the chance to review \"Rabbit Is Rich\". He replied:\nThe reason I didn't review the book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My appreciation of it is that diverse and that complicated\u00a0... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is\u2014the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.\n\"The Fiction Circus\", an online and multimedia literary magazine, called Updike one of the \"four Great American Novelists\" of his time along with Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Don DeLillo, each jokingly represented as a sign of the Zodiac. Furthermore, Updike was seen as the \"best prose writer in the world\", like Nabokov before him. But in contrast to many literati and establishment obituaries, the \"Circus\" asserted that nobody \"thought of Updike as a \"vital\" writer\".\nAdam Gopnik of \"The New Yorker\" evaluated Updike as \"the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing\u00a0... He sang like Henry James, but he saw like Sinclair Lewis. The two sides of American fiction\u2014the precise, realist, encyclopedic appetite to get it all in, and the exquisite urge to make writing out of sensation rendered exactly\u2014were both alive in him.\"\nThe critic James Wolcott, in a review of Updike's last novel, \"The Widows of Eastwick\" (2008), noted that Updike's penchant for observing America's decline is coupled with an affirmation of America's ultimate merits: \"Updike elegises entropy American-style with a resigned, paternal, disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists: Don DeLillo, Gore Vidal, Philip Roth. America may have lost its looks and stature, but it was a beauty once, and worth every golden dab of sperm.\"\nGore Vidal, in a controversial essay in the \"Times Literary Supplement\", professed to have \"never taken Updike seriously as a writer\". He criticizes his political and aesthetic worldview for its \"blandness and acceptance of authority in any form\". He concludes that Updike \"describes to no purpose\". In reference to Updike's wide establishment acclaim, Vidal mockingly called him \"our good child\" and excoriated his alleged political conservatism. Vidal ultimately concluded, \"Updike's work is more and more representative of that polarizing within a state where Authority grows ever more brutal and malign while its hired hands in the media grow ever more excited as the holy war of the few against the many heats up.\"\nRobert B. Silvers, editor of \"The New York Review of Books\", called Updike \"one of the most elegant and coolly observant writers of his generation\". The short-story writer Lorrie Moore, who once called Updike \"American literature's greatest short story writer\u00a0... and arguably our greatest writer\", reviewed Updike's body of short stories in \"The New York Review\", praising their intricate detail and rich imagery: \"his eye and his prose never falter, even when the world fails to send its more socially complicated revelations directly his story's way\". In her work on Updike, Biljana Doj\u010dinovi\u0107 has argued that his short story collection \"The Afterlife and Other Stories\" is a pivotal work that demonstrates a change in his writing on feminism.\nUpdike's array of awards includes two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, two National Book Awards, three National Book Critics Circle awards, the 1989 National Medal of Arts, the 2003 National Humanities Medal, and the Rea Award for the Short Story for outstanding achievement. The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Updike to present the 2008 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. government's highest humanities honor; Updike's lecture was titled \"The Clarity of Things: What Is American about American Art\". In November 2008, the editors of the UK's \"Literary Review\" magazine awarded Updike their Bad Sex in Fiction Lifetime Achievement Award, which celebrates \"crude, tasteless or ridiculous sexual passages in modern literature\".\nThemes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAll in all this is the happiest fucking country the world has ever seen.\n \u2014Rabbit Angstrom.\nThe principal themes in Updike's work are religion, sex, America, and death. He often combined them, especially in his favored terrain of \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", of which he once said, \"I like middles. It is in middles that extremes clash, where ambiguity restlessly rules.\"\nFor example, the decline of religion in America is chronicled in \"In the Beauty of the Lilies\" (1996) alongside the history of cinema, and Rabbit Angstrom contemplates the merits of sex with the wife of his friend Reverend Jack Eccles while the latter is giving his sermon in \"Rabbit, Run\" (1960).\nCritics have often noted that Updike imbued language itself with a kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books\u2014the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories\u2014demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language. Updike's novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader, the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.\nDescribing his purpose in writing prose in the introduction to his \"Early Stories: 1953\u20131975\" (2004), Updike wrote that his aim was always \"to give the mundane its beautiful due\". Elsewhere he famously said, \"When I write, I aim my mind not towards New York City but towards a vague spot east of Kansas.\" Some have suggested that the \"best statement of Updike's aesthetic comes in his early memoir 'The Dogwood Tree'\" (1962): \"Blankness is not emptiness; we may skate upon an intense radiance we do not see because we see nothing else. And in fact there is a color, a quiet but tireless goodness that things at rest, like a brick wall or a small stone, seem to affirm.\"\nSex.\nSex in Updike's work is noted for its ubiquity and the reverence with which he described it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His contemporaries invade the ground with wild Dionysian yelps, mocking both the taboos that would make it forbidden and the lust that drives men to it. Updike can be honest about it, and his descriptions of the sight, taste and texture of women's bodies can be perfect little madrigals.\nThe critic Edward Champion notes that Updike's prose heavily favors \"external sexual imagery\" rife with \"explicit anatomical detail\" rather than descriptions of \"internal emotion\" in descriptions of sex. In Champion's interview with Updike on \"The Bat Segundo Show\", Updike replied that he perhaps favored such imagery to concretize and make sex \"real\" in his prose. Another sexual theme commonly addressed in Updike is adultery, especially in a suburban, middle class setting, most famously in \"Couples\" (1968). The Updikean narrator is often \"a man guilty of infidelity and abandonment of his family\".\nUnited States.\nSimilarly, Updike wrote about the United States with a certain nostalgia, reverence, and recognition and celebration of America's broad diversity. ZZ Packer wrote that in Updike, \"there seemed a strange ability to harken both America the Beautiful as well as America the Plain Jane, and the lovely Protestant backbone in his fiction and essays, when he decided to show it off, was as progressive and enlightened as it was unapologetic.\"\nThe Rabbit novels in particular can be viewed, according to Julian Barnes, as \"a distraction from, and a glittering confirmation of, the vast bustling ordinariness of American life\". But as Updike celebrated ordinary America, he also alluded to its decline: at times, he was \"so clearly disturbed by the downward spin of America\". Adam Gopnik concludes that \"Updike's great subject was the American attempt to fill the gap left by faith with the materials produced by mass culture. He documented how the death of a credible religious belief has been offset by sex and adultery and movies and sports and Toyotas and family love and family obligation. For Updike, this effort was blessed, and very nearly successful.\"\nUpdike's novels about America almost always contain references to political events of the time. In this sense, they are artifacts of their historical eras, showing how national leaders shape and define their times. The lives of ordinary citizens take place against this wider background.\nDeath.\nUpdike often wrote about death, his characters providing a \"mosaic of reactions\" to mortality, ranging from terror to attempts at insulation. In \"The Poorhouse Fair\" (1959), the elderly John Hook intones, \"There is no goodness without belief ... And if you have not believed, at the end of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved, to take into the next\", demonstrating a religious, metaphysical faith present in much of Updike's work.\nFor Rabbit Angstrom, with his constant musings on mortality, his near-witnessing of his daughter's death, and his often shaky faith, death is more frightening and less obvious in its ramifications. At the end of \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1990), though, Rabbit demonstrates a kind of certainty, telling his son Nelson on his deathbed, \"... But enough. Maybe. Enough.\" In \"The Centaur\" (1963), George Caldwell has no religious faith and is afraid of his cancer. Death can also be a sort of unseen terror; it \"occurs offstage but reverberates for survivors as an absent presence\".\nUpdike himself also experienced a \"crisis over the afterlife\", and indeed\nmany of his heroes shared the same sort of existential fears the author acknowledged he had suffered as a young man: Henry Bech's concern that he was 'a fleck of dust condemned to know it is a fleck of dust,' or Colonel Ellello\u00fb's lament that 'we will be forgotten, all of us forgotten.' Their fear of death threatens to make everything they do feel meaningless, and it also sends them running after God\u2014looking for some reassurance that there is something beyond the familiar, everyday world with 'its signals and buildings and cars and bricks.'\nUpdike demonstrated his own fear in some of his more personal writings, including the poem \"Perfection Wasted\" (1990):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also #External links for links to archives of his essays and reviews in \"The New Yorker\" and \"The New York Review of Books\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading and literary criticism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nInterviews\nArticles\nWorks\nPapers\n*https://"}
{"id": "15825", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15825", "title": "John Steinbeck", "text": "American writer (1902\u20131968)\nJohn Ernst Steinbeck ( ; February 27, 1902\u00a0\u2013 December 20, 1968) was an American writer. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humor and keen social perception\". He has been called \"a giant of American letters.\"\nDuring his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels \"Tortilla Flat\" (1935) and \"Cannery Row\" (1945), the multigeneration epic \"East of Eden\" (1952), and the novellas \"The Red Pony\" (1933) and \"Of Mice and Men\" (1937). The Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939) is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. By the 75th anniversary of its publishing date, it had sold 14 million copies.\nMuch of Steinbeck's work employs settings in his native central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.\nEarly life.\nSteinbeck was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, California. He was of German, English, and Irish descent. Johann Adolf Gro\u00dfsteinbeck (1828\u20131913), Steinbeck's paternal grandfather, was a founder of Mount Hope, a short-lived farming colony in Palestine that disbanded after Arab attackers killed his brother and raped his brother's wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in the United States in 1858, shortening the family name to Steinbeck. The family farm in Heiligenhaus, Mettmann, Germany, is still named \"Gro\u00dfsteinbeck\".\nHis father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862\u20131935), served as Monterey County treasurer. John's mother, Olive Hamilton (1867\u20131934), a former school teacher, shared Steinbeck's passion for reading and writing. The Steinbecks were members of the Episcopal Church, although Steinbeck later became agnostic. Steinbeck lived in a small rural valley (no more than a frontier settlement) set in fertile soil, about 25 miles from the Pacific Coast. Both valley and coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. He spent his summers working on nearby ranches including the Post Ranch in Big Sur. He later labored with migrant workers on Spreckels sugar beet farms. There he learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and the darker side of human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in \"Of Mice and Men\". He explored his surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms. While working at Spreckels Sugar Company, he sometimes worked in their laboratory, which gave him time to write. He had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things he owned.\nSteinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English literature at Stanford University near Palo Alto, leaving without a degree in 1925. He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write. When he failed to publish his work, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker at Lake Tahoe, where he met Carol Henning, his first wife. They married in January 1930 in Los Angeles, where, with friends, he attempted to make money by manufacturing plaster mannequins.\nWhen their money ran out six months later due to a slow market, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to Pacific Grove, California, to a cottage owned by his father, on the Monterey Peninsula a few blocks outside the Monterey city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing, paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928, loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the Great Depression, Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crabs that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market. Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends. Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck's novel \"Cannery Row\".\nIn 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology. Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck's attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from Warder Clyde Allee, a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on ecology. Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand. Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.\nBetween 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends. Steinbeck's wife began working at the lab as secretary-bookkeeper. Steinbeck helped on an informal basis. They formed a common bond based on their love of music and art, and John learned biology and Ricketts's ecological philosophy. When Steinbeck became emotionally upset, Ricketts sometimes played music for him.\nCareer.\nWriting.\nSteinbeck's first novel, \"Cup of Gold\", published in 1929, is loosely based on the life and death of privateer Henry Morgan. It centers on Morgan's assault and sacking of Panam\u00e1 Viejo, sometimes referred to as the \"Cup of Gold\", and on the women, brighter than the sun, who were said to be found there. In 1930, Steinbeck wrote a werewolf murder mystery, \"Murder at Full Moon\", that has never been published because Steinbeck considered it unworthy of publication.\nBetween 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck produced three shorter works. \"The Pastures of Heaven\", published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish corporal while chasing runaway Indian slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published \"The Red Pony\", a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck's childhood. \"To a God Unknown\", named after a Vedic hymn, follows the life of a homesteader and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works.\nBefore his novel \"Tortilla Flat\" (1935), Steinbeck was an obscure writer \"with little success\". Although he had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness.\nSteinbeck achieved his first critical success with \"Tortilla Flat\", a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California Commonwealth Club's gold medal. It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I, just before U.S. prohibition. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited \"spicy and comic tales about a gang of \"paisanos\", asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression.\" \"Tortilla Flat\" was adapted as a 1942 film of the same name, starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr and John Garfield, a friend of Steinbeck. With some of the proceeds, he built a summer ranch-home in Los Gatos.\nSteinbeck began to write a series of \"California novels\" and Dust Bowl fiction, set among common people during the Great Depression. These included \"In Dubious Battle\", \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\". He also wrote an article series called \"The Harvest Gypsies\" for the \"San Francisco News\" about the plight of the migrant worker.\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was a drama about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. Steinbeck, on vacations to Mexico, witnessed sold-out theater troupes with often poor and illiterate workers consisting of the audience. As such, Steinbeck chose to write \"Of Mice and Men\" with a stage play in mind. It was critically acclaimed and Steinbeck's 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a \"little masterpiece\".\nIts stage production was a hit, starring Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director George S. Kaufman that the play as it existed in his own mind was \"perfect\" and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays (\"The Moon Is Down\" and \"Burning Bright\").\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was also adapted as a 1939 Hollywood film, with Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie (he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production) and Burgess Meredith as George. Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades. Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie.\nSteinbeck followed this wave of success with \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. In August 1936, the San Francisco News asked Steinbeck to personally interview multiple families in the impoverished Hoovervilles of the San Joaquin Valley. As Steinbeck visited the slums that hugged the highways across the Central Valley, he was harrowed by what he saw. He talked with multiple families and vowed to make a book depicting their struggles. It is commonly considered his greatest work. According to \"The New York Times\", it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that month, it won the National Book Award, favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Later that year, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was adapted as a film directed by John Ford, starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad; Fonda was nominated for the best actor Academy Award. \"Grapes\" was controversial. Steinbeck's New Deal political views, negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism, and sympathy for the plight of workers, led to a backlash against the author for displaying communist views, especially in his hometown of Salinas. Steinbeck received so many threats that he purchased a handgun for his own safety. Claiming the book both was obscene and misrepresented conditions in the county, the Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries in August 1939. This ban lasted until January 1941.\nOf the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, \"The vilification of me out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by them that the Okies hate me and have threatened to kill me for lying about them. I'm frightened at the rolling might of this damned thing. It is completely out of hand; I mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy.\"\nThe then First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, already a fan of Steinbeck's work from \"Of Mice and Men\", defended Steinbeck's work in her nationally syndicated newspaper column, \"My Day\". She wrote: \"Now I must tell you that I have just finished a book which is an unforgettable experience in reading. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, both repels and attracts you. The horrors of the picture, so well drawn, make you dread sometimes to begin the next chapter, and yet you cannot lay the book down or even skip a page.\" After visiting California labor camps in 1940, a reporter asked her if she believed that \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was exaggerated. Roosevelt responded, \"I have never believed that The Grapes of Wrath was exaggerated\".\nEd Ricketts.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Ed Ricketts strongly influenced Steinbeck's writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their coauthored book, \"Sea of Cortez\" (December 1941), about a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well. However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as \"The Log from the Sea of Cortez\", under his name only (though Ricketts had written some of it). This work remains in print today.\nAlthough Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book. In 1942, after his divorce from Carol he married Gwyndolyn \"Gwyn\" Conger.\nRicketts was Steinbeck's model for the character of \"Doc\" in \"Cannery Row\" (1945) and \"Sweet Thursday\" (1954), \"Friend Ed\" in \"Burning Bright\", and characters in \"In Dubious Battle\" (1936) and \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939). Ecological themes recur in Steinbeck's novels of the period.\nSteinbeck's close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol. Ricketts's biographer Eric Enno Tamm opined that, except for \"East of Eden\" (1952), Steinbeck's writing declined after Ricketts's untimely death in 1948.\nWorld War II.\nSteinbeck's novel \"The Moon Is Down\" (1942), about the Socrates-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in Northern Europe, was made into a film almost immediately. It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and the occupiers the Germans. In 1945, Steinbeck received the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross for his literary contributions to the Norwegian resistance movement.\nIn 1943, Steinbeck served as a World War II war correspondent for the \"New York Herald Tribune\" and worked with the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the CIA). It was at that time he became friends with Will Lang Jr. of \"Time\"/\"Life\" magazine. During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s Beach Jumpers program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the Mediterranean. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and used a Thompson submachine gun to help capture Italian and German prisoners. Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary \"Once There Was a War\" (1958).\nSteinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from shrapnel and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing. He wrote Alfred Hitchcock's movie, \"Lifeboat\" (1944), and with screenwriter Jack Wagner, \"A Medal for Benny\" (1945), about paisanos from \"Tortilla Flat\" going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of \"Lifeboat,\" because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones. In 1944, bruised, battered, and homesick, Steinbeck wrote \"Cannery Row\" (1945), a love letter to the city of Monterey. In 1958, Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery Row in his honor.\nAfter the war, he wrote \"The Pearl\" (1947), knowing it would be filmed eventually. Steinbeck's relationship with Hollywood had solidified to the point where his books were being green-lit as movies as they released. The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of \"Woman's Home Companion\" magazine as \"The Pearl of the World\". It was illustrated by John Alan Maxwell. The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in \"The Log From the Sea of Cortez\", which he described in Chapter 11 as being \"so much like a parable that it almost can't be\". Steinbeck traveled to Cuernavaca, Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script; on this trip he would be inspired by the story of Emiliano Zapata, and subsequently wrote a film script (\"Viva Zapata!\") directed by Elia Kazan and starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.\nIn 1947, Steinbeck made his first trip to the Soviet Union with photographer Robert Capa. They visited Moscow, Kyiv, Tbilisi, Batumi and Stalingrad, some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, \"A Russian Journal\", was illustrated with Capa's photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nNew York.\nOver the course of 276 days in 1952, Steinbeck wrote the first draft of \"East of Eden,\" a book he considered his ultimate test as a writer. He wrote a daily letter to his editor while writing the book. Through them, Steinbeck explored himself, his creative process, his love for writing, and his family life, for he had just married his third wife, Elaine Scott, the year prior. Steinbeck, according to Elaine Scott, considered \"East of Eden\" his \"magnum opus\", his greatest novel. As the book was released, he wrote to John Beskow, a Swedish artist and a confidant of his: \"I have put all the things I have wanted to write all my life. This is 'the book'... having done this, I can do anything I want\". Also in 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of 20th Century Fox's film, \"O. Henry's Full House\". Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer O. Henry. About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for Columbia Records; the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck's deep, resonant voice.\nFollowing the success of \"Viva Zapata!\", Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on the 1955 film \"East of Eden\", James Dean's movie debut. Jack Moffitt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", in a review that appeared after the March 1955 premiere, wrote \"Beautifully acted, and superbly directed by Elia Kazan, it is bound to be one of the year\u2019s important contributions to screen literature.\"\nFrom March to October 1959, Steinbeck and his third wife Elaine rented a cottage in the hamlet of Discove, Redlynch, near Bruton in Somerset, England, while Steinbeck researched his retelling of the Arthurian legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Glastonbury Tor was visible from the cottage, and Steinbeck also visited the nearby hillfort of Cadbury Castle, the supposed site of King Arthur's court of Camelot. The unfinished manuscript was published after his death in 1976, as \"The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights\". Steinbeck grew up enthralled by the stories of King Arthur, and the Steinbecks recounted the time spent in Somerset as the happiest of their life together.\n\"\" is a travelogue of his 1960 road trip with his poodle Charley. Steinbeck bemoans his lost youth and roots, while dispensing both criticism and praise for the United States. According to Steinbeck's son Thom, Steinbeck made the journey because he knew he was dying and wanted to see the country one last time.\nSteinbeck's last novel, \"The Winter of Our Discontent\" (1961), examines moral decline in the United States. The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him. The book has a very different tone from Steinbeck's amoral and ecological stance in earlier works such as \"Tortilla Flat\" and \"Cannery Row\". It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel but were disappointed that it was not another \"Grapes of Wrath\".\nIn the Nobel Prize presentation speech the next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: \"Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.\"\nApparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.\nNobel Prize.\nIn 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his \"realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception\". The selection was heavily criticized, and described as \"one of the Academy's biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper. The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. \"The New York Times\" asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", noting that \"[T]he international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... [W]e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\". Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: \"Frankly, no.\" Biographer Jackson Benson notes, \"[T]his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into 'the main currents of American writing' as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value.\" In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the writer is delegated to declare and to celebrate man's proven capacity for greatness of heart and spirit\u2014for gallantry in defeat, for courage, compassion and love. In the endless war against weakness and despair, these are the bright rally flags of hope and of emulation. I hold that a writer who does not believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor any membership in literature.\u2014\u200a\nFifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a \"compromise choice\" among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell, French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen. The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot. \"There aren't any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation,\" wrote committee member Henry Olsson. Although the committee believed Steinbeck's best work was behind him by 1962, committee member Anders \u00d6sterling believed the release of his novel \"The Winter of Our Discontent\" showed that \"after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [Steinbeck has] regained his position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway.\"\nAlthough modest about his own talent as a writer, Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, he wrote that he considered cartoonist Al Capp, creator of the satirical \"Li'l Abner\", \"possibly the best writer in the world today\". At his own first Nobel Prize press conference he was asked his favorite authors and works and replied: \"Hemingway's short stories and nearly everything Faulkner wrote.\"\nIn September 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Steinbeck the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nIn 1967, at the behest of \"Newsday\" magazine, Steinbeck went to Vietnam to report on the war. He thought of the Vietnam War as a heroic venture and was considered a hawk for his position on the war. His sons served in Vietnam before his death, and Steinbeck visited one son in the battlefield. At one point he was allowed to man a machine-gun watch position at night at a firebase while his son and other members of his platoon slept.\nPersonal life.\nSteinbeck and his first wife, Carol Henning, married in January 1930 in Los Angeles. By 1940, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and it ended a year later. In 1942, after his divorce from Carol, Steinbeck married Gwyndolyn \"Gwyn\" Conger. With his second wife Steinbeck had two sons, Thomas (\"Thom\") Myles Steinbeck (1944\u20132016) and John Steinbeck IV (1946\u20131991).\nIn May 1948, Steinbeck returned to California on an emergency trip to be with his friend Ed Ricketts, who had been seriously injured when a train struck his car. Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived. Upon returning home, Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn, who asked for a divorce, which became final in October. Steinbeck spent the year after Ricketts's death in deep depression.\nIn June 1949, Steinbeck met stage manager Elaine Scott at a restaurant in Carmel, California. Steinbeck and Scott eventually began a relationship, and in December 1950 they married, within a week of Scott's finalizing her own divorce from actor Zachary Scott. This third marriage for Steinbeck lasted until his death in 1968.\nSteinbeck was an acquaintance of modernist poet Robinson Jeffers, a Californian neighbor. In a letter to Elizabeth Otis, Steinbeck wrote: \"Robinson Jeffers and his wife came in to call the other day. He looks a little older but that is all. And she is just the same.\"\nIn 1962, Steinbeck began acting as friend and mentor to the young writer and naturalist Jack Rudloe, who was trying to establish his own biological supply company, now Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory in Florida. Their correspondence continued until Steinbeck's death.\nIn February 1966, Steinbeck and his wife traveled to Israel. He met officials, e.g. Teddy Kollek. He visited in Tel Aviv the site of Mount Hope, a farm community established by his grandfather, whose brother, Friedrich Gro\u00dfsteinbeck, had been murdered by Arab marauders in 1858 during the Outrages at Jaffa.\nDeath and legacy.\nJohn Steinbeck died in New York City, where his writing career had begun, on December 20, 1968, during the 1968 flu pandemic of heart disease and congestive heart failure. He was 66, and had been a lifelong smoker. An autopsy showed nearly complete occlusion of the main coronary arteries.\nIn accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and interred on March 4, 1969 at the Hamilton family gravesite in Salinas, with those of his parents and maternal grandparents. His third wife, Elaine, was buried in the plot in 2004. He had written to his doctor that he felt deeply \"in his flesh\" that he would not survive his physical death, and that the biological end of his life was the final end to it.\nSteinbeck's incomplete novel based on the King Arthur legends of Malory and others, \"The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights\", was published in 1976.\nMany of Steinbeck's works are required reading in American high schools. In England, \"Of Mice and Men\" was one of the key texts used by the examining body AQA for its English Literature GCSE until its removal from the reformed specification that was first examined in June 2018. Following concerns about racist language used in the book, it was also removed from the English Literature GCSE syllabus in Wales, along with \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" by WJEC. It continues to be studied in Northern Ireland, although calls have also been made for its removal there. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that \"Of Mice and Men\" was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools. Steinbeck's works have also been banned. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was banned in August 1939 by the Kern County Board of Supervisors from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries. It was burned in Salinas on two occasions. In 2003, a school board in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity. According to the American Library Association, Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, with \"Of Mice and Men\" ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States.\nLiterary influences.\nSteinbeck grew up in California's Salinas Valley, a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place.\nSalinas, Monterey and parts of the San Joaquin Valley were the setting for many of his stories. The area is now sometimes referred to as \"Steinbeck Country\". Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel, \"\", which concerns the pirate/privateer Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.\nIn his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. His childhood friend, Max Wagner, a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor, served as inspiration for \"The Red Pony\". Later he used actual American conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.\nHis later work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history and mythology. One of his last published works was \"Travels with Charley\", a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America.\nCommemoration.\nSteinbeck's boyhood home, a turreted Victorian building in downtown Salinas, has been preserved and restored by the Valley Guild, a nonprofit organization. Fixed menu lunches are served Monday through Saturday, and the house is open for tours on Sunday afternoons during the summer.\nThe National Steinbeck Center is two blocks away at 1 Main Street. Dana Gioia (chair of the National Endowment for the Arts) told an audience at the center, \"This is really the best modern literary shrine in the country, and I've seen them all.\" Its \"Steinbeckiana\" includes \"Rocinante\", the camper-truck in which Steinbeck made the cross-country trip described in \"Travels with Charley\". His father's cottage on Eleventh Street in Pacific Grove, where Steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books, also survives.\nIn Monterey, Ed Ricketts's laboratory survives (though it is not yet open to the public), and at the corner that Steinbeck describes in \"Cannery Row\", also the store that once belonged to Lee Chong and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hoboes of Cannery Row. The site of the Hovden Sardine Cannery next to Doc's laboratory is now occupied by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. In 1958, the street that Steinbeck described as \"Cannery Row\" in the novel, once named Ocean View Avenue, was renamed Cannery Row in honor of the novel. The town of Monterey has commemorated Steinbeck's work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from \"Cannery Row\", historical plaques, and sculptured busts depicting Steinbeck and Ricketts.\nSan Jose's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library is home to the Martha Heasley Cox Center for Steinbeck Studies, an archive and museum which since 2002 has published the Steinbeck Review.\nOn February 27, 1979 (the 77th anniversary of the writer's birth), the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring Steinbeck, starting the Postal Service's Literary Arts series honoring American writers.\nSteinbeck was inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in 1995.\nOn December 5, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Steinbeck into the California Hall of Fame, located at the California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. His son, author Thomas Steinbeck, accepted the award on his behalf.\nMonterey Bay Roller Derby was founded in 2010. Their team names over the years have referenced Steinbeck, including Beasts of Eden, Cannery Rollers, Steinwreckers and Babes of Wrath. Their juniors league was known as the Dread Ponies.\nTo commemorate the 112th anniversary of Steinbeck's birthday on February 27, 2014, Google displayed an interactive doodle utilizing animation which included illustrations portraying scenes and quotes from several novels by the author.\nSteinbeck and his friend Ed Ricketts appear as fictionalized characters in the 2016 novel \"Monterey Bay\", about the founding of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, by Lindsay Hatton (Penguin Press).\nIn February 2016, Caltrans installed signage to identify a five-mile segment of U.S. Route 101 in Salinas as the John Steinbeck Highway, in accordance with a 2014 state legislative resolution.\nIn 2019 the Sag Harbor town board approved the creation of the John Steinbeck Waterfront Park across from the iconic town windmill. The structures on the parcel were demolished and park benches installed near the beach. The Beebe windmill replica already had a plaque memorializing the author who wrote from a small hut overlooking the cove during his sojourn in the literary haven.\nReligious views.\nSteinbeck was affiliated to the St. Paul's Episcopal Church and he stayed attached throughout his life to Episcopalianism although Steinbeck later became agnostic. Especially in his works of fiction, Steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes. The shaping of his characters often drew on the Bible and the theology of Anglicanism, combining elements of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.\nSteinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left Salinas for Stanford. However, the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at Salinas, and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work. William Ray considered his Episcopal views are prominently displayed in \"The Grapes of Wrath\", in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters Casy and Tom, who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion.\nPolitical views.\nSteinbeck's contacts with leftist authors, journalists, and labor union figures may have influenced his writing, but his political views varied throughout his career.\nSpying for the CIA.\nDocuments released by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2012 indicate that Steinbeck offered his services to the Agency in 1952, while planning a European tour, and the Director of Central Intelligence, Walter Bedell Smith, was eager to take him up on the offer. What work, if any, Steinbeck may have performed for the CIA during the Cold War is unknown. It is also unclear if Steinbeck actually provided any useful information to the CIA.\nDocuments released by the Security Service of Ukraine following the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 indicate that the Soviet KGB suspected him of being an American agent when he visited locations within the USSR, including Kyiv, in 1947.\nLeftist alliances.\nHe joined the League of American Writers, a Communist organization, in 1935. Steinbeck was mentored by radical writers Lincoln Steffens and his wife Ella Winter. Through Francis Whitaker, a member of the Communist Party USA's John Reed Club for writers, Steinbeck met with strike organizers from the Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union. In 1939, he signed a letter with some other writers in support of the Soviet invasion of Finland and the Soviet-established puppet government.\nSteinbeck was a close associate of playwright Arthur Miller. In June 1957, Steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by supporting him when Miller refused to name names in the House Un-American Activities Committee trials. Steinbeck called the period one of the \"strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced\".\nIn 1963, Steinbeck visited the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic at the behest of President John F. Kennedy. During his visit he sat for a rare portrait by painter Martiros Saryan and visited Geghard Monastery. He also met with Armenian poet Hovhannes Shiraz in Yerevan. Steinbeck's letter of thanks for Shiraz's hospitality is now displayed at the Shiraz house museum in Gyumri. Footage of this visit filmed by Rafael Aramyan was sold in 2013 by his granddaughter.\nVietnam war.\nIn 1967, when he was sent to Vietnam to report on the war, his sympathetic portrayal of the United States Army led the \"New York Post\" to denounce him for betraying his leftist past. Steinbeck's biographer, Jay Parini, says Steinbeck's friendship with President Lyndon B. Johnson influenced his views on Vietnam. Steinbeck may also have been concerned about the safety of his son serving in Vietnam. Steinbeck opposed the anti-war movement in the United States, denouncing the \"fallout, drop-out, cop-out insurgency of our children and young people, the rush to stimulant as well as hypnotic drugs, the rise of narrow, ugly, and vengeful cults of all kinds, the mistrust and revolt against all authority \u2013 this in a time of plenty such as has never been known.\"\nAlong with Albert Einstein, Steinbeck was one of the sponsors of the Peoples' World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples' World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950\u201351 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.\nGovernment harassment.\nSteinbeck complained publicly about government harassment. Thomas Steinbeck, the author's eldest son, said that J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI at the time, could find no basis for prosecuting Steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to audit Steinbeck's taxes every single year of his life, just to annoy him. According to Thomas, a true artist is one who \"without a thought for self, stands up against the stones of condemnation, and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice, or the halls of government. By doing so, these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo.\"\nIn a 1942 letter to United States Attorney General Francis Biddle, John Steinbeck wrote: \"Do you suppose you could ask Edgar's boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I am an enemy alien. It is getting tiresome.\" The FBI denied that Steinbeck was under investigation.\nMajor works.\n\"Tortilla Flat\".\nSteinbeck's first commercial success, published in 1935, is an episodic fiction recounting adventures of a loosely attached group of delinquent locals in a shabby coastal district of California. Like other books of Steinbeck's, \"Tortilla Flat\" was adapted into a feature film.\n\"In Dubious Battle\".\nIn 1936, Steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his Dust Bowl trilogy, which included \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\". This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers' strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of \"the Party\", generally taken to be the Communist Party, although this is never spelled out in the book.\n\"Of Mice and Men\".\n\"Of Mice and Men\" is a 1937 tragic novel that Steinbeck rewrote as a play that same year. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with \"The Grapes of Wrath\", \"East of Eden\", and \"The Pearl\", \"Of Mice and Men\" is one of Steinbeck's best known works. It was made into movies three times: in 1939, starring Burgess Meredith, Lon Chaney Jr., and Betty Field; in 1981, starring Randy Quaid, Robert Blake and Ted Neeley; and in 1992, starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.\n\"The Grapes of Wrath\".\n\"The Grapes of Wrath\" was published during the Great Depression and had a contemporary setting, describing a family of sharecroppers, the Joads, who were driven from their land by the dust storms of the Dust Bowl. The title is a reference to the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers' plight and too critical of capitalism, but it found a large audience of its own. It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction (novels) and was adapted as a film starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell and directed by John Ford.\n\"Cannery Row\".\nThe 1945 novel tells of a marine biologist in a seedy district dotted with sardine canneries in Monterey, California, who is feted by colorful neighbors in gratitude for his kindness to them. \"Cannery Row\" and its sequel, \"Sweet Thursday\", were adapted into a movie in 1982.\n\"East of Eden\".\nSteinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this 1952 Salinas Valley saga. The story follows two families: the Hamiltons\u00a0\u2013 based on Steinbeck's own maternal ancestry\u00a0\u2013 and the Trasks, reprising stories about the biblical Adam and his progeny. His paternal ancestry is also reflected in the story. The book was published in 1952. Portions of the novel were made into a 1955 movie directed by Elia Kazan and starring James Dean.\n\"Travels with Charley\".\nIn 1960, Steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom-built camper top\u00a0\u2013 which was rare at the time\u00a0\u2013 and drove across the United States with his faithful \"blue\" standard poodle, Charley. Steinbeck nicknamed his truck \"Rocinante\" after Don Quixote's \"noble steed\". In this sometimes comical, sometimes melancholic book, Steinbeck describes what he sees as he travels from Maine to Montana to California, and from there to Texas and Louisiana and back to his home on Long Island. However, in 2011, after his death, a reporter who had followed \"Travels with Charley\"'s trail using the author's own diaries controverted the book's accuracy, casting Steinbeck's claimed reportage as largely fictionalized, allegations supported by scholars and Steinbeck's son John.\nThe restored camper truck is on exhibit in the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15826", "revid": "7098284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15826", "title": "Joshua Reynolds", "text": "English painter (1723\u20131792)\nSir Joshua Reynolds (16 July 1723 \u2013 23 February 1792) was an English painter who specialised in portraits. The art critic John Russell called him one of the major European painters of the 18th century, while Lucy Peltz says he was \"the leading portrait artist of the 18th-century and arguably one of the greatest artists in the history of art.\" He promoted the \"Grand Style\" in painting, which depended on idealisation of the imperfect. He was a founder and first president of the Royal Academy of Arts and was knighted by George III in 1769. He has been referred to as the 'master who revolutionised British Art.'\nReynolds had a famously prolific studio that produced over 2,000 paintings during his lifetime. Ellis Waterhouse estimated those works the painter did \u2018think worthy\u2019 at \u2018hardly less than a hundred paintings which one would like to take into consideration, either for their success, their originality, or their influence.' Of these, \"Portrait of Omai\" is probably his best known work and has been described by Simon Schama as \"one of the greatest things British art has ever produced [and] one of the all time, timeless masterpieces that painting can produce.\" Waterhouse considered \"The Marlborough Family\" as 'the most monumental achievement of British portraiture' and that 'Reynolds' genius came to full flower in the diversity and geniality he was able to give to his full-length portraits' like \"Portrait of Philip Gell\" and \"Portrait of the Earl of Carlisle\".\nThomas Lawrence rated \"Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse\" as \"indisputably the finest female portrait in the world.\" Neil Jeffares adds that \"Portrait of Robert Orme\" was 'surely one of the great eighteenth-century European portraits.' The price paid for the exceptional \"Portrait of Omai\" in 2023 was \u00a350 million \u2013 far more than had ever been paid for an 18th-century picture. This was followed two years later by the sale of the iconic full-length \"Portrait of Lady Worsley\" for \u00a325 million. Also in 2025, the full-length \"\" was acquired by the National Trust for acceptance in lieu of tax of \u00a317.5 million by H M Government (the way the scheme is structured meant the open market price calculation of the picture would be substantially higher than \u00a317.5 million.) Jonathan Jones says 'that puts Reynolds in the superstar category, way beyond his contemporaries, and competing with the likes of Damien Hirst and Lucian Freud.' 'Reynolds is not remote or staid at all. He\u2019s the portraitist of the Enlightenment, a daring artist who captured a daring age.'\nEarly life.\nReynolds was born in Plympton, Devon, on 16 July 1723, as the third son of the Reverend Samuel Reynolds, master of the Plympton Free Grammar School in the town. His father had been a fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, but did not send any of his sons to the university.\nOne of his sisters, seven years his senior, was Mary Palmer, author of \"Devonshire Dialogue\", whose fondness for drawing is said to have had much influence on Joshua as a boy. In 1740, she provided \u00a360, half of the premium paid to Thomas Hudson the portrait-painter, for Joshua's pupillage, and nine years later advanced money for his expenses in Italy. His other siblings included Frances Reynolds and Elizabeth Johnson.\nAs a boy, he also came under the influence of Zachariah Mudge, whose Platonistic philosophy stayed with him all his life. Reynolds made extracts in his commonplace book from Theophrastus, Plutarch, Seneca, Marcus Antonius, Ovid, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, John Dryden, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, and Aphra Behn and copied passages on art theory by Leonardo da Vinci, Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy, and Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien. The work that came to have the most influence on Reynolds was Jonathan Richardson's \"An Essay on the Theory of Painting\" (1715). Reynolds' annotated copy was lost for nearly two hundred years until it appeared in a Cambridge bookshop, inscribed with the signature \"J. Reynolds Pictor\". It is now in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.\nCareer.\nHaving shown an early interest in art, Reynolds was apprenticed in 1740 to the fashionable London portrait painter Thomas Hudson, who like Reynolds had been born in Devon. Hudson had a collection of Old Master drawings, including some by Guercino, of which Reynolds made copies. Although apprenticed to Hudson for a period of four years, Reynolds remained with him only until the summer of 1743. Having left Hudson, Reynolds worked for some time as a portrait-painter in Plymouth Dock (now Devonport). He returned to London before the end of 1744, but following his father's death in late 1745 he shared a house in Plymouth Dock with his sisters.\nIn 1749, Reynolds met Commodore Augustus Keppel, who invited him to join HMS \"Centurion\", of which he had command, on a voyage to the Mediterranean. While with the ship he visited Lisbon, C\u00e1diz, Algiers and Minorca. From Minorca he travelled to Livorno in Italy, and then to Rome, where he spent two years, studying the Old Masters and acquiring a taste for the \"Grand Style\". Lord Edgcumbe, who had known Reynolds as a boy and introduced him to Keppel, suggested he should study with Pompeo Batoni, the leading painter in Rome, but Reynolds replied that he had nothing to learn from him. While in Rome he suffered a severe cold, which left him partially deaf, and, as a result, he began to carry the small ear trumpet with which he is often pictured.\nReynolds travelled homeward overland via Florence, Bologna, Venice, and Paris. He was accompanied by Giuseppe Marchi, then aged about 17. Apart from a brief interlude in 1770, Marchi remained in Reynolds' employment as a studio assistant for the rest of the artist's career. Following his arrival in England in October 1752, Reynolds spent three months in Devon before establishing himself in London the following year and remaining there for the rest of his life. He took rooms in St Martin's Lane, before moving to Great Newport Street; his sister Frances acted as his housekeeper. He achieved success rapidly, and was extremely prolific. Lord Edgecumbe recommended William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire and Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton to sit for him, and other peers followed, including Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, third son of George II, in whose portrait, according to Nicholas Penny \"bulk is brilliantly converted into power\". In 1760, Reynolds moved into a large house, with space to show his works and accommodate his assistants, on the west side of Leicester Fields (now Leicester Square).\nAlongside ambitious full-length portraits, Reynolds painted large numbers of smaller works. In the late 1750s, at the height of the social season, he received five or six sitters a day, each for an hour. By 1761, Reynolds could command a fee of 80 guineas for a full-length portrait; in 1764, he was paid 100 guineas for a portrait of Lord Burghersh.\nThe clothing of Reynolds' sitters was usually painted by either one of his pupils, his studio assistant Giuseppe Marchi, or the specialist drapery painter Peter Toms. James Northcote, his pupil, wrote of this arrangement that \"the imitation of particular stuffs is not the work of genius, but is to be acquired easily by practice, and this was what his pupils could do by care and time more than he himself chose to bestow; but his own slight and masterly work was still the best.\" Lay figures were used to model the clothes.\nReynolds often adapted the poses of his subjects from the works of earlier artists, a practice mocked by Nathaniel Hone in a painting called \"The Conjuror\" submitted to the Royal Academy exhibition of 1775, and now in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland. It shows a figure representing, though not resembling, Reynolds, seated in front of a cascade of prints from which Reynolds had borrowed with varying degrees of subtlety.\nAlthough not known principally for his landscapes, Reynolds did paint in this genre. He had an excellent vantage from his house, Wick House, on Richmond Hill, and painted the view in about 1780.\nReynolds also was recognised for his portraits of children. He emphasised the innocence and natural grace of children when depicting them. His 1788 portrait, \"Age of Innocence\", is his best known character study of a child. The subject of the painting is not known, although suggestions include Theophila Gwatkin, his great-niece, and Lady Anne Spencer, the youngest daughter of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough.\nThe Club.\nReynolds worked long hours in his studio, rarely taking a holiday. He was gregarious and keenly intellectual, with many friends from London's intelligentsia, numbered among whom were Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Edmund Burke, Giuseppe Baretti, Henry Thrale, David Garrick, and artist Angelica Kauffman, exchanging his portrait of her for a portrait of him by Kauffman. Johnson said in 1778: \"Reynolds is too much under [Charles James] Fox and Burke at present. He is under the \"Fox star\" and the \"Irish constellation\" (meaning Burke). He is always under some planet\".\nBecause of his popularity as a portrait painter, Reynolds enjoyed constant interaction with the wealthy and famous men and women of the day, and it was he who brought together the figures of \"The Club\". It was founded in 1764 and met in a suite of rooms on the first floor of the Turks Head at 9 Gerrard Street, now marked by a plaque. Original members included Burke, Bennet Langton, Topham Beauclerk, Goldsmith, Anthony Chamier, Thomas Hawkins, and Christopher Nugent, to be joined by Garrick, Boswell, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan. In ten years the membership had risen to 35. The Club met every Monday evening for supper and conversation and continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning. In later years, it met fortnightly during Parliamentary sessions. When in 1783 the landlord of the Turks Head died and the property was sold, The Club moved to Sackville Street.\nRoyal Academy.\nReynolds was one of the earliest members of the Royal Society of Arts, helped found the Society of Artists of Great Britain, and in 1768 became the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts, a position he was to hold until his death. In 1769, he was knighted by George III, only the second English artist to be so honoured. His \"Discourses\", a series of lectures delivered at the academy between 1769 and 1790, are remembered for their sensitivity and perception. In one lecture, he expressed the opinion that \"invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory.\" William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of Reynolds 'there is much ingenuity and originality in all his academic discourses, replete with classical knowledge of his art, acute remarks on the works of others, and general taste and discernment'.\nReynolds and the Royal Academy received a mixed reception. Critics included William Blake who published the vitriolic \"Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses\" in 1808. J. M. W. Turner and Northcote were fervent acolytes: Turner requested he be laid to rest at Reynolds' side, and Northcote, who spent four years as Reynolds' pupil, wrote to his family: \"I know him thoroughly, and all his faults, I am sure, and yet almost worship him.\"\nIn 2018, the Royal Academy of Arts celebrated its 250th anniversary from its opening in 1768. This became an impetus for galleries and museums across the UK to celebrate \"the making, debating and exhibiting art at the Royal Academy\". Waddesdon Manor was amongst the historic houses that supported Sir Joshua Reynolds's influence at the academy, acknowledging how:\n[He] transformed British painting with portraits and subject pictures that engaged their audience's knowledge, imagination, memory and emotions... As an eloquent teacher and art theorist, he used his role at the head of the Royal Academy to raise the status of art and artists of Britain.\n\"Lord Keppel\".\nIn the Battle of Ushant against the French in 1778, Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel commanded the Channel Fleet and the outcome resulted in no clear winner; Keppel ordered the attack be renewed and was obeyed except by Sir Hugh Palliser, who commanded the rear, and the French escaped bombardment. A dispute between Keppel and Palliser arose and Palliser brought charges of misconduct and neglect of duty against Keppel and the Admiralty decided to court-martial him. On 11 February 1779, Keppel was acquitted of all charges and became a national hero. One of Keppel's lawyers commissioned Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland to paint a portrait of Keppel, but Keppel redirected it to Reynolds. Reynolds alluded to Keppel's trial in the portrait by painting his hand on his sword, reflecting the presiding officer's words at the court-martial: \"In delivering to you your sword, I am to congratulate you on its being restored to you with so much honour\".\nPrincipal Painter in Ordinary to the King.\nOn 10 August 1784, Allan Ramsay died and the office of Principal Painter in Ordinary to King George III became vacant. Thomas Gainsborough felt that he had a good chance of securing it, but Reynolds felt he deserved it and threatened to resign the presidency of the Royal Academy if he did not receive it. Reynolds noted in his pocket book: \"Sept. 1, 2\u00bd, to attend at the Lord Chancellor's Office to be sworn in painter to the King\". It did not make Reynolds happy, however, as he wrote to Boswell: \"If I had known what a shabby miserable place it is, I would not have asked for it; besides as things have turned out I think a certain person is not worth speaking to, nor speaking of\", presumably meaning the King. Reynolds wrote to Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of St Asaph, a few weeks later: \"Your Lordship congratulation on my succeeding Mr. Ramsay I take very kindly, but it is a most miserable office, it is reduced from two hundred to thirty-eight pounds per annum, the Kings Rat catcher I believe is a better place, and I am to be paid only a fourth part of what I have from other people, so that the Portraits of their Majesties are not likely to be better done now, than they used to be, I should be ruined if I was to paint them myself\".\n\"Lord Heathfield\".\nIn 1787, Reynolds painted the portrait of George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield, who became a national hero for the successful defence of Gibraltar in the Great Siege from 1779 to 1783 against the combined forces of France and Spain. Heathfield is depicted against a background of clouds and cannon smoke, wearing the uniform of the 15th Light Dragoons and clasping the key of the Rock, its chain wrapped twice around his right hand. John Constable said in the 1830s that it was \"almost a history of the defence of Gibraltar\". Desmond Shawe-Taylor has claimed that the portrait may have a religious meaning, Heathfield holding the key similar to St. Peter (Jesus' \"rock\") possessing the keys to Heaven, Heathfield \"the rock upon which Britannia builds her military interests\".\nLater life.\nIn 1789, Reynolds lost the sight of his left eye, which forced him into retirement. In 1791 James Boswell dedicated his \"Life of Samuel Johnson\" to Reynolds. Reynolds agreed with Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" and, writing in early 1791, expressed his belief that the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\" of France had fallen due to spending too much time tending, as he puts it, to the splendor of the foliage, to the neglect of the stirring the earth about the roots. They cultivated only those arts which could add splendor to the nation, to the neglect of those which supported it \u2013 They neglected Trade &amp; substantial Manufacture\u00a0... but does it follow that a total revolution is necessary that because we have given ourselves up too much to the ornaments of life, we will now have none at all. When attending a dinner at Holland House, Fox's niece Caroline was sat next to Reynolds and \"burst out into glorification of the Revolution \u2013 and was grievously chilled and checked by her neighbour's cautious and unsympathetic tone\".\nOn 4 June 1791, at a dinner at the Freemasons' Tavern to mark the King's birthday, Reynolds drank to the toasts \"GOD \"save the\" KING!\" and \"May our glorious Constitution under which the arts flourish, be immortal!\", in what was reported by the \"Public Advertiser\" as \"a fervour truly patriotick\". Reynolds \"filled the chair with a most convivial glee\". He returned to town from Burke's house in Beaconsfield and Edmond Malone wrote that \"we left his carriage at the Inn at Hayes, and walked five miles on the road, in a warm day, without his complaining of any fatigue\".\nLater that month Reynolds suffered from a swelling over his left eye and had to be purged by a surgeon. In October he was too ill to take the president's chair and in November, Frances Burney recorded that I had long languished to see that kindly zealous friend, but his ill health had intimidated me from making the attempt\": \"He had a bandage over one eye, and the other shaded with a green half-bonnet. He seemed serious even to sadness, though extremely kind. 'I am very glad,' he said, in a meek voice and dejected accent, 'to see you again, and I wish I could see you better! but I have only one eye now, and hardly that.' I was really quite touched. On 5 November, Reynolds, fearing he might not have an opportunity to write a will, wrote a memorandum intended to be his last will and testament, with Edmund Burke, Edmond Malone, and Philip Metcalfe named as executors. On 10 November, Reynolds wrote to Benjamin West to resign the presidency, but the General Assembly agreed he should be re-elected, with Sir William Chambers and West to deputise for him.\nDoctors Richard Warren and Sir George Baker believed Reynolds' illness to be psychological and they bled his neck \"with a view of drawing the humour from his eyes\" but the effect, in the view of his niece, was that it seemed \"as if the 'principle of life' were gone\" from Reynolds. On New Year's Day 1792 Reynolds became \"seized with sickness\", and from that time onwards could not keep food down.\nReynolds died on 23 February 1792 at his house at 47 Leicester Fields in London between eight and nine in the evening.\nBurke was present on the night Reynolds died, and was moved within hours to write a eulogy of Reynolds, starting with the following sentiments: \"Sir Joshua Reynolds was on very many accounts one of the most memorable men of his Time. He was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant Arts to the other Glories of his Country. In Taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in the richness and Harmony of colouring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned Ages.\" Burke's tribute was well received and one journalist called it \"the eulogium of Apelles pronounced by Pericles\".\nReynolds was buried at St Paul's Cathedral. In 1903, a statue, by Alfred Drury, was erected in his honour in the Annenberg Courtyard of Burlington House, home of the Royal Academy. Around the statue are fountains and lights, installed in 2000, arranged in the pattern of a star chart at midnight on the night of Reynolds' birth. The planets are marked by granite discs, and the Moon by a water recess.\nPersonal characteristics.\nIn appearance Reynolds was not striking. Slightly built, he was about 5'6\" tall with dark brown curls, a florid complexion and features that James Boswell thought were \"rather too largely and strongly limned.\" He had a broad face and a cleft chin, and the bridge of his nose was slightly dented; his skin was scarred by smallpox and his upper lip disfigured as a result of falling from a horse as a young man. Edmond Malone asserted however that \"his appearance at first sight impressed the spectator with the idea of a well-born and well-bred English gentleman.\"\nIn his mature years he suffered from deafness, as recorded by Frances Burney, although this did not impede his lively social life. Renowned for his placidity, Reynolds often claimed that he \"hated nobody\". This may be self-idealisation. It is well known that he disliked George Romney, whom he referred to only as \"the man in Cavendish Square\" and whom he successfully prevented from becoming a member of the Royal Academy. He did not like Gainsborough, yet appreciated his achievements in the obituary he wrote of his rival. (Rump; Kidson). It is said that when he taught in one of his \"discourses\" that a painter should not amass too much of the colour blue in the foreground of an image, Gainsborough was prompted to paint his famous \"The Blue Boy\".\nNever quite losing his Devonshire accent, Reynolds was not only an amiable and original conversationalist, but a friendly and generous host, so that Frances Burney recorded in her diary that he had \"a suavity of disposition that set everybody at their ease in his society\", and William Makepeace Thackeray believed \"of all the polite men of that age, Joshua Reynolds was the finest gentleman\". Dr Johnson commented on the \"inoffensiveness\" of his nature; Edmund Burke noted his \"strong turn for humor\". Thomas Barnard, who later became Bishop of Killaloe, wrote in his closing verses on Reynolds stating:\n&lt;poem&gt;Thou say'st not only skill is gained\nBut genius too may be attained\nBy studious imitation;\nThy temper mild, thy genius fine\nI'll copy till I make them mine\nBy constant application.&lt;/poem&gt;\nSome people, such as Hester Lynch Piozzi, construed Reynolds' equable calm as cool and unfeeling. It is to this lukewarm temperament that Frederick W. Hilles, Bodman Professor of English Literature at Yale attributes Reynolds' never having married. In the editorial notes of his compendium \"Portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds\", Hilles theorises that \"as a corollary one might say that he [Reynolds] was somewhat lacking in a capacity for love\", and cites Boswell's notary papers: \"He said the reason he would never marry was that every woman whom he liked had grown indifferent to him, and he had been glad he did not marry her.\" Reynolds' own sister, Frances, who lived with him as housekeeper, took her own negative opinion further still, thinking him \"a gloomy tyrant\". The presence of family compensated Reynolds for the absence of a wife; he wrote on one occasion to his friend Bennet Langton, that both his sister and niece were away from home \"so that I am quite a bachelor\". Reynolds did not marry, and had no known children.\nBiographer Ian McIntyre discusses the possibility of Reynolds having enjoyed sexual relations with certain clients, such as Nelly O'Brien (or \"My Lady O'Brien\", as he playfully dubbed her) and Kitty Fisher, who visited his house for more sittings than were strictly necessary. Dan Cruickshank in his book \"London's Sinful Secret\" summarised Reynolds as having visited and re-visited various reputed red light districts in London after his return from Italy as a possible contributor to his medical condition and appearance due to commonly contracted disease in those areas of London.\nRegarding the British debate over the abolition of slavery, abolitionist Thomas Clarkson claimed that Reynolds stated his opposition to the Atlantic slave trade at a dinner with a group of friends with Clarkson present. Clarkson had shown the group samples of cloth produced in Africa, and Reynolds \"gave his unqualified approbation of the abolition of this cruel traffic\". Reynolds also subscribed to the second edition of Ottobah Cugoano's abolitionist work \"Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species\". Reynolds also had a Black servant who appears to have joined his household around the mid-1760s. Unlike Cugoano, however, his name is not recorded despite Northcote suggesting that the servant modelled for several of Reynolds\u2019 paintings. Northcote stated that the man had been brought to Britain by Mary Mordaunt, the wife of landowner Valentine Morris, though this account contained \"inconsistencies and conflicting chronologies\".\nReynolds Research Project.\nIn 2010, the Wallace Collection launched the Reynolds Research Project. With the support of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and in partnership with the National Gallery and in collaboration with the Yale Center for British Art, work was undertaken to conserve the museum's portraits to improve their visual appreciation for future generations and to investigate the ways in which they were painted.\nThe purpose of an exhibition and accompanying catalogue, \"Joshua Reynolds: Experiments in Paint\", 2015, was to share the discoveries of the project and to reveal Reynolds's complex and experimental engagement with painterly materials over the course of his long career. A series of thematic groupings of works from the collection with temporary loans allowed the curators to explore the development of Reynolds's images from both a technical and art historical viewpoint.\nAs well as exploring his experimentation with materials, the project also revealed the innovative ways in which Reynolds collaborated with his patrons; played with the conventions of genre, composition and pose; engaged with the work of other artists; and organised the submission and display of his work at exhibitions. The commissioning and collecting of Reynolds's work, specifically in the context of the founders of the Wallace Collection (the Seymour-Conway family), was also examined.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served briefly as Finance Minister of Austria in 1919. In 1932, he emigrated to the United States to become a professor at Harvard University, where he remained until the end of his career, and in 1939 obtained American citizenship.\nSchumpeter was one of the most influential economists of the early 20th century, and popularized creative destruction, a term coined by Werner Sombart. His magnum opus is considered to be \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy.\"\nEarly life and education.\nSchumpeter was born in 1883 in Triesch, Habsburg Moravia (now T\u0159e\u0161\u0165 in the Czech Republic, then part of Austria-Hungary), to German-speaking Catholic parents. Though both of his grandmothers were Czech, Schumpeter did not acknowledge his Czech ancestry. His father, who owned a factory, died when Joseph was only four years old. In 1893, Joseph and his mother moved to Vienna. Schumpeter was a loyal supporter of Franz Joseph I of Austria.\nSchumpeter was educated at the Theresianum and began his career studying law at the University of Vienna under Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, an economic theorist of the Austrian School. In 1906, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Vienna's faculty of law, with a specialisation in economics. In 1909, after some study trips, he became a professor of economics and government at the University of Czernowitz in modern-day Ukraine. In 1911, he joined the University of Graz, where he remained until World War I.\nIn 1913\u20131914, Schumpeter taught at Columbia University as an invited professor. This invitation marked, according to Wolfgang Stolper, the \"high point of his worldly success\". He taught economic theory and met Irving Fisher and Wesley Clair Mitchell. Columbia awarded him an honorary doctorate.\nIn 1918, Schumpeter was a member of the Socialisation Commission established by the Council of the People's Deputies in Germany. In March 1919, he was invited to take office as Minister of Finance in the Republic of German-Austria. He proposed a capital levy as a way to tackle the war debt and opposed the socialization of the plant. In 1921, he became president of the private Biedermann Bank. He was also a board member at the Kaufmann Bank. Problems at those banks left Schumpeter in debt. His resignation was a condition of the takeover of the Biedermann Bank in September 1924.\nFrom 1925 until 1932, Schumpeter held a chair at the University of Bonn, Germany. He lectured at Harvard in 1927\u20131928 and 1930. In 1931, he was a visiting professor at the Tokyo College of Commerce. In 1932, Schumpeter moved to the United States, and soon began what would become extensive efforts to help fellow central European economists displaced by Nazism. Schumpeter's last visit to Europe was in 1937. Schumpeter also became known for his opposition to Marxism, although he still believed the triumph of socialism to be inevitable in the long run. He also criticized Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. In 1939, Schumpeter became a US citizen. At the beginning of World War II, the FBI investigated him and his wife, Elizabeth Boody (a prominent scholar of Japanese economics) for Nazi sympathies, but found no evidence of such leanings.\nAt Harvard, Schumpeter was considered a memorable character, erudite, and even showy in the classroom. He became known for his heavy teaching load and his personal and painstaking interest in his students. He served as the faculty advisor of the Graduate Economics Club and organized private seminars and discussion groups. Some colleagues thought his views were outdated by Keynesianism, which was fashionable; others resented his criticisms, particularly of their failure to offer an assistant professorship to Paul Samuelson, but recanted when they thought him likely to accept a position at Yale University. This period of his life was characterized by hard work and comparatively little recognition of his massive two-volume book \"Business Cycles.\" However, Schumpeter persevered, and in 1942 published what became the most popular of all his works, \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\", reprinted many times and in many languages in the following decades, as well as cited thousands of times.\nCareer.\nInfluences.\nThe source of Schumpeter's dynamic, change-oriented, and innovation-based economics was the historical school of economics. Although his writings could be critical of that perspective, Schumpeter's work on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship can be seen as a continuation of ideas originated by the historical school, especially the work of Gustav von Schmoller and Werner Sombart. Despite being born in Austria and having trained with many of the same economists, some argue he cannot be categorized with the Austrian School of economics without major qualifications while others maintain the opposite. Schumpeter was also influenced by L\u00e9on Walras and the Lausanne School, calling Walras the \"greatest of all economists\".\nThe Austrian sociologist Rudolf Goldscheid's concept of fiscal sociology influenced Schumpeter's analysis of the tax state. A 2012 paper showed that Schumpeter's writings displayed the influence of Francis Galton's work.\nEvolutionary economics.\nAccording to Christopher Freeman (2009), \"the central point of his whole life work [is]: that capitalism can only be understood as an evolutionary process of continuous innovation and 'creative destruction'\".\n\"History of Economic Analysis\".\nSchumpeter's scholarship is apparent in his posthumous \"History of Economic Analysis\", Schumpeter thought that the greatest 18th-century economist was Turgot rather than Adam Smith, and he considered L\u00e9on Walras to be the \"greatest of all economists\", beside whom other economists' theories were \"like inadequate attempts to catch some particular aspects of Walrasian truth\". Schumpeter criticized John Maynard Keynes and David Ricardo for the \"Ricardian vice\". According to Schumpeter, both Ricardo and Keynes reasoned in terms of abstract models, where they would freeze all but a few variables. Then they could argue that one caused the other in a simple monotonic fashion. This led to the belief that one could easily deduce policy conclusions directly from a highly abstract theoretical model.\nIn this book, Joseph Schumpeter recognized the implication of a gold monetary standard compared to a fiat monetary standard. In \"History of Economic Analysis\", Schumpeter stated the following: \"An 'automatic' gold currency is part and parcel of a laissez-faire and free-trade economy. It links every nation's money rates and price levels with the money rates and price levels of all the other nations that are 'on gold.' However, gold is extremely sensitive to government expenditure and even to attitudes or policies that do not involve expenditure directly, for example, in foreign policy, certain policies of taxation, and, in general, precisely all those policies that violate the principles of [classical] liberalism. \"This\" is the reason why gold is so unpopular now and also why it was so popular in a bourgeois era.\"\nBusiness cycles.\nSchumpeter's relationships with the ideas of other economists were quite complex in his most important contributions to economic analysis \u2013 the theory of business cycles and development. Following neither Walras nor Keynes, Schumpeter starts in \"The Theory of Economic Development\" with a treatise of circular flow which, excluding any innovations and innovative activities, leads to a stationary state. The stationary state is, according to Schumpeter, described by Walrasian equilibrium. The hero of his story is the entrepreneur.\nThe entrepreneur disturbs this equilibrium and is the prime cause of economic development, which proceeds cyclically along with several time scales. In fashioning this theory connecting innovations, cycles, and development, Schumpeter kept alive the Russian Nikolai Kondratiev's ideas on 50-year cycles, Kondratiev waves.\nSchumpeter suggested a model in which the four main cycles, Kondratiev (54 years), Kuznets (18 years), Juglar (9 years), and Kitchin (about 4 years) can be added together to form a composite waveform. A Kondratiev wave could consist of three lower-degree Kuznets waves. Each Kuznets wave could, itself, be made up of two Juglar waves. Similarly two (or three) Kitchin waves could form a higher degree Juglar wave. If each of these were in phase; more importantly, if the downward arc of each was simultaneous so that the nadir of each was coincident, it would explain disastrous slumps and consequent depressions. As far as the segmentation of the Kondratiev Wave, Schumpeter never proposed such a fixed model. He saw these cycles varying in time \u2013 although in a tight time frame by coincidence \u2013 and for each to serve a specific purpose.\nKeynesianism.\nIn Schumpeter's theory, Walrasian equilibrium is not adequate to capture the key mechanisms of economic development. Schumpeter also thought that the institution enabling the entrepreneur to buy the resources needed to realize his vision was a well-developed capitalist financial system, including a whole range of institutions for granting credit. One could divide economists among (1) those who emphasized \"real\" analysis and regarded money as merely a \"veil\" and (2) those who thought monetary institutions were important and money could be a separate driving force. Both Schumpeter and Keynes were among the latter.\nDemise of capitalism.\nSchumpeter's most popular book in English is probably \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\". While he agrees with Karl Marx that capitalism will collapse and be replaced by socialism, Schumpeter predicts a different way this will come about. While Marx predicted that capitalism would be overthrown by a violent proletarian revolution, which occurred in the least capitalist countries, Schumpeter believed that capitalism would gradually weaken itself and eventually collapse. Specifically, the success of capitalism would lead to corporatism and to values hostile to capitalism, especially among intellectuals.\n\"Intellectuals\" are a social class in a position to critique societal matters for which they are not directly responsible and to stand up for the interests of other classes. Intellectuals tend to have a negative outlook on capitalism, even while relying on it for prestige because their professions rely on antagonism toward it. The growing number of people with higher education is a great advantage of capitalism, according to Schumpeter. Yet, unemployment and a lack of fulfilling work will lead to intellectual critique, discontent, and protests.\nParliaments will increasingly elect social democratic parties, and democratic majorities will vote for restrictions on entrepreneurship. Increasing workers' self-management, industrial democracy and regulatory institutions would evolve non-politically into \"liberal capitalism\". Thus, the intellectual and social climate needed for thriving entrepreneurship will be replaced by some form of \"laborism\". This will exacerbate \"creative destruction\" (a borrowed phrase to denote an endogenous replacement of old ways of doing things by new ways), which will ultimately undermine and destroy the capitalist structure.\nSchumpeter emphasizes throughout this book that he is analyzing trends, not engaging in political advocacy.\nWilliam Fellner, in the book \"Schumpeter's Vision: Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy After 40 Years\", noted that Schumpeter saw any political system in which the power was fully monopolized as fascist.\nDemocratic theory.\nIn the same book, Schumpeter expounded on a theory of democracy that sought to challenge what he called the \"classical doctrine\". He disputed the idea that democracy was a process by which the electorate identified the common good, and politicians carried this out for them. He argued this was unrealistic, and that people's ignorance and superficiality meant that they were largely manipulated by politicians, who set the agenda. Furthermore, he claimed that even if the common good was possible to find, it would still not make clear the means needed to reach its end, since citizens do not have the requisite knowledge to design government policy. This made a 'rule by the people' concept both unlikely and undesirable. Instead, he advocated a minimalist model, much influenced by Max Weber, whereby democracy is the mechanism for competition between leaders, much like a market structure. Although periodic votes by the general public legitimize governments and keep them accountable, the policy program is very much seen as their own and not that of the people, and the participatory role of individuals is usually severely limited.\nSchumpeter defined democracy as the method by which people elect representatives in competitive elections to carry out their will. This definition has been described as simple, elegant and parsimonious, making it clearer to distinguish political systems that either fulfill or fail these characteristics. This minimalist definition stands in contrast to broader definitions of democracy, which may emphasize aspects such as \"representation, accountability, equality, participation, justice, dignity, rationality, security, freedom\". Within such a minimalist definition, states which other scholars say have experienced democratic backsliding and which lack civil liberties, a free press, the rule of law and a constrained executive, would still be considered democracies. For Schumpeter, the formation of a government is the endpoint of the democratic process, which means that for the purposes of his democratic theory, he has no comment on what kinds of decisions that the government can take to be a democracy. Schumpeter faced pushback on his theory from other democratic theorists, such as Robert Dahl, who argued that there is more to democracy than simply the formation of government through competitive elections.\nSchumpeter's view of democracy has been described as \"elitist\", as he criticizes the rationality and knowledge of voters, and expresses a preference for politicians making decisions. Democracy is therefore in a sense a means to ensure circulation among elites. However, studies by Natasha Piano of the University of Chicago emphasize that Schumpeter had substantial disdain for elites as well.\nEntrepreneurship.\nThe field of entrepreneurship theory owed much to Schumpeter's contributions. His fundamental theories are often referred to as Mark I and Mark II. In Mark I, Schumpeter argued that the innovation and technological change of a nation come from entrepreneurs or wild spirits. He coined the word \"Unternehmergeist\", German for \"entrepreneur-spirit\", and asserted that \"... the doing of new things or the doing of things that are already being done in a new way\" stemmed directly from the efforts of entrepreneurs.\nSchumpeter developed Mark II while a professor at Harvard. Many social economists and popular authors of the day argued that large businesses had a negative effect on the standard of living of ordinary people. Contrary to this prevailing opinion, Schumpeter argued that the agents that drive innovation and the economy are large companies that have the capital to invest in research and development of new products and services and to deliver them to customers more cheaply, thus raising their standard of living. In one of his seminal works, \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\", Schumpeter wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As soon as we go into details and inquire into the individual items in which progress was most conspicuous, the trail leads not to the doors of those firms that work under conditions of comparatively free competition but precisely to the door of the large concerns \u2013 which, as in the case of agricultural machinery, also account for much of the progress in the competitive sector \u2013 and a shocking suspicion dawns upon us that big business may have had more to do with creating that standard of life than with keeping it down.\nAs of 2017[ [update]] Mark I and Mark II arguments are considered complementary.\nCycles and long wave theory.\nSchumpeter was the most influential thinker to argue that long cycles are caused by innovation and are an incident of it. His treatise on how business cycles developed was based on Kondratiev's ideas which attributed the causes very differently. Schumpeter's treatise brought Kondratiev's ideas to the attention of English-speaking economists. Kondratiev fused important elements that Schumpeter missed. Yet, the Schumpeterian variant of the long-cycles hypothesis, stressing the initiating role of innovations, commands the widest attention today.\nIn Schumpeter's view, technological innovation is the cause of both cyclical instability and economic growth. Fluctuations in innovation cause fluctuations in investment and those cause cycles in economic growth. Schumpeter sees innovations as clustering around certain points in time that he refers to as \"neighborhoods of equilibrium\" when entrepreneurs perceive that risk and returns warrant innovative commitments. These clusters lead to long cycles by generating periods of acceleration in aggregate growth.\nThe technological view of change needs to demonstrate that changes in the rate of innovation govern changes in the rate of new investments and that the combined impact of innovation clusters takes the form of fluctuation in aggregate output or employment. The process of technological innovation involves extremely complex relations among a set of key variables: inventions, innovations, diffusion paths, and investment activities. The impact of technological innovation on aggregate output is mediated through a succession of relationships that have yet to be explored systematically in the context of the long wave. New inventions are typically primitive, their performance is usually poorer than existing technologies and the cost of their production is high. A production technology may not yet exist, as is often the case in major chemical and pharmaceutical inventions. The speed with which inventions are transformed into innovations and diffused depends on the actual and expected trajectory of performance improvement and cost reduction.\nInnovation.\nSchumpeter identified innovation as the critical dimension of economic change. He argued that economic change revolves around innovation, entrepreneurial activities, and market power. He sought to prove that innovation-originated market power can provide better results than the invisible hand and price competition. He argued that technological innovation often creates temporary monopolies, allowing abnormal profits that would soon be competed away by rivals and imitators. These temporary monopolies were necessary to provide the incentive for firms to develop new products and processes.\nDoing Business.\nThe World Bank's \"Doing Business\" report was influenced by Schumpeter's focus on removing impediments to creative destruction. The creation of the report is credited in part to his work.\nPersonal life.\nSchumpeter was married three times. His first marriage was to Gladys Ricarde Seaver, an Englishwoman nearly 12 years his senior, in 1907. His best man at the wedding was the Austrian jurist Hans Kelsen. They separated in 1913 and were finally divorced in 1925. His second was to Anna Reisinger, 20 years his junior and daughter of the concierge of the apartment where he grew up. As a divorced man, he and his bride converted to Lutheranism to marry. They married in 1925, but she died in childbirth the year after. The loss of his wife and newborn son came only weeks after Schumpeter's mother had died. Five years after arriving in the US, in 1937, at the age of 54, Schumpeter married the American economic historian Dr. Elizabeth Boody (1898\u20131953), who helped him popularize his work and edited what became their magnum opus, the posthumously published \"History of Economic Analysis\". Elizabeth assisted him with his research and English writing until his death.\nSchumpeter claimed that he had set himself three goals in life: to be the greatest economist in the world, the best horseman in all of Austria, and the greatest lover in all of Vienna. He claimed to have reached two of these goals, though he never specified which two, although he is reported to have said that there were too many fine horsemen in Austria for him to succeed in all his aspirations.\nSchumpeter died in his home in Taconic, Connecticut, at the age of 66, on the night of January 8, 1950.\nLegacy.\nFor some time after his death, Schumpeter's views were most influential among various heterodox economists, especially Europeans, who were interested in industrial organization, evolutionary theory, and economic development, and who tended to be on the other end of the political spectrum from Schumpeter and were also often influenced by Keynes, Karl Marx, and Thorstein Veblen. Robert Heilbroner was one of Schumpeter's most renowned pupils, who wrote extensively about him in \"The Worldly Philosophers\". In the journal \"Monthly Review\", John Bellamy Foster wrote of that journal's founder Paul Sweezy, one of the leading Marxist economists in the United States and a graduate assistant of Schumpeter's at Harvard, that Schumpeter \"played a formative role in his development as a thinker\". Other outstanding students of Schumpeter's include the economists Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Hyman Minsky and John Kenneth Galbraith and former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. Future Nobel Laureate Robert Solow was his student at Harvard, and he expanded on Schumpeter's theory.\nToday, Schumpeter has a following outside standard textbook economics, in areas such as economic policy, management studies, industrial policy, and the study of innovation. Schumpeter was probably the first scholar to develop theories about entrepreneurship. For instance, the European Union's innovation program, and its main development plan, the Lisbon Strategy, are influenced by Schumpeter. The International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society awards the Schumpeter Prize.\nThe Schumpeter School of Business and Economics opened in October 2008 at the University of Wuppertal, Germany. According to University President Professor Lambert T. Koch, \"Schumpeter will not only be the name of the Faculty of Management and Economics, but this is also a research and teaching programme related to Joseph A. Schumpeter.\"\nOn September 17, 2009, \"The Economist\" inaugurated a column on business and management named \"Schumpeter\". The publication has a history of naming columns after significant figures or symbols in the covered field, including naming its British affairs column after former editor Walter Bagehot and its European affairs column after Charlemagne. The initial Schumpeter column praised him as a \"champion of innovation and entrepreneurship\" whose writing showed an understanding of the benefits and dangers of business that proved to be far ahead of its time.\nSchumpeter's thoughts inspired the economic theory of Adam Przeworski.\nTwo of the 2025 Economic Noble Peace Prize winners \"Philippe Aghion\" and \"Peter Howitt\", used \"creative destruction\" as the basis for their work.\nTranslated as: Translated by: Bruce A.

{"id": "15830", "revid": "19469213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15830", "title": "John Lee Hooker", "text": "American blues musician (1912 or 1917\u20132001)\nJohn Lee Hooker (August 22, 1912 or 1917 \u2013 June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues that he developed in Detroit. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s\u20131940s piano-derived boogie-woogie. Hooker was ranked 35 in \"Rolling Stone\"'s 2015 list of 100 greatest guitarists, and has been cited as one of the greatest male blues vocalists of all time.\nSome of his best known songs include \"Boogie Chillen'\" (1948), \"Crawling King Snake\" (1949), \"Dimples\" (1956), \"Boom Boom\" (1962), and \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" (1966). Several of his later albums, including \"The Healer\" (1989), \"Mr. Lucky\" (1991), \"Chill Out\" (1995), and \"Don't Look Back\" (1997), were album chart successes in the U.S. and UK. \"The Healer\" (for the song \"I'm in the Mood\") and \"Chill Out\" (for the album) both earned him Grammy wins, as well as \"Don't Look Back\", which went on to earn him a double-Grammy win for Best Traditional Blues Recording and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (with Van Morrison).\nEarly life.\nHooker's date of birth is a subject of debate; the years 1912, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been suggested. Most official sources list 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920. Information found in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was actually born in 1912. In 2017, a series of events were held to celebrate the supposed centenary of his birth. In the 1920 federal census, John Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in Tutwiler, Mississippi.\nIt is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near Clarksdale, in Coahoma County. He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923), a sharecropper and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census, William and Minnie were recorded as being 48 and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to have been a \"decade or so younger\" than her husband, which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.\nThe Hooker children were homeschooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the spirituals sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).\nMoore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in Shreveport, Louisiana, learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the Delta blues of the time.\nAnother influence was Tony Hollins, who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of \"Crawlin' King Snake\" and \"Catfish Blues\".\nAt the age of 14, Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again. In the mid-1930s, he lived in Memphis, Tennessee, where he performed on Beale Street, at the New Daisy Theatre and occasionally at house parties.\nHe worked in factories in various cities during World War II, eventually getting a job with the Ford Motor Company in Detroit in 1943. He frequented the blues clubs and bars on Hastings Street, the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker's popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.\nEarlier career.\nHooker was working as a janitor in a Detroit steel mill when his recording career began in 1948, when Modern Records, based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit. The single, \"Boogie Chillen'\", became a hit and the best-selling race record of 1949. Though illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting traditional blues lyrics, he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for Chess Records and Chance Records in 1951\u20131952), Johnny Lee (for De Luxe Records in 1953\u20131954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker, Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, and the Boogie Man.\nHis early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. Hooker rarely played with a standard beat, opting instead to adjust the tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing, and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.\nFor much of this period, he recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland. In Hooker's later sessions for Vee-Jay Records in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including Eddie Taylor, who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies. \"Boom Boom\" (1962) and \"Dimples,\" two popular songs by Hooker, were originally released by Vee-Jay.\nLater career.\nBeginning in 1962, Hooker gained greater exposure when he toured Europe in the annual American Folk Blues Festival. His \"Dimples\" became a successful single on the UK Singles Charts in 1964, eight years after its first US release. Hooker began to perform and record with rock musicians. One of his earliest collaborations was with British blues rock band the Groundhogs. In 1970, he recorded the joint album \"Hooker 'n Heat\", with the American blues and boogie rock group Canned Heat, whose repertoire included adaptations of Hooker songs. It became the first of Hooker's albums to reach the \"Billboard\" charts, peaking at number 78 on the Billboard 200. Other collaboration albums soon followed, including \"Endless Boogie\" (1971) and \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\" (1972), which included Steve Miller, Elvin Bishop, Van Morrison, and others.\nHooker appeared in the 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers\" as a street musician playing \"Boom Boom.\" In 1989, he recorded the album \"The Healer\" with Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, and others. The 1990s saw additional collaboration albums: \"Mr. Lucky\" (1991), \"Chill Out\" (1995), and \"Don't Look Back\" (1997) with Morrison, Santana, Los Lobos, and additional guest musicians. His re-recording of \"Boom Boom\" (the title track for his 1992 album) with guitarist Jimmie Vaughan became Hooker's highest charting single (number 16) in the UK. \"Come See About Me\", a 2004 DVD, includes performances filmed between 1960 and 1994 and interviews with several of the musicians.\nHooker owned five houses in his later life, including ones in the California cities of Los Altos, Redwood City, and Long Beach. On June 21, 2001, Hooker died in his sleep at home in Los Altos.\nAwards and recognition.\nAmong his many awards, Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. He was a recipient of a 1983 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is also inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.\nTwo of his songs, \"Boogie Chillen\" and \"Boom Boom,\" are included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. \"Boogie Chillen\" is also included in the Recording Industry Association of America's list of the \"Songs of the Century\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "15834", "revid": "8690395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15834", "title": "Satires (Juvenal)", "text": "Collection of satirical poems by Juvenal\nThe Satires () are a collection of satirical poems by the Latin author Juvenal written between 100\u2013127 A.D.\nThe \"Satires\" address perceived threats to society, such as socially ascendant foreigners, infidelity, and the extreme excesses of the Roman aristocracy. Juvenal's audience was highly educated, and his dense poems are laced with historical and mythological allusions.\nHistory and composition.\nDate.\nThe first book of \"Satires\" probably dates to 100 AD. The fifth book likely dates to a point after 127, because of a reference to the Roman consul Lucius Aemilius Juncus in Satire 15. Between these two books, Juvenal wrote seven additional satires that are organized in three books. Satire 6 was written shortly after the first book and serves as a companion piece.\nGenre.\nThe Roman satire genre featured a wide-ranging discussion of social mores in dactylic hexameter. Quintilian noted how many genres Rome borrowed from Greece but concluded, \"Satire, on the other hand, is all our own\". The other great satirist of Rome was Horace. John Dryden summed up the difference in their approach, \"Horace meant to make his reader laugh...Juvenal always intends to move your indignation.\"\nIn Satire 1, concerning the scope and content of his work, Juvenal says:\n\"From the day when the rain-clouds lifted up the waters, and Deucalion climbed that mountain in his ship to seek an oracle\u2014that day when stones grew soft and warm with life, and Pyrrha showed maidens in nature's garb to men\u2014all the doings of mankind, their vows, their fears, their angers and their pleasures, their joys and goings to and fro, shall form the motley subject of my page.\" - (1.81\u201386)\nJuvenal's \"Satires\" range from 130 to 695 lines. Satire 16 is incomplete. Translators like Niall Rudd sometimes provided pithy titles like \"9. The Woes of a Gigolo\" and \"15. The Case of Cannibalism\". The 16 Satires are grouped into five books:\nSynopsis.\nBook I.\nSatire 1: Juvenal begins, \"semper ego auditor tantum...\" (Must I be always a listener?). He confesses the moral rot of Rome has made avoiding satire impossible. He points to eunuch marriages, women at boar hunts, and sycophancy as examples of widespread degeneracy. He praises Gaius Lucilius for proving the merits of the genre.\nSatire 2: Juvenal attacks hypocrites and homosexuality. He also defames Otho for bringing cosmetics on a military campaign. He claims the ghosts of great Romans would feel ill upon seeing such men in the Underworld.\nSatire 3: The third satire describes the decision of Umbricius, Juvenal's friend, to depart from Rome. Narrated by Umbricius, it states that an honest man cannot survive in Rome and complains about how it is impossible to compete with Greeks and Orientals. Within this satire, Juvenal calls Rome a, \"a chaotic metropolis where life has become dangerous for honest men\".\nSatire 4: The fourth satire is a mock heroic epic, describing a council convened by Domitian. Starting off with an invocation to the muse of epic poetry, Calliope, it mocks the absurdity of the situation with a fake sense of importance. Within it, Juvenal is summoned to the council to determine how to cook the gigantic turbot (\"rhombus\") given to Domitian as a gift. It also discusses various other events, such as Crispinus buying a singular mullet at the outrageous price of 6,000 sesterces.\nSatire 5: The fifth satire describes the shame experienced by a client when his patron, Virro, finally decided to extend to him an invitation to his dinner party. It criticizes the client, stating that, \"a poor man\u2019s stomach is easy to please, yet you suffer insults at a dinner party just for a free meal\". It also states that, though they are at the same table, they are being treated completely differently, with the client being given much worse food while Virro eats delicacies. Overall, this satire is a brutal commentary on the social inequality of ancient Rome, where the wealthy give their dependents the bare minimum in exchange for their loyalty.\nBook II.\nSatire 6: The sixth satire is Juvenal's longest, at 661 lines, and his most famous. Addressing a man whom Juvenal calls delusional enough to think about getting married, he expounds the immorality and 'vices' of women. In it, he claims that women are unfaithful, and that they relentlessly seek abortions, murder their stepchildren, and use potions to drive their husbands insane. Thus he proposes suicide as a 'painless alternative' to marriage. Two noteworthy phrases from this satire are 'rara avis', (lit. 'rare bird'), which refers to good women as a black swan, or hard to come by, and another is the line 'quis custodiet ipsos custodes', (lit. 'who will guard the guards themselves').\nBook III.\nSatire 7: The seventh satire laments the decline of intellectual pursuits and the miserable circumstances of contemporary authors, pining for the patronage enjoyed by Augustan writers. It opens with a prayer for better treatment of scholars under a new emperor, possibly Hadrian. The satire criticizes how learned men are underpaid while public entertainers, like the actor Paris, are excessively compensated. This actor, Paris, may have been the man that he was possibly exiled for slandering. \nSatire 8: The eighth satire takes issue with the idea that noble birth defines a person\u2019s worth, stating that true nobility comes from virtue, not their pedigree. Juvenal argues that relying on the achievements of one's ancestors is meaningless if the individual is inferior to them. He points out that many nobles do nothing to earn their status, likening it to racehorses valued for their speed rather than their lineage\u2014if they are slow, they are sent to pull carts. Thus, Juvenal implies that if a noble is inferior, he should be regarded as so, as well. Furthermore, he criticizes Nero, stating that he utterly debased himself in spending lavishly on sports.\nSatire 9: The ninth satire is a conversation between the narrator and Naevolus, a male prostitute who is upset that his hard work isn\u2019t paying off. Naevolus talks about serving rich, effeminate men who do not want to spend money on his services. Naevolus also talks about how he saved one man\u2019s marriage, but now the man wants someone else. To which, the narrator tells him that rich men have no secrets and that he will always find a patron, and Naevolus worries about growing older and losing his appeal.\nBook IV.\nSatire 10: The tenth satire focuses on the foolishness of human desires, showing how things like wealth, power, beauty, long life, and even children, are not truly good in themselves. Juvenal argues that these desires can often lead to harm. For example, wealth can destroy, power is fleeting, and even fame or military glory can bring ruin. Juvenal highlights examples like Sejanus, Hannibal, and Alexander the Great to show how these worldly pursuits end in disappointment, even if they were less of a disappointment than him. The satire ends by suggesting that instead of seeking these things, people should trust the gods to choose what\u2019s best for them. The famous phrase \"mens sana in corpore sano\" (lit. a healthy mind in a healthy body) is found within this satire.\nSatire 11: The eleventh satire focuses on moderation, mainly in food and the Roman cena (formal dinner). Juvenal contrasts the lavish spending habits of gourmands with the simplicity and moderation of a meal made from home-grown foods. In the first section, he criticizes those who refuse to spend less on luxuries, even at the cost of going into debt, and urges the wisdom of Apollo\u2019s advice to \u201cknow thyself,\u201d not just in aspirations, but in what one spends on food. The narrator then invites a friend, Persicus, to his house to demonstrate his own moderation, serving only simple foods from his Tiburtine land. He talks about how ancient Romans, like the noble Curius, were content with humble food, while modern wealthy people demand luxuries like ivory tables and professional meat carvers. Instead of a pornographic Spanish dance show, Juvenal says the evening\u2019s entertainment after the dinner will be poetry.\nSatire 12: The twelfth satire features a narrator describing to Corvinus the vows he made to the Roman gods-- Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva\u2014 along with his Lares (family gods) to ensure the safety of his friend Catullus during a dangerous storm at sea. Despite the threat of the storm, which led Catullus to sacrifice valuable possessions for his life, the narrator says that his sacrifices are not for personal gain--unlike the legacy hunters who might sacrifice anything, including slaves or children, to secure an inheritance. After the storm, the sailors managed to reach the port at Ostia, and the narrator prepares an altar to make his offerings. The narrator clarifies that since Catullus has heirs, his actions in helping Catullus are motivated by friendship, not by a desire for wealth.\nBook V.\nSatire 13: The thirteenth satire is a reflection on the dangers of revenge when one is wronged. The narrator begins by stating that guilt is its own punishment and he suggests that experience can help defend against the whims of Fortuna. He also acknowledges that the world is corrupt and that the Golden Age was vastly superior to the present (a point he brought up in Satire 7 as well). Juvenal also points out that financial loss is often mourned more than death itself and he criticizes people that are surprised by the scale of crime in Rome, likening it to being surprised by a German with blue eyes. He also calls revenge foolish, citing philosophers like Chrysippos, Thales, and Socrates, who would not endorse such actions. He also references a story from Herodotus about a corrupt Spartan consulting the Oracle at Delphi, stating that merely intending to do evil makes one immediately guilty.\nSatire 14: The fourteenth satire says that children learn vice from their parents, stressing the injustice of a father punishing a son for imitating his own faults. Juvenal says that people are more concerned with presenting a clean atrium to guests than with maintaining a virtuous household for their children, and gives various examples, such as Caetronius and his son both squandering wealth on extravagant houses, and stating that religious customs, like Judaism, are learned from one's parents. Juvenal claims that avaricious individuals risk their lives for these unimportant gains, for example, how Alexander the Great's realization that Diogenes, content with little, was happier than he. Ultimately, the satire says that truly being content lies in possessing as much as Epicurus or Socrates found sufficient, or, in Roman terms, a modest fortune within the equestrian order; if such wealth does not satisfy, then Juvenal states that not even the riches of Croesus or Persia will be enough.\nSatire 15: The fifteenth satire talks about the importance of compassion in maintaining civilization. Juvenal states that while extreme circumstances have sometimes forced people into desperate actions for survival, even the most savage societies have historically refrained from cannibalism. He recounts a recent incident in Upper Egypt where two rival cities, consumed by hatred, escalated a minor conflict into full-blown violence, leading to the horrific act of eating a fallen enemy raw. In contrast, Juvenal says that the Vascones, besieged by Pompey, resorted to cannibalism only out of necessity, and even the infamous human sacrifices at the altar of Artemis in Taurus did not involve consumption of flesh. At the end, Juvenal says that compassion is what makes humans and animals different, along with our ability to cry, as people are endowed not only with life but also with reason, enabling them to build civilization.\nSatire 16: The sixteenth satire discusses the advantages that soldiers enjoy over ordinary citizens. Juvenal says that soldiers are immune to civilian justice, as any legal action against them must take place within the camp, where a plaintiff stands little chance and may even face violence for their efforts. Unlike civilians, soldiers are not subjected to the delays of the legal system and possess the right to make a will while their father is still alive-- an inversion of the usual family hierarchy that places the son, a soldier, above his own father. This satire, although left incomplete due to only 60 lines being preserved, showed Juvenal's expertise in law and adds credit to him possibly working in the legal system prior to writing his \"Satires\".\nScholarship.\nThe chief manuscript for Juvenal's \"Satires\" is a codex edited by Pierre Pithou in 1575. It made its way to Montpellier. The manuscript is known as the Codex Pithoeanus Montepessulanus. A. E. Housman developed a critical apparatus for the \"Satires\" in 1905.\nLacunae in manuscripts created problems that editors and translators solved in a variety of ways. In addition to lacunae, it was common to expurgate Juvenal's explicit passages until recently.\nJohn Dryden wrote a massive introduction for his translation of \"Satires\" in 1692. \nJuvenal's persona in the first two books is indignant, persistently asking outraged questions about the state of Rome. In the later books, he is more restrained and ironic. He borrowed heavily from writers like Martial and Virgil.\nJuvenal's \"Satires\" are a valuable source about early Judaism, given their accounts of Jewish life in first-century Rome.\nLiterary and cultural influence.\nSeveral maxims originate in Juvenal's \"Satires\":\nThe footwear and sports equipment manufacturing company Asics is named after a Latin acronym for \"anima sana in corpore sano\" (a sound mind in a sound body), a variant on the maxim in Juvenal's .\nSamuel Johnson used Juvenal as a model for two of his works: \"London: A Poem in Imitation of The Third Satire of Juvenal\" (1738) and \"The Vanity of Human Wishes: The Tenth Satire of Juvenal Imitated\" (1748). In \"Suspiria de Profundis\" (1845), Thomas de Quincey rhapsodized that no one wrote better indignant verses than Juvenal.\nGerman writer Heinrich B\u00f6ll was exposed to Juvenal's \"Satires\" by an anti-Nazi teacher in high school, \"Mr. Bauer realized how topical Juvenal was, how he dealt at length with such phenomena as arbitrary government, tyranny, corruption, the degradation of public morals, the decline of the Republican ideal and the terrorizing acts of the Praetorian Guards...I found an 1838 translation of Juvenal with an extensive commentary, twice the length of the translated text itself, written at the height of the Romantic period...I read all of it very intensely, as if it was a detective novel. It was one of the few books to which I persistently held on throughout the war...\"\nAlexander Theroux identified Juvenal as his most important influence.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the foremost avant-garde artists of the 20th century and highly influential on the Surrealist and Dadaist movements, among others. The \"National Observer\" suggested that \"of the artistic generation whose daring gave birth to Twentieth Century Art, Cocteau came closest to being a Renaissance man\".\nHe is most notable for his novels (1923), (1928), and (1929); the stage plays (1930), (1934), (1938), (1941), and (1946); and the films \"The Blood of a Poet\" (1930), (1948), \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1946), \"Orpheus\" (1950), and \"Testament of Orpheus\" (1960), which alongside \"Blood of a Poet\" and \"Orpheus\" constitute the so-called Orphic Trilogy. He was described as \"one of [the] avant-garde's most successful and influential filmmakers\" by AllMovie. Cocteau, according to Annette Insdorf, \"left behind a body of work unequalled for its variety of artistic expression\".\nThough his body of work encompassed many different media, Cocteau insisted on calling himself a poet, classifying the great variety of his works \u2014 poems, novels, plays, essays, drawings, films \u2014 as , , , , and .\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nCocteau was born in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, to Georges Cocteau and Eug\u00e9nie Lecomte, a socially prominent Parisian family. His father, a lawyer and amateur painter, died by suicide when Cocteau was nine. From 1900 to 1904, Cocteau attended the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet where he met and began a relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos, who reappeared throughout Cocteau's work \"John Cocteau: Erotic Drawings\". \nHe left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, \"Aladdin's Lamp\", at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in Bohemian artistic circles as \"The Frivolous Prince\", the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. Edith Wharton described him as a man \"to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...\"\nEarly career.\nIn his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers Marcel Proust, Andr\u00e9 Gide, and Maurice Barr\u00e8s. In 1912, he collaborated with L\u00e9on Bakst on \"Le Dieu bleu\" for the Ballets Russes; the principal dancers being Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. During World War I, Cocteau served in the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani, and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated.\nRussian impresario Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in \"Parade\" in 1917. It was produced by Diaghilev, with sets by Picasso, the libretto by Apollinaire and the music by Erik Satie. \"If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,\" wrote Cocteau, \"with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.\"\nAn important exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as Les Six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les Six frequented a wildly popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.\nFriendship with Raymond Radiguet.\nIn 1918 he met the French poet Raymond Radiguet. They collaborated extensively, socialized, and undertook many journeys and vacations together. Cocteau also got Radiguet exempted from military service. Admiring of Radiguet's great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friend's works in his artistic circle and arranged for the publication by Grasset of \"Le Diable au corps\", a largely autobiographical story of an adulterous relationship between a married woman and a younger man, exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the \"Nouveau Monde\" literary prize. Some contemporaries and later commentators thought there might have been a romantic component to their friendship. Cocteau himself was aware of this perception, and worked earnestly to dispel the notion that their relationship was sexual in nature.\nThere is disagreement over Cocteau's reaction to Radiguet's sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to opium addiction. Opponents of that interpretation point out that he did not attend the funeral (he generally did not attend funerals) and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of \"Les noces\" (\"The Wedding\") by the Ballets Russes at Monte Carlo. \nHis opium addiction at the time, Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the Monte Carlo Opera. Cocteau's opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style. His most notable book, \"Les Enfants Terribles\", was written in a week during a strenuous opium weaning.\nIn \"\", he recounts the experience of his recovery from opium addiction in 1929. His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world. Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent, Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. Under Maritain's influence, Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church. He again returned to the Church later in life and undertook a number of religious art projects.\nFurther works.\nOn 15 June 1926 Cocteau's play \"Orph\u00e9e\" was staged in Paris. It was quickly followed by an exhibition of drawings and \"constructions\" called \"Po\u00e9sie plastique\u2013objets, dessins\". Cocteau wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky's opera-oratorio \"Oedipus rex\", which had its original performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 30 May 1927. In 1929 one of his most celebrated and well-known works, the novel \"Les Enfants terribles\" was published.\nIn 1930 Cocteau made his first film \"The Blood of a Poet\", publicly shown in 1932. Though now generally accepted as a surrealist film, the surrealists themselves did not accept it as a truly surrealist work. Although this is one of Cocteau's best-known works, his 1930s are notable rather for a number of stage plays, above all \"La Voix humaine\" and \"Les Parents terribles\", which was a popular success. His 1934 play \"La Machine infernale\" was Cocteau's stage version of the Oedipus legend and is considered to be his greatest work for the theatre. During this period Cocteau also published two volumes of journalism, including \"Mon Premier Voyage: Tour du Monde en 80 jours\", a neo-Jules Verne around the world travel reportage he made for the newspaper Paris-Soir.\n1940\u20131944.\nThroughout his life, Cocteau tried to maintain a distance from political movements, confessing to a friend that \"my politics are non-existent\". According to Claude Arnaud, from the 1920s on, Cocteau's only deeply held political convictions were a marked pacifism and antiracism. He praised the French republic for serving as a haven for the persecuted, and applauded Picasso's anti-war painting \"Guernica\" as a cross that \"Franco would always carry on his shoulder\". In 1940, Cocteau signed a petition circulated by the Ligue internationale contre l'antis\u00e9mitisme (International League Against Antisemitism) which protested the rise of racism and antisemitism in France, and declared himself \"ashamed of his white skin\" after witnessing the plight of colonized peoples during his travels.\nAlthough in 1938 Cocteau had compared Adolf Hitler to an evil demiurge who wished to perpetrate a Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre against Jews, his friend Arno Breker convinced him that Hitler was a pacifist and patron of the arts with France's best interests in mind. During the Nazi occupation of France, he was in a \"round-table\" of French and German intellectuals who met at the Georges V Hotel in Paris, including Cocteau, the writers Ernst J\u00fcnger, Paul Morand and Henry Millon de Montherlant, the publisher Gaston Gallimard and the Nazi legal scholar Carl Schmitt. \nIn his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the F\u00fchrer's sexuality. Cocteau effusively praised Breker's sculptures in an article entitled published in 1942. This piece caused him to be arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war, though he was cleared of any wrongdoing and had used his contacts for his failed attempt to save friends such as Max Jacob. Later, after growing closer with communists such as Louis Aragon, Cocteau would name Joseph Stalin as \"the only great politician of the era\".\nIn 1940, , Cocteau's play written for and starring \u00c9dith Piaf (who died the day before Cocteau), was enormously successful.\nLater years.\nCocteau's later years are mostly associated with his films. Cocteau's films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming French New Wave genre.\nFollowing \"The Blood of a Poet\" (1930), his best known films include \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1946), \"Les Parents terribles\" (1948), and \"Orpheus\" (1949). His final film, \"Le Testament d'Orph\u00e9e\" (\"The Testament of Orpheus\") (1960), featured appearances by Picasso and matador Luis Miguel Domingu\u00edn, along with Yul Brynner, who also helped to finance the film.\nIn 1945, Cocteau was one of several designers who created sets for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode. He drew inspiration from filmmaker Ren\u00e9 Clair while making \"Tribute to Ren\u00e9 Clair: I Married a Witch\". The maquette is described in his \"Journal 1942\u20131945\", in his entry for 12 February 1945: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I saw the model of my set. Fashion bores me, but I am amused by the set and fashion placed together. It is a smoldering maid's room. One discovers an aerial view of Paris through the wall and ceiling holes. It creates vertigo. On the iron bed lies a fainted bride. Behind her stand several dismayed ladies. On the right, a very elegant lady washes her hands in a flophouse basin. Through the unhinged door on the left, a lady enters with raised arms. Others are pushed against the walls. The vision provoking this catastrophe is a bride-witch astride a broom, flying through the ceiling, her hair and train streaming.\nIn 1956, Cocteau decorated the \"Chapelle Saint-Pierre\" in Villefranche-sur-Mer with mural paintings. The following year he also decorated the marriage hall at the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Menton.\nPrivate life.\nJean Cocteau never hid his homosexuality. He was the author of the mildly homoerotic and semi-autobiographical \"Le Livre blanc\" (translated as \"The White Paper\" or \"The White Book\"), published anonymously in 1928. He never repudiated its authorship and a later edition of the novel features his foreword and drawings. The novel begins:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As far back as I can remember, and even at an age when the mind does not yet influence the senses, I find traces of my love of boys. I have always loved the strong sex that I find legitimate to call the fair sex. My misfortunes came from a society that condemns the rare as a crime and forces us to reform our inclinations.\nFrequently his work, either literary (\"Les enfants terribles\"), graphic (erotic drawings, book illustration, paintings) or cinematographic (\"The Blood of a Poet\", \"Orpheus\", \"Beauty and the Beast\"), is pervaded with homosexual undertones, homoerotic imagery/symbolism or camp. In 1947 Paul Morihien published a clandestine edition of \"Querelle de Brest\" by Jean Genet, featuring 29 very explicit erotic drawings by Cocteau. In recent years several albums of Cocteau's homoerotica have been available to the general public.\nIn the 1930s, Cocteau is rumoured to have had a platonic affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the daughter of a Romanov Grand Duke and herself a sometime actress, model, and former wife of couturier Lucien Lelong.\nCocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with French actors Jean Marais and \u00c9douard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in \"The Eternal Return\" (1943), \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1946), \"Ruy Blas\" (1947), and \"Orpheus\" (1949).\nDeath.\nCocteau died of a heart attack at his ch\u00e2teau in Milly-la-For\u00eat, Essonne, France, on 11\u00a0October 1963 at the age of 74. His friend, French singer \u00c9dith Piaf, had died the previous day. Her death was announced on the morning of Cocteau's day of death. It has been said, in a story which is almost certainly apocryphal, that his heart failed upon hearing of Piaf's death. \nCocteau's health had already been in decline for several months, and he had previously had a severe heart attack on 22\u00a0April 1963. A more plausible suggestion for the reason behind this decline in health has been proposed by author Roger Peyrefitte, who notes that Cocteau had been devastated by a breach with his longtime friend, socialite and notable patron Francine Weisweiller, as a result of an affair she had been having with a minor writer. Weisweiller and Cocteau did not reconcile until shortly before Cocteau's death.\nAccording to his wishes, Cocteau is buried beneath the floor of the Chapelle Saint-Blaise des Simples in Milly-la-For\u00eat. The epitaph on his gravestone set in the floor of the chapel reads: \"I stay with you\" ().\nHonours and awards.\nIn 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise and The Royal Academy of Belgium.\nDuring his life, Cocteau was commander of the Legion of Honor, Member of the Mallarm\u00e9 Academy, German Academy (Berlin), American Academy, Mark Twain (U.S.A) Academy, Honorary President of the Cannes Film Festival, Honorary President of the France-Hungary Association and President of the Jazz Academy and the Academy of the Disc.\nInfluence.\nFilm critic Pauline Kael mentions that revivals of the film \"Blood of a Poet\" led to Cocteau being considered one of the most important filmmakers of his time, because he was \"an artist using the medium for his own end.\" She said that he caused audiences to start looking at films in a new way, as invited filmmakers and no longer as merely audience members.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15838", "revid": "50904378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15838", "title": "John Donne", "text": "English poet and cleric (1572\u20131631)\nJohn Donne ( ; 1571 or 1572 \u2013 31 March 1631) was an English poet, scholar, soldier and secretary born into a recusant family, who later became a cleric in the Church of England. Under royal patronage, he was made Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London (1621\u20131631). He is considered the preeminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His poetical works are noted for their metaphorical and sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs and satires. He is also known for his sermons.\nDonne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques. His early career was marked by poetry that bore immense knowledge of English society. A theme in Donne's later poetry is the idea of true religion, something that he spent much time considering and about which he often theorised. He wrote secular poems as well as erotic and love poems. He is particularly famous for his mastery of metaphysical conceits.\nDespite his great education and poetic talents, Donne lived in poverty for several years, relying heavily on wealthy friends. This was as a result of his secret marriage to Anne More, with whom he eventually had twelve children. He served as a member of Parliament in 1601 and in 1614. In 1615 he unwillingly was ordained Anglican deacon and then priest at the king's insistence.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nDonne was born in London in 1571 or 1572, into a recusant Roman Catholic family when practice of that religion was illegal in England. Donne was the third of six children. His father, also named John Donne, was married to Elizabeth Heywood. He was of Welsh descent and a warden of the Ironmongers Company in the City of London. He avoided unwelcome government attention out of fear of religious persecution.\nHis father died in 1576, when Donne was four years old, leaving his mother, Elizabeth, with the responsibility of raising the children alone. Heywood was also from a recusant Roman Catholic family, the daughter of John Heywood, the playwright, and sister of the Reverend Jasper Heywood, a Jesuit priest and translator. She was a great-niece of Thomas More. A few months after her husband died, Donne's mother married John Syminges, a wealthy widower with three children of his own.\nDonne was educated privately. There is no evidence to support the popular claim that he was taught by Jesuits. In 1583, at the age of 11, he began studies at Hart Hall, now Hertford College, Oxford. After three years of studies there, Donne was admitted to the University of Cambridge, where he studied for another three years. Donne could not obtain a degree from either institution because of his Catholicism, since he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy required to graduate. In 1591 he was accepted as a student at the Thavies Inn legal school, one of the Inns of Chancery in London. On 6 May 1592, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, one of the Inns of Court.\nIn 1593, five years after the defeat of the Spanish Armada and during the intermittent Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604), Queen Elizabeth issued the first English statute against sectarian dissent from the Church of England, titled \"An Act for restraining Popish recusants\". It defined \"Popish recusants\" as those \"convicted for not repairing to some Church, Chapel, or usual place of Common Prayer to hear Divine Service there, but forbearing the same contrary to the tenor of the laws and statutes heretofore made and provided in that behalf\". Donne's brother Henry was also a university student prior to his arrest in 1593 for harbouring a Catholic priest, William Harrington, and died in Newgate Prison of bubonic plague, leading Donne to begin questioning his Catholic faith.\nDuring and after his education, Donne spent much of his considerable inheritance on women, literature, pastimes and travel. Although no record details precisely where Donne travelled, he crossed Europe. He later fought alongside the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh against the Spanish at Cadiz (1596) and the Azores (1597), and witnessed the loss of the Spanish flagship, the \"San Felipe\". According to Izaak Walton, his earliest biographer, \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... he returned not back into England till he had stayed some years, first in Italy, and then in Spain, where he made many useful observations of those countries, their laws and manner of government, and returned perfect in their languages.\nBy the age of 25 he was well prepared for the diplomatic career he appeared to be seeking. He was appointed chief secretary to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton, and was established at Egerton's London home, York House, Strand, close to the Palace of Whitehall, then the most influential social centre in England.\nMarriage to Anne More.\nDuring the next four years, Donne fell in love with Egerton's niece Anne More. They were secretly married just before Christmas in 1601, against the wishes of both Egerton and Anne's father George More, who was Lieutenant of the Tower. Upon discovery, this wedding ruined Donne's career, getting him dismissed and put in Fleet Prison, along with the Church of England priest Samuel Brooke, who married them, and his brother Christopher, who stood in, in the absence of George More, to give Anne away. Donne was released shortly thereafter when the marriage was proved to be valid, and he soon secured the release of the other two. Walton tells us that when Donne wrote to his wife to tell her about losing his post, he wrote after his name: \"John Donne, Anne Donne, Un-done.\" It was not until 1609 that Donne was reconciled with his father-in-law and received his wife's dowry.\nAfter his release, Donne had to accept a retired country life in a small house in Pyrford, Surrey, owned by Anne's cousin, Sir Francis Wooley, where they lived until the end of 1604. In spring 1605 they moved to another small house in Mitcham, Surrey, where he scraped a meagre living as a lawyer, while Anne Donne bore a new baby almost every year. Though he also worked as an assistant pamphleteer to Thomas Morton writing anti-Catholic pamphlets, Donne was in a constant state of financial insecurity.\nAnne gave birth to twelve children in sixteen years of marriage, including two stillbirths\u2014their eighth and then, in 1617, their last child. The ten surviving children were Constance, John, George, Francis, Lucy (named after Donne's patron Lucy, Countess of Bedford, her godmother), Bridget, Mary, Nicholas, Margaret and Elizabeth. Three, Francis, Nicholas and Mary, died before they were ten.\nIn a state of despair that almost drove him to kill himself, Donne noted that the death of a child would mean one mouth fewer to feed, but he could not afford the burial expenses. During this time, Donne wrote but did not publish \"Biathanatos\", his defence of suicide. His wife died on 15 August 1617, five days after giving birth to their twelfth child, a still-born baby. Donne mourned her deeply, and wrote of his love and loss in his Holy Sonnet.\nCareer and later life.\nIn 1602, Donne was elected as a member of parliament (MP) for the constituency of Brackley, but the post was not a paid position. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, being succeeded by King James VI of Scotland as King James I of England. The fashion for coterie poetry of the period gave Donne a means to seek patronage. Many of his poems were written for wealthy friends or patrons, especially for MP Sir Robert Drury of Hawsted (1575\u20131615), whom he met in 1610 and who became his chief patron, furnishing him and his family an apartment in his large house in Drury Lane.\nIn 1610 and 1611, Donne wrote two anti-Catholic polemics: \"Pseudo-Martyr\" and \"Ignatius His Conclave\" for Morton. He then wrote two Anniversaries, ' (1611) and ' (1612) for Drury.\nDonne sat as an MP again, this time for Taunton, in the Addled Parliament of 1614. Though he attracted five appointments within its business he made no recorded speech. Although King James was pleased with Donne's work, he refused to reinstate him at court and instead urged him to take holy orders. At length, Donne acceded to the king's wishes, and in 1615 was an ordained priest in the Church of England.\nIn 1615, Donne was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity from Cambridge University. He became a Royal Chaplain in the same year. He became a reader of divinity at Lincoln's Inn in 1616, where he served in the chapel as minister until 1622. In 1618, he became chaplain to Viscount Doncaster, who was an ambassador to the . Donne did not return to England until 1620. In 1621, Donne was made Dean of St Paul's, a leading and well-paid position in the Church of England, which he held until his death in 1631.\nIn 1616 he was granted the living as rector of two parishes, Keyston in Huntingdonshire and Sevenoaks in Kent, and in 1621 of Blunham, in Bedfordshire, all held until his death. Blunham Parish Church has an imposing stained glass window commemorating Donne, designed by Derek Hunt. During Donne's period as dean his daughter Lucy died, aged eighteen. In late November and early December 1623 he suffered a nearly fatal illness, thought to be either typhus or a combination of a cold followed by a period of fever.\nDuring his convalescence he wrote a series of meditations and prayers on health, pain and sickness that were published as a book in 1624 under the title of \"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions\". One of these meditations, , contains the well-known phrases \"No man is an \"Iland\"\" (often modernised as \"No man is an island\") and \"...for whom the \"bell\" tolls\". In 1624, he became vicar of St Dunstan-in-the-West, and in 1625 a prolocutor to Charles I. He earned a reputation as an eloquent preacher. 160 of his sermons have survived, including Death's Duel, his famous delivered at the Palace of Whitehall before King Charles I in February 1631.\nDeath.\nDonne suffered a violent fever in 1630, aged about 58, and he heard the rumour that he was dead, commenting, 'A man would almost be content to die ... to hear of so much sorrow and so much good testimony from good men as I (God be blessed for it) did upon the report of my death.'\nDonne died on 31 March 1631. He was buried in old St Paul's Cathedral, where a memorial statue of him by Nicholas Stone was erected with a Latin epigraph probably composed by himself. The memorial was one of the few to survive the Great Fire of London in 1666 and is now in St Paul's Cathedral. The statue was said by Izaac Walton in his biography, to have been modelled from the life by Donne to suggest his appearance at the resurrection. It started a vogue of such monuments during the 17th century. In 2012, a bust of the poet by Nigel Boonham was unveiled outside in the cathedral churchyard.\nWritings.\nDonne's earliest poems showed a developed knowledge of English society coupled with sharp criticism of its problems. His satires dealt with common Elizabethan topics, such as corruption in the legal system, mediocre poets and pompous courtiers. His images of sickness, vomit, manure and plague reflected his strongly satiric view of a society populated by fools and knaves. His third satire, however, deals with the problem of true religion, a matter of great importance to Donne. He argued that it was better to examine carefully one's religious convictions than blindly to follow any established tradition, for none would be saved at the Final Judgment, by claiming \"A Harry, or a Martin taught [them] this.\"\nDonne's early career was also notable for his erotic poetry, especially his elegies, in which he employed unconventional metaphors, such as a flea biting two lovers being compared to sex. Donne did not publish these poems, although they circulated widely in manuscript form. One such, a previously unknown manuscript that is believed to be one of the largest contemporary collections of Donne's work (among that of others), was found at Melford Hall in November 2018.\nSome have speculated that Donne's numerous illnesses, financial strain and the deaths of his friends all contributed to the development of a more sombre and pious tone in his later poems. The change can be clearly seen in \"\" (1611), a poem that Donne wrote in memory of Elizabeth Drury, daughter of his patron, Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk. This poem treats Elizabeth's demise with extreme gloominess, using it as a symbol for the fall of man and the destruction of the universe.\nThe increasing gloominess of Donne's tone may also be observed in the religious works that he began writing during the same period. Having converted to the Anglican Church, Donne quickly became noted for his sermons and religious poems. Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death, and the fear that it inspired in many, on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X, \"Death Be Not Proud\".\nEven as he lay dying during Lent in 1631, he rose from his sickbed and delivered the Death's Duel sermon, which was later described as his own funeral sermon. Death's Duel portrays life as a steady descent to suffering and death; death becomes merely another process of life, in which the 'winding sheet' of the womb is the same as that of the grave. Hope is seen in salvation and immortality through an embrace of God, Christ and the Resurrection.\nStyle.\nHis work has received much criticism over the years, especially concerning his metaphysical form. Donne is generally considered the most prominent member of the metaphysical poets, a phrase coined in 1781 by Samuel Johnson, following a comment on Donne by John Dryden. Dryden had written of Donne in 1693: \"He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires, but in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses of love.\"\nIn \"Life of Cowley\" (from Samuel Johnson's 1781 work of biography and criticism \"Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets\"), Johnson refers to the beginning of the 17th century in which there \"appeared a race of writers that may be termed the metaphysical poets\". Donne's immediate successors in poetry therefore tended to regard his works with ambivalence, with the Neoclassical poets regarding his conceits as abuse of the metaphor. However, he was revived by Romantic poets such as Coleridge and Browning, though his more recent revival in the early 20th century by poets such as T. S. Eliot and critics like F. R. Leavis tended to portray him, with approval, as an anti-Romantic.\nDonne is considered a master of the metaphysical conceit, an extended metaphor that combines two vastly different ideas into a single idea, often using imagery. An example of this is his equation of lovers with saints in \"The Canonization\". Unlike the conceits found in other Elizabethan poetry, most notably Petrarchan conceits, which formed clich\u00e9d comparisons between more closely related objects (such as a rose and love), metaphysical conceits go to a greater depth in comparing two completely unlike objects. One of the most famous of Donne's conceits is found in \"\" where he compares the apartness of two separated lovers to the working of the legs of a compass.\nDonne's works are also witty, employing paradoxes, puns and subtle yet remarkable analogies. His pieces are often ironic and cynical, especially regarding love and human motives. Common subjects of Donne's poems are love (especially in his early life), death (especially after his wife's death) and religion.\nJohn Donne's poetry represented a shift from classical forms to more personal poetry. Donne is noted for his poetic metre, which was structured with changing and jagged rhythms that closely resemble casual speech (it was for this that the more classical-minded Ben Jonson commented that \"Donne, for not keeping of accent, deserved hanging\").\nSome scholars believe that Donne's literary works reflect the changing trends of his life, with love poetry and satires from his youth and religious sermons during his later years. Other scholars, such as Helen Gardner, question the validity of this dating\u2014most of his poems were published posthumously (1633). The exception to these is his \"Anniversaries\", which were published in 1612 and \"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions\" published in 1624. His sermons are also dated, sometimes specifically by date and year.\nLegacy.\nDonne is remembered in the Calendar of Saints of the Church of England, the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar and the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America for his life as both poet and priest. His commemoration is on 31 March.\nDuring his lifetime several likenesses were made of the poet. The earliest was the anonymous portrait of 1594 now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which was restored in 2012. One of the earliest Elizabethan portraits of an author, the fashionably dressed poet is shown darkly brooding on his love. The portrait was described in Donne's will as \"that picture of myne wych is taken in the shaddowes\", and bequeathed by him to Robert Kerr, 1st Earl of Ancram. Other paintings include a 1616 head and shoulders after Isaac Oliver, also in the National Portrait Gallery, and a 1622 head and shoulders in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1911, the young Stanley Spencer devoted a visionary painting to \"John Donne arriving in heaven\" (1911) which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum.\nDonne's reception until the 20th century was influenced by the publication of his writings in the 17th century. Because Donne avoided publication during his life, the majority of his works were brought to the press by others in the decades after his death. These publications present what Erin McCarthy calls a \"teleological narrative of Donne's growth\" from young rake \"Jack Donne\" to reverend divine \"Dr. Donne\". For example, while the first edition of \"Poems, by J. D.\" (1633) mingled amorous and pious verse indiscriminately, all editions after 1635 separated poems into \"Songs and Sonnets\" and \"Divine Poems\". This organization \"promulgated the tale of Jack Donne's transformation into Doctor Donne and made it the dominant way of understanding Donne's life and work.\"\nA similar effort to justify Donne's early writings appeared in the publication of his prose. This pattern can be seen in a 1652 volume that combines texts from throughout Donne's career, including flippant works like \"Ignatius His Conclave\" and more pious writings like \"Essays in Divinity.\" In the preface, Donne's son \"unifies the otherwise disparate texts around an impression of Donne's divinity\" by comparing his father's varied writing to Jesus' miracles. Christ \"\"began his first\" Miracle \"here\", \"by turning\" Water \"into\" Wine, \"and made it his last to ascend from\" Earth \"to\" Heaven.\"\nDonne first wrote \"\"things conducing to cheerfulness &amp; entertainment of\" Mankind,\" and later \"\"change[d] his conversation from\" Men \"to\" Angels.\" Another figure who contributed to Donne's legacy as a rake-turned-preacher was Donne's first biographer Izaak Walton. Walton's biography separated Donne's life into two stages, comparing Donne's life to the transformation of St. Paul. Walton writes, \"where [Donne] had been a Saul\u2026 in his irregular youth,\" he became \"a Paul, and preach[ed] salvation to his brethren.\"\nThe idea that Donne's writings reflect two distinct stages of his life remains common; however, many scholars have challenged this understanding. In 1948, Evelyn Simpson wrote, \"a close study of his works... makes it clear that his was no case of dual personality. He was not a Jekyll-Hyde in Jacobean dress... There is an essential unity underlying the flagrant and manifold contradictions of his temperament.\"\nIn literature.\nAfter Donne's death, a number of poetical tributes were paid to him, of which one of the principal (and most difficult to follow) was his friend Lord Herbert of Cherbury's \"Elegy for Doctor Donne\". Posthumous editions of Donne's poems were accompanied by several \"Elegies upon the Author\" over the course of the next two centuries. Six of these were written by fellow churchmen, others by such courtly writers as Thomas Carew, Sidney Godolphin and Endymion Porter. In 1963 came Joseph Brodsky's \"The Great Elegy for John Donne\".\nBeginning in the 20th century, several historical novels appeared taking as their subject various episodes in Donne's life. His courtship of Anne More is the subject of Elizabeth Gray Vining's \"Take Heed of Loving Me: A novel about John Donne\" (1963) and Maeve Haran's \"The Lady and the Poet\" (2010). Both characters also make interspersed appearances in Mary Novik's \"Conceit\" (2007), where the main focus is on their rebellious daughter Pegge. English treatments include Garry O'Connor's \"Death's Duel: a novel of John Donne\" (2015), which deals with the poet as a young man.\nHe also plays a significant role in Christie Dickason's \"The Noble Assassin\" (2012), a novel based on the life of Donne's patron and (the author claims) his lover, Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. Finally there is Bryan Crockett's \"Love's Alchemy: a John Donne Mystery\" (2015), in which the poet, blackmailed into service in Robert Cecil's network of spies, attempts to avert political disaster and at the same time outwit Cecil.\nMusical settings.\nThere were musical settings of Donne's lyrics even during his lifetime and in the century following his death. These included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger's (\"So, so, leave off this last lamenting kisse\" in his 1609 Ayres); John Cooper's (\"The Message\"); Henry Lawes' (\"Break of Day\"); John Dowland's (\"Break of Day\" and \"To ask for all thy love\"); and settings of \"A Hymn to God the Father\" by John Hilton the younger and Pelham Humfrey (published 1688).\nAfter the 17th century, there were no more until the start of the 20th century with Havergal Brian (\"A nocturnal on St Lucy's Day\", first performed in 1905), Eleanor Everest Freer (\"Break of Day, published in 1905) and Walford Davies (\"The Cross\", 1909) among the earliest. In 1916\u201318, the composer Hubert Parry set Donne's \"Holy Sonnet 7\" (\"At the round earth's imagined corners\") to music in his choral work, \"Songs of Farewell\". Regina Hansen Willman set Donne's \"First Holy Sonnet\" for voice and string trio. In 1945, Benjamin Britten set nine of Donne's Holy Sonnets in his song cycle for voice and piano \"The Holy Sonnets of John Donne\". in 1968, Williametta Spencer used Donne's text for her choral work \"At the Round Earth's Imagined Corners.\" Among them is also the choral setting of \"Negative Love\" that opens \"Harmonium\" (1981), as well as the aria setting of \"Holy Sonnet XIV\" at the end of the 1st act of \"Doctor Atomic\", both by John Adams.\nThere have been settings in popular music as well. One is the version of the song \"Go and Catch a Falling Star\" on John Renbourn's debut album \"John Renbourn\" (1966), in which the last line is altered to \"False, ere I count one, two, three\". On their 1992 album \"Duality\", the English Neoclassical dark wave band In the Nursery used a recitation of the entirety of Donne's \"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\" for the track \"Mecciano\" and an augmented version of \"A Fever\" for the track \"Corruption.\"\nProse texts by Donne have also been set to music. In 1954, Priaulx Rainier set some in her \"Cycle for Declamation\" for solo voice. In 2009, the American Jennifer Higdon composed the choral piece \"On the Death of the Righteous\", based on Donne's sermons. More recent is the Russian minimalist Anton Batagov's \" I Fear No More, selected songs and meditations of John Donne\" (2015).\nWorks.\nMost of Donne's works were published after his death.

{"id": "15839", "revid": "15361201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15839", "title": "Joey Ramone", "text": "American punk rock singer (1951\u20132001)\nJeffrey Ross Hyman (May 19, 1951 \u2013 April 15, 2001), known professionally as Joey Ramone, was an American singer, songwriter, and the lead vocalist and founding member of the punk rock band Ramones, with Johnny Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. His image, voice, and tenure with the Ramones made him a countercultural icon.\nBorn to a Jewish family in Queens, New York City, he was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and suffered a psychotic episode at age 18. After playing in the glam punk band Sniper from 1972 to 1974, Joey cofounded the Ramones in 1974. Initially the band's drummer, Joey switched to lead vocals shortly after the group's formation. Appearing on all the band's releases, he, along with guitarist Johnny Ramone, are the only two original members who stayed in the band until it disbanded in 1996.\nFollowing the Ramones' breakup, he embarked on a solo career before dying of lymphoma in 2001. His debut solo album \"Don't Worry About Me\" was released the following year.\nEarly life.\nJeffrey Ross Hyman was born on May 19, 1951, in Queens, New York City, to a Jewish family. His parents were Charlotte (\"n\u00e9e\" Mandell) and Noel Hyman. It has been claimed he was born with a parasitic twin growing out of his back, which was incompletely formed and surgically removed. He had a younger brother Mikey Leigh, who is also singer-songwriter. The family resided in Forest Hills, Queens, where Hyman and his future Ramones bandmates attended Forest Hills High School. Though generally a happy person, Hyman described himself as a misfit and loner as a child. He was diagnosed at 18 with obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. His striking physique has been attributed to Marfan syndrome and his health was often frail. His mother, Charlotte Lesher, owned an art gallery in Queens. After divorcing her first husband, Noel Hyman, she married again but was widowed when her second husband died in a car accident while she was on vacation.\nHyman began playing the drums when he was 13 years old. He was a fan of the Beatles, the Who, David Bowie, and the Stooges among other bands, particularly oldies and the Phil Spector-produced girl groups. The Who in particular inspired him when he saw them perform at the age of 16.\nCareer.\nSniper.\nIn 1972 Hyman joined the glam punk band Sniper. Sniper played at the Mercer Arts Center, Max's Kansas City and the Coventry, alongside New York Dolls, Suicide, and Queen Elizabeth III. Hyman played with Sniper under the name Jeff Starship.\nHyman continued playing with Sniper until early 1974, when he was replaced by Alan Turner.\nRamones.\nIn 1974, Jeffrey Hyman co-founded the punk rock band the Ramones with friends John Cummings and Douglas Colvin. Colvin was already using the pseudonym \"Dee Dee Ramone\" and the others also adopted stage names using \"Ramone\" as their surname: Cummings became Johnny Ramone and Hyman became Joey Ramone. The name \"Ramone\" stems from Paul McCartney: he briefly used the stage name \"Paul Ramon\" during 1960\u201361, when the Beatles, still an unknown five-piece band called the Silver Beetles, did a tour of Scotland and all took up pseudonyms; and again on the 1969 Steve Miller album \"Brave New World\", where he played the drums on one song using that name.\nRamone initially served as the group's drummer while Dee Dee Ramone was the original vocalist. However, when Dee Dee's vocal cords proved unable to sustain the demands of constant live performances, Ramone's manager Thomas Erdelyi suggested Joey switch to vocals. Mickey Leigh: I was shocked when the band came out. Joey was the lead singer and I couldn't believe how good he was. Because he'd been sitting in my house with my acoustic guitar, writing these songs like 'I Don't Care', fucking up my guitar, and suddenly he's this guy on stage who you can't take your eyes off of. After a series of unsuccessful auditions in search of a new drummer, Erdelyi took over on drums, assuming the name Tommy Ramone.\nIn a 1988 press bio, Ramone described the origin of the Ramones: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We decided to start our group because we were bored with everything we heard in the early '70s \u2013 there was nothing to listen to anymore. Everything was tenth generation Elton John or just junk. Everything was long jams, long guitar solos. We missed hearing songs that were short and exciting...and good! We wanted to bring energy back to rock &amp; roll.\u2014\u200a\nThe Ramones were a major influence on the punk rock movement in the United States, though they achieved only minor commercial success. Their only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold in Ramone's lifetime was the compilation album \"Ramones Mania\". Recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now represented in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the \"Rolling Stone\" lists of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and 25 Greatest Live Albums of All Time, VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and Mojo's 100 Greatest Albums. In 2002, the Ramones were voted the second greatest rock and roll band ever in \"Spin\", behind the Beatles.\nIn 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played its final show and then disbanded.\nOther projects.\nOne of Ramone's earliest side projects was with a band called The Seclusions in 1983. Ramone sang vocals alongside his brother Leigh on a cover of the song \"Nothing Can Change the Shape of Things to Come\" from the album \"Isolation For Creation\". Also appearing on the track were Jimmy Destri, Holly Beth Vincent, Jimmy Ripp, Busta Jones, and Jay Dee Daugherty.\nIn 1985, Ramone joined Steven Van Zandt's music industry activist group Artists United Against Apartheid, which campaigned against the Sun City resort in South Africa. Ramone and 49 other recording artists \u2013 including Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards, Lou Reed and Run DMC \u2013 collaborated on the song \"Sun City\", in which they pledged they would never perform at the resort.\nIn 1994, Ramone appeared on the Helen Love album \"Love and Glitter, Hot Days and Music\", singing the track \"Punk Boy\". Helen Love returned the favor, singing on Ramone's song \"Mr. Punchy\".\nIn October 1996, Ramone headlined the \"Rock the Reservation\" alternative rock festival in Tuba City, Arizona. \"Joey Ramone &amp; the Resistance\" (Daniel Rey on guitar, John Connor on bass guitar and Roger Murdock on drums) debuted Ramone's interpretation of Louis Armstrong's \"Wonderful World\" live, as well as Ramone's choice of Ramones classics and some of his other favorite songs, such as The Dave Clark Five's \"Any Way You Want It\", The Who's \"The Kids are Alright\" and The Stooges' \"No Fun\".\nRamone co-wrote and recorded the song \"Meatball Sandwich\" with Youth Gone Mad. For a short time before his death, he took the role of manager and producer for the punk rock band the Independents.\nHis last recording as a vocalist was backup vocals on the album \"One Nation Under\" by Navajo punk band Blackfire. He appeared on two tracks, \"What Do You See\" and \"Lying to Myself\".\nRamone produced the Ronnie Spector EP \"She Talks to Rainbows\" in 1999. It was critically acclaimed but was not very commercially successful. The title track was previously on the Ramones' final studio album, \"\u00a1Adios Amigos!\"\nVocal style.\nRamone's signature cracks, hiccups, snarls, crooning, and youthful voice made him one of punk rock's most recognizable voices. Allmusic.com wrote that \"Joey Ramone's signature bleat was the voice of punk rock in America.\" As his vocals matured and deepened through his career, so did the Ramones' songwriting, leaving a notable difference from his initial melodic and callow style \u2013 two notable tracks serving as examples are \"Somebody Put Something in My Drink\" and \"Mama's Boy\". Dee Dee Ramone was quoted as saying, \"All the other singers [in New York] were copying David Johansen (of the New York Dolls), who was copying Mick Jagger... But Joey was unique, totally unique.\"\nPersonal life.\nIn the late 1970s, Hyman began dating Linda Ramone. They had first met at CBGB in 1976, before meeting again a few years later in Los Angeles. The couple began dating and Linda would often travel with the Ramones when they toured to shows. They got engaged a couple years later. It is reported that Hyman and Linda had an argument about the engagement ring he bought her, and this fight is said to be the inspiration for the Ramones song \"Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)\". Linda and Hyman eventually split up after Linda began a relationship with Hyman's bandmate Johnny Ramone.\nOne of Hyman's favourite bands was Mot\u00f6rhead; he also liked AC/DC, The Georgia Satellites and The Dickies.\nIllness and death.\nIn 1995, Ramone was diagnosed with lymphoma. He kept his condition private until it was revealed on March 19, 2001, that he was battling the disease. In December 2000, Ramone had a fall that broke his hip and was hospitalized. His condition deteriorated after the fall. He died of the illness at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on April 15, 2001, aged 49. He was reportedly listening to the song \"In a Little While\" by U2 when he died. In an interview in 2014 for Radio 538, U2 lead singer Bono stated that Joey Ramone's family had told him this; later, Joey's friend Andy Shernoff (of The Dictators) also confirmed it. Joey's funeral was attended by former bandmates Tommy, Richie and C. J. Ramone, along with Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie, and Joan Jett. Joey is interred at New Mount Zion Cemetery in Lyndhurst, New Jersey.\nHis solo album \"Don't Worry About Me\" was released posthumously in 2002, and features the single \"What a Wonderful World\", a cover of the Louis Armstrong standard. MTV News said: \"With his trademark rose-colored shades, black leather jacket, shoulder-length hair, ripped jeans and alternately snarling and crooning vocals, Joey was the iconic godfather of punk.\" \"MOJO\" wrote an obituary for Ramone and said: \"[that he] came to be the supreme icon of punk rock is proof of how much one determined misfit can change the world\".\nLegacy.\nContinued popularity.\nJoey Ramone is regarded as one of the greatest influences in the history of punk music. In a commerorative 2001 article for \"PopMatters\", Devon Powers writes that \"he also popularised and solidified the blueprint of a musical form which broke rock and roll irreparably.\"\nIn 2022, Brookfield Asset Management acquired a majority stake in the music-publishing rights of Ramone for around US$10 million.\nTributes.\nOn November 30, 2003, a block of East 2nd Street in New York City was officially renamed Joey Ramone Place. It is the block where Hyman once lived with bandmate Dee Dee Ramone and is near the former site of the music club CBGB, where the Ramones began their career. Hyman's birthday is celebrated annually during the \"Joey Ramone Birthday Bash\", hosted in New York City by his brother and, until 2007, his mother, Charlotte.\nIn September 2010, the Associated Press reported that the \"Joey Ramone Place,\" road sign was New York City's most stolen sign. Later, the sign was moved to above ground level. Drummer Marky Ramone thought Joey would appreciate that his sign would be the most stolen, adding \"Now you have to be an NBA player to see it.\"\nIn 2002 Tommy, C. J., and Marky Ramone and Daniel Rey recorded Jed Davis' Joey Ramone tribute album, \"The Bowery Electric\".\nAppearances in lists of influential people.\nThe Ramones were named as inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2002.\nAfter several years in development, Ramone's second posthumous album was released on May 22, 2012. Titled \"...Ya Know?\", it was preceded on Record Store Day by a 7\" single re-release of \"Blitzkrieg Bop\"/\"Havana Affair\".\nPortrayal in film and television.\nJoey Ramone was portrayed by Joel David Moore, as a supporting character, in the 2013 biographical film \"CBGB\".\nOn April 15, 2021, the 20th anniversary of Ramone's death, it was announced that Pete Davidson would portray Ramone in the upcoming Netflix biopic, \"I Slept with Joey Ramone,\" based on the memoir of the same name written by Ramone's brother Mickey Leigh, an executive producer on the project, in collaboration with Ramone's estate. The treatment was written and developed by Davidson and director Jason Orley.\nIn late 2024, it was reported that the biopic project had stalled in response to a legal ruling that had come as the result of a lawsuit filed by Linda Ramone, Johnny Ramone's widow.\nDiscography.\nSolo.\nAlbum\nEP\nSingles\nOther appearances\nWith Sibling Rivalry.\nEP\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "15852", "revid": "3116621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15852", "title": "John Lennon", "text": "English musician and activist (1940\u20131980)\nJohn Winston Ono Lennon (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940\u00a0\u2013\u00a08 December 1980) was an English musician and activist. He gained global fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.\nBorn in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He initially was the group's \"de facto\" leader, a role he gradually seemed to cede to McCartney, writing and co-writing songs with increasing innovation, including \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", which he later cited as his finest work with the band. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including \"How I Won the War\" (1967), and authoring \"In His Own Write\" (1964) and \"A Spaniard in the Works\" (1965), both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with \"All You Need Is Love\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the counterculture of the 1960s.\nIn 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration bed-in for peace, and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career. Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums and several more films. After the Beatles disbanded, Lennon released his solo debut \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" and the international top-10 singles \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Instant Karma!\", \"Imagine\", and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year deportation attempt by the Nixon administration. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, during which time he produced Harry Nilsson's album \"Pussy Cats\". He also had chart-topping collaborations with Elton John (\"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\") and David Bowie (\"Fame\"). Following a five-year hiatus, Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration \"Double Fantasy\". He was shot and killed by Mark David Chapman, three weeks after the album's release.\nAs a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number-one singles in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. \"Double Fantasy\", his second-best-selling non-Beatles album, won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. That year, he won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC history poll of the \"100 Greatest Britons\". \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and 38th-greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).\nEarly years: 1940\u20131956.\nJohn Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital, the only child of Alfred and Julia Lennon (n\u00e9e Stanley). Alfred was a merchant seaman of Irish descent who was away at the time of his son's birth. His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944. When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected the idea. After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon.\nIn July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them \u2013 with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins \u2013 and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her. According to author Mark Lewisohn, however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. Billy Hall, who witnessed the incident, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate. Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.\nThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at Mendips, 251Menlove Avenue, Woolton, with Mimi and her husband George Toogood Smith, who had no children of their own. His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving crossword puzzles. Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and John often visited her at 1 Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him Elvis Presley records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play \"Ain't That a Shame\" by Fats Domino. In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe regularly visited his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas. During the school holidays Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey, another cousin, and the three often travelled to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows. They would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine, Arthur Askey, Max Bygraves and Joe Loss, with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked George Formby. After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled, \"John, cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at Durness, which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16.\" Lennon's uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955, aged 52.\nLennon was raised as an Anglican and attended Dovedale Primary School. After passing his eleven-plus exam, he attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool from September 1952 to 1957, and was described by Harvey at the time as a \"happy-go-lucky, good-humoured, easy going, lively lad\". However, he was also known to frequently engage in fights, bully and disrupt classes. Despite this, he quickly built a reputation as the class clown and often drew comical cartoons that appeared in his self-made school magazine, the \"Daily Howl\".\nIn 1956, Julia bought John his first guitar. The instrument was an inexpensive Gallotone Champion acoustic for which she lent her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations. Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, \"The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.\"\nLennon's senior school years were marked by a shift in his behaviour. Teachers at Quarry Bank High School described him thus: \"He has too many wrong ambitions and his energy is often misplaced\", and \"His work always lacks effort. He is content to 'drift' instead of using his abilities.\" Lennon's misbehaviour created a rift in his relationship with his aunt.\nOn 15 July 1958, at the age of 44, Julia Lennon was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house. His mother's death traumatised the teenage Lennon, who, for the next two years, drank heavily and frequently got into fights, consumed by a \"blind rage\". Julia's memory would later serve as a major creative inspiration for Lennon, inspiring songs such as the 1968 Beatles song \"Julia\".\nLennon failed his O-level examinations, and was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art after his aunt and headmaster intervened. At the college he began to wear Teddy Boy clothes and was threatened with expulsion for his behaviour. In the description of Cynthia Powell, Lennon's fellow student and subsequently his wife, he was \"thrown out of the college before his final year\".\nLennon faced significant challenges throughout his education due to dyslexia, which negatively affected his reading and writing skills. Lennon's academic performance was poor, and was often described as a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d in the classroom. While he was drawn to art and music from a young age, his struggles with dyslexia negatively impacted his studies and ultimately resulted in his expulsion from the Liverpool College of Art.\nThe Quarrymen to the Beatles: 1956\u20131970.\nFormation, fame and touring: 1956\u20131966.\nAt the age of 15, Lennon formed a skiffle group, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956. By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll. Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St Peter's Church garden f\u00eate. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.\nMcCartney said that Aunt Mimi \"was very aware that John's friends were lower class\", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon. According to McCartney's brother Mike, their father similarly disapproved of Lennon, declaring that Lennon would get his son \"into trouble\". McCartney's father nevertheless allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the family's front room at 20Forthlin Road. During this time Lennon wrote his first song, \"Hello Little Girl\", which became a UK top 10 hit for the Fourmost in 1963.\nMcCartney recommended that his friend George Harrison become the lead guitarist. Lennon thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played \"Raunchy\" for Lennon and was asked to join. Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became \"The Beatles\" in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles were engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, in West Germany, and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them. Lennon's aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead. After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.\nBrian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\" McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \"Love Me Do\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, \"Please Please Me\", in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \"Twist and Shout\". The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \"We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that \u2013 to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \"He was like our own little Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.\"\nThe Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April. During their Royal Variety Show performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery.\" After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, filmmaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, \"In His Own Write\" and \"A Spaniard in the Works\". The Beatles received recognition from the British establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.\nLennon grew concerned that fans who attended Beatles concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. Lennon's \"Help!\" expressed his own feelings in 1965: \"I \"meant\" it... It was me singing 'help'\". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his \"Fat Elvis\" period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change. A hurtful comment from a reporter would lead him to undergo several bouts with weight loss and appearance changes throughout the rest of his life. In March that year he and Harrison were unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by the two musicians and their partners, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug. When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later, in a lift at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire; Lennon recalled: \"We were all screaming... hot and hysterical.\"\n In March 1966, during an interview with \"Evening Standard\" reporter Maureen Cleave, Lennon remarked, \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink... We're more popular than Jesus now \u2013 I don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later. The furore that followed, which included the burning of Beatles records, Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against Lennon, contributed to the band's decision to stop touring.\nStudio years, break-up and solo work: 1966\u20131970.\nAfter the band's final concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon filmed the anti-war black comedy \"How I Won the War\" \u2013 his only appearance in a non-Beatles feature film \u2013 before rejoining his bandmates for an extended period of recording, beginning in November. Lennon had increased his use of LSD and, according to author Ian MacDonald, his continuous use of the drug in 1967 brought him \"close to erasing his identity\". The year 1967 saw the release of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", hailed by \"Time\" magazine for its \"astonishing inventiveness\", and the group's landmark album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which revealed lyrics by Lennon that contrasted strongly with the simple love songs of the group's early years.\nIn late June, the Beatles performed Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\" as Britain's contribution to the \"Our World\" satellite broadcast, before an international audience estimated at up to 400\u00a0million. Intentionally simplistic in its message, the song formalised his pacifist stance and provided an anthem for the Summer of Love. After the Beatles were introduced to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the group attended an August weekend of personal instruction at his Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor, Wales. During the seminar, they were informed of Epstein's death. \"I knew we were in trouble then\", Lennon said later. \"I didn't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music. I was scared \u2013 I thought, 'We've fucking had it now.'\" McCartney organised the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film \"Magical Mystery Tour\", which was released in December that year. While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop, its soundtrack release, featuring Lennon's Lewis Carroll\u2013inspired \"I Am the Walrus\", was a success.\nLed by Harrison and Lennon's interest, the Beatles travelled to the Maharishi's ashram in India in February 1968 for further guidance. While there, they composed most of the songs for their double album \"The Beatles\", but the band members' mixed experience with Transcendental Meditation signalled a sharp divergence in the group's camaraderie. On their return to London, they became increasingly involved in business activities with the formation of Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies. Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve \"artistic freedom within a business structure\". Released amid the Protests of 1968, the band's debut single for the Apple label included Lennon's B-side \"Revolution\", in which he called for a \"plan\" rather than committing to Maoist revolution. The song's pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the New Left press. Adding to the tensions at the Beatles' recording sessions that year, Lennon insisted on having his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono, beside him, thereby contravening the band's policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio. He was especially pleased with his songwriting contributions to the double album and identified it as a superior work to \"Sgt. Pepper\". At the end of 1968, Lennon participated in \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\", a television special that was not broadcast. Lennon performed with the Dirty Mac, a supergroup composed of Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell. The group also backed a vocal performance by Ono. A film version was released in 1996.\nBy late 1968, Lennon's increased drug use and growing preoccupation with Ono, combined with the Beatles' inability to agree on how the company should be run, left Apple in need of professional management. Lennon asked Lord Beeching to take on the role but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon was approached by Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion. In early 1969, Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr, but McCartney never signed the management contract.\nLennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969 and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called \"Bag One\" depicting scenes from their honeymoon, eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated. Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles, and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: ' (known more for its cover than for its music), ' and \"Wedding Album\". In 1969, they formed the Plastic Ono Band, releasing \"Live Peace in Toronto 1969\". Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles \"Give Peace a Chance\", which was widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam War anthem, \"Cold Turkey\", which documented his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin, and \"Instant Karma!\".\nIn protest at Britain's involvement in \"the Nigeria-Biafra thing\" (namely, the Nigerian Civil War), its support of America in the Vietnam War and (perhaps jokingly) against \"Cold Turkey\" slipping down the charts, Lennon returned his MBE medal to the Queen. This gesture had no effect on his MBE status, which could be renounced but ultimately only the Sovereign has the power to annul the original award. The medal, together with Lennon's letter, is held at the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood.\nLennon left the Beatles on 20 September 1969, but agreed not to inform the media while the group renegotiated their recording contract. He was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970. Lennon's reaction was, \"Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!\" He later wrote, \"I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that.\" In a December 1970 interview with Jann Wenner of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, \"I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record.\" Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison and Starr \"got fed up with being sidemen for Paul\u00a0... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?\"\nSolo career: 1970\u20131980.\nInitial solo success and activism: 1970\u20131972.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system's game. The establishment will irritate you \u2013 pull your beard, flick your face \u2013 to make you fight. Because once they've got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don't know how to handle is non-violence and humor.\n\u2014John Lennon\nBetween 1 April and 15 September 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov at Tittenhurst, in London and at Janov's clinic in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for six months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but their American visa ran out and they had to return to the UK. Lennon's debut solo album, \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. The album featured the song \"Mother\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \"Working Class Hero\", an attack on Western social systems which, due to the lyrics \"you're so fucking crazy\" and \"you're still fucking peasants\", fell foul of broadcasters.\nIn January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \"Power to the People\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \"Revolution\", although he later disowned \"Power to the People\", saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved in a protest against the prosecution of \"Oz\" magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \"disgusting fascism\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \"God Save Us/Do the Oz\" and joined marches in support of the magazine.\nEager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, \"Imagine\" (1971). \"Rolling Stone\" reported that \"it contains a substantial portion of good music\" but warned of the possibility that \"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \"How Do You Sleep?\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics on \"Ram\" that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono. In \"Jealous Guy\", Lennon addressed his demeaning treatment of women, acknowledging that his past behaviour was a result of long-held insecurity.\nIn gratitude for his guitar contributions to \"Imagine\", Lennon initially agreed to perform at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York. Harrison refused to allow Ono to participate at the concerts, however, which resulted in the couple having a heated argument and Lennon pulling out of the event.\nLennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \"strategic counter-measure\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.\n\"Some Time in New York City\" was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The \"NME\"'s review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\". In the US, \"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on \"The Dick Cavett Show\". Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \"nigger\".\nLennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Ono's song \"Death of Samantha\" was inspired by the incident.\n\"Lost weekend\": 1973\u20131975.\nAs Lennon was about to record \"Mind Games\" in 1973, he and Ono decided to separate. The ensuing 18-month period apart, which he later called his \"lost weekend\" in reference to the film of the same name, was spent in Los Angeles and New York City in the company of May Pang. \"Mind Games\", credited to the \"Plastic U.F.Ono Band\", was released in November 1973. Lennon also contributed \"I'm the Greatest\" to Starr's album \"Ringo\" (1973), released the same month. With Harrison joining Starr and Lennon at the recording session for the song, it marked the only occasion when three former Beatles recorded together between the band's break-up and Lennon's death.\nIn early 1974, Lennon was drinking heavily and his alcohol-fuelled antics with Harry Nilsson made headlines. In March, two widely publicised incidents occurred at The Troubadour club. In the first incident, Lennon stuck an unused menstrual pad on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress. The second incident occurred two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers. Lennon decided to produce Nilsson's album \"Pussy Cats\", and Pang rented a Los Angeles beach house for all the musicians. After a month of further debauchery, the recording sessions were in chaos, and Lennon returned to New York with Pang to finish work on the album. In April, Lennon had produced the Mick Jagger song \"Too Many Cooks (Spoil the Soup)\" which was, for contractual reasons, to remain unreleased for more than 30 years. Pang supplied the recording for its eventual inclusion on \"The Very Best of Mick Jagger\" (2007).\nLennon had settled back in New York when he recorded the album \"Walls and Bridges\". Released in October 1974, it included \"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\", which featured Elton John on backing vocals and piano, and became Lennon's only single as a solo artist to top the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart during his lifetime. A second single from the album, \"#9 Dream\", followed before the end of the year. Starr's \"Goodnight Vienna\" (1974) again saw assistance from Lennon, who wrote the title track and played piano. On 28 November, Lennon made a surprise guest appearance at Elton John's Thanksgiving concert at Madison Square Garden, in fulfilment of his promise to join the singer in a live show if \"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\", a song whose commercial potential Lennon had doubted, reached number one. Lennon performed the song along with \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"I Saw Her Standing There\", which he introduced as \"a song by an old estranged fianc\u00e9 of mine called Paul\".\nIn the first two weeks of January 1975, Elton John topped the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart with his cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", featuring Lennon on guitar and backing vocals - Lennon is credited on the single under the moniker of \"Dr. Winston O'Boogie\". As January became February, Lennon and Ono reunited as Lennon and Bowie completed recording of their co-composition \"Fame\", which became David Bowie's first US number one, featuring guitar and backing vocals by Lennon. In February, Lennon released \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (1975), an album of cover songs. \"Stand by Me\", taken from the album and a US and UK hit, became his last single for five years. He made what would be his final stage appearance in the ATV special \"A Salute to Lew Grade\", recorded on 18 April and televised in June. Playing acoustic guitar and backed by an eight-piece band, Lennon performed two songs from \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (\"Stand by Me\", which was not broadcast, and \"Slippin' and Slidin'\") followed by \"Imagine\". The band, known as Etc., wore masks behind their heads, a dig by Lennon, who thought Grade was two-faced.\nHiatus and return: 1975\u20131980.\nLennon began what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry, during which time, he later said, he \"baked bread\" and \"looked after the baby\". He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote \"Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)\" for Starr's \"Ringo's Rotogravure\" (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980.\nSean Lennon, Lennon's only child with Ono, was born on 9 October 1975 (Lennon's thirty-fifth birthday), after which Lennon took on the role of househusband. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, \"we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby as much as we can until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family.\" During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed \"mad stuff\", all of which would be published posthumously.\nLennon emerged from his hiatus in October 1980, when he released the single \"(Just Like) Starting Over\". In November, he and Ono released the album \"Double Fantasy\", which included songs Lennon had written in Bermuda. In June, Lennon chartered a 43-foot sailboat and embarked on a sailing trip to Bermuda. En route, he and the crew encountered a storm, rendering everyone on board seasick, except Lennon, who took control and sailed the boat through the storm. This experience re-invigorated him and his creative muse. He spent three weeks in Bermuda in a home called Fairylands writing and refining the tracks for the upcoming album.\nThe music reflected Lennon's fulfilment in his new-found stable family life. Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned follow-up album \"Milk and Honey\", which was issued posthumously, in 1984. \"Double Fantasy\" was not well received initially and drew comments such as \"Melody Maker\"'s \"indulgent sterility... a godawful yawn\".\nMurder.\nIn New York, at approximately 5:00\u00a0p.m. on 8 December 1980, Lennon autographed a copy of \"Double Fantasy\" for Mark David Chapman before leaving The Dakota with Ono for a recording session at the Record Plant. After the session, Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota in a limousine at around 10:50p.m. (EST). They left the vehicle and walked through the archway of the building. Chapman then shot Lennon twice in the back and twice in the shoulder at close range. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser to the emergency room of Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:15p.m. (EST); he was 40 years old.\nOno issued a statement the next day, saying \"There is no funeral for John. Later in the week we will set the time for a silent vigil to pray for his soul. We invite you to participate from wherever you are at the time.\" She requested that instead of flowers, people could donate to Lennon's personal charitable foundation, the Spirit Foundation. \"John loved and prayed for the human race. Please pray the same for him. Love. Yoko and Sean.\" His remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Ono scattered his ashes in New York's Central Park, where the Strawberry Fields memorial was later created. Chapman avoided going to trial when he ignored his lawyer's advice and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years to life.\nIn the weeks following the murder, \"(Just Like) Starting Over\" and \"Double Fantasy\" topped the charts in the UK and the US. \"Imagine\" hit number one in the UK in January 1981 and \"Happy Xmas\" peaked at number two. \"Imagine\" was succeeded at the top of the UK chart by \"Woman\", the second single from \"Double Fantasy\". Later that year, Roxy Music's cover version of \"Jealous Guy\", recorded as a tribute to Lennon, was also a UK number-one.\nPersonal relationships.\nCynthia Lennon.\nLennon met Cynthia Powell (1939\u20132015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he shouted, \"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him.\nLennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger. In her 2005 memoir \"John\", Powell recalled that, when they were dating, Lennon once struck her after he observed her dancing with Stuart Sutcliffe. She ended their relationship as a result, until three months later, when Lennon apologised and asked to reunite. She took him back and later noted that he was never again physically abusive towards her, although he could still be \"verbally cutting and unkind\". Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude towards women. He said that the Beatles song \"Getting Better\" told his (or his peers') own story. \"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically \u2013 any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace\".\nRecalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.\nCynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After spending a holiday in Greece, Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood to find Lennon sitting on the floor with Ono in terrycloth robes and left the house to stay with friends, feeling shocked and humiliated. A few weeks later, Alexis Mardas informed Powell that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian. She received a letter stating that Lennon was doing so on the grounds of her adultery with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, an accusation which Powell denied. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds (adultery). The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her \u00a3100,000, a small annual payment, and custody of Julian.\nBrian Epstein.\nThe Beatles were performing at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 when they were introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual and closeted, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Later biographer Mark Lewisohn called the claim unsubstantiated and wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Suggestions that it was \"only\" homoerotic fantasy that drew Brian Epstein to the Beatles are distortion... and perform a malign disservice to both him and them. It may have been part of the mix, but he was, above all else, simply the latest in an ever-lengthening line of people seduced by the Beatles' singular mix of talents.\nAlmost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a caf\u00e9 in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this.\" Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying \"How was your honeymoon, John?\" The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. Lennon was drunk. He later said: \"He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in.\"\nLennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish. When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered \"Queer Jew\"; on learning of the eventual title, \"A Cellarful of Noise\", he parodied, \"More like \"A Cellarful of Boys\"\". He demanded of a visitor to Epstein's flat, \"Have you come to blackmail him? If not, you're the only bugger in London who hasn't.\" During the recording of \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\", he sang altered choruses of \"Baby, you're a rich fag Jew\".\nJulian Lennon.\nDuring his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \"Hey Jules\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \"Hey Jude\". Lennon later said, \"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\"\nLennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a \"Walls and Bridges\" track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \"got on a great deal better\" during the time he spent in New York: \"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.\"\nIn a \"Playboy\" interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, \"Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will.\" He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, \"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.\" After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.\nYoko Ono.\nLennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer A Nail\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" According to Lennon's recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles, but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon said he replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work \"Apple\", much to her fury.\nOno began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \"avant-garde bullshit\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the \"Two Virgins\" album, after which, he said, they \"made love at dawn\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \"Oh, hi.\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.\nTwo years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long bed-in. They planned another bed-in in the United States, but were denied entry, so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\". They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \"Bagism\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building, where the Beatles had performed their rooftop concert three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, some official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire. After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' album, \"Abbey Road\".\nOno and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on Bank Street, Greenwich Village. Looking for somewhere with better security, they relocated in 1973 to the more secure Dakota overlooking Central Park at 1West72nd Street.\nMay Pang.\nABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"lost weekend\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson.\nIn June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In February 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.\nSean Lennon.\nSean Ono Lennon was born on 9 October 1975, his father's 35th birthday. Ono had previously suffered three miscarriages in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. After Ono and Lennon were reunited, she became pregnant again. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on the condition that Lennon adopt the role of househusband, which he agreed to do.\nFollowing Sean's birth, Lennon's subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as \"Real Love: The Drawings for Sean\". Lennon later proudly declared, \"He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\"\nFormer Beatles.\nWhile Lennon remained consistently friendly with Starr during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 \"Dark Horse\" tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published \"I, Me, Mine\", an autobiography that Lennon felt made little mention of him. Lennon told \"Playboy\", \"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\"\nLennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \"How Do You Sleep?\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and, on one occasion in 1974, even recorded music together (later bootlegged as \"A Toot and a Snore in '74\") before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" in which Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. According to Lennon, the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but they were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono... That ain't bad picking.\"\nAlong with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death, according to Fred Seaman, Lennon and Ono's assistant at the time, Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released \"Coming Up\" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. \"It's driving me crackers!\" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, \"I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on.\"\nPolitical activism.\nLennon and Ono used their honeymoon as a bed-in at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel; the March 1969 event attracted worldwide media ridicule. During a second bed-in three months later at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Lennon wrote and recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\". Released as a single, the song was quickly interpreted as an anti-war anthem and sung by a quarter of a million demonstrators against the Vietnam War in Washington,\u00a0DC, on 15 November, the second Vietnam Moratorium Day. In December, they paid for billboards in 10 cities around the world which declared, in the national language, \"War Is Over! If You Want It\".\nDuring the year, Lennon and Ono began to support efforts by the family of James Hanratty to prove his innocence. Hanratty had been hanged in 1962. According to Lennon, those who had condemned Hanratty were \"the same people who are running guns to South Africa and killing blacks in the streets\u00a0... The same bastards are in control, the same people are running everything, it's the whole bullshit bourgeois scene.\" In London, Lennon and Ono staged a \"Britain Murdered Hanratty\" banner march and a \"Silent Protest For James Hanratty\", and produced a 40-minute documentary on the case. At an appeal hearing more than thirty years later, Hanratty's conviction was upheld after DNA evidence was found to match, validating those who condemned him.\nLennon and Ono showed their solidarity with the Clydeside UCS workers' work-in of 1971 by sending a bouquet of red roses and a cheque for \u00a35,000. On moving to New York City in August that year, they befriended two of the Chicago Seven, Yippie peace activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman. Another political activist, John Sinclair, poet and co-founder of the White Panther Party, was serving ten years in prison for selling two joints of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of the drug. In December 1971 at Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15,000 people attended the \"John Sinclair Freedom Rally\", a protest and benefit concert with contributions from Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger, Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, and others. Lennon and Ono, backed by David Peel and Jerry Rubin, performed an acoustic set of four songs from their forthcoming \"Some Time in New York City\" album including \"John Sinclair\", whose lyrics called for his release. The day before the rally, the Michigan Senate passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later Sinclair was released on an appeal bond. The performance was recorded and two of the tracks later appeared on \"John Lennon Anthology\" (1998).\nFollowing the Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland in 1972, Lennon said that given the choice between the British army and the IRA he would side with the latter. Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for their \"Some Time in New York City\" album: \"The Luck of the Irish\" and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". In 2000, David Shayler, a former member of Britain's domestic security service MI5, suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA, though this was swiftly denied by Ono. Biographer Bill Harry records that following Bloody Sunday, Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film \"The Irish Tapes\", a political documentary with an Irish Republican slant. In February 2000 Lennon's cousin Stanley Parkes stated that the singer had given money to the IRA during the 1970s. After the events of Bloody Sunday Lennon and Ono attended a protest in London while displaying a \"Red Mole\" newspaper with the headline \"For the IRA, Against British Imperialism\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOur society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I'm liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it.\n\u2014John Lennon\nAccording to FBI surveillance reports, and confirmed by Tariq Ali in 2006, Lennon was sympathetic to the International Marxist Group, a Trotskyist group formed in Britain in 1968. However, the FBI considered Lennon to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary, as he was \"constantly under the influence of narcotics\".\nIn 1972, Lennon contributed a drawing and limerick titled \"Why Make It Sad to Be Gay?\" to Len Richmond and Gary Noguera's \"The Gay Liberation Book\". Lennon's last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980. He and Ono planned to join the workers' protest on 14 December.\nDeportation attempt.\nFollowing the impact of \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" on the anti-war movement, the Nixon administration heard rumours of Lennon's involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the 1972 Republican National Convention and tried to have him deported. Nixon believed that Lennon's anti-war activities could cost him his reelection; Republican Senator Strom Thurmond suggested in a February 1972 memo that \"deportation would be a strategic counter-measure\" against Lennon. The next month the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began deportation proceedings, arguing that his 1968 misdemeanour conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the United States. Lennon spent the next &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 years in and out of deportation hearings until 8 October 1975, when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt, stating \"the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds\". While the legal battle continued, Lennon attended rallies and made television appearances. He and Ono co-hosted \"The Mike Douglas Show\" for a week in February 1972, introducing guests such as Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale to mid-America. In 1972, Bob Dylan wrote a letter to the INS defending Lennon, stating:\nJohn and Yoko add a great voice and drive to the country's so-called art institution. They inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so, only help others to see pure light and in doing that, put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media. Hurray for John and Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!\nOn 23 March 1973, Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days. Ono, meanwhile, was granted permanent residence. In response, Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association, where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia; a place with \"no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people\". Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), they asked for political asylum in the US. The press conference was filmed, and appeared in a 2006 documentary, \"The U.S. vs. John Lennon\". Soon after the press conference, Nixon's involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington, D.C.. They led to the president's resignation 14 months later. In December 1974, when he and members of his tour entourage visited the White House, Harrison asked Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor, to intercede in the matter. Ford's administration showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon, and the deportation order was overturned in 1975. The following year, Lennon received his green card certifying his permanent residency, and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.\nFBI surveillance and declassified documents.\nAfter Lennon's death, historian Jon Wiener filed a Freedom of Information Act request for FBI files that documented the Bureau's role in the deportation attempt. The FBI admitted it had 281 pages of files on Lennon, but refused to release most of them on the grounds that they contained national security information. In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages. The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the Ninth Circuit in 1991. The Justice Department appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case. In 1997, respecting President Bill Clinton's newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve \"foreseeable harm\", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.\nWiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. \"Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files\" contained facsimiles of the documents, including \"lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges\". The story is told in the documentary \"The US vs. John Lennon\". The final 10 documents in Lennon's FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing \"national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality\", were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.\nWriting.\nBeatles biographer Bill Harry wrote that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the \"Daily Howl\". The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the \"Daily Howl\" to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon \"had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up\", and in Lennon's story \"A Carrot in a Potato Mine\", \"the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog \u2013 also wearing glasses\".\nLennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that \"In His Own Write\" (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about\". Like the \"Daily Howl\" it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail \u2013 until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock\". \"The Times Literary Supplement\" considered the poems and stories \"remarkable\u00a0... also very funny\u00a0... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". \"Book Week\" reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me\".\nIn combination with \"A Spaniard in the Works\" (1965), \"In His Own Write\" formed the basis of the stage play \"\", co-adapted by Victor Spinetti and Adrienne Kennedy. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the National Theatre, Sir Laurence Olivier, the play opened at The Old Vic in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together. In 1969, Lennon wrote \"Four in Hand\", a skit based on his teenage experiences of group masturbation, for Kenneth Tynan's play \"Oh! Calcutta!\" After Lennon's death, further works were published, including \"Skywriting by Word of Mouth\" (1986), \"Ai: Japan Through John Lennon's Eyes: A Personal Sketchbook\" (1992), with Lennon's illustrations of the definitions of Japanese words, and \"Real Love: The Drawings for Sean\" (1999). \"The Beatles Anthology\" (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.\nArt.\nIn 1967, Lennon, who had attended art school, funded and anonymously participated in Ono's art exhibition Half-A-Room that was held at Lisson Gallery. Following his collaborating with Ono in the form of The Plastic Ono Band that began in 1968, Lennon became involved with the Fluxus art movement. In the summer of 1968, Lennon began showing his painting and conceptual art at his You Are Here art exhibition held at Robert Fraser Gallery in London. The show, that was dedicated to Ono, included a six foot in diameter round white monochrome painting called \"You Are Here\" (1968). Besides the white monochrome paint, its surface contained only the tiny hand written inscription \"you are here\". This painting, and the show in general, was conceived as a response to Ono's conceptual art piece \"This is Not Here\" (1966) that was part of her Fluxus installation of wall text pieces called \"Blue Room Event\" (1966). \"Blue Room Event\" consisted of sentences that Ono wrote directly on her white New York apartment walls and ceiling. Lennon's You Are Here show also included sixty charity collection boxes, a pair of Lennon's shoes with a sign that read \"I take my shoes off to you\", a ready made black bike (an apparent homage to Marcel Duchamp and his 1917 Bicycle Wheel), an overturned white hat labeled \"For The Artist\", and a large glass jar full of free-to-take \"you are here\" white pin badges. A hidden camera secretly filmed the public reaction to the show. For the 1 July opening, Lennon, dressed all in white (as was Ono), released 365 white balloons into the city sky. Each ballon had attached to it a small paper card to be mailed back to Lennon at the Robert Fraser Gallery at 69 Duke Street, with the finder's comments.\nAfter moving to New York City, from 18 April to 12 June 1970, Lennon and Ono presented a series of Fluxus conceptual art events and concerts at Joe Jones's Tone Deaf Music Store called \"GRAPEFRUIT FLUXBANQUET\". Performances included \"Come Impersonating John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono, Grapefruit Banquet\" and \"Portrait of John Lennon as a Young Cloud by Yoko + Everybody\". That same year, Lennon also made \"The Complete Yoko Ono Word Poem Game\" (1970): a conceptual art poem collage that utilized the cut-up (or \"d\u00e9coup\u00e9\") aleatory technique typical of the work of John Cage and many Fluxus artists. The cut-up technique can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs. For \"The Complete Yoko Ono Word Poem Game\", Lennon took the portrait photo of himself that was included in the packaging of the 1968 \"The Beatles\" LP (aka \"The White Album\") and cut it into 134 small rectangles. A single word was written on the back of each fragment, to be read in any order. The portrait image was meant to be reassembled in any order. \"The Complete Yoko Ono Word Poem Game\" was presented by Lennon to Ono on 28 July in an inscribed envelope for her to randomly assemble and reassemble at will.\nLennon made whimsical drawings and fine art prints on occasion until the end of his life. For example, he drew a 1968 comic for the macrobiotic magazine \"Harmony\" and one printed inside the sleeve of his \"Wedding Album\" (1969). Lennon exhibited at Eugene Schuster's London Arts Gallery his \"Bag One\" lithographs in an exhibition that included several depicting erotic imagery. The show opened on 15 January 1970 and 24 hours later it was raided by police officers who confiscated 8 of the 14 lithos on the grounds of indecency. The lithographs had been drawn by Lennon in 1969 chronicling his wedding and honeymoon with Yoko Ono and one of their bed-ins staged in the interests of world peace.\nIn 1969, Lennon appeared in the Yoko Ono Fluxus art film \"Self-Portrait\", which consisted of a single forty-minute shot of Lennon's penis. The film was premiered at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. In 1971, Lennon made an experimental art film called \"Erection\" that was edited on 16 mm film by George Maciunas, founder of the Fluxus art movement and avant-garde contemporary of Ono. The film uses the songs \"Airmale\" and \"You\" from Ono's 1971 album \"Fly\", as its soundtrack.\nMusicianship.\nInstruments.\nLennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger had left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy; he often used the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.\nAs his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. \"Double Fantasy\" producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"The Long and Winding Road\", \"Helter Skelter\") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \"Imagine\", described as his best-known solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a Mellotron keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in 1967.\nIn 2024, a guitar of Lennon's that was thought to have been lost was found in an attic and auctioned at Julien's Auctions for $2.9 million (2.68 million euros)\nVocal style.\nLennon's vocal style was heavily influenced by Little Richard, Larry Williams and Little Willie John; the British music writer Ian MacDonald noted that \"no white singer\" had been able to imitate them successfully before Lennon and McCartney. MacDonald contrasted Lennon's singing voice, a \"brassy northern roar flecked with bluesy moans\", with the \"conventionally glamorous\" voices of earlier artists such as Elvis Presley, Dean Martin and Cliff Richard. The British critic Nik Cohn observed of Lennon, \"He owned one of the best pop voices ever, rasped and smashed and brooding, always fierce.\" Cohn wrote that Lennon, performing \"Twist and Shout\", would \"rant his way into total incoherence, half rupture himself\". When the Beatles recorded the song, the final track during the one-day session that produced the band's 1963 debut album, \"Please Please Me\", Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, \"I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming.\" In the words of biographer Barry Miles, \"Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll.\" The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon \"had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice! ... put something on it... Make it \"different\".'\" Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.\nAs his Beatles era segued into his solo career, his singing voice found a widening range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon \"tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of 'Cold Turkey' and the cathartic \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\".\" Music critic Robert Christgau called this Lennon's \"greatest vocal performance... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically... echoed, filtered, and double tracked.\" David Stuart Ryan described Lennon's vocal delivery as ranging from \"extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety\" to a hard \"rasping\" style. Wiener too described contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be \"at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair\". Music historian Ben Urish recalled hearing the Beatles' \"Ed Sullivan Show\" performance of \"This Boy\" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: \"As Lennon's vocals reached their peak... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was my emotions I heard in his voice. Just like I always had.\"\nLegacy.\nMusic historians Schinder and Schwartz wrote of the transformation in popular music styles that took place between the 1950s and the 1960s. They said that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having \"revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts\", the group then \"spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers\". On National Poetry Day in 1999, the BBC conducted a poll to identify the UK's favourite song lyric and announced \"Imagine\" as the winner.\nTwo home recording demos by Lennon, \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", were finished by the three surviving members of the Beatles when they reunited in 1994 and 1995. Both songs were released as Beatles singles in conjunction with \"The Beatles Anthology\" compilations. A third song, \"Now and Then\", was also worked on but not released until 2023 whereupon it was dubbed \"the last Beatles song\", topping the UK charts.\nIn 1997, Yoko Ono and the BMI Foundation established an annual music competition programme for songwriters of contemporary musical genres to honour John Lennon's memory and his large creative legacy. Over $400,000 have been given through BMI Foundation's \"John Lennon Scholarships\" to talented young musicians in the United States.\nIn a 2006 \"Guardian\" article, Jon Wiener wrote: \"For young people in 1972, it was thrilling to see Lennon's courage in standing up to [US President] Nixon. That willingness to take risks with his career, and his life, is one reason why people still admire him today.\" For music historians Urish and Bielen, Lennon's most significant effort was \"the self-portraits\u00a0... in his songs [which] spoke to, for, and about, the human condition.\" Writing for \"El Pa\u00eds\" in 2024, Amaia Odriozola described Lennon's Windsor glasses as being \"known all over the world\" and credited him with pioneering glasses as a \"style statement\" for musicians.\nIn 2013, Downtown Music Publishing signed a publishing administration agreement for the US with Lenono Music and Ono Music, home to the song catalogues of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, respectively. Under the terms of the agreement, Downtown represents Lennon's solo works, including \"Imagine\", \"Instant Karma (We All Shine On)\", \"Power to the People\", \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\", \"Jealous Guy\", \"(Just Like) Starting Over\" and others.\nLennon has been the subject of numerous memorials and tributes. In 2002, the airport in Lennon's home town was renamed the Liverpool John Lennon Airport. On what would have been Lennon's 70th birthday in 2010, Cynthia and Julian Lennon unveiled the John Lennon Peace Monument in Chavasse Park, Liverpool. The sculpture, entitled \"Peace &amp; Harmony\", exhibits peace symbols and carries the inscription \"Peace on Earth for the Conservation of Life \u00b7 In Honour of John Lennon 1940\u20131980\". In December 2013, the International Astronomical Union named one of the craters on Mercury after Lennon.\nThere is a John Lennon Park in Havana, Cuba which features a statue in his likeness sitting on a bench.\nAccolades.\nThe Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership is regarded as one of the most influential and successful of the 20th century. As performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number one singles in the US Hot 100 chart. His album sales in the US stand at 14\u00a0million units. \"Double Fantasy\" was his best-selling album, at three million shipments in the US. Released shortly before his death, it won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. That year, the BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music was given to Lennon.Participants in a 2002 BBC poll voted him eighth of \"100 Greatest Britons\". Between 2003 and 2008, \"Rolling Stone\" recognised Lennon in several reviews of artists and music, ranking him fifth of \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" and 38th of \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and his albums \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" and \"Imagine\", 22nd and 76th respectively of \"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) with the other Beatles in 1965, but returned his medal in 1969 because of \"Britain's involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam, and against Cold Turkey slipping down the charts\". Lennon was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\nFilmography.\nAll releases after his death in 1980 use archival footage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
