{"id": "18623", "revid": "1261736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18623", "title": "Lausanne", "text": "City in Switzerland\nLausanne ( , ; ; ) is the capital and largest city of the Swiss French-speaking canton of Vaud, in Switzerland. The Olympic capital, it is a hilly city situated on the shores of Lake Geneva, about halfway between the Jura Mountains and the Alps, and facing the French town of \u00c9vian-les-Bains across the lake. Lausanne is located (as the crow flies) northeast of Geneva, the nearest major city. The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland convenes in Lausanne, although it is not the \"de jure\" capital of the nation.\nThe municipality of Lausanne has a population of about 150,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland after Basel, Geneva, and Zurich, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, Valais and foreign parts), commonly designated as \"Arc l\u00e9manique\" was over 1.3\u00a0million inhabitants in 2017 and is the fastest growing in Switzerland.\nInitially a Celtic and Roman settlement on the shores of the lake, Lausanne became a town at the foot of Notre Dame, a cathedral built in the 12th century. \nHowever, in the 20th century, Lausanne became a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the \"Olympic Capital\" since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. With its 28-station metro system, Lausanne is the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.\nHistory.\nThe Romans built a military camp, which they called , at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called or (The \"-y\" suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as and in 280 as . By 400, it was , and in 990 it was mentioned as . \nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Counts of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne.\nFrom 888 to 1032, the initially relatively small town belonged to the Kingdom of Upper Burgundy. During the 11th century, Lausanne developed into a political, economic and religious center. The city became the center of the secular rule of the bishops. In the period that followed, especially in the 12th and 13th centuries, Lausanne flourished. Finally, in 1275, the Lausanne Cathedral was consecrated in the presence of Pope Gregory X and King Rudolf I of Germany.\nIt was invaded by forces from the canton of Bern and remained under their domination from 1536 to 1798. The iconoclastic Bernese stripped the Lausanne cathedral of its Roman Catholic trappings, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them, but they never were returned.\nAfter the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city's status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton of Vaud under which it joined the Swiss Federation.\nModern history and heritage.\nIn 1923, the city was the venue for the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, which established the modern Turkish Republic. In 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.\nFrom the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial suburb of Renens.\nThe city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem \"The Waste Land\" (\"by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept\"). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people \u2013 such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron \u2013 have sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby.\nThe city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the L\u00f4zane Bouge protests demanded the city \"open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street\". Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.\nIn June 2022, Lausanne launched Plateforme 10, an art district comprising three museums. The trio of museums included Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts (MCBA), Photo Elys\u00e9e, and the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts (MUDAC).\nGeography.\nTopography.\nThe most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (\"Le L\u00e9man\" in French). Lausanne is built on the southern slope of the Swiss plateau, with a difference in elevation of about between the lakeshore at Ouchy and its northern edge bordering Le Mont-sur-Lausanne and \u00c9palinges. Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Swiss and Savoyan Alps.\nIn addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present \"Rue Centrale\", with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, tourists should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street in which they are trying to go. The name \"Flon\" is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.\nThe municipality includes the villages of Vidy, Cour, Ouchy, Mornex, Chailly, La Sallaz, Vennes, Montblesson, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Montheron and Chalet-\u00e0-Gobet () as well as the exclave of Vernand.\nLausanne is located at the limit between the extensive wine-growing regions of Lavaux (to the east) and la C\u00f4te (to the west).\nLausanne has an area, as of 2014[ [update]], of (depending on calculation method).

Cards may have a barcode or magstripe to more easily allow for scanning, although some are chip cards or proximity cards. U.S. supermarkets often issue two copies of the card: one credit-card sized and one that fits on a keychain, in addition to providing access to the card via a mobile app, website.\nDigital loyalty cards.\nAs of 2024, most programs in the United States offer a digital version of the loyalty card, accessed via a mobile app, and often customers can scan a QR or bar code from the app at the physical point of sale. Some programs now offer digital cards only or only exceptionally, such as Marks and Spencer's \"Sparks\" program in the UK launched in 2020 which no longer issues physical cards except upon special request. American Airlines no longer sends membership kits to new members of its frequent flyer program.\nEncouraging or forcing customers to use a mobile app to present their loyalty account number, although criticized for being unfriendly to people without smartphones including many elderly people, benefits the merchant in a number of ways. It lets them present special offers to the customer (or even push them via push notifications), tailor customer experience to the individual consumer, and understand customer behavior better, including their purchasing amounts and patterns.\nSimilar developments have been observed in European markets , where digital loyalty programs are being adopted beyond large retail chains. A 2025 case study from Romania (among others ) describes how mobile wallet-based loyalty cards enable independent businesses to build and manage customer relationships without maintaining a proprietary mobile app. These systems use QR codes for visit tracking, deliver automated rewards, and provide merchants with direct customer insights that are often unavailable when orders are placed through third-party delivery platforms. Their lower operational cost has contributed to broader uptake among small businesses.\nPhone number and other methods.\nAt a physical point of sale, presenting a physical or digital card is not necessary at many U.S. merchants, if the customer enters the phone number associated with the account on a terminal or tells it to a cashier who enters it into the register. When purchasing online, customers usually must log in to the account on the merchant's website. However, when purchasing airline tickets from online travel agencies, customers can usually enter their airline loyalty number into the agency website and the agency will pass it onto the airline.\nPoints.\nPrograms that feature points grant customers a certain number of points for each purchase, in the US often per $1 or $10 increment of spend. Once they have enough points, clients can redeem them for either:\nTiers.\nPrograms with tiers define levels (such as silver, gold, and platinum levels) that customers are upgraded to when they spend enough with the merchant(s), usually over a certain period of time such as a year. For example, Sephora gives 1 point for $1 spent. Once customers earn a specific number of points, they can enter a new level with higher discounts and exclusive products.\nMembership fees.\nIn subscription-based programs, customers pay a fee to enjoy the program's benefits, for example Barnes and Noble bookstores charge members about 40 U.S. dollars per year (as of mid-2024) for its \"Premium Membership and Rewards\" program, which gives members a 10% discount off most merchandise. There is also a free tier which does not offer such discounts but does allow members to collect virtual \"stamps\" (i.e. loyalty points).\nTypes of rewards.\nDepending on the program, rewards may take the form of:\nIn addition to rewards, loyalty cards may also be used to identify consumers for benefits and other services, e.g.:\nCashback.\nPrograms with cashback features give customers a portion of the money that they have spent with a business (usually a defined percent which may be higher than usual during promotions). The \"cash back\" is rarely actually cash money, but rather takes the form of a transfer of the \"cashback\" amount to the customer's bank account.\nExamples in the U.S. include Rakuten Rewards, a coalition reward program, and many banks that give their clients cash back for using their debit cards to pay for various products and services.\nChannels.\nDepending on the program, ways that consumers may access their loyalty account (account number, promotions, other information) may include:\nMobile apps and websites.\nThere has been a move away from traditional magnetic card, stamp, or punchcard based schemes to online and mobile online loyalty programs. While these schemes vary, the common element is a push toward eradication of a traditional card, in favour of an electronic equivalent. The choice of medium is often a QR code. Some prominent examples are Austrian based mobile-pocket established in 2009, the US-based Punchd (discontinued from June 2013,), which became part of Google in 2011. and an Australian-based loyalty card application called Stamp Me which incorporates iBeacon technology. Others, like Loopy Loyalty (HK), Loyalli (UK), Perka (US), and Whisqr Loyalty (CA), have offered similar programs. Passbook by Apple is the first attempt to standardize the format of mobile loyalty cards.\nOffline with mobile device.\nWith the introduction of host card emulation (HCE) and near field communication (NFC) technology for mobile applications, traditional contactless smart cards for prepaid and loyalty programs are emulated in a smartphone. Google Wallet adopted these technologies for mobile off-line payment applications.\nThe major advantage of off-line over the online system is that the user's smartphone does not have to be online, and the transaction is fast. In addition, multiple emulated cards can be stored in a smartphone to support multi-merchant loyalty programs. Consequently, the user does not need to carry many physical cards anymore.\nIndustries.\nToday, such loyalty programs cover most types of commerce, each having varying features and rewards schemes, and range from programs of a single-location business to large chains or membership in a coalition loyalty program. Industries include:\nThe market approach has shifted from product-centric to a customer-centric one due to a highly competitive market and a wide array of services offered to customers, therefore, it's important that marketing strategies prioritize growing a sustainable business and increasing customer satisfaction.\nCasinos.\nAlmost all major U.S. casino chains also have loyalty cards, which offer members tier credits, reward credits, comps, and other perks based on card members' \"theo\" from gambling, various demographic data, and spend patterns on various purchases at the casino, within the casino network, and with the casino's partners. Examples of such programs include Caesars Rewards (formerly called Total Rewards) and MGM Resorts International's Mlife.\nCoffee shops.\n\"Disloyalty\" cards.\nAs of 2011[ [update]], some independent coffee shops in Boston, Toronto and London has set up experimental \"disloyalty card\" programs, which rewarded customers for visiting a variety of coffee shops.\nBenefits to merchants.\nLoyalty programs' most important benefit to merchants is that they generate data, which bring more repeat business and therefore increase sales.\nApplication forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its marketing research. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether they are a vegetarian.\nAs of the mid-2020s, loyalty program trends include:\nLoyalty programs are a means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff.\nOceania.\nFlybuys is the largest loyalty program in both Australia and New Zealand. \nAs virtual currency.\nLoyalty programs have been described as a form of centralized virtual currency, one with unidirectional cash flow, since reward points can be exchanged into a good or service but not into cash.\nCriticism.\nEvidence for the effectiveness of loyalty programs is controversial. Many companies are unsure whether and how to use customer loyalty programs profitably. Many programs (regardless of location, size, or industry) are run without the appropriate metrics or target parameters.\nSome companies complain that loyalty programs discount goods to people who are buying goods anyway. Moreover, the expense of participating in these programs rarely generates a good return on investment. The Forte Consultancy Group regards loyalty programs as bribes. In the case of infrequent spenders, loyalty fees provide a means of subsidizing discounts.\nA 2015 study found that most supermarket loyalty cards in the United States do not offer any real value to their customers. Furthermore, commercial use of customers' personal data \u2013 collected as part of loyalty programs \u2013 has the potential for abuse; it is highly likely that consumer purchases are tracked and used for marketing research to increase the efficiency of marketing and advertising, which is one of the purposes of offering the loyalty card. For some customers, participating in a loyalty program (even with a fake or anonymous card) funds activities that violate privacy. Consumers have also expressed concern about the integration of RFID technology into loyalty-card systems.\nOne may view loyalty and credit-card reward-plans as modern-day examples of kickbacks.\nEmployees who need to buy something (such as an airline flight or a hotel room) for a business trip, but who have discretion to decide which airline or hotel chain to use, have an incentive to choose the payment method that provides the most cash-back, credit-card rewards or loyalty points instead of minimizing costs for their employer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18625", "revid": "3174456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18625", "title": "Ludwig Von Drake", "text": "Fictional Disney character appearing in cartoons and comic books \nProfessor Ludwig Von Drake is a cartoon character created in 1961 by The Walt Disney Company. He is the paternal uncle of Donald Duck. He was first introduced as the presenter (and singer of \"The Spectrum Song\") in the cartoon \"An Adventure in Color\", part of the first episode of \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\" on NBC. According to the episode \"The Hunting Instinct\" of that series he and Donald Duck's father are brothers. He is described as a scientist, lecturer, psychologist, and world traveler. The character displayed his \"expert\" knowledge on a variety of subjects in eighteen episodes of the classic anthology series, as well as on a number of Disneyland Records.\nPaul Frees was the original voice of Ludwig Von Drake. After Frees retired from the role, the character was briefly voiced by Wayne Allwine and Walker Edmiston. Since 1987, he has been voiced by Corey Burton. Ludwig Von Drake has also appeared in numerous Disney comics stories.\nCharacter.\nLudwig Von Drake comes from Vienna, Austria, and has a fascination with knowledge. Since his youth, he has been trying to obtain as many diplomas, in any science, as possible. When he is consulted by other family members, it is a running gag that he almost invariably turns out to have a university degree relevant for whatever information they are seeking. He is often shown as having little social competence, however, and is often portrayed as being very forgetful, sometimes even somewhat senile. In the comics, Ludwig usually visits with Donald Duck and Donald's nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. On occasion, Daisy Duck will coax (or even trick) the professor into giving lectures and tours for her ladies' club. Ludwig can play the piano and acoustic guitar, as shown in a few television specials and more.\nIn the \"Wonderful World of Color\" episode \"The Hunting Instinct\", Walt Disney states Ludwig is Donald Duck's father's brother. According to Walt Disney, Donald decided to adopt his maternal surname, Duck, when he got into show business, and that is the reason why he is not popularly known as Donald Von Drake. In the comic strips by Bob Karp and Al Taliaferro, Donald and his nephews usually call Ludwig 'Uncle Ludwig', and Daisy Duck refers to him as 'sort of an uncle' of Donald's in the first Sunday strip where his name is mentioned.\nIn the \"Wonderful World of Color\" episode \"Kids is Kids\", Ludwig says, \"Of course, I don't need any help raising children. I'm a bachelor.\" Besides, he has been shown to be a member of the \"Absentminded Dating Club\", where he is the suitor of a duck woman called Alice. This is contradicted by Don Rosa's private (and unpublished) Duck Family tree which shows Ludwig married to Donald Duck's mother's sister Matilda McDuck. The same family tree also states this is the only relationship between Ludwig and Donald Duck; thereby contradicting Walt Disney's statement.\nIn the story \"Duckburg, U.S.A.\", published in \"Ludwig Von Drake\" #1 (November 1961), Professor Ludwig Von Drake arrives in Duckburg by train, and it is shown that Donald Duck had never seen this Austrian relative before, not even in a picture. Grandma Duck, Uncle Scrooge McDuck, Daisy Duck, Gladstone Gander, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Gus Goose, and Gyro Gearloose also appear in this same story waiting to know Ludwig at the train station, and Grandma enthusiastically exclaims, \"Professor Ludwig Von Drake! Such a nice-sounding name!\". In some old comic stories where Ludwig visits Grandma on her farm, it is clear that they have a close relationship, as shown in the story \"Message From Space\", where Grandma exclaims, \"You need rest, dear boy!\", after thinking he had a kind of nervous breakdown. In \"Pigeon Panic\" Ludwig exclaims, \"Ho! You know you can depend on me!\", after Grandma warned him to be careful with her smartest homer. There is an enlightening sequence of two panels in the story \"The Rural Eggs-pert\", where Ludwig is resting in an old chair of Grandma's house when an antique buyer asks Grandma to sell him \"this fine old specimen\" (the chair) and she answers, \"Well, it's been in the family for years, but I could do without it!\", making Ludwig astonished, since he thinks she is referring to him as if he was a livestock. He would not have reacted this way if he was not her relative. In the last panel of the story \"Barn Dance Doctor\", Grandma refers to Ludwig as her \"cityfied cousin\". Since it was stipulated by Don Rosa that her father was a \"Coot\" and her mother was a \"Gadwall\", it is not clear if Ludwig Von Drake is related to Elvira Coot through her father or her mother. Grandma Duck could have an Austrian ascendancy to explain her kinship to Ludwig. \nIn the story \"The Family Tree Spree\", Donald scares of seeing Ludwig's specs on the floor and thinks about them as \"Uncle Ludwig's specs\". In the end of this same story, it is revealed that Ludwig also appears in Donald's paternal family tree, wherein he and Donald both have an ancestor called Colombust Duck. According to Carl Barks, Donald's father's surname is Duck, his mother's one being McDuck. Since Humperdink Duck (a.k.a. Grandpa Duck), Grandma Duck's deceased husband and Donald's paternal grandfather, was probably almost contemporary with Ludwig Von Drake, it is possible to consider they were half-brothers, Donald being thus Ludwig's grandnephew. Ludwig reveals to Daisy and her friends in \"Blown Up Genius\" that he came from a long line of glass blowers. In \"Winning Ways\", Daisy and her friends try to prepare Ludwig's favorite dish, called \"Wiener Schnitzel a la Weltschmerz\", whose recipe belonged to Ludwig's great grandmother. Ludwig is really excited about it because he has not eaten that dish since he left Austria and came to Duckburg to know his relatives of Donald's paternal family. In \"The Big Payoff\", it is revealed that he spent many months living in Donald's house since his arrival in Duckburg. Ludwig wins a TV chess challenge in this comic story, making Donald exclaim, \"Yippee! He did it! Now he can pay all he's owed us (he and his nephews) for these many months!\". According to the story \"The Jewels of Skull Rock\", Ludwig spent six months in Donald's house. In the Christmas story \"The Cuckoo Clock Caper\", Ludwig exclaims that he and Scrooge are \"joined in good fellowship\". Ludwig and Gyro Gearloose competed as to who is the greater inventor in the comic story \"I.Q. Bugaboo\".\nThose twelve stories mentioned above were drawn by Tony Strobl, who was the cartoonist responsible for introducing Professor Ludwig into American Disney comic books. Actually, Ludwig's first comic book appearance was in a not previously mentioned story by Strobl, \"The Scene Stealer\", first published in October 1961. The events shown in this one presumably happened after the ones shown in \"Duckburg, U.S.A.\", which was published two months later.\nFilmography.\nProfessor Ludwig Von Drake was introduced as a new character alongside Walt Disney himself in the very first episode of \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\" after the series was moved to NBC in the fall of 1961. He was designed by Bill Berg. Von Drake was frequently animated by Milt Kahl and Ward Kimball, two of Disney's Nine Old Men animators. Some animation of the character was also done by Frank Thomas and Eric Larson.\nTelevision.\nWonderful World of Color appearances (1960s)\nCartoon appearances (1980s\u2013present).\nVon Drake has appeared on several Disney animated cartoon series: \"DuckTales\", \"Raw Toonage\", \"Bonkers\", \"Mickey Mouse Works\", \"Quack Pack\", \"House of Mouse\", \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\", \"Minnie's Bow-Toons\", \"Mickey Mouse\", \"Mickey and the Roadster Racers\", the 2017 reboot of \"DuckTales\", \"The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\", \"Mickey Mouse Funhouse\", \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse+\" and in numerous television specials. In all of these, Von Drake wears a pink shirt, black tie, red vest, and a lab coat.\nIn \"House of Mouse\", Von Drake appears as a recurring character. In \"Ask Von Drake\", Mickey tries to prove that Ludwig Von Drake does not know everything. At the end, Mickey convinces him that during the headcount of all the Disney characters, he forgot himself. Also, in \"House of Genius\", Ludwig creates robot duplicates of Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, and Pluto. At the end, when Ludwig brings in a robot duplicate of himself, Mickey tells the robot to send the real Ludwig packing.\nIn \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\", he is a major recurring character, often helping the protagonists, or asking for help himself.\nLudwig appears as a recurring character in the \"DuckTales\" reboot as the head of spy agency S.H.U.S.H.\nLudwig makes a cameo appearance between Walt Disney Animation Studios characters that take a group photo in the 2023 short film, \"Once Upon a Studio\".\n\"Sing-Along Songs\" series.\nIn the Disney's \"Sing-Along Songs\" series of videos, he has hosted/co-hosted these five volumes:\nDisneyland Records discography.\nIn 1961 Disneyland Records released the LP \"Professor Ludwig Von Drake\". The LP had two songs from the character's debut in the \"An Adventure in Color\" episode (\"The Green with Envy Blues\" and \"The Spectrum Song\"), as well as new songs and comedy bits.\nThe track list for the \"Ludwig Von Drake\" LP:\nAs of February 2010, the digitally remastered LP can be downloaded exclusively at the iTunes Store.\nPrint appearances.\nThe Disney studio encouraged the writers of Duck comics to introduce this new character in print, and already in September 1961, Von Drake started appearing in Al Taliaferro and Bob Karp's featured daily strips. However, aside from a solitary cameo appearance in a one-page story in \"Uncle Scrooge\" #54 (December 1964), the character was not used by leading Disney duck artist Carl Barks.\nIn 1961, Dell Comics launched a comic book series starring Von Drake and illustrated by Tony Strobl, but it only lasted for four issues before being discontinued. The character made subsequent appearances in other comic titles such as \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" and in the \"Donald Duck\" newspaper strip.\nLudwig also appeared in a 1962 sequence of the annual \"Disney Christmas Story\" comic strip. In \"Sleeping Beauty's Christmas Story\", the professor helps Princess Aurora break Maleficent's spell.\nProfessor Ludwig has often been used by Italian cartoonists, including in some of the long sagas inspired by famous books that they usually produce with the Duck Family, such as \"La storia di Marco Polo detta Il Milione\" (free translation \"The Million \u2013 A Story of Marco Polo\") and \"Paperino in: Il mondo perduto\" (free translation \"Donald in: The Lost World\"). As a result, he has achieved significant popularity in Italy (where he is known as Pico De Paperis). He is portrayed in Italian comics as a scholar with multiple degrees in different subjects (even the more improbable ones) rather than a scientist.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The population was 31,625 according to the 2020 census.\nMost of the city's growth occurred between 1950 and 1980. Originally an agricultural town with many summer cottages and apricot orchards, Los Altos is a bedroom community on the western edge of Silicon Valley, serving as a major source of commuters to other parts of Silicon Valley. Los Altos strictly limits commercial zones to the downtown area and small shopping and office parks lining Foothill Expressway and El Camino Real.\nHistory.\nThe area was initially Fremont Judicial Township, Santa Clara County which was formed in 1853. Fremont Judicial Township was later unofficially called \"Banks and Braes\". Paul Shoup, an executive of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and his colleagues formed the Altos Land Company in 1906 and started the development of Los Altos. The company acquired of land from Sarah Winchester. Shoup wanted to link Palo Alto and Los Gatos by making Los Altos a commuter town. It continued a train-a-day operation to and from San Francisco.\nOn April 19, 1908, Southern Pacific Railroad began running steam train service through Los Altos on the new Mayfield Cutoff with five trains per day. Two freight cars served as a train depot. Also, the first commercial building, Eschenbruecher's Hardware, was built in downtown. In 1913, the craftsman-style Los Altos train station was built at 288 First Street.\nBy 1949, many residents were dissatisfied with the zoning policy of Santa Clara County, and there was a constant threat of annexation by neighboring Palo Alto and Mountain View, so they decided to incorporate. Los Altos became the eleventh city in Santa Clara County on December 1, 1952.\nTrain service ceased operation in January 1964, and the train track became Foothill Expressway. Los Altos may have the first scientifically designed sound baffle in 1970. Santa Clara County undertook a seminal study to calculate the effects of alternate soundwall designs along Foothill Expressway. The resulting wall brought about the predicted reduction of seven to ten decibels in noise pollution levels experienced by adjacent homes.\nIn 1976, Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built the first 50 Apple I computers in Jobs's garage in Los Altos.\nIn 2004, landlord Judy Fusco rented her Los Altos home, later known as \"Casa Facebook\", to Mark Zuckerberg; there, he and a few other associates scaled Facebook from 200,000 members to 2.5 million.\nOn April 15, 2021, Los Altos became home to the world's first consumer flying car showroom.\nEarthquakes.\nLos Altos is near the San Andreas Fault and therefore subject to earthquakes.\nGeography.\nLos Altos is bordered by Los Altos Hills to the west, Palo Alto to the west and northwest, Mountain View to the northwest and northeast, Sunnyvale to the east, and Cupertino to the southeast.\nLos Altos is crossed by three creeks that flow north to San Francisco Bay, Adobe Creek on its western boundary, Stevens Creek on its eastern boundary and Permanente Creek in the middle. Hale Creek is a tributary to Permanente Creek, and Permanente Creek is now largely diverted to Stevens Creek by a diversion channel. All three creeks originate on the flanks of Black Mountain.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020s.\nThe 2020 United States census reported that Los Altos had a population of 31,625.

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.9 males.\nThere were 11,204 housing units at an average density of per square mile (/km2), of which 9,002 (83.8%) were owner-occupied, and 1,743 (16.2%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 0.7%; the rental vacancy rate was 5.0%. 24,669 people (85.1% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 4,080 people (14.1%) lived in rental housing units.\nThe median household income of Los Altos for 2013\u20132017 was $208,309. The average home listing price in 2014 was $1.96 million. In 2017, \"Forbes\" ranked Los Altos (94022 and 94024) as the 3rd and 48th most expensive ZIP codes in the United States with median home prices of $7,755,000 and $3,431,615, respectively. In 2018, data from the American Community Survey revealed that Los Altos was the fifth wealthiest city in the United States.\n1930.\nApproximately 2,900 people would have considered themselves a resident of Los Altos.\nHousing costs.\nLos Altos strives to maintain a semi-rural atmosphere. Los Altos has few sidewalks except in commercial zones and along arterial roads. The minimum lot size for most residential housing is one-quarter of an acre. Most streets have broad dirt shoulders and no street lighting. The civic center sits in the middle of an orchard, a remnant of those that once covered the area. The downtown is a triangle with arterials and collector streets on all sides that enable most through traffic to bypass Main Street.\nAs of today, many Los Altos homes fetch $4\u00a0million and higher. The city is placed (along with neighboring Los Altos Hills, with which it shares ZIP codes) at numbers 24 and 28 on Forbes' \"Most Expensive ZIP Codes in America\" list in 2007. In 2015, \"Forbes\" placed Los Altos (ZIP codes 94022 and 94024) as the 11th and 57th most expensive ZIP codes in the United States, behind such cities as Atherton, California and Sagaponack, New York. For the 94022 ZIP code, which includes parts of Los Altos Hills, California the median home price is $4.9 million with an average of 120 days on the market. For the 94024 ZIP code, the median home price is $2.8 million with an average of 36 days on the market.\nEconomy.\nSince the mid-1990s, downtown Los Altos has experienced mild economic difficulties due to competition from nearby shopping centers and chain stores, as well as its lack of a hotel or movie theater. Revitalizing downtown is a major issue in city politics.\nTop employers.\nAccording to the City's 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nGovernment.\nIn the California State Legislature, Los Altos is in the senatorial district, represented by Democrat Josh Becker, and in the Assembly district, represented by Democrat Marc Berman.\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Los Altos is in California's congressional district, represented by Democrat Sam Liccardo.\nEducation.\nPublic.\nMost of Los Altos is in the Los Altos Elementary School District and the Mountain View-Los Altos Union High School District. A portion of it is in the Cupertino Union Elementary School District and the Fremont Union High School District. The Los Altos School District has one of the highest average API scores in California and includes seven elementary schools in the Los Altos\u2013Mountain View area.\nLos Altos has the Bullis Charter School, a K-8 charter school.\n all of the public schools are highly regarded, and many graduates of Los Altos-area high schools continue their education at well-known universities.\nPrivate.\nLos Altos is also served by highly regarded private and religious schools. St. Nicholas School, St. Simon School, Miramonte Elementary School, (JrK\u20138th) Canterbury Christian School (Pre-K\u20138th), the Lower and Middle Campuses (K\u20136th) of Pinewood School, The School for Independent Learners, and the lower school campus of the Waldorf School of the Peninsula are located within city limits. Others nearby include St. Francis High School (Mountain View), Mountain View Academy, and The King's Academy (Sunnyvale). Other schools farther away with students from Los Altos include Sacred Heart Schools, Atherton, Mitty High School, Menlo School, Woodside Priory School, Castilleja School, The Harker School, and Bellarmine College Preparatory.\nPublic libraries.\nSanta Clara County Library operates the Los Altos Library and the Woodland Branch Library in Los Altos. Members of the library have access to all the other locations in the Santa Clara County Library District.\nParks and recreation.\nAdobe Creek flows through Redwood Grove, a nature preserve off University Avenue in Los Altos purchased by the city in 1974. In October 2009 Los Altos contracted with Acterra to remove non-native plants and revitalize the redwood, oak woodland, riparian and grassland ecosystems by installing native plants, improving soil conditions, and creating habitat for wildlife such as bird houses and native bee boxes. The coast redwoods (\"Sequoia sempervirens\") were transplanted by the Halsey family from a location on Summit Road in the Santa Cruz Mountains and replaced the native willows. The historic Halsey House, built in the late 1920s by Theodore and Emma Halsey, is a good example of Spanish Revival architecture. The city designated Halsey House a local landmark in 1981 and until recently it housed the Florence Fava collection of Coastanoan or Ohlone Indian artifacts from a nearby archeological excavation in Los Altos Hills (now moved to the Los Altos History Museum). On June 16, 2010, the Los Altos City Council finalized the purchase of of creekside property from Delbert and Marlene Beumer, who wanted to provide a safe pathway connecting Shoup Park and Redwood Grove.\nSteelhead trout (\"Oncorhynchus mykiss\") occurred historically in Adobe Creek. However, tidal gates at the mouth of Adobe Creek as well as culverts at the El Camino Real and Interstate 280 overpasses probably preclude the passage of migrating salmonids, even though the reaches upstream from Hidden Villa in Los Altos Hills have been judged excellent trout habitat.\nSports.\nLos Altos has a variety of youth-oriented sports organizations, programs, and after-school activities. Some examples include:\nMedia.\nThe \"Los Altos Town Crier\", a weekly, is the primary newspaper for the town, \"serving the Hometown of Silicon Valley since 1947.\" The \"San Jose Mercury News\" is the primary daily newspaper serving the town, delivering a Peninsula Section to Los Altans and locations north in lieu of the Local section delivered to those in San Jose and other communities closer to San Jose.\nSister cities.\nLos Altos had four sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:\nThe program was run by the non-profit Los Altos Sister Cities, Inc., founded in 1988. That organization later decided to cease its participation and is now dissolved. Los Altos no longer participates in the sister cities program.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also known as myasthenic syndrome, Eaton\u2013Lambert syndrome, and when related to cancer, carcinomatous myopathy. \nAround 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC); it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body). It is the result of antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The diagnosis is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also distinguish it from myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.\nIf the disease is associated with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.\nThe condition affects about 3.4 per million people. LEMS usually occurs in people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).\nThree-quarters of people with LEMS also have disruption of the autonomic nervous system. This may be experienced as a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.\nAlong with a medical history and physical examination by a neuromuscular physician, a Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) antibody test and Electromyography (EMG) test can obtain a diagnosis of LEMs. However, positive VGCC antibody tests may indicate other diseases. Strength improves further with repeated testing, e.g. improvement of power on repeated hand grip (a phenomenon known as \"Lambert's sign\"). At rest, reflexes are typically reduced; with muscle use, reflex strength increases. This is a characteristic feature of LEMS. The pupillary light reflex may be sluggish.\nIn LEMS associated with small cell lung cancer, most have no suggestive symptoms of cancer at the time, such as cough, coughing blood, and unintentional weight loss. However, LEMS symptoms can occur up to 5 years prior to cancer diagnosis and also after cancer diagnosis. LEMS associated with lung cancer may be more severe.\nCauses.\nLEMS is often associated with lung cancer (50\u201370%), specifically small-cell carcinoma, making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of the people with small-cell lung cancer, 1\u20133% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the lung cancer, and it is otherwise asymptomatic.\nLEMS may also be associated with endocrine diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes mellitus type 1. Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen in the presence of tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.\nMechanism.\nNormal physiology.\nIn normal neuromuscular function, a nerve impulse is carried down the axon (the long projection of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse is transferred to the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.\nPathology of LEMS.\nIn LEMS, antibodies against VGCC, particularly the P/Q-type VGCC and possibly the N-type VGCC, decrease the amount of calcium that can enter the nerve ending, resulting in reduced acetylcholine release in the neuromuscular junction. Apart from skeletal muscle, the autonomic nervous system also requires acetylcholine neurotransmission; this explains the occurrence of autonomic symptoms in LEMS. P/Q voltage-gated calcium channels are also found in the cerebellum, explaining why some experience problems with coordination. The antibodies bind particularly to the part of the receptor known as the \"domain III S5\u2013S6 linker peptide\". Antibodies may also bind other VGCCs. Some have antibodies that bind synaptotagmin, the protein sensor for calcium-regulated vesicle fusion. Many people with LEMS, both with and without VGCC antibodies, have detectable antibodies against the M1 subtype of the acetylcholine receptor; their presence may participate in a lack of compensation for the weak calcium influx. N-type VGCCs are found on autonomic nerve terminals.\nApart from the decreased calcium influx, a disruption of active zone vesicle release sites also occurs, which may also be antibody-dependent, since people with LEMS have antibodies to components of these active zones (including voltage-dependent calcium channels). Together, these abnormalities lead to the decrease in muscle contractility. Repeated stimuli over a period of about 10 seconds eventually lead to sufficient delivery of calcium, and an increase in muscle contraction to normal levels, which can be demonstrated using an electrodiagnostic medicine study called needle electromyography by increasing amplitude of repeated compound muscle action potentials.\nThe antibodies found in LEMS associated with lung cancer also bind to calcium channels in the cancer cells, and it is presumed that the antibodies originally develop as a reaction to these cells. It has been suggested that the immune reaction to the cancer cells suppresses their growth and improves the prognosis from the cancer.\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis is usually made with nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG), which is one of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. EMG involves the insertion of small needles into the muscles. NCS involves administering small electrical impulses to the nerves, on the surface of the skin, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. NCS investigation in LEMS primarily involves evaluation of compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) of effected muscles and sometimes EMG single-fiber examination can be used.\nCMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and conduction velocities. If repeated impulses are administered (2 per second or 2\u00a0Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the motor end plate is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all can be attributed to insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.\nBlood tests may be performed to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels can be identified in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50\u201360% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months for the first two years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also be performed to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.\nTreatment.\nIf LEMS is caused by an underlying cancer, treatment of the cancer could lead to resolution of the symptoms. Treatment usually consists of chemotherapy, with radiation therapy in those with limited disease.\nFirdapse is the only FDA-approved treatment for LEMS. Firdapse works in the presynaptic neuromuscular junction to increase the release of acetylcholine helping to improve muscle function and relieve/reduce the symptoms of LEMS.\nImmunosuppression.\nSome evidence supports the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used with a degree of effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.\nOther.\nThree other treatment modalities also aim at improving LEMS symptoms, namely pyridostigmine, 3,4-diaminopyridine (amifampridine), and guanidine. They work to improve neuromuscular transmission. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and Mestinon tablets (Pyridostigmine) are secondary treatments.\nTentative evidence supports 3,4-diaminopyridine at least for a few weeks. The 3,4-diaminopyridine base or the water-soluble 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate may be used. Both 3,4-diaminopyridine formulations delay the repolarization of nerve terminals after a discharge, thereby allowing more calcium to accumulate in the nerve terminal.\nPyridostigmine decreases the degradation of acetylcholine after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side effects and is not recommended. 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.\nThe FDA approved amifampridine for use in children 6 years and older with LEMS in addition to the prior approval for use in adults with LEMS on November 28, 2018.\nHistory.\nAnderson and colleagues from St Thomas' Hospital, London, were the first to mention a case with possible clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Edward H. Lambert, Lee Eaton, and E.D. Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Often served with or after dessert, they are typically heavily sweetened and un-aged, beyond a resting period during production, when necessary, for their flavors to mingle.\nLiqueurs are historical descendants of herbal medicines. They were made in France as early as the 13th century, often prepared by monks (for example, Chartreuse). Today they are produced all over the world, commonly served neat, over ice, with coffee, in cocktails, and used in cooking.\nEtymology.\nThe French word \"liqueur\" is derived from the Latin \"liquifacere\", which means \"to dissolve\".\nIn some parts of the United States and Canada, liqueurs may be referred to as cordials, or schnapps. This can cause confusion as in the United Kingdom a cordial would refer to a non-alcoholic concentrated fruit syrup, typically diluted to taste and consumed as a non-carbonated soft drink. Schnapps, on the other hand, can refer to any distilled beverage in Germany and aquavit in Scandinavian countries.\nLegal definitions.\nIn the United States, where spirits are often called \"liquor\", there is often confusion discerning between liqueurs and liquors, due to the many different types of flavored spirits that are available today (e.g., flavored vodka). Liqueurs generally contain a lower alcohol content (15\u201330% ABV) than spirits and have a sweetener mixed, while some can have an ABV as high as 55%.\nCanada.\nUnder the Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870), liqueurs are produced from mixing alcohol with plant materials. These materials include juices or extracts from fruits, flowers, leaves or other plant materials. The extracts are obtained by soaking, filtering or softening the plant substances. A sweetening agent should be added in an amount that is at least 2.5 percent of the finished liqueur. The alcohol percentage shall be at least 23%. It may also contain natural or artificial flavoring and color.\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union directive on spirit drinks provides guidelines applicable to all liqueurs.

Liqueurs (and also cordials) are defined as products created by mixing or redistilling distilled spirits with fruit, plant products, natural flavors, extracts, or sweeteners. These additives must be added in an amount not less than 2.5% by weight of the final product.\nPreparation.\nSome liqueurs are prepared by infusing certain woods, fruits, or flowers in either water or alcohol and adding sugar or other items. Others are distilled from aromatic or flavoring agents.\nAnise and Rak\u0131 liqueurs have the property of turning from transparent to cloudy when added to water: the oil of anise remains in solution in the presence of a high concentration of alcohol, but coalesces when the alcohol concentration is reduced; this is known as the ouzo effect.\nUse.\nCocktails.\nAdding liqueurs to a cocktail can change the flavour and appearance of the cocktail. Whilst some liqueurs are coloured and designed to make the cocktail pop in colour, others are clear to prevent the liqueur from taking over the colour of the base spirit or garnish.\nLayered drinks.\nLayered drinks are made by floating different-colored liqueurs in separate layers. Each liqueur is poured slowly into a glass over the back of a spoon or down a glass rod, so that the liquids of different densities remain unmixed, creating a striped effect.\nHealth concerns.\nAlcohol-based sugar-sweetened beverages, are closely linked to heavy episodic drinking in adolescents.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18630", "revid": "50936493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18630", "title": "Lilith", "text": "Female entity in Near Eastern mythology\nLilith (; ), also spelled Lilit, Lilitu, or Lilis, is a feminine figure in Mesopotamian and Jewish mythology. According to accounts in the Talmud she is a primordial she-demon. Lilith is cited as having been \"banished\" from the Garden of Eden for disobeying Adam.\nThe stem Hebrew word from which the name Lilith is taken is in the Biblical Hebrew, in the Book of Isaiah, though Lilith herself is not mentioned in any biblical text. In late antiquity in Mandaean and Jewish sources from 500 AD onward, Lilith appears in historiolas (incantations incorporating a short mythic story) in various concepts and localities that give partial descriptions of her. She is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Eruvin 100b, Niddah 24b, Shabbat 151b, Bava Batra 73a), and in the \"Zohar\" \u00a7 Leviticus 19a as \"a hot fiery female who first cohabited with man\". Many rabbinic authorities, including Maimonides and Menachem Meiri, reject the existence of Lilith.\nThe name Lilith seems related to the masculine Akkadian word and its female variants and . The \"lil-\" root is shared by the Hebrew word appearing in , which is thought to be a night bird by modern scholars such as Judit M. Blair. In Mesopotamian religion according to the cuneiform texts of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylonia, \"lil\u00fb\" are a class of demonic spirits, consisting of adolescents who died before they could bear children. Many have also connected her to the Mesopotamian demon Lamashtu, who shares similar traits and a similar position in mythology to Lilith.\nHistory.\nIn some Jewish folklore, such as the \"Alphabet of Sirach\" (c.\u2009700\u20131000 AD), Lilith appears as Adam's first wife, who was created at the same time and from the same clay as Adam. The legend of Lilith developed extensively during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadah, the Zohar, and Jewish mysticism. For example, in the 13th-century writings of Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen, Lilith left Adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the Garden of Eden after she had coupled with the archangel Samael.\nInterpretations of Lilith found in later Jewish materials are plentiful, but little information has survived relating to the Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian views of this class of demons. Recent scholarship has disputed the relevance of two sources previously used to connect the Jewish to an Akkadian \u2013 the Gilgamesh appendix and the Arslan Tash amulets (see below for discussion of these two problematic sources).\nIn contrast, some scholars, such as Lowell K. Handy, hold the view that though Lilith derives from Mesopotamian demonology, evidence of the Hebrew Lilith being present in the sources frequently cited \u2013 the Sumerian Gilgamesh fragment and the Sumerian incantation from Arshlan-Tash being two \u2013 is scant, if present at all.\nIn Hebrew-language texts, the term or (translated as \"night creatures\", \"night monster\", \"night hag\", or \"screech owl\") first occurs in a list of animals in Isaiah 34. The Isaiah 34:14 Lilith reference does not appear in most common Bible translations such as KJV and NIV. Commentators and interpreters often envision the figure of Lilith as a dangerous demon of the night, who is sexually wanton, and who steals babies in the darkness. Currently there is no scholarly consensus, with some adhering to the animalistic interpretation, whereas others claim 34:14 is referencing a literal demon or a category of demons falling under the specification of \"lilith\". Historically, certain prominent Jewish rabbis in Talmudic texts feared the likes of liliths, some to such an extent that they recommended men not sleep in a home alone, as any who do would be \"seized by Lilith.\" Jewish incantation bowls and amulets from Mesopotamia from the first to the eighth centuries identify Lilith as a female demon and provide the first visual depictions of her. The said amulets were often symbolic divorce papers, warding off a given lilith that was thought to be haunting one's house or family.\nEtymology.\nIn the Akkadian language of Assyria and Babylonia, the terms and mean spirits. Some uses of are listed in the Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (CAD, 1956, L.190), in Wolfram von Soden's \"Akkadisches Handw\u00f6rterbuch\" (AHw, p.\u00a0553), and \"Reallexikon der Assyriologie\" (RLA, p.\u00a047).\nThe Sumerian female demons have no etymological relation to Akkadian , \"evening\".\nArchibald Sayce (1882) considered that the Hebrew and the earlier Akkadian names are derived from Proto-Semitic. Charles Fossey (1902) has this literally translating to \"female night being/demon\", although cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia exist where \"L\u012bl\u012bt\" and \"L\u012bl\u012btu\" refers to disease-bearing wind spirits.\nMesopotamian mythology.\nThe spirit in the tree in the Gilgamesh cycle.\nSamuel Noah Kramer (1932, published 1938) translated as \"Lilith\" in Tablet XII of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" dated c.\u2009600 BC. Tablet XII is not part of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh,\" but is a later Assyrian Akkadian translation of the latter part of the Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". The is associated with a serpent and a zu bird. In \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\", a huluppu tree grows in Inanna's garden in Uruk, whose wood she plans to use to build a new throne. After ten years of growth, she comes to harvest it and finds a serpent living at its base, a Zu bird raising young in its crown, and that a made a house in its trunk. Gilgamesh is said to have killed the snake, and then the zu bird flew away to the mountains with its young, while the fearfully destroys its house and runs for the forest.\nIdentification of the as Lilith is stated in the \"Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible\" (1999). Suggested translations for the Tablet XII spirit in the tree include as \"sacred place\", as \"spirit\", and as \"water spirit\", but also simply \"owl\", given that the is building a home in the trunk of the tree. A connection between the Gilgamesh and the Jewish Lilith was rejected on textual grounds by Sergio Ribichini (1978).\nThe bird-footed woman in the Burney Relief.\nKramer's translation of the Gilgamesh fragment was used by Henri Frankfort (1937) and Emil Kraeling (1937) to support identification of a woman with wings and bird-feet in the disputed Burney Relief as related to Lilith. Frankfort and Kraeling identified the figure in the relief with Lilith. Today, the identification of the Burney Relief with Lilith is questioned. Modern research has identified the figure as one of the main goddesses of the Mesopotamian pantheons, most probably Ereshkigal. But the figure is more generally identified as the goddess of love and war: Thorkild Jacobsen identified the figure as Inanna in an analysis based on the existence of symbols and attributes commonly recognized to the goddess and on textual evidence.\nThe Arslan Tash amulets.\nThe Arslan Tash amulets are limestone plaques discovered in 1933 at Arslan Tash, the authenticity of which is disputed. William F. Albright, Theodor H. Gaster, and others, accepted the amulets as a pre-Jewish source which shows that the name Lilith already existed in the 7th century BC but Torczyner (1947) identified the amulets as a later Jewish source.\nLamashtu.\nMany have alternatively drawn connections between Lilith and the Mesopotamian demon Lamashtu, due to their similar position and traits in both mythologies.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nThe word (or ) only appears once in the Hebrew Bible as part of a few Bible translations, in a prophecy regarding the fate of Edom. Most other nouns in the list appear more than once and thus are better documented, with the exception of another \"hapax legomenon\": the word \"qippoz\". The reading of scholars and translators is often guided by a decision about the complete list of eight creatures as a whole. Quoting from Isaiah 34 (NAB):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(12) Her nobles shall be no more, nor shall kings be proclaimed there; all her princes are gone. (13) Her castles shall be overgrown with thorns, her fortresses with thistles and briers. She shall become an abode for jackals and a haunt for ostriches. (14) Wildcats shall meet with desert beasts, satyrs shall call to one another; There shall the Lilith repose, and find for herself a place to rest. (15) There the hoot owl shall nest and lay eggs, hatch them out and gather them in her shadow; There shall the kites assemble, none shall be missing its mate. (16) Look in the book of the LORD and read: No one of these shall be lacking, For the mouth of the LORD has ordered it, and His spirit shall gather them there. (17) It is He who casts the lot for them, and with His hands He marks off their shares of her; They shall possess her forever, and dwell there from generation to generation.\nHebrew text.\nIn the Masoretic Text:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the Dead Sea Scrolls, among the 19 fragments of Isaiah found at Qumran, the Great Isaiah Scroll (1Q1Isa) in 34:14 renders the creature as plural (or ).\nEberhard Schrader (1875) and Moritz Abraham Levy (1855) suggest that Lilith was a demon of the night, known also by the Jewish exiles in Babylon. Schrader's and Levy's view is therefore partly dependent on a later dating of Deutero-Isaiah to the 6th century BC and the presence of Jews in Baghdad in the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which would coincide with the possible references to the in Babylonian demonology. However, this view is challenged by Judit M. Blair, who argues that the context indicates unclean animals.\nGreek version.\nThe Septuagint translates both the reference to Lilith and the word for jackals or \"wild beasts of the island\" within the same verse into Greek as , apparently assuming them to refer to the same creatures and omitting \"wildcats/wild beasts of the desert.\" Under this reading, instead of the wildcats or desert beasts meeting with the jackals or island beasts, the goat or \"satyr\" crying \"to his fellow\" and lilith or \"screech owl\" resting \"there\", it is the goat or \"satyr\", translated as \"demons\", and the jackals or island beasts \"\" meeting with each other and crying \"one to the other\" and the latter resting there.\nLatin Bible.\nThe early 5th-century Vulgate translated the same word as .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe translation is, \"And demons shall meet with monsters, and one hairy one shall cry out to another; there the lamia has lain down and found rest for herself\".\nEnglish versions.\nWycliffe's Bible (1395) preserves the Latin rendering :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Isa 34:15\nThe Bishops' Bible of Matthew Parker (1568) from the Latin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Isa 34:14 there shall the Lamia lye and haue her lodgyng.\nDouay\u2013Rheims Bible (1582/1610) also preserves the Latin rendering :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Isa 34:14 And demons and monsters shall meet, and the hairy ones shall cry out one to another, there hath the lamia lain down, and found rest for herself.\nThe Geneva Bible of William Whittingham (1587) from the Hebrew:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Isa 34:14 and the screech owl shall rest there, and shall finde for her selfe a quiet dwelling.\nThen the King James Version (1611):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Isa 34:14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.\nThe \"screech owl\" translation of the King James Version is, together with the \"owl\" (, probably a water bird) in 34:11 and the \"great owl\" (, translated in other versions as a snake) of 34:15, an attempt to render the passage by choosing suitable animals for difficult to translate Hebrew words.\nLater translations include:\nJewish tradition.\nMajor sources in Jewish tradition regarding Lilith in chronological order include:\nDead Sea Scrolls.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls contain one indisputable reference to Lilith in \"Songs of the Sage\" (4Q510\u2013511) fragment 1:\nAnd I, the Instructor, proclaim His glorious splendour so as to frighten and to te[rrify] all the spirits of the destroying angels; spirits of the bastards, demons, Lilith, howlers, and [desert dwellers] ... and those which fall upon men, without warning, to lead them astray from a spirit of understanding, and to make their heart and their minds desolate during the present dominion of wickedness and predetermined time of humiliations for the Sons of Lig[ht], by the guilt of the ages of [those] smitten by iniquity \u2013 not for eternal destruction, [bu]t for an era of humiliation for transgression.\nAs with the Massoretic text of Isaiah 34:14, and therefore unlike the plural \"liliyyot\" (or \"liliyyoth\") in the Isaiah scroll 34:14, \"lilit\" in 4Q510 is singular, this liturgical text both cautions against the presence of supernatural malevolence and assumes familiarity with Lilith; distinct from the biblical text, however, this passage does not function under any socio-political agenda, but instead serves in the same capacity as An Exorcism (4Q560) and Songs to Disperse Demons (11Q11). The text is thus, to a community \"deeply involved in the realm of demonology\", an exorcism hymn.\nJoseph M. Baumgarten (1991) identified the unnamed woman of \"The Seductress\" (4Q184) as related to the female demon. However, John J. Collins regards this identification as \"intriguing\" but that it is \"safe to say\" that (4Q184) is based on the strange woman of Proverbs 2, 5, 7, 9:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nEarly Rabbinic literature.\nLilith does not occur in the Mishnah. The Jerusalem Talmud contains one mention in the 1523 Bomberg edition (Shabbat 6:9), which is not supported by any manuscript. The word \"lilit\" appears five times in the Babylonian Talmud:\nThe above statement by Hanina may be related to the belief that nocturnal emissions engendered the birth of demons:\nThe Midrash Rabbah collection contains two references to Lilith. The first one is present in Genesis Rabbah 22:7 and 18:4: according to Rabbi Yehuda beRabbi, God proceeded to create a second Eve for Adam, after Lilith had to return to dust. However, to be exact the said passages do not employ the Hebrew word itself and instead speak of \"the first Eve\" (, analogical to Adam ha-Rishon \"the first Adam\"). Although in the medieval Hebrew literature and folklore, especially that reflected on the protective amulets of various kinds, \"The First Eve\" was identified with Lilith, one should remain careful in transposing this equation to the Late Antiquity.\nThe second mention of Lilith, this time explicit, is present in Numbers Rabbah 16:25. The midrash develops the story of Moses's plea after God expresses anger at the bad report of the spies. Moses responds to a threat by God that He will destroy the Israelite people. Moses pleads before God, that God should not be like Lilith who kills her own children. Moses said:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[God,] do not do it [i.e. destroy the Israelite people], that the nations of the world may not regard you as a cruel Being and say: 'The Generation of the Flood came and He destroyed them, the Generation of the Separation came and He destroyed them, the Sodomites and the Egyptians came and He destroyed them, and these also, whom he called My son, My firstborn (Ex. IV, 22), He is now destroying! As that Lilith who, when she finds nothing else, turns upon her own children, so Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land... He hath slain them' (Num. XIV, 16)!\nIncantation bowls.\nAn individual Lilith, along with Bagdana \"king of the lilits\", is one of the demons to feature prominently in protective spells in the eighty surviving Jewish occult incantation bowls from Sassanid Empire Babylon (4th\u20136th century AD) with influence from Iranian culture.[47] These bowls were buried upside down below the structure of the house or on the land of the house, in order to trap the demon or demoness. Almost every house was found to have such protective bowls against demons and demonesses.\nThe centre of the inside of the bowl depicts Lilith, or the male form, Lilit. Surrounding the image is writing in spiral form; the writing often begins at the centre and works its way to the edge. The writing is most commonly scripture or references to the Talmud. The incantation bowls which have been analysed, are inscribed in the following languages, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Syriac, Mandaic, Middle Persian, and Arabic. Some bowls are written in a false script which has no meaning.\nThe correctly worded incantation bowl was capable of warding off Lilith or Lilit from the household. Lilith had the power to transform into a woman's physical features, seduce her husband, and conceive a child. However, Lilith would become hateful toward the children born of the husband and wife and would seek to kill them. Similarly, Lilit would transform into the physical features of the husband, seduce the wife, she would give birth to a child. It would become evident that the child was not fathered by the husband, and the child would be looked down on. Lilit would seek revenge on the family by killing the children born to the husband and wife.\nKey features of the depiction of Lilith or Lilit include the following. The figure is often depicted with arms and legs chained, indicating the control of the family over the demon(ess). The demon(ess) is depicted in a frontal position with the whole face showing. The eyes are very large, as well as the hands (if depicted). The demon(ess) is entirely static.\nOne bowl contains the following inscription commissioned from a Jewish occultist to protect a woman called Rashnoi and her husband from Lilith:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Thou liliths, male lili and female lilith, hag and ghool, I adjure you by the Strong One of Abraham, by the Rock of Isaac, by the Shaddai of Jacob, by Yah Ha-Shem by Yah his memorial, to turn away from this Rashnoi b. M. and from Geyonai b. M. her husband. [Here is] your divorce and writ and letter of separation, sent through holy angels. Amen, Amen, Selah, Halleluyah! (http://)\u2014\u200a\nAlphabet of Ben Sira.\nThe pseudepigraphical 8th\u201310th centuries \"Alphabet of Ben Sira\" is considered to be the oldest form of the story of Lilith as Adam's first wife. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known. Scholars tend to date the Alphabet between the 8th and 10th centuries AD. The work has been characterized by some scholars as satirical, but Ginzberg concluded it was meant seriously.\nIn the text, an amulet is inscribed with the names of three angels (Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof) and placed around the neck of newborn boys in order to protect them from the lilin until their circumcision. The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this tradition are, in fact, dated as being much older. The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to the Alphabet, and is not a new concept, as it can be found in Genesis Rabbah. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor may be exclusive to the Alphabet.\nThe idea in the text that Adam had a wife prior to Eve may have developed from an interpretation of the Book of Genesis and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God's creation of Eve from Adam's rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\" The Alphabet text places Lilith's creation after God's words in Genesis 2:18 that \"it is not good for man to be alone\"; in this text God forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam but she and Adam bicker. Lilith claims that since she and Adam were created in the same way they were equal and she refuses to submit to him:\nAfter God created Adam, who was alone, He said, \"It is not good for man to be alone.\" He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, \"I will not lie below,\" and he said, \"I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.\" Lilith responded, \"We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.\" But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.\nAdam stood in prayer before his Creator: \"Sovereign of the universe!\" he said, \"the woman you gave me has run away.\" At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof, to bring her back.\nSaid the Holy One to Adam, \"If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.\" The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, \"We shall drown you in the sea.\"\n\"Leave me!' she said. \"I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.\"\nWhen the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: \"Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.\" She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.\nThe background and purpose of \"The Alphabet of Ben-Sira\" is unclear. It is a collection of stories about heroes of the Bible and Talmud, it may have been a collection of folk-tales, a refutation of Christian, Karaite, or other separatist movements; its content seems so offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish satire, although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany.\n\"The Alphabet of Ben-Sira\" is the earliest surviving source of the story, and the conception that Lilith was Adam's first wife became only widely known with the 17th century \"Lexicon Talmudicum\" of German scholar Johannes Buxtorf.\nIn this folk tradition that arose in the early Middle Ages, Lilith, a dominant female demon, became identified with Asmodeus, King of Demons, as his queen. Asmodeus was already well known by this time because of the legends about him in the Talmud. Thus, the merging of Lilith and Asmodeus was inevitable. The second myth of Lilith grew to include legends about another world and by some accounts this other world existed side by side with this one, \"Yenne Velt\" is Yiddish for this described \"Other World\". In this case Asmodeus and Lilith were believed to procreate demonic offspring endlessly and spread chaos at every turn.\nTwo primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately; there is hardly a tale where she encompasses both roles. But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft. Such stories are commonly found among Jewish folklore.\nThe influence of the rabbinic traditions.\nAlthough the image of Lilith of the \"Alphabet of Ben Sira\" is unprecedented, some elements in her portrayal can be traced back to the talmudic and midrashic traditions that arose around Eve.\nFirst and foremost, the very introduction of Lilith to the creation story rests on the rabbinic myth, prompted by the two separate creation accounts in Genesis 1:1\u20132:25, that there were two original women. A way of resolving the apparent discrepancy between these two accounts was to assume that there must have been some other first woman, apart from the one later identified with Eve. The Rabbis, noting Adam's exclamation, \"this time (\"zot hapa\u2018am\") [this is] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh\" (Genesis 2:23), took it as an intimation that there must already have been a \"first time\". According to Genesis rabbah 18:4, Adam was disgusted upon seeing the first woman full of \"discharge and blood\", and God had to provide him with another one. The subsequent creation is performed with adequate precautions: Adam is made to sleep, so as not to witness the process itself (Sanhedrin 39a), and Eve is adorned with fine jewellery (Genesis rabbah 18:1) and brought to Adam by the angels Gabriel and Michael (ibid. 18:3). However, nowhere do the rabbis specify what happened to the first woman, leaving the matter open for further speculation. This is the gap into which the later tradition of Lilith could fit.\nSecond, this new woman is still met with harsh rabbinic allegations. Again playing on the Hebrew phrase , Adam, according to the same midrash, declares: \"it is she [\"zot\"] who is destined to strike the bell [\"zog\"] and to speak [in strife] against me, as you read, 'a golden bell [\"pa\u2018amon\"] and a pomegranate' [Exodus 28:34] ... it is she who will trouble me [\"mefa\u2018amtani\"] all night\" (Genesis Rabbah 18:4). The first woman also becomes the object of accusations ascribed to Rabbi Joshua of Siknin, according to whom Eve, despite the divine efforts, turned out to be \"swelled-headed, coquette, eavesdropper, gossip, prone to jealousy, light-fingered and gadabout\" (Genesis Rabbah 18:2). A similar set of charges appears in Genesis Rabbah 17:8, according to which Eve's creation from Adam's rib rather than from the earth makes her inferior to Adam and never satisfied with anything.\nThird, and despite the terseness of the biblical text in this regard, the erotic iniquities attributed to Eve constitute a separate category of her shortcomings. Told in Genesis 3:16 that \"your desire shall be for your husband\", she is accused by the Rabbis of having an overdeveloped sexual drive (Genesis Rabbah 20:7) and constantly enticing Adam (Genesis Rabbah 23:5). However, in terms of textual popularity and dissemination, the motif of Eve copulating with the primeval serpent takes priority over her other sexual transgressions. Despite the rather unsettling picturesqueness of this account, it is conveyed in numerous places: Genesis Rabbah 18:6, and BT Sotah 9b, Shabbat 145b\u2013146a and 156a, Yevamot 103b and Avodah Zarah 22b.\nKabbalah.\nKabbalistic mysticism attempted to establish a more exact relationship between Lilith and God. With her major characteristics having been well developed by the end of the Talmudic period, after six centuries had elapsed between the Aramaic incantation texts that mention Lilith and the early Spanish Kabbalistic writings in the 13th century, she reappears, and her life history becomes known in greater mythological detail. Her creation is described in many alternative versions.\nOne mentions her creation as being before Adam's, on the fifth day, because the \"living creatures\" with whose swarms God filled the waters included Lilith. A similar version, related to the earlier Talmudic passages, recounts how Lilith was fashioned with the same substance as Adam was, shortly before. A third alternative version states that God originally created Adam and Lilith in a manner that the female creature was contained in the male. Lilith's soul was lodged in the depths of the Great Abyss. When God called her, she joined Adam. After Adam's body was created a thousand souls from the Left (evil) side attempted to attach themselves to him. However, God drove them off. Adam was left lying as a body without a soul. Then a cloud descended and God commanded the earth to produce a living soul. This God breathed into Adam, who began to spring to life and his female was attached to his side. God separated the female from Adam's side. The female side was Lilith, whereupon she flew to the Cities of the Sea and attacked humankind.\nYet another version claims that Lilith emerged as a divine entity that was born spontaneously, either out of the Great Supernal Abyss or out of the power of an aspect of God (the Gevurah of Din). This aspect of God was negative and punitive, as well as one of his ten attributes (Sefirot), at its lowest manifestation has an affinity with the realm of evil and it is out of this that Lilith merged with Samael.\nAn alternative story links Lilith with the creation of luminaries. The \"first light\", which is the light of Mercy (one of the Sefirot), appeared on the first day of creation when God said \"Let there be light\". This light became hidden and the Holiness became surrounded by a husk of evil. \"A husk (klippa) was created around the brain\" and this husk spread and brought out another husk, which was Lilith.\nMidrash ABKIR.\nThe first medieval source to depict Adam and Lilith in full was the Midrash A.B.K.I.R. (c. 10th century), which was followed by the Zohar and other Kabbalistic writings. Adam is said to be perfect until he recognises either his sin or Cain's fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world. He then separates from holy Eve, sleeps alone, and fasts for 130 years. During this time \"Pizna\", either an alternate name for Lilith or a daughter of hers, desires his beauty and seduces him against his will. She gives birth to multitudes of djinns and demons, the first of them being named Agrimas. However, they are defeated by Methuselah, who slays thousands of them with a holy sword and forces Agrimas to give him the names of the rest, after which he casts them away to the sea and the mountains.\nTreatise on the Left Emanation.\nThe mystical writing of two brothers Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, \"Treatise on the Left Emanation\", which predates the Zohar by a few decades, states that Samael and Lilith are in the shape of an androgynous being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the Throne of Glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite. The two twin androgynous couples resembled each other and both \"were like the image of Above\"; that is, that they are reproduced in a visible form of an androgynous deity.\n19. In answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces.\nAnother version that was also current among Kabbalistic circles in the Middle Ages establishes Lilith as the first of Samael's four wives: Lilith, Naamah, Eisheth, and Agrat bat Mahlat. Each of them are mothers of demons and have their own hosts and unclean spirits in no number. The marriage of archangel Samael and Lilith was arranged by Tanin'iver (\"Blind Dragon\"), who is the counterpart of \"the dragon that is in the sea\". Blind Dragon acts as an intermediary between Lilith and Samael:\nBlind Dragon rides Lilith the Sinful \u2013 may she be extirpated quickly in our days, Amen! \u2013 And this Blind Dragon brings about the union between Samael and Lilith. And just as \"the Dragon that is in the sea\" (Isa. 27:1) has no eyes, likewise Blind Dragon that is above, in the likeness of a spiritual form, is without eyes, that is to say, without colors... (Patai 81:458) Samael is called the Slant Serpent, and Lilith is called the Tortuous Serpent.\nThe marriage of Samael and Lilith is known as the \"Angel Satan\" or the \"Other God\", but it was not allowed to last. To prevent Lilith and Samael's demonic children \"Lilin\" from filling the world, God castrated Samael. In many 17th century Kabbalistic books, this seems to be a reinterpretation of an old Talmudic myth where God castrated the male Leviathan and slew the female Leviathan in order to prevent them from mating and thereby destroying the Earth with their offspring. With Lilith being unable to fornicate with Samael anymore, she sought to couple with men who experience nocturnal emissions. A 15th or 16th century Kabbalah text states that God has \"cooled\" the female Leviathan, meaning that he has made Lilith infertile and she is a mere fornication.\nThe \"Treatise on the Left Emanation\" also says that there are two Liliths, the lesser being married to the great demon Asmodeus.\nThe Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni. The name of his mate is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, and their daughter is Lilith.\nAnother passage charges Lilith as being a tempting serpent of Eve.\nAnd the Serpent, the Woman of Harlotry, incited and seduced Eve through the husks of Light which in itself is holiness. And the Serpent seduced Holy Eve, and enough said for him who understands. And all this ruination came about because Adam the first man coupled with Eve while she was in her menstrual impurity \u2013 this is the filth and the impure seed of the Serpent who mounted Eve before Adam mounted her. Behold, here it is before you: because of the sins of Adam the first man all the things mentioned came into being. For Evil Lilith, when she saw the greatness of his corruption, became strong in her husks, and came to Adam against his will, and became hot from him and bore him many demons and spirits and Lilin. (Patai81:455f)\nZohar.\nReferences to Lilith in the Zohar include the following:\nShe roams at night, and goes all about the world and makes sport with men and causes them to emit seed. In every place where a man sleeps alone in a house, she visits him and grabs him and attaches herself to him and has her desire from him, and bears from him. And she also afflicts him with sickness, and he knows it not, and all this takes place when the moon is on the wane.\nThis passage may be related to the mention of Lilith in Talmud Shabbath 151b (see above), and also to Talmud Eruvin 18b where nocturnal emissions are connected with the begettal of demons.\nAccording to Rapahel Patai, older sources state clearly that after Lilith's Red Sea sojourn (mentioned also in Louis Ginzberg's \"Legends of the Jews\"), she returned to Adam and begat children from him by forcing herself upon him. Before doing so, she attaches herself to Cain and bears him numerous spirits and demons. In the Zohar, however, Lilith is said to have succeeded in begetting offspring from Adam even during their short-lived sexual experience. Lilith leaves Adam in Eden, as she is not a suitable helpmate for him. Gershom Scholem proposes that the author of the Zohar, Rabbi Moses de Leon, was aware of both the folk tradition of Lilith and another conflicting version, possibly older.\nThe Zohar adds further that two female spirits instead of one, Lilith and Naamah, desired Adam and seduced him. The issue of these unions were demons and spirits called \"the plagues of humankind\", and the usual added explanation was that it was through Adam's own sin that Lilith overcame him against his will.\n17th-century Hebrew magical amulets.\nA copy of Jean de Pauly's translation of the Zohar in the Ritman Library contains an inserted late 17th century printed Hebrew sheet for use in magical amulets where the prophet Elijah confronts Lilith.\nThe sheet contains two texts within borders, which are amulets, one for a male ('lazakhar'), the other one for a female ('lanekevah'). The invocations mention Adam, Eve and Lilith, 'Chavah Rishonah' (the first Eve, who is identical with Lilith), also devils or angels: Sanoy, Sansinoy, Smangeluf, Shmari'el (the guardian) and Hasdi'el (the merciful). A few lines in Yiddish are followed by the dialogue between the prophet Elijah and Lilith when he met her with her host of demons to kill the mother and take her new-born child ('to drink her blood, suck her bones and eat her flesh'). She tells Elijah that she will lose her power if someone uses her secret names, which she reveals at the end: \"lilith, abitu, abizu, hakash, avers hikpodu, ayalu, matrota ...\"\nIn other amulets, probably informed by \"The Alphabet of Ben-Sira\", she is Adam's first wife. (Yalqut Reubeni, Zohar 1:34b, 3:19)\nCharles Richardson's dictionary portion of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana\" appends to his etymological discussion of \"lullaby\" \"a [manuscript] note written in a copy of Skinner\" [i.e. Stephen Skinner's 1671 \"Etymologicon Lingu\u00e6 Anglican\u00e6\"], which asserts that the word \"lullaby\" originates from , a Hebrew incantation meaning \"Lilith begone\" recited by Jewish mothers over an infant's cradle. Richardson did not endorse the theory and modern lexicographers consider it a false etymology.\nAlsatian Krasmesser (16th to 20th century).\nNot so much an amulet as a ritual object for protection, the \"Krasmesser\" (or \"Kreismesser\", circle knife) played a role in Jewish birth rituals in the area of Alsace, Switzerland and Southern Germany between the 16th and 20th century. The Krasmesser would be used by a midwife or by the husband to draw a magic circle around the pregnant or birthing woman to protect her from Lilith and the evil eye, which were considered to represent the greatest danger for children and pregnant women.\nRabbi Naphtali Hirsch ben Elieser Treves described this custom as early as 1560, and later references to a knife or sword by the birthing bed by both Paul Christian Kirchner and Johann Christian Georg Bodenschatz indicate its continuance. A publication about birth customs by the Jewish Museum of Switzerland also includes oral accounts from 20th century Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg which likewise mention circling movements with a knife in order to protect a woman in childbirth.\nGreco-Roman mythology.\nIn the Latin Vulgate Book of Isaiah 34:14, Lilith is translated \"lamia\".\nAccording to Augustine Calmet, Lilith has connections with early views on vampires and sorcery:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some learned men have thought they discovered some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; but all that they say of it does not come near what is related of the vampires. The lamiae, the strigae, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living people, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand by the name of vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiae and strigae have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.\nI own that these terms [\"lamiae\" and \"strigae\"] are found in the versions of Holy Scripture. For instance, Isaiah, describing the condition to which Babylon was to be reduced after her ruin, says that she shall become the abode of satyrs, lamiae, and strigae (in Hebrew, lilith). This last term, according to the Hebrews, signifies the same thing, as the Greeks express by strix and lamiae, which are sorceresses or magicians, who seek to put to death new-born children. Whence it comes that the Jews are accustomed to write in the four corners of the chamber of a woman just delivered, \"Adam, Eve, be gone from hence lilith.\" ... The ancient Greeks knew these dangerous sorceresses by the name of lamiae, and they believed that they devoured children, or sucked away all their blood till they died.\nAccording to Siegmund Hurwitz the Talmudic Lilith is connected with the Greek Lamia, who, according to Hurwitz, likewise governed a class of child stealing lamia-demons. Lamia bore the title \"child killer\" and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body from the waist up and a serpentine body from the waist down. One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess Hecate, another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them. Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men's blood. Her gift was the \"mark of a Sibyl\", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was \"cursed\" to never be able to shut her eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, Zeus gave her the ability to remove and replace her eyes from their sockets.\nIn Mandaeism.\nIn Mandaean scriptures such as the \"Ginza Rabba\" and \"Qulasta\", liliths () are mentioned as inhabitants of the World of Darkness.\nLilith is mentioned in a Mandaean magic incantation inscribed in Mandaic on a c. 7th-century Late Antiquity lead amulet designated \"BM 135794 II\", where she is mentioned together with other demons, in plural form. The first of the charm's text consists of a banning formula that calls for the binding, subduing and destruction of various demons, mentioned by name in plural form, and also talks of the demons of time walking about and harming \"the children of Adam and all offspring of Hawa (=Eve)\". The lines of this formula are repeated near-identically about three times, with Lilith's name, in plural, appearing in the formula on lines 27, 46 and 55, in the same near-identical line \"Sahras, Dews, Rhuas, Humartas and Lilits.\" At lines 70-100, the banning formula of the charm ends and is taken over by a Mandaic magic story that tells of a gnostic tree made up of different demon groups and of a \"Dew\" demon dwelling in the tree being cast out of it and expelled from the tree by the archangel Gabriel. In this part of the charm, Lilith is mentioned as a part of this gnostic tree, again rendered in plural. The tree's trunk is said to be made up of \"Dews\" (or 'dewis' or 'daeva') on lines 76-77, the tree's foliage to be made up of \"Latabas\" ('devils') on line 77, and its branches to be made up of \"Lilits\" on lines 77-78. The charm associates the demons with time, using units of time such as \"season\", \"month\", \"day\", \"hour\", \"minute\" and so on, and so the charm has been interpreted to be a magical protection against \"demons of time\" or against time as threatening and harmful elements.\nThe amulet is part of a set of lead, silver and gold amulets attributed to the family archive of Mah-Adhur Gushnasp, who served as prime minister of the Sasanian Empire during Ardashir III's reign, and was discovered by Lietuenant Colonel H.S. Alexander in a lead jar under the foundations of a private house in a mound near el-Qurnah at the confluence of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates in southern Iraq during a private dig between 1910 and 1920, which was then passed on to the British Library and is today housed in the Department of the Ancient Near East in the British Museum. The text was translated by scholar Christa M\u00fcller-Kessler and published in 2002 in Cornelia Wunsch and C. B. F. Walker's \"Mining The Archives\".\nIn Arabic mythology.\nThe occult writer Ahmad al-Buni (d. 1225), in his \"Sun of the Great Knowledge\" (), mentions a demon called \"the mother of children\" (), a term also used \"in one place\". \nFolkloric traditions recorded around 1953 tell about a jinn called \"Qarinah\", who was rejected by Adam and mated with Iblis instead. She gave birth to a host of demons and became known as their mother. To take revenge on Adam, she pursues human children. As such, she would kill a pregnant mother's baby in the womb, causes impotence to men or attacks little children with illnesses. According to occult practises, she would be subject to the demon-king \"Murrah al-Abyad\", which appears to be another name for Iblis used in magical writings. Although Lilith has no place in the Islamic creation myth (nor elsewhere in formal Islamic theology), folklore about Lilith influenced that of the Qarinah during the early days of Islam.\nIn Western media.\nIn German media.\nLilith's earliest appearance in the literature of the Romantic period (1789\u20131832) was in Goethe's 1808 work \"\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAfter Mephistopheles offers this warning to Faust, he then, quite ironically, encourages Faust to dance with \"the Pretty Witch\". Lilith and Faust engage in a short dialogue, where Lilith recounts the days spent in Eden.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIn English media.\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which developed around 1848, were greatly influenced by Goethe's work on the theme of Lilith. In 1863, Dante Gabriel Rossetti of the Brotherhood began painting what would later be his first rendition of \"Lady Lilith\", a painting he expected to be his \"best picture hitherto\". Symbols appearing in the painting allude to the \"femme fatale\" reputation of the Romantic Lilith: poppies (death and cold) and white roses (sterile passion). Accompanying his \"Lady Lilith\" painting from 1866, Rossetti wrote a sonnet entitled \"Lilith\", which was first published in Swinburne's pamphlet-review (1868), \"Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe poem and the picture appeared together alongside Rossetti's painting \"Sibylla Palmifera\" and the sonnet \"Soul's Beauty\". In 1881, the \"Lilith\" sonnet was renamed \"Body's Beauty\" in order to contrast it and \"Soul's Beauty\". The two were placed sequentially in \"The House of Life\" collection (sonnets number 77 and 78).\nRossetti wrote in 1870:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lady [Lilith] ... represents a Modern Lilith combing out her abundant golden hair and gazing on herself in the glass with that self-absorption by whose strange fascination such natures draw others within their own circle.\u2014\u200a\nThis is in accordance with Jewish folk tradition, which associates Lilith both with long hair (a symbol of dangerous feminine seductive power in Jewish culture), and with possessing women by entering them through mirrors.\nThe Victorian poet Robert Browning re-envisioned Lilith in his poem \"Adam, Lilith, and Eve\". First published in 1883, the poem uses the traditional myths surrounding the triad of Adam, Eve, and Lilith. Browning depicts Lilith and Eve as being friendly and complicitous with each other, as they sit together on either side of Adam. Under the threat of death, Eve admits that she never loved Adam, while Lilith confesses that she always loved him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nBrowning focused on Lilith's emotional attributes, rather than that of her ancient demon predecessors.\nScottish author George MacDonald also wrote a fantasy novel entitled \"Lilith\", first published in 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology are present in the author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing at herself in a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.\nAustralian poet and scholar Christopher John Brennan (1870\u20131932), included a section titled \"Lilith\" in his major work \"Poems: 1913\" (Sydney: G. B. Philip and Son, 1914). The \"Lilith\" section contains thirteen poems exploring the Lilith myth and is central to the meaning of the collection as a whole.\nC. L. Moore's 1940 story \"Fruit of Knowledge\" is written from Lilith's point of view. It is a re-telling of the Fall of Man as a love triangle between Lilith, Adam and Eve \u2013 with Eve's eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam's love.\nBritish poet John Siddique's 2011 collection \"Full Blood\" has a suite of 11 poems called \"The Tree of Life\", which features Lilith as the divine feminine aspect of God. A number of the poems feature Lilith directly, including the piece \"Unwritten\" which deals with the spiritual problem of the feminine being removed by the scribes from \"The Bible.\"\nLilith is also mentioned in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", by C. S. Lewis. The character Mr. Beaver ascribes the ancestry of the main antagonist, Jadis the White Witch, to Lilith.\n\"Lilith\" is a poem by Vladimir Nabokov, written in 1928. Many have connected it to Lolita, but Nabokov adamantly denies this: \"Intelligent readers will abstain from examining this impersonal fantasy for any links with my later fiction.\"\nIn Samuel de Ceccatty's 2022 British adult animated short film \"Lilith &amp; Eve\", Eve leaves Eden to learn about Lilith despite Adam's protests.\nIn American media.\n\"Lilith: A Dramatic Poem\" is a four-act medieval fantasy verse drama written in blank verse by American poet and playwright George Sterling, first published in 1919. Influential critic H. L. Mencken said of Sterling: \"I think his dramatic poem \"Lilith\" was the greatest thing he ever wrote.\" The \"New York Times\" declared \"Lilith\" \"the finest thing in poetic drama yet done in America and one of the finest poetic dramas yet written in English.\" Author Theodore Dreiser said: \"It rings richer in thought than any American dramatic poem with which I am familiar.\" Poet Clark Ashton Smith wrote: \"\"Lilith\" is certainly the best dramatic poem in English since the days of Swinburne and Browning. ... The lyrics interspersed throughout the drama are as beautiful as any by the Elizabethans.\"\nIn the role playing game series \"Vampire the Masquerade\", Lilith plays a major part in the mythology within the games.\n\"Lilith\" is a 1961 novel by J. R. Salamanca that tells the story of a man, Vincent, who is seduced by a schizophrenic woman named Lilith. It explores themes of love, obsession, and blurred lines between fantasy and reality. A feature film of the same name written by Robert Rossen and starring Jean Seberg and Warren Beatty was released in 1964.\nIn the 2019 adult animated series \"Hazbin Hotel\", Lilith is depicted as the wife of Lucifer and the queen of Hell. Charlie, the protagonist of the series, is Lilith's daughter. According to \"The Washington Times\", \"Hazbin Hotel\" subverts traditional narratives of Lucifer and Lilith by presenting their betrayal of God as heroic and noble.\nIn the Diablo series of video games, Lilith is depicted as the daughter of Mephisto and the creator of the games world alongside her lover, the angel Inarius. Lilith serves as the main antagonist in Diablo IV.\nIn Western esotericism.\nThe depiction of Lilith in Romanticism continues to be popular among Wiccans and in other modern occultism. A few magical orders dedicated to the undercurrent of Lilith, featuring initiations specifically related to the arcana of the \"first mother\", exist. Two organisations that use initiations and magic associated with Lilith are the Ordo Antichristianus Illuminati and the Order of Phosphorus. Lilith appears as a succubus in Aleister Crowley's \"De Arte Magica.\" Lilith was also one of the middle names of Crowley's first child, Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley (1904\u20131906), and Lilith is sometimes identified with Babalon in Thelemic writings. Many early occult writers who contributed to modern day Wicca expressed special reverence for Lilith. Charles Leland associated Aradia with Lilith: Aradia, says Leland, is Herodias, who was regarded in stregheria folklore as being associated with Diana as chief of the witches. Leland further notes that Herodias is a name that comes from west Asia, where it denoted an early form of Lilith.\nGerald Gardner asserted that there was continuous historical worship of Lilith to present day, and that her name is sometimes given to the goddess being personified in the coven by the priestess. This idea was further attested by Doreen Valiente, who cited her as a presiding goddess of the Craft: \"the personification of erotic dreams, the suppressed desire for delights\". Valiente also falls prey to the misindentification of the Burney Relief as Lilith. She identifies Lilith as a 'moon goddess' as well as a patroness of witches.\nIn some contemporary concepts, \"Lilith\" is viewed as the embodiment of the Goddess, a designation that is thought to be shared with what these faiths believe to be her counterparts: Inanna, Ishtar, Asherah, Anath, Anahita and Isis. According to one view, Lilith was originally a Sumerian, Babylonian, or Hebrew mother goddess of childbirth, children, women, and sexuality.\nRaymond Buckland holds that Lilith is a dark moon goddess on par with the Hindu Kali.\nMany theistic Satanists consider Lilith a goddess, with some recognizing her as the patron of strong women and women's rights. Lilith is popular among theistic Satanists because of her association with Satan and is most often worshipped by women, but not exclusively. Some Satanists believe that she is married to Satan and thus think of her as a mother figure. Others base their reverence for her on her history as a succubus and praise her as a sex goddess. A different approach to a Satanic Lilith holds that she was once a fertility and agricultural goddess.\nThe Western mystery tradition associates Lilith with the qlippoth of Kabbalah. Dion Fortune writes, \"The Virgin Mary is reflected in Lilith\", and that Lilith is the source of \"lustful dreams\".\nLilith is a source of veneration within the Luciferian Tradition of Michael W. Ford. The research and esoteric development of modern Luciferianism recognizes Lilith as equal to Samael, composing the symbol of the \"Adversary\". Michael W. Ford's works on this Luciferian interpretation was first published in 1999 and the early 2000's, with \"Book of the Witch Moon\"; \"Luciferian Witchcraft\" and \"Liber HVHI\" . The origins of the various mythologies concerning Lilith were then published in works such as \"The Bible of the Adversary\"; \"Adversarial Light - Magick of the Adversary\"; \"Maskim Hul\"; \"Sebitti\"; \"Akhkharu - Vampyre Magick\"; \"Dragon of the Two Flames\" and \"The Demons of Solomon\", among others. Ford's work explores considerably deep lore commonly overlooked previously by much of common lore concerning Lilith. \n\"The Luciferian Tarot\", the first published Left-Hand Path Tarot Deck and book 2007, depicts several Qlippothic representations of Lilith as a guide and feminine energy reflecting an aspect of the Adversary in Luciferianism. Additional works which focus by a chapter on Lilith are \"Infernal Union - Sinister Initiation and Satanic Psalms\" and \"Whispers of the Jinn\" which presents the Arabic and Islamic representation of Lilith. The book on ancient Persian sorcery, known as Yatukdinoih, centered on the cult of the Daevas and Ahriman, identifies a manifestation of Lilith as both the Manichaean \"Az\" and Zoroastrian demoness, \"Jeh\". This is based on the traits and lore concerning the direct alignments with Lilith. \nRecently, Lilith is the central topic of study in Michael W. Ford's \"Lilith and Lamastu: Legends of the Ancient Abyss\", which explores the Western mystery tradition within a Luciferian perspective. The Mesopotamian 3rd to 8th century Aramaic Incantation Bowls, hold a good deal of lore concerning the many different types of Lilith-spirits and the depictions of Lilith, yet also the associations between the King of Demons, Bagdana. The modern aim of Luciferian Magick with concern to Lilith, utilizes methods of seeking the nocturnal energies inherent in humanity and is directed towards beneficial workings:\n\"For the Black Magickan, these are demons of nocturnal desire, the passions of our subconscious that motivate aspects of our consciousness. Igrath, the \u201cMistress of the Sorcerers\u201d guides and inspires the attainment of magical knowledge and sorcery, including the shaping of the energy of the mind to manipulate the element of air to project upon the astral plane and by dream.\"\nThe most popular iteration of the Sigil of Lilith, designed in the style of those of the Lesser Key of Solomon, appeared in 2007 by controversial contemporary occultist, Robin Artisson.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18631", "revid": "31339567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18631", "title": "Lorentz force", "text": "Force acting on charged particles in electric and magnetic fields\nIn electromagnetism, the Lorentz force is the force exerted on a charged particle by electric and magnetic fields. It determines how charged particles move in electromagnetic environments and underlies many physical phenomena, from the operation of electric motors and particle accelerators to the behavior of plasmas.\nThe Lorentz force has two components. The electric force acts in the direction of the electric field for positive charges and opposite to it for negative charges, tending to accelerate the particle in a straight line. The magnetic force is perpendicular to both the particle's velocity and the magnetic field, and it causes the particle to move along a curved trajectory, often circular or helical in form, depending on the directions of the fields.\nVariations on the force law describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire (sometimes called Laplace force), and the electromotive force in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field, as described by Faraday's law of induction.\nTogether with Maxwell's equations, which describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges and currents, the Lorentz force law forms the foundation of classical electrodynamics. While the law remains valid in special relativity, it breaks down at small scales where quantum effects become important. In particular, the intrinsic spin of particles gives rise to additional interactions with electromagnetic fields that are not accounted for by the Lorentz force.\nHistorians suggest that the law is implicit in a paper by James Clerk Maxwell, published in 1865. Hendrik Lorentz arrived at a complete derivation in 1895, identifying the contribution of the electric force a few years after Oliver Heaviside correctly identified the contribution of the magnetic force.\nDefinition and properties.\nPoint particle.\nThe Lorentz force F acting on a point particle with electric charge q, moving with velocity v, due to an external electric field E and magnetic field B, is given by (SI definition of quantities):\nformula_1\nHere, \u00d7 is the vector cross product, and all quantities in bold are vectors. In component form, the force is written as:\nformula_2\nIn general, the electric and magnetic fields depend on both position and time. As a charged particle moves through space, the force acting on it at any given moment depends on its current location, velocity, and the instantaneous values of the fields at that location. Therefore, explicitly, the Lorentz force can be written as:\nformula_3\nin which r is the position vector of the charged particle, t is time, and the overdot is a time derivative.\nThe total electromagnetic force consists of two parts: the electric force \"q\"E, which acts in the direction of the electric field and accelerates the particle linearly, and the magnetic force \"q\"(v \u00d7 B), which acts perpendicularly to both the velocity and the magnetic field. Some sources refer to the Lorentz force as the sum of both components, while others use the term to refer to the magnetic part alone. \nThe direction of the magnetic force is often determined using the right-hand rule: if the index finger points in the direction of the velocity, and the middle finger points in the direction of the magnetic field, then the thumb points in the direction of the force (for a positive charge). In a uniform magnetic field, this results in circular or helical trajectories, known as cyclotron motion.\nIn many practical situations, such as the motion of electrons or ions in a plasma, the effect of a magnetic field can be approximated as a superposition of two components: a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the guiding center, and a relatively slow drift of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures. These differences may lead to electric currents or chemical separation.\nWhile the magnetic force affects the direction of a particle's motion, it does no mechanical work on the particle. The rate at which the energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle is given by the dot product of the particle's velocity and the force:\nformula_4Here, the magnetic term vanishes because a vector is always perpendicular to its cross product with another vector; the scalar triple product formula_5 is zero. Thus, only the electric field can transfer energy to or from a particle and change its kinetic energy.\nSome textbooks use the Lorentz force law as the fundamental definition of the electric and magnetic fields. That is, the fields E and B are uniquely defined at each point in space and time by the hypothetical force F a test particle of charge \"q\" and velocity v would experience there, even if no charge is present. This definition remains valid even for particles approaching the speed of light (that is, magnitude of v, |v| \u2248 \"c\"). However, some argue that using the Lorentz force law as the definition of the electric and magnetic fields is not necessarily the most fundamental approach possible.\nContinuous charge distribution.\nThe Lorentz force law also given in terms of continuous charge distributions, such as those found in conductors or plasmas. For a small element of a moving charge distribution with charge\u202fformula_6, the infinitesimal force is given by:\nformula_7\nDividing both sides by the volume formula_8 of the charge element gives the force density\nformula_9\nwhere formula_10 is the charge density and formula_11 is the force per unit volume. Introducing the current density formula_12, this can be rewritten as:\nformula_13\nThe total force is the volume integral over the charge distribution:\nformula_14\nUsing Maxwell's equations and vector calculus identities, the force density can be reformulated to eliminate explicit reference to the charge and current densities. The force density can then be written in terms of the electromagnetic fields and their derivatives:formula_15\nwhere formula_16 is the Maxwell stress tensor, formula_17 denotes the tensor divergence, formula_18 is the speed of light, and formula_19 is the Poynting vector. This form of the force law relates the energy flux in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. (See Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism for more details.)\nThe power density corresponding to the Lorentz force, the rate of energy transfer to the material, is given by:formula_20\nInside a material, the total charge and current densities can be separated into free and bound parts. In terms of free charge density formula_21, free current density formula_22, polarization formula_23, and magnetization formula_24, the force density becomes\nformula_25This form accounts for the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The associated power density is\nformula_26\nFormulation in the Gaussian system.\nThe above-mentioned formulae use the conventions for the definition of the electric and magnetic field used with the SI, which is the most common. However, other conventions with the same physics (i.e. forces on e.g. an electron) are possible and used. In the conventions used with the older CGS-Gaussian units, which are somewhat more common among some theoretical physicists as well as condensed matter experimentalists, one has instead\nformula_27\nwhere c is the speed of light. Although this equation looks slightly different, it is equivalent, since one has the following relations:\nformula_28\nwhere \"\u03b5\"0 is the vacuum permittivity and \"\u03bc\"0 the vacuum permeability. In practice, the subscripts \"G\" and \"SI\" are omitted, and the used convention (and unit) must be determined from context.\nForce on a current-carrying wire.\nWhen a wire carrying a steady electric current is placed in an external magnetic field, each of the moving charges in the wire experience the Lorentz force. Together, these forces produce a net macroscopic force on the wire. For a straight, stationary wire in a uniform magnetic field, this force is given by:\nformula_29\nwhere I is the current and \u2113 is a vector whose magnitude is the length of the wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of the current.\nIf the wire is not straight or the magnetic field is non-uniform, the total force can be computed by applying the formula to each infinitesimal segment of wire formula_30, then adding up all these forces by integration. In this case, the net force on a stationary wire carrying a steady current is\nformula_31\nOne application of this is Amp\u00e8re's force law, which describes the attraction or repulsion between two current-carrying wires. Each wire generates a magnetic field, described by the Biot\u2013Savart law, which exerts a Lorentz force on the other wire. If the currents flow in the same direction, the wires attract; if the currents flow in opposite directions, they repel. This interaction provided the basis of the former definition of the ampere, as the constant current that produces a force of 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-7 newtons per metre between two straight, parallel wires one metre apart.\nAnother application is an induction motor. The stator winding AC current generates a moving magnetic field which induces a current in the rotor. The subsequent Lorentz force formula_32 acting on the rotor creates a torque, making the motor spin. Hence, though the Lorentz force law does not apply when the magnetic field formula_33 is generated by the current formula_34, it does apply when the current formula_34 is induced by the movement of magnetic field formula_33.\nElectromagnetic induction.\nThe Lorentz force acting on electric charges in a conducting loop can produce a current by pushing charges around the circuit. This effect is the fundamental mechanism underlying induction motors and generators. It is described in terms of electromotive force (emf), a quantity which plays a central role in the theory of electromagnetic induction. In a simple circuit with resistance formula_37, an emf formula_38 gives rise to a current formula_34 according to the Ohm's law formula_40.\nBoth components of the Lorentz force\u2014the electric and the magnetic\u2014can contribute to the emf in a circuit, but through different mechanisms. In both cases, the induced emf is described by Faraday's flux rule, which states that the emf around a closed loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop:\nformula_41The magnetic flux formula_42 is defined as the surface integral of the magnetic field formula_33 over a surface formula_44 bounded by the loop:\nformula_45\nThe flux can change either because the loop moves or deforms over time, or because the field itself varies in time. These two possibilities correspond to the two mechanisms described by the flux rule:\nThe sign of the induced emf is given by Lenz's law, which states that the induced current produces a magnetic field opposing the change in the original flux.\nThe flux rule can be derived from the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation and the Lorentz force law. In some cases, especially in extended systems, the flux rule may be difficult to apply directly or may not provide a complete description, and the full Lorentz force law must be used. (See inapplicability of Faraday's law.)\nMotional emf.\nThe basic mechanism behind motional emf is illustrated by a conducting rod moving through a magnetic field that is perpendicular to both the rod and its direction of motion. Due to movement in magnetic field, the mobile electrons of the conductor experience the magnetic component (\"q\"v \u00d7 B) of the Lorentz force that drives them along the length of the rod. This leads to a separation of charge between the two ends of the rod. In the steady state, the electric field from the accumulated charge balances the magnetic force.If the rod is part of a closed conducting loop moving through a nonuniform magnetic field, the same effect can drive a current around the circuit. For instance, suppose the magnetic field is confined to a limited region of space, and the loop initially lies outside this region. As it moves into the field, the area of the loop that encloses magnetic flux increases, and an emf is induced. From the Lorentz force perspective, this is because the field exerts a magnetic force on charge carriers in the parts of the loop entering the region. Once the entire loop lies in a uniform magnetic field and continues at constant speed, the total enclosed flux remains constant, and the emf vanishes. In this situation, magnetic forces on opposite sides of the loop cancel out.\nTransformer emf.\nA complementary case is transformer emf, which occurs when the conducting loop remains stationary but the magnetic flux through it changes due to a time-varying magnetic field. This can happen in two ways: either the source of the magnetic field moves, altering the field distribution through the fixed loop, or the strength of the magnetic field changes over time at a fixed location, as in the case of a powered electromagnet..\nIn either situation, no magnetic force acts on the charges, and the emf is entirely due to the electric component (\"q\"E) of the Lorentz force. According to the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation, a time-varying magnetic field produces a circulating electric field, which drives current in the loop. This phenomenon underlies the operation of electrical machines such as synchronous generators. The electric field induced in this way is non-conservative, meaning its line integral around a closed loop is not zero.\nRelativity.\nFrom the viewpoint of special relativity, the distinction between motional and transformer emf is frame-dependent. In the laboratory frame, a moving loop in a static field generates emf via magnetic forces. But in a frame moving with the loop, the magnetic field appears time-dependent, and the emf arises from an induced electric field. Einstein's special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects. In modern terms, electric and magnetic fields are different components of a single electromagnetic field tensor, and a transformation between inertial frames mixes the two.\nHistory.\nEarly attempts to quantitatively describe the electromagnetic force were made in the mid-18th century. It was proposed that the force on magnetic poles, by Johann Tobias Mayer and others in 1760, and electrically charged objects, by Henry Cavendish in 1762, obeyed an inverse-square law. However, in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive. It was not until 1784 when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, using a torsion balance, was able to definitively show through experiment that this was true. Soon after the discovery in 1820 by Hans Christian \u00d8rsted that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re that same year was able to devise through experimentation the formula for the angular dependence of the force between two current elements. In all these descriptions, the force was always described in terms of the properties of the matter involved and the distances between two masses or charges rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields.\nThe modern concept of electric and magnetic fields first arose in the theories of Michael Faraday, particularly his idea of lines of force, later to be given full mathematical description by Lord Kelvin and James Clerk Maxwell. From a modern perspective it is possible to identify in Maxwell's 1865 formulation of his field equations a form of the Lorentz force equation in relation to electric currents, although in the time of Maxwell it was not evident how his equations related to the forces on moving charged objects. J. J. Thomson was the first to attempt to derive from Maxwell's field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object's properties and external fields. Interested in determining the electromagnetic behavior of the charged particles in cathode rays, Thomson published a paper in 1881 wherein he gave the force on the particles due to an external magnetic field as\nformula_46\nThomson derived the correct basic form of the formula, but, because of some miscalculations and an incomplete description of the displacement current, included an incorrect scale-factor of a half in front of the formula. Oliver Heaviside invented the modern vector notation and applied it to Maxwell's field equations; he also (in 1885 and 1889) had fixed the mistakes of Thomson's derivation and arrived at the correct form of the magnetic force on a moving charged object. Finally, in 1895, Hendrik Lorentz derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields. Lorentz began by abandoning the Maxwellian descriptions of the ether and conduction. Instead, Lorentz made a distinction between matter and the luminiferous aether and sought to apply the Maxwell equations at a microscopic scale. Using Heaviside's version of the Maxwell equations for a stationary ether and applying Lagrangian mechanics (see below), Lorentz arrived at the correct and complete form of the force law that now bears his name.\nLorentz force in terms of potentials.\nThe E and B fields can be replaced by the magnetic vector potential A and (scalar) electrostatic potential \"\u03d5\" by\nformula_47\nwhere \u2207 is the gradient, \u2207\u22c5 is the divergence, and \u2207\u00d7 is the curl.\nThe force becomes\nformula_48\nUsing an identity for the triple product this can be rewritten as\nformula_49\n(Notice that the coordinates and the velocity components should be treated as independent variables, so the del operator acts only on formula_50, not on formula_51; thus, there is no need of using Feynman's subscript notation in the equation above.) Using the chain rule, the convective derivative of formula_50 is:\nformula_53\nso that the above expression becomes:\nformula_54\nWith v = \u1e8b and \nformula_55\nwe can put the equation into the convenient Euler\u2013Lagrange form\nformula_56\nwhere formula_57 and formula_58\nLorentz force and analytical mechanics.\nThe Lagrangian for a charged particle of mass \"m\" and charge \"q\" in an electromagnetic field equivalently describes the dynamics of the particle in terms of its \"energy\", rather than the force exerted on it. The classical expression is given by:\nformula_59\nwhere A and \"\u03d5\" are the potential fields as above. The quantity formula_60 can be identified as a generalized, velocity-dependent potential energy and, accordingly, formula_32 as a non-conservative force. Using the Lagrangian, the equation for the Lorentz force given above can be obtained again.\nThe Hamiltonian can be derived from the Lagrangian using a Legendre transformation. The canonical momentum is\nformula_62\nApplying the Legendre transformation gives\nformula_63This classical Hamiltonian directly generalizes to quantum mechanics, where formula_64 and formula_65 become non-commuting operators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Derivation of Lorentz force from classical Lagrangian (SI units)\nFor an A field, a particle moving with velocity v = \u1e59 has potential momentum formula_66, so its potential energy is formula_67. For a \"\u03d5\" field, the particle's potential energy is formula_68.\nThe total potential energy is then:\nformula_69\nand the kinetic energy is:\nformula_70\nhence the Lagrangian:\nformula_71\nLagrange's equations are\nformula_72\n(same for \"y\" and \"z\"). So calculating the partial derivatives:\nformula_73\nformula_74\nequating and simplifying:\nformula_75\nformula_76\nand similarly for the \"y\" and \"z\" directions. Hence the force equation is:\nformula_77\nThe relativistic Lagrangian is\nformula_78\nThe action is the relativistic arclength of the path of the particle in spacetime, minus the potential energy contribution, plus an extra contribution which, with quantum mechanics, can be realised as a phase obtained by a charged particle moving along a vector potential.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Derivation of Lorentz force from relativistic Lagrangian (SI units)\nThe equations of motion derived by extremizing the action (see matrix calculus for the notation):\nformula_79\nformula_80\nare the same as Hamilton's equations of motion:\nformula_81\nformula_82\nboth are equivalent to the noncanonical form:\nformula_83\nThis formula is the Lorentz force, representing the rate at which the EM field adds relativistic momentum to the particle.\nRelativistic form of the Lorentz force.\nCovariant form of the Lorentz force.\nField tensor.\nUsing the metric signature (1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121), the Lorentz force for a charge q can be written in covariant form:\nformula_84\nwhere p\u03b1 is the four-momentum, defined as\nformula_85\n\u03c4 the proper time of the particle, F\u03b1\u03b2 the contravariant electromagnetic tensor\nformula_86\nand U is the covariant 4-velocity of the particle, defined as:\nformula_87\nin which\nformula_88\nis the Lorentz factor.\nThe fields are transformed to a frame moving with constant relative velocity by:\nformula_89\nwhere \u039b\"\u03bc\"\"\u03b1\" is the Lorentz transformation tensor.\nTranslation to vector notation.\nThe \"\u03b1\" = 1 component (x-component) of the force is\nformula_90\nSubstituting the components of the covariant electromagnetic tensor \"F\" yields\nformula_91\nUsing the components of covariant four-velocity yields\nformula_92\nThe calculation for \"\u03b1\" = 2, 3 (force components in the y and z directions) yields similar results, so collecting the three equations into one:\nformula_93\nand since differentials in coordinate time dt and proper time d\u03c4 are related by the Lorentz factor,\nformula_94\nthis gives,\nformula_95\nThis is precisely the Lorentz force law, however, it is important to note that p is the relativistic expression,\nformula_96\nLorentz force in spacetime algebra (STA).\nThe electric and magnetic fields are dependent on the velocity of an observer, so the relativistic form of the Lorentz force law can best be exhibited starting from a coordinate-independent expression for the electromagnetic and magnetic fields formula_97, and an arbitrary time-direction, formula_98. This can be settled through spacetime algebra (or the geometric algebra of spacetime), a type of Clifford algebra defined on a pseudo-Euclidean space, as\nformula_99\nand\nformula_100\nformula_101 is a spacetime bivector (an oriented plane segment, just like a vector is an oriented line segment), which has six degrees of freedom corresponding to boosts (rotations in spacetime planes) and rotations (rotations in space-space planes). The dot product with the vector formula_98 pulls a vector (in the space algebra) from the translational part, while the wedge-product creates a trivector (in the space algebra) who is dual to a vector which is the usual magnetic field vector. The relativistic velocity is given by the (time-like) changes in a time-position vector where\nformula_103\n(which shows our choice for the metric) and the velocity is\nformula_104\nThe proper form of the Lorentz force law ('invariant' is an inadequate term because no transformation has been defined) is simply\nformula_105\nNote that the order is important because between a bivector and a vector the dot product is anti-symmetric. Upon a spacetime split like one can obtain the velocity, and fields as above yielding the usual expression.\nLorentz force in general relativity.\nIn the general theory of relativity the equation of motion for a particle with mass formula_106 and charge formula_107, moving in a space with metric tensor formula_108 and electromagnetic field formula_109, is given as\nformula_110\nwhere formula_111 (formula_112 is taken along the trajectory), formula_113, and formula_114.\nThe equation can also be written as\nformula_115\nwhere formula_116 is the Christoffel symbol (of the torsion-free metric connection in general relativity), or as\nformula_117\nwhere formula_118 is the covariant differential in general relativity.\nQuantum mechanics.\nIn quantum mechanics, particles are described by wavefunctions whose evolution is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. While this formulation does not involve forces explicitly, it extends the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics, by incorporating interactions with electromagnetic fields through potential terms in the Hamiltonian. For a non-relativistic particle of mass formula_106 and charge formula_120, the Hamiltonian takes the form:\nformula_121\nThis expression is a direct generalization of the classical Hamiltonian that leads to the Lorentz force law. The key difference is that in quantum mechanics, position formula_65 and momentum formula_123 are operators that do not commute. As a result, quantum dynamics incorporate fundamentally different behavior such as wave interference and quantization.\nUnlike in classical physics, where only electric and magnetic fields influence particle motion, quantum mechanics allows the electromagnetic potentials themselves to produce observable effects. This is exemplified by the Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect, in which a charged particle passes through a region with zero electric and magnetic fields but encircles a magnetic flux confined to an inaccessible area. Although the classical Lorentz force is zero along the particle's path, the interference pattern observed on a screen shifts depending on the enclosed magnetic flux, revealing the physical significance of the vector potential in quantum mechanics.\nNevertheless, the classical Lorentz force law emerges as an approximation to the quantum dynamics: according to the Ehrenfest theorem, the expectation value of the momentum operator evolves according to an equation that resembles the classical Lorentz force law. Even in the Aharonov\u2013Bohm setup, the average motion of a wave packet follows the classical trajectory.\nQuantum particles such as electrons also possess intrinsic spin, which introduces additional electromagnetic interactions beyond those described by the classical Lorentz force. In the non-relativistic limit, this is captured by the Pauli equation, which includes a spin\u2013magnetic field coupling term:\nformula_124\nwhere formula_16 are the Pauli matrices. This term leads to spin-dependent forces absent in the classical theory. A complete relativistic treatment is given by the Dirac equation, which incorporates spin and electromagnetic interactions through minimal coupling, and correctly predicts features such as the electron's gyromagnetic ratio.\nApplications.\nIn many real-world applications, the Lorentz force is insufficient to accurately describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in practice and on a fundamental level. Real systems involve many interacting particles that also generate their own fields E and B. To account for these collective effects\u2014such as currents, flows, and plasmas\u2014more complex equations are required, such as the Boltzmann equation, the Fokker\u2013Planck equation or the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. These models go beyond single-particle dynamics, incorporating particle interactions and self-consistent field generation, and are central to fields like magnetohydrodynamics, electrohydrodynamics, and plasma physics, as well as to the understanding of astrophysical and superconducting phenomena.\nThe Lorentz force occurs in many devices, including:\nIn its manifestation as the Laplace force on an electric current in a conductor, this force occurs in many devices, including:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\nRemarks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lorenzo held the balance of power within the Italic League, an alliance of states that stabilized political conditions on the Italian Peninsula for decades, and his life coincided with the mature phase of the Italian Renaissance and the golden age of Florence. As a patron, he is best known for his sponsorship of artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. On the foreign policy front, Lorenzo manifested a clear plan to stem the territorial ambitions of Pope Sixtus IV, in the name of the balance of the Italic League of 1454. For these reasons, Lorenzo was the subject of the Pazzi conspiracy (1478), in which his brother Giuliano was assassinated. The Peace of Lodi of 1454 that he supported among the various Italian states collapsed with his death. He is buried in the Medici Chapel in Florence.\nYouth.\nLorenzo's grandfather, Cosimo de' Medici, was the first member of the Medici family to lead the Republic of Florence and run the Medici Bank simultaneously. As one of the wealthiest men in Europe, the elder Cosimo spent a very large portion of his fortune on government and philanthropy, for example as a patron of the arts and financier of public works. Lorenzo's father, Piero di Cosimo de' Medici, was equally at the centre of Florentine civic life, chiefly as an art patron and collector, while Lorenzo's uncle, Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici, took care of the family's business interests. Lorenzo's mother, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, was a writer of sonnets and a friend to poets and philosophers of the Medici Academy. She became her son's advisor after the deaths of his father and uncle.\nLorenzo, considered the most promising of the five children of Piero and Lucrezia, was tutored by a diplomat and bishop, Gentile de' Becchi, and the humanist philosopher Marsilio Ficino, and he was trained in Greek by pivotal Renaissance scholar John Argyropoulos. With his brother Giuliano, he participated in jousting, hawking, hunting, and horse breeding for the Palio, a horse race in Siena. In 1469, aged 20, he won first prize in a jousting tournament sponsored by the Medici. The joust was the subject of a poem written by Luigi Pulci. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli also wrote of the occasion, perhaps sarcastically, that he won \"not by way of favour, but by his own valour and skill in arms\". He carried a banner painted by Verrocchio, and his horse was named Morello di Vento.\nPiero sent Lorenzo on many important diplomatic missions when he was still a youth, including trips to Rome to meet the pope and other important religious and political figures.\nLorenzo was described as rather plain of appearance and of average height, having a broad frame and short legs, dark hair and eyes, a squashed nose, short-sighted eyes and a harsh voice. Giuliano, on the other hand, was regarded as handsome and a \"golden boy\", and was used as a model by Botticelli in his painting of \"Mars and Venus\". Even Lorenzo's close friend Niccolo Valori described him as homely, saying, \"nature had been a stepmother to him in regards to his personal appearance, although she had acted as a loving mother in all things concocted with the mind. His complexion was dark, and although his face was not handsome it was so full of dignity as to compel respect.\"\nPolitics.\nLorenzo, groomed for power, assumed a leading role in the state upon the death of his father in 1469, when he was 20. Already drained by his grandfather's building projects and constantly stressed by mismanagement, wars, and political expenses, the assets of the Medici Bank were reduced seriously during the course of Lorenzo's lifetime.\nLorenzo, like his grandfather, father, and son, ruled Florence indirectly through surrogates in the city councils by means of payoffs and strategic marriages until 1490. Rival Florentine families inevitably harboured resentments over the Medicis' dominance, and enemies of the Medici remained a factor in Florentine life long after Lorenzo's passing. The most notable of the rival families was the Pazzi, who nearly brought Lorenzo's reign to an end.\nOn Sunday, 26 April 1478, in an incident known as the Pazzi conspiracy, a group headed by Girolamo Riario, Francesco de' Pazzi, and Francesco Salviati (the archbishop of Pisa), attacked Lorenzo and his brother and co-ruler Giuliano in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in an attempt to seize control of the Florentine government. Salviati acted with the blessing of his patron Pope Sixtus IV. Giuliano was killed, brutally stabbed to death, but Lorenzo escaped with only a minor wound to the neck, having been defended by the poet Poliziano and the banker Francesco Nori, the latter of whom was killed in the attack. News of the conspiracy spread throughout Florence, and it was brutally put down by the populace through such measures as the lynching of the archbishop of Pisa and members of the Pazzi family who were involved in the conspiracy.\nIn the aftermath of the Pazzi conspiracy and the punishment of supporters of Pope Sixtus IV, the Medici and Florence earned the wrath of the Holy See, which seized all the Medici assets that Sixtus could find, excommunicated Lorenzo and the entire government of Florence, and ultimately put the entire Florentine city-state under interdict. When these moves had little effect, Sixtus formed a military alliance with King Ferdinand I of Naples, whose son, Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, led an invasion of the Florentine Republic, still ruled by Lorenzo.\nLorenzo rallied the citizens. However, with little support from the traditional Medici allies in Bologna and Milan, the war dragged on, and only diplomacy by Lorenzo, who personally traveled to Naples and became a prisoner of the king for several months, ultimately resolved the crisis. That success enabled Lorenzo to secure constitutional changes within the government of the Florentine Republic that further enhanced his own power.\nThereafter, Lorenzo, like his grandfather Cosimo de' Medici, pursued a policy of maintaining peace, balancing power between the northern Italian states and keeping major European states such as France and the Holy Roman Empire out of Italy. Lorenzo maintained good relations with Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, as the Florentine maritime trade with the Ottomans was a major source of wealth for the Medici.\nEfforts to acquire revenue from the mining of alum in Tuscany unfortunately marred Lorenzo's reputation. Alum had been discovered by local citizens of Volterra, who turned to Florence to get backing to exploit this important natural resource. A key commodity in the glassmaking, tanning and textile industries, alum was available from only a few sources under the control of the Ottomans and monopolized by Genoa before the discovery of alum sources in Italy at Tolfa. First the Roman Curia in 1462, and then Lorenzo and the Medici Bank less than a year later, got involved in backing the mining operation, with the pope taking a two-ducat commission for each cantar quintal of alum retrieved and ensuring a monopoly against the Turkish-derived goods by prohibiting trade in alum with infidels. When they realized the value of the alum mine, the people of Volterra wanted its revenues for their municipal funds rather than having it enter the pockets of their Florentine backers. Thus began an insurrection and secession from Florence, which involved putting to death several opposing citizens. Lorenzo sent mercenaries to suppress the revolt by force, and the mercenaries ultimately sacked the city. Lorenzo hurried to Volterra to make amends, but the incident would remain a dark stain on his record.\nPatronage.\nLorenzo's court included artists such as Piero and Antonio del Pollaiuolo, Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Michelangelo Buonarroti, who were instrumental in achieving the 15th-century Renaissance. Although Lorenzo did not commission many works himself, he helped these artists to secure commissions from other patrons. Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for three years, dining at the family table and participating in discussions led by Marsilio Ficino.\nLorenzo was an artist and wrote poetry in his native Tuscan. In his poetry, he celebrates life while acknowledging with melancholy the fragility and instability of the human condition, particularly in his later works. Love, feasts and light dominate his verse.\nCosimo had started the collection of books that became the Medici Library (also called the Laurentian Library), and Lorenzo expanded it. Lorenzo's agents retrieved from the East large numbers of classical works, and he employed a large workshop to copy his books and disseminate their content across Europe. He supported the development of humanism through his circle of scholarly friends, including the philosophers Marsilio Ficino, Poliziano and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. They studied Greek philosophers and attempted to merge the ideas of Plato with Christianity.\nApart from a personal interest, Lorenzo also used the Florentine milieu of fine arts for his diplomatic efforts. An example includes the commission of Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Pietro Perugino and Cosimo Rosselli from Rome to paint murals in the Sistine Chapel, a move that has been interpreted as sealing the alliance between Lorenzo and Pope Sixtus IV.\nIn 1471, Lorenzo calculated that his family had spent some 663,000 florins (about US$460\u00a0million today) on charity, buildings and taxes since 1434. He wrote, I do not regret this for though many would consider it better to have a part of that sum in their purse, I consider it to have been a great honour to our state, and I think the money was well-expended and I am well-pleased.\nFrom 1479 Lorenzo became a permanent member of the committee supervising the rebuild of the \"signoria\" in Florence. He created a court of artists in his sculpture garden at San Marco which allowed him to exert 'enormous influence on the selection of artists on public projects'.\nMarriage and issue.\nLorenzo married Clarice Orsini on 7 February 1469. The marriage in person took place in Florence on 4 June 1469. She was a daughter of Giacomo Orsini, Lord of Monterotondo and Bracciano by his wife and cousin Maddalena Orsini.\nLorenzo and Clarice had:\nLorenzo adopted his nephew Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici (1478\u20131534), the illegitimate son of his slain brother Giuliano. In 1523, after serving four years as ruler of Florence, Giulio ascended to the papacy as Pope Clement VII.\nLater years, death, and legacy.\nDuring Lorenzo's tenure, several branches of the family bank collapsed because of bad loans, and in later years he got into financial difficulties and resorted to misappropriating trust and state funds.\nToward the end of Lorenzo's life, Florence came under the influence of Girolamo Savonarola, who believed Christians had strayed too far into Greco-Roman culture. Lorenzo played a role in bringing Savonarola to Florence.\nLorenzo died during the late night of 8 April 1492, at the longtime family villa of Careggi. Savonarola visited Lorenzo on his deathbed. The rumour that Savonarola damned Lorenzo on his deathbed has been refuted in Roberto Ridolfi's book \"Vita di Girolamo Savonarola\". Letters written by witnesses to Lorenzo's death report that he died peacefully after listening to the Gospel of the day. Many signs and portents were claimed to have taken place at the moment of his death, including the dome of Florence Cathedral being struck by lightning, ghosts appearing, and the lions kept at Via Leone fighting one another.\nThe Signoria and councils of Florence issued a decree:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whereas the foremost man of all this city, the lately deceased Lorenzo de' Medici, did, during his whole life, neglect no opportunity of protecting, increasing, adorning and raising this city, but was always ready with counsel, authority and painstaking, in thought and deed; shrank from neither trouble nor danger for the good of the state and its freedom... it has seemed good to the Senate and people of Florence... to establish a public testimonial of gratitude to the memory of such a man, in order that virtue might not be unhonoured among Florentines, and that, in days to come, other citizens may be incited to serve the commonwealth with might and wisdom.\nLorenzo was buried with his brother Giuliano in the Basilica di San Lorenzo in the red porphyry sarcophagus designed for Piero and Giovanni de' Medici, not, as might be expected, in the New Sacristy, designed by Michelangelo. The latter holds the two monumental tombs of Lorenzo and Giuliano's less known namesakes: Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, and Giuliano, Duke of Nemours. According to Williamson and others, the statues of the lesser Lorenzo and Giuliano were carved by Michelangelo to incorporate the essence of the famous men. In 1559, the bodies of Lorenzo de' Medici (\"the Magnificent\") and his brother Giuliano were interred in the New Sacristy in an unmarked tomb beneath Michelangelo's statue of the Madonna.\nMedical researchers have suggested that Lorenzo may have suffered from acromegaly, a rare disorder that results from excessive secretion of growth hormone, based on interpretation of his reported symptoms, and later analysis of his skeleton and death mask.\nLorenzo's heir was his eldest son, Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici, known as \"Piero the Unfortunate\". In 1494, he squandered his father's patrimony and brought down the Medici dynasty in Florence. His second son, Giovanni, who became Pope Leo X, retook the city in 1512 with the aid of a Spanish army. In 1531, Lorenzo's nephew Giulio di Giuliano \u2013 whom Lorenzo had raised as his own son and who in 1523 became Pope Clement VII \u2013 formalized Medici rule of Florence by installing Alessandro de' Medici the city's first hereditary duke.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was a former governor of Spoleto.\nHer family arranged several marriages for her that advanced their own political position, including to Giovanni Sforza, Lord of Pesaro and Gradara, Count of Cotignola; Alfonso of Aragon, Duke of Bisceglie and Prince of Salerno; and Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. Alfonso of Aragon was an illegitimate son of the King of Naples, and tradition has it that Lucrezia's brother Cesare may have had him murdered after his political value waned.\nNotorious tales about her family have cast Lucrezia as a \"femme fatale\", a controversial role in which she has been portrayed in many artworks, novels, and films.\nEarly life.\nLucrezia Borgia was born on 18 April 1480 at Subiaco, a town near Rome. Her mother was Vannozza dei Cattanei, a mistress of her father, Cardinal Rodrigo de Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI). She had three full siblings: Cesare Borgia, Giovanni Borgia, and Gioffre Borgia, although Gioffre's paternity was later contested. Lucrezia's father acknowledged her as his child, and consulted an astrologer after her birth, who foretold a remarkable future. During her early life, Lucrezia's education was entrusted to Carlo Canale and then to Adriana Orsini de Milan. Orsini was a confidant of Lucrezia's father and was his first cousin.\nLucrezia's education would primarily take place in the Palazzo Pizzo de Merlo, a building adjacent to her father's residence. Unlike most educated women of her time, for whom convents were the primary source for knowledge, Lucrezia's humanist education came from within the sphere of intellectuals in the court and close relatives, and it included a solid grounding in the Humanities, which the Catholic Church was reviving at the time. She was fluent in Spanish, Catalan, Italian, and French, and literate in both Latin and Greek. She would also become proficient in poetry and oration, and could play the lute and zither, embroider and dance. The biggest testament to her intelligence is her ability in administration, as later on in life, she took care of Vatican City correspondence and governance of Ferrara.\nList of marriages.\nFirst marriage: Giovanni Sforza (Lord of Pesaro and Gradara).\nOn 26 February 1491, a matrimonial arrangement was drawn up between Lucrezia and the Lord of Val D'Ayora, in the Kingdom of Valencia, Don Cherubino Joan de Centelles (d. 1522). The arrangement was annulled less than two months later in favour of a new contract engaging Lucrezia to Don Gaspare, Count of Aversa (1476\u20131534). \nWhen Lucrezia's father Rodrigo became Pope Alexander VI in August 1492, he sought to be allied with powerful, princely families and founding dynasties of Italy. Therefore, he called off Lucrezia's previous engagements. Cardinal Ascanio Sforza said: \"There are many who long to marry into the Pope's family via his daughter, and he lets many think they have a chance. Even the king of Naples aspires to win her hand!\"\nThe Pope arranged for Lucrezia to marry \"condottiero\" Giovanni Sforza, a member of the House of Sforza who was the Lord of Pesaro and titled Count of Catignola. Giovanni was nephew of the Duke of Milan as an illegitimate son of Costanzo I Sforza. He was a Sforza of the second rank and belonged to a cadet branch of the family. They married by proxy on 12 June 1493 in Rome, when Lucrezia was aged 13. She was outfitted in brocade and jewels for the wedding ceremony.\nOn 31 May 1494, Lucrezia departed from Rome with a retinue of ladies and gentlemen and accompanied by Giulia Farnese and Adriana Mila. She moved to her husband's palace in Pesaro, where local poets celebrated her with their madrigals, she negotiated the marriage of one of her Spanish ladies-in-waiting, and she exchanged visits with the highly literate court of the Dukes of Urbino.\nBefore long, the Borgia family no longer needed the Sforzas, and the Pope may have covertly ordered the execution of Giovanni Sforza. Lucrezia was likely informed of this by her brother, Cesare, and she warned her husband, who then fled from Rome.\nAlexander asked Giovanni's uncle, Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, to persuade Giovanni to agree to an annulment of the marriage. Giovanni refused and accused Lucrezia of paternal incest, spreading the rumour that the pope wanted his daughter to return to Rome so that he could have sex with her. This rumour endured through the centuries, partly due to the writings of Florentine historian Francesco Guicciardini and verses by Giovanni Pontano and Jacopo Sannazaro, and Lucrezia's reputation was tainted. The pope, however, asserted that his daughter's marriage had not been consummated and was, thus, invalid. Giovanni was offered her dowry in return for his cooperation. The Sforza family threatened to withdraw their protection, should he refuse. Giovanni finally signed confessions of impotence and documents of annulment before witnesses, despite how his first wife had died in childbirth.\nPurported affair with Pedro Calderon.\nHistorians have speculated that during the prolonged process of the annulment, Lucrezia consummated a relationship with someone, perhaps Alexander's chamberlain Pedro Calderon (sometimes called Perotto). In any case, families hostile to the Borgias would later accuse her of being pregnant at the time her marriage was annulled. She is known to have retired to the cloistered Convent of Saint Sixtus Vecchio in Rome where she was given sanctuary by the Mother Superior in June 1497, to await the outcome of the annulment proceedings, which were finalized in December of the same year. In the convent, in mid-June, she received news of the murder of her brother Giovanni, whose killer was never officially discovered.\nThe bodies of Pedro Calderon and a maid, Pantasilea, were found in the Tiber river in February 1498. In March 1498, the Ferrarese ambassador claimed that Lucrezia had given birth, but this was denied by other sources. However, a child was born in the Borgia household the year before Lucrezia's marriage to Alfonso of Aragon. He was named Giovanni but is known to historians as the \"\"Infans Romanus\u201d\" (Child of Rome).\nIn 1501, two papal bulls were issued concerning Giovanni Borgia. In the first, he was recognized as Cesare's child from an affair, before his marriage. The second contradictory bull recognized him as the son of Pope Alexander VI. Lucrezia's name is not mentioned in either, and rumours that she was his mother have never been proven. The second bull was kept secret for many years, and Giovanni was assumed to be Cesare's son. This is supported by the fact that he became Duke of Camerino in 1502, which was to be inherited by the Duke of Romagna's oldest son. After Alexander's death, Giovanni went to stay with Lucrezia in Ferrara, where he was accepted as her half-brother.\nSecond marriage: Alfonso d'Aragon (Duke of Bisceglie and Prince of Salerno).\nDespite the scandal of the annulment of her marriage to Giovanni Sforza, Lucrezia was married for a second time to the Neapolitan Alfonso of Aragon, Duke of Bisceglie and Prince of Salerno of the House of Trast\u00e1mara. He was the illegitimate son of Alfonso II King of Naples and his mistress Trogia Gazzella. Alfonso was also the half-brother of Sancha of Aragon, Princess of Squillace and wife of Lucrezia's younger brother Gioffre Borgia. \nLucrezia's father gave the Duchy of Spoleto and 40,000 ducats as her dowry. It was also part of the agreement that the couple would remain in Rome for at least one year and not be forced to live permanently at the Kingdom of Naples until her father's death. Lucrezia's marriage was a short one.\nLucrezia and Alfonso were married on 21 July 1498 in the Vatican, with the celebrations being held behind closed doors in the Borgia apartments. Lucrezia became the Duchess consort of Bisceglie and Princess consort of Salerno and the marriage was said to be happy, with Lucrezia supporting her husband in a dispute with her father on the legality of the marriage of Alfonso\u2019s aunt Beatrice of Naples to Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary.\nIn 1499, Lucrezia was appointed as Governor of Spoleto, a role usually reserved solely for cardinals, becoming the first female governor in the Papal States in a territory crucial for the passage from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic Sea. She also reportedly lost her first baby with Alfonso in February 1499.\nAlfonso fled Rome for Naples shortly afterwards due to the changing alliances of the Borgias, while Lucrezia was again pregnant. His flight incensed the Pope who sent troops after him but failed to find him. He returned to Rome at Lucrezia's request only to be murdered on 15 July 1500. At the top of the steps before the entrance to St. Peter's Basilica, Alfonso was attacked by three hired killers armed with halberds and swords. He was stabbed in the head, right arm, and leg. Those who found him took him to the chamber of the Borgia Tower where he was cared for by his doctors from Naples, his half-sister Sancha and Lucrezia. While recovering from his injuries, Alfonso was strangled to death in his bed by a servant, possibly Micheletto Corella.\nIt was widely rumoured that Lucrezia's brother, Cesare, was responsible for Alfonso's death, as he had recently allied himself with France through his marriage to Charlotte d\u2019Albret (sister of King John III of Navarre) in May 1499, against Naples.\nLucrezia and Alfonso had one child, Rodrigo of Aragon, named for his maternal grandfather the Pope. He was born in 1500 and was baptised in the presence of many cardinals, ambassadors and prelates from all over Italy. His godfather was Francesco Borgia, Archbishop of Cosenza, while Cardinal Carafa of Naples performed the baptismal rite in the Sistine Chapel. Rodrigo died in 1512 of a disease in Bari, Apulia, at the age of 12. Lucrezia withdrew to a convent to grieve for a month after her son died.\nAfter her second husband's death, Lucrezia acted as her father's private secretary in the Vatican, which involved opening his letters, informing him of the contents and replying to any which required an immediate response. Lucrezia was not accused of taking any undue advantage of this powerful position and was referred to as \"wise, discreet and generous' by the Venetian ambassador, Polo Capello.\nLucrezia's father and brother Ceasare began arrangements for a third marriage. Five months after Alfonso's death, an engagement was announced for Lucrezia to Francesco Orsini, Duke of Gravina, but the plan was abandoned by her father. By January 1501, the Pope was pursuing a match for Lucrezia with the son of Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. The d'Este family was one of the oldest and most powerful in Italy.\nThird marriage: Alfonso I d'Este (Duke of Ferrara).\nLucrezia married Alfonso I d'Este by proxy in Rome on 30 December 1501, with his brother Ferrante d'Este standing in for the groom, then in person on 2 February 1502 in Ferrara. Lucrezia's progress from Rome to Ferrara was through the Apennine Mountains and she both rode on horseback and was carried in a sedan chair, and was accompanied by ladies, retainers, musicians, and her brother Cesare. \nDespite having given birth to a child, Lucrezia was obliged to simulate the appearance of a virgin spouse in order to marry d'Este and was forced to leave Rodrigo of Aragon, her only child by Alfonso of Aragon, behind. Lucrezia tried many times to have little Rodrigo in Ferrara, but her plans were ruined. She sent him gifts and letters and, when he was 9 years old, an educator from the University of Ferrara. \nLucrezia became Duchess of Ferrara from 1505 after the death of Alfonso's father Ercole. She gave birth to six children during her marriage to d'Este, including the future Duke of Ferrara, Ercole II d'Este.However, neither partner was faithful. Beginning in 1503, Lucrezia enjoyed a long relationship with her brother-in-law, Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua. Francesco's wife was the cultured intellectual Isabella d'Este, the sister of Alfonso, to whom Lucrezia had made overtures of friendship, to no avail. The affair between Francesco and Lucrezia was passionate, more sexual than sentimental, as can be attested in the fevered love letters the pair wrote one another. It has been claimed that the affair ended when Francesco contracted syphilis and had to end sexual relations with Lucrezia. This may not be true, however, as Francesco had contracted syphilis before 1500; it was known that he passed the disease onto his eldest son, Federico Gonzaga, who was born in 1500. Francesco did not meet Lucrezia until 1502.\nLucrezia also had a love affair with the poet Pietro Bembo during her third marriage. Their love letters were deemed \"the prettiest love letters in the world\" by the Romantic poet Lord Byron when he saw them in the Ambrosian Library of Milan on 15 October 1816. The letters were published in 1859 under the title \"Lettere di Lucrezia Borgia a messer Pietro Bembo.\"\nDue to Lucrezia's influence as a patron of the arts, the court of d'Este became a centre for aspiring Renaissance writers, musicians, poets and philosophers, including Ludovico Ariosto and Gian Giorgio Trissino. She was considered a respectable and accomplished Renaissance duchess, effectively rising above her previous reputation and surviving the fall of the Borgias following her father's death in 1503. She played a diplomatic role at the Ferrarese court, meeting with envoys and ruling the territory as regent twice during Alfonso's absences on military campaigns. She is also known to have overseen the management of her finances, buying and selling properties, buying marshland at a low cost then investing in reclamation enterprises, and renting parts of her newly arable land for short terms, which contributed to a nearly doubling of her annual income. She was a patron of charities and ecclesiastical foundations.\nWhen Lucrezia's husband was excommunicated and Ferrara was placed under interdict by Pope Julius II in 1510, Lucrezia pawned her jewels to pay for the cities defences and entertained French troops that had come to Ferrara\u2019s aid. She met the famed French soldier, the Chevalier Bayard, while the latter was co-commanding the French allied garrison of Ferrara. According to his biographer, the Chevalier became a great admirer of Lucrezia's, considering her a \"pearl on this Earth.\"\nAfter a long history of complicated pregnancies and miscarriages, on 14 June 1519, Lucrezia gave birth to her tenth child, which she named Isabella Maria, in honour of Alfonso's sister, Isabella d'Este. The child was sickly, and fearing she would die unbaptised, Alfonso ordered her to be baptized immediately, with Eleonora Pico della Mirandola and Count Alexandro Serafino as godparents.\nLucrezia had become very weak during the pregnancy, and fell seriously ill after the birth. After seeming to recover for two days, she worsened again, and died on 24 June 1519 at Belriguardo Castle, aged 39. Her body was shrouded in the habit of a tertiary Franciscan and she was buried in the convent of Corpus Domini in Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, where she had requested to be interred. She was deeply mourned by the people of Ferrara.\nAfter Lucrezia's death, her brother-in-law Giovanni Gonzaga wrote to Isabella d'Este that: \"It is said that the Duchess left behind a good amount of money, but the exact amount is unknown.\"\nAppearance.\nLucrezia was described as having heavy blonde hair that fell past her knees, a beautiful complexion, hazel eyes that changed colour, a full, high bosom, and a natural grace that made her appear to \"walk on air\". In another description, the author wrote that \"her mouth is rather large, the teeth brilliantly white, her neck is slender and fair, and the bust is admirably proportioned.\" These physical attributes were highly appreciated in Italy due to the similarity of her description with that of the Roman goddess of arts and war, Minerva.\nOne painting, \"Portrait of a Youth\" by Dosso Dossi at the National Gallery of Victoria, was identified as a portrait of Lucrezia in November 2008. The portrait had previously been considered to be of a young man, due to the dagger held in the sitter\u2019s hands, but also includes feminine motifs such as the myrtle bush and flowers. This painting may be the only surviving formal portrait of Lucrezia Borgia; however, doubts have been cast on that attribution. \nSeveral other paintings, such as Veneto's fanciful portrait, have also been said to depict Lucrezia, but none have been accepted by scholars, at present.\nAccording to Mandell Creighton in his \"History of the Papacy\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Lucrezia was personally popular through her beauty and her affability. Her long golden hair, her sweet childish face, her pleasant expression and her graceful ways, seem to have struck all who saw her.\"\nLegacy.\nSince her death, several rumours surrounding Lucrezia have persisted, primarily concerning the nature of the extravagant parties thrown by the Borgia family. One example is the legendary Banquet of Chestnuts. Many of these allegations concern accusations of Lucrezia's involvement in incest, poisoning, and murder. For example, it was rumoured that Lucrezia was in possession of a hollow ring that she used to poison drinks. However, no historical basis for these accusations exists, beyond the attacks of her enemies.\nA modern 20th-century by Frank Cadogan Cowper that hangs in the Tate Britain art gallery in London portrays Lucrezia taking the place of her father, Pope Alexander VI, at an official Vatican meeting. This apparently documents an event, although the moment depicted (a Franciscan friar kissing Lucrezia's feet) was invented by the artist.\nIn 2002 the city of Ferrara celebrated an \"Anno di Lucrezia Borgia\" to commemorate the 500th anniversary of her arrival as the bride of the future duke.\nChildren.\nLucrezia was mother to seven or eight known children:\nGiovanni Borgia, \"infans Romanus\" (\"Child of Rome,\" c. 1498\u20131548) had his paternity acknowledged by Alexander and Cesare, in two Papal bulls, but it was rumoured that he was the child of Lucrezia and Pedro Calderon. The child (identified, in later life, as Lucrezia's half-brother) was most likely the result of a liaison between Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI, Lucrezia's father) and an unknown mistress and was not Lucrezia's child.\nThe Italian historian Maria Bellonci claims that Lucrezia gave birth to three children who did not survive infancy, one by Alfonso of Aragon and two by Alfonso d'Este. She is also thought to have had at least four miscarriages.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18642", "revid": "51039834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18642", "title": "Lemmy", "text": "English rock musician (1945\u20132015)\nIan Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 \u2013 28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy Kilmister or simply Lemmy, was an English musician. He was the founder, lead vocalist, bassist and primary songwriter of the rock band Mot\u00f6rhead, of which he was the only continuous member, and a member of Hawkwind from 1971 to 1975.\nA foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal, Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops, his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared \"one of the most recognisable voices in rock\". He was also noted for his unique posture when singing, which was once described as \"looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\". He was also known for his bass playing style, using his Rickenbacker bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\". A notable aspect of his bass sound was his guitar-like riffing, often playing power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall.\nLemmy was born in Stoke-on-Trent and grew up between there, the nearby towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Madeley, and later in the village of Benllech, Anglesey, Wales. At a later point, Lemmy remembers living briefly at Gwrych Castle, Abergele. He was influenced by rock and roll and the early works of the Beatles, which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s, such as the Rockin' Vickers. He worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and the Nice before joining the space rock band Hawkwind in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit \"Silver Machine\". In 1975, he was fired from Hawkwind after an arrest for drug possession. That same year, he founded Mot\u00f6rhead. The band's success peaked around 1980 and 1981, including the hit single \"Ace of Spades\" and the chart-topping live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" (1981).\nLemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Mot\u00f6rhead until his death on 28 December 2015 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1990. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer two days before his death. Alongside his music career, he had minor roles and cameos in film and television. He was known for his hard-living, road-driven lifestyle, which included chain-smoking and daily consumption of large amounts of alcohol and amphetamine.\nEarly life.\nLemmy was born Ian Fraser Kilmister in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent on 24 December 1945. When he was three months old, his father, an ex-Royal Air Force chaplain and concert pianist, separated from his mother. He moved with his mother and grandmother to nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme, then to Madeley. When he was 10, his mother married former rugby player George L. Willis, who already had two older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony, whom Ian disliked. They later moved to a farm in the village of Benllech on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, with Lemmy commenting that \"funnily enough, being the only English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn't make for the happiest time, but it was interesting from an anthropological point of view\". He attended Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones, a comprehensive school in Amlwch, where he was nicknamed \"Lemmy.\" It was later suggested by some that the name originated from the phrase \"lemmy [lend me] a quid 'til Friday\" because of his alleged habit of borrowing money from people to play slot machines, although Lemmy himself said that he did not know the origin of the name. He soon started to show an interest in rock and roll, girls, motorbikes and horses.\nAt school, Lemmy noticed a pupil who had brought a guitar to school and had been \"surrounded by chicks.\" His mother had a guitar, which he then took to school, and was himself surrounded by girls even though he could not play. By the time he left school, he had moved with his family to Conwy. He went on to work several odd jobs, including one at the local Hotpoint electric appliance factory, while also playing guitar for local bands such as the Sundowners and spending time at a horse-riding school. He saw the Beatles perform at The Cavern Club in Liverpool when he was 16, and then learned to play along on guitar to their debut studio album \"Please Please Me\" (1963). He also admired the sarcastic attitude of the group, particularly that of John Lennon, and later said of the group, \"Brian Epstein cleaned them up for mass consumption, but they were anything but sissies. They were from Liverpool ... a hard, sea-farin' town, all these dockers and sailors around all the time who would beat the piss out of you if you so much as winked at them. ... The Rolling Stones were the mummy's boys\u2014they were all college students from the outskirts of London. ... The Stones made great records, but they were always shit on stage, whereas the Beatles were the gear.\"\nCareer.\n1960\u20131970: Early years.\nIn Stockport, Lemmy joined local bands the Rainmakers and then the Motown Sect who played northern clubs for three years. In 1965, he joined The Rockin' Vickers who signed a deal with CBS, released three singles and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Rockin' Vickers moved to Manchester, where they shared a flat together.\nLeaving the Rockin' Vickers, Lemmy moved to London in 1967. He shared a flat with Noel Redding, bassist of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and with Neville Chesters, their road manager. He got a job as a roadie for the band. In 1968, he joined the psychedelic rock band Sam Gopal under the name Ian Willis and recorded the album \"Escalator\" which was released in 1969. After meeting Simon King at a shopping centre in Chelsea in 1969, he joined the band Opal Butterfly, but the group soon disbanded, having failed to raise enough interest with their singles.\n \"See also \"\n1971\u20131975: Hawkwind.\nIn August 1971, Lemmy joined the space rock band Hawkwind, who were based in Ladbroke Grove, London, as a bassist and vocalist. He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately before a benefit gig in Notting Hill by bandmate Michael \"Dik Mik\" Davies, to have two members who enjoyed amphetamine. Lemmy states that he originally auditioned for Hawkwind as a guitarist, but on the morning of the Notting Hill gig, they decided not to get another guitarist. By chance, the bass player did not show up and left his equipment in the van. He often said, \"Their bass player was pretty much saying 'please steal my gig!' So I stole his gig.\" Lemmy quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using double stops and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a distinctive part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on the double live album \"Space Ritual\". He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, \"Silver Machine\", which reached No. 3 in 1972.\nIn May 1975, during a North American tour, Lemmy was arrested at the Canadian border in Windsor, Ontario, on drug possession charges. The border police mistook the amphetamine he was carrying for cocaine and he was kept overnight in jail before being released without charge. The band and management were concerned that his arrest might stop the band from crossing back into the United States, even though he had been released without charge. They were also tired of what they saw as his erratic behaviour, so they decided to fire him.\nHe once said of Hawkwind: \"I did like being in Hawkwind, and I believe I'd still be playing with them today if I hadn't been kicked out. It was fun onstage, not so much offstage. They didn't want to mesh with me. Musically, I loved the drummer, the guitar player. It was a great band.\"\n1975\u20132015: Mot\u00f6rhead.\nAfter Hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called \"Bastard\" with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink Fairies, Steve Peregrin Took's band Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son Paul. When his manager informed him that a band by the name of \"Bastard\" would never get a slot on \"Top of the Pops\", Lemmy changed the band's name to \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" \u2013 the title of the last song he had written for Hawkwind.\nSoon after, Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor and with this line-up, the band began to achieve success. Lemmy's guttural vocals were unique in rock at that time, and were copied during the time when punk rock became popular. The band's sound appealed to Lemmy's original fans and, eventually, to fans of punk. Lemmy asserted that he generally felt more kinship with punks than with metalheads; he also played with the Damned for a handful of gigs when they had no regular bassist. Mot\u00f6rhead's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits, including the single \"Ace of Spades,\" which remained a crowd favourite throughout the band's career, and the UK No. 1 live album \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\". Mot\u00f6rhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Their \u2013 and Lemmy's \u2013 final live performance was in Berlin, Germany, on 11 December 2015 during the band's 40th Anniversary Tour.\nPersonal life.\nAt the age of 17, Lemmy met a holidaying girl named Cathy. He followed her to Stockport, where she gave birth to his son Sean, who was put up for adoption. In the 2010 documentary film \"Lemmy\", he mentioned having a son whose mother had only recently reconnected with him and \"hadn't got the heart to tell him who his father was.\" Later, during his time with the Rockin' Vickers, he slept with a woman in Manchester named Tracy; she had a son, Paul Inder, whom Lemmy met six years later. As an adult, Inder became a guitarist and occasionally joined Lemmy on stage.\nLemmy lived in Los Angeles from 1990 until his death in 2015, his last residence being a two-room apartment two blocks away from his favourite hangout, the Rainbow Bar and Grill.\nIn the 2005 Channel 4 documentary \"Mot\u00f6rhead: Live Fast, Die Old\", it was claimed that Lemmy had slept with over 2,000 women. He later quipped, \"I said more than 1,000; the magazine made 2,000 of it.\" \"Maxim\" had Lemmy at No. 8 on its top ten \"Living Sex Legends\" list, as they claimed that he had slept with around 1,200 women. He is featured in the book \"Sex Tips from Rock Stars\" (2010) by Paul Miles.\nDave Grohl, on his Probot website, describes musicians with whom he has worked. In his entry for Lemmy, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We recorded [Lemmy's] track in Los Angeles in maybe two takes about a year and a half ago. Until then I'd never met what I'd call a real rock 'n' roll hero before. Fuck Elvis and Keith Richards, Lemmy's the king of rock 'n' roll\u2014he told me he never considered Mot\u00f6rhead a metal band, he was quite adamant. Lemmy's a living, breathing, drinking and snorting fucking legend. No one else comes close.\nLemmy was well known for his heavy drinking. The documentary \"Mot\u00f6rhead: Live Fast Die Old\" stated that he drank a bottle of Jack Daniel's every day and had done so since he was 30 years old. In 2013, he stopped drinking Jack Daniel's for health reasons. During his time with Hawkwind, he developed an addiction to amphetamine and LSD, particularly the former. Before joining Hawkwind, he recalled Dik Mik, a former Hawkwind sound technician, visiting his home in the middle of the night and taking amphetamines with him. They became interested in how long \"you could make the human body jump about without stopping\", which they did for a few months until Mik ran out of money and wanted to return to Hawkwind, taking Lemmy with him.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I first got into speed because it was a utilitarian drug and kept you awake when you needed to be awake when otherwise you'd just be flat out on your back. If you drive to Glasgow for nine hours in the back of a sweaty truck you don't really feel like going onstage feeling all bright and breezy. [...] It's the only drug I've found that I can get on with, and I've tried them all\u00a0\u2013 except smack [heroin] and morphine: I've never \"fixed\" [injected] anything.\nIn November 2005, he was invited to the National Assembly for Wales as a guest speaker by Conservative member William Graham. He was asked to express his views on the detrimental effects of drugs and called for the legalisation of heroin. He stated that legalisation would eradicate the drug dealer from society and generate money from its taxation, however hard this would be to accept.\nLemmy collected German military regalia; he had an Iron Cross emblazoned on his bass, which led to accusations of Nazi sympathies. He stated that he collected Nazi memorabilia because he liked the way it looked, and he considered himself an anarchist. He spoke against racism many times. Lemmy said he was against religion, government, and established authority. In 2011, he identified as agnostic, saying: \"I can find out when I die. I can wait. I'm not in a hurry.\" Jeff Hanneman, the founder of the thrash metal band Slayer, befriended Lemmy due to their shared fondness for collecting Nazi memorabilia. According to Keith Emerson's autobiography, \"Pictures of an Exhibitionist\" (2004), Lemmy gave him two of his Hitler Youth knives during his time as a roadie for the Nice. Emerson used these knives many times as keyholders when playing the Hammond organ during concerts with the Nice and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer before destroying them. Lemmy defended his collection by saying that if his then-girlfriend (who was black) had no problem with it, nobody else should.\nIllness and death.\nIn December 2000, Lemmy's tour was cancelled when he was hospitalised in Italy with the flu, exhaustion, and a lung infection. He was hospitalised with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005. As he grew older, he consumed less alcohol and drugs because he suffered from diabetes and hypertension. In June 2013, it was reported that he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted. His tour was cancelled in July 2013 due to a severe haematoma. He referred to his continuing drug use as \"dogged insolence in the face of mounting opposition to the contrary\". Towards the end of his life, he had to use a walking stick. He had started smoking at the age of 11. In August 2015, he said he had cut down his smoking habit from two packs a day to one pack a week. He was hospitalised with a lung infection in September 2015, after having breathing problems when performing onstage.\nOn 28 December 2015, Lemmy died at his Los Angeles apartment from prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure. He was 70 years old. Mot\u00f6rhead announced his death on their official Facebook page later that day. According to the band, his cancer had only been diagnosed two days prior to his death.\nLemmy's manager, Todd Singerman, later revealed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He [Lemmy] gets home [from tour], we have a big birthday party for him at the Whisky a Go Go. His friends came down and played. Two days later I could tell he wasn't feeling good. So we took him to the hospital. They release him. Then after the brain scan, they found the cancer in his brain and his neck. The doctor comes with the result a couple of days later and says \"It's terminal.\"\nLemmy's doctor had given him between two and six months to live. Mikael Maglieri, owner of his nearby hangout Rainbow Bar and Grill, subsequently had a video game machine that Lemmy was fond of playing taken from the establishment and put in Lemmy's apartment so he could continue playing it from his bedside. Although his manager had planned to keep the news private until his eventual death, Lemmy strongly encouraged him to make the diagnosis public in early 2016, but he died before a press release could be drafted.\nFuneral.\nLemmy's memorial service took place at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, on 9 January 2016. The service was streamed live over YouTube with more than 230,000 people logging on to watch, while others gathered at the Rainbow. His body was cremated following the funeral. His remains were placed in a 3D-printed urn shaped like his trademark cavalry hat and emblazoned with the slogan \"Born to lose, lived to win\". The piece was on display during his funeral and was later interred at Forest Lawn.\nIn March 2021, it was revealed that some of Lemmy's ashes were, by his own request, put into bullets and sent to his closest friends, including Whitfield Crane of Ugly Kid Joe, Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Michael Monroe of Hanoi Rocks, Doro Pesch of Warlock, and Riki Rachtman. In August 2023, it was reported that some of Lemmy's ashes were also scattered into the mud at Wacken Open Air music festival in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. In April 2024, it was reported James Hetfield got an Ace of Spades tattoo with some of Lemmy's ashes in it.\nTributes.\nTributes were paid by fellow rock stars such as Rob Halford, Dave Grohl, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Metallica, Scott Ian of Anthrax, and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.\nIn 2005, the British magazine and website \"Classic Rock\" presented Lemmy with its first \"Living Legend\" award. In a 2013 interview with the magazine, Lemmy said he had never expected to make it to 30, but he spoke very pointedly about the future, indicating neither he nor the band was obsessing about the end:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Death is an inevitability, isn't it? You become more aware of that when you get to my age. I don't worry about it. I'm ready for it. When I go, I want to go doing what I do best. If I died tomorrow, I couldn't complain. It's been good.\nIn February 2016, the Hollywood Vampires performed at the Grammy Award ceremony as a tribute to Lemmy. On 11 June, Download Festival paid tribute to Lemmy by renaming the main stage the \"Lemmy Stage\", and in the slot where Mot\u00f6rhead were due to play, there was a video tribute to Lemmy in which they played his music and his peers talked about him. On 17 November, Metallica released a tribute song titled \"Murder One\", named after Lemmy's frequently used amp. The song, from their tenth studio album \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\", depicts Lemmy's rise to fame. On 18 January 2017, Lemmy was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for being the creator of thrash metal. In 2017, the extinct crocodile relative \"Lemmysuchus\" was named after Lemmy. On 14 November 2016, asteroid 243002 was officially named 243002 Lemmy, complementing asteroid 250840 Motorhead, named after the band in 2014.\nIn 2018, Hawkwind recorded a new acoustic version of Lemmy's \"The Watcher\" (originally recorded on \"Doremi Fasol Latido\") on the studio album \"Road to Utopia\" with production, arrangement and additional orchestrations by Mike Batt and a guest appearance from Eric Clapton.\nOn 9 May 2025, a statue of Lemmy by local sculptor Andy Edwards was unveiled on Market Place in Burslem, in the presence of Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist Phil Campbell. The statue portrays him with his Rickenbacker 4001 bass, with his head tilted up towards a microphone. The statue will contain a small portion of Lemmy's ashes in the plinth.\nCollaborations.\nLemmy worked with several musicians, apart from his Mot\u00f6rhead bandmates, over the course of his career. He wrote the song \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S\" for the Ramones, which he played in his live sets as a tribute to the band. He also produced a Ramones EP and an album for Warfare entitled \"Metal Anarchy\" in which W\u00fcrzel guested on guitar. He was brought in as a songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne's 1991 \"No More Tears\" album, providing lyrics for the tracks \"Hellraiser,\" (which Mot\u00f6rhead later recorded themselves and released as a single), \"Desire,\" \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" and the single \"Mama, I'm Coming Home\". He also appeared in music videos for other musicians, such as the Ramones' version for The Who's \"Substitute\" and the Foo Fighters' \"White Limo\". Lemmy noted in several magazine and television interviews that he made more money from the royalties of that one song than he had in his entire time with Mot\u00f6rhead. After being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2000, for which he was hospitalised briefly, Lemmy again appeared with Mot\u00f6rhead at WrestleMania X-Seven playing WWE wrestler Triple H to the ring. Lemmy published his autobiography, \"White Line Fever\", in November 2002. In 2005, Mot\u00f6rhead won their first Grammy in the Best Metal Performance category with their cover of Metallica's \"Whiplash\". In the same year he began recording an unreleased solo album titled \"Lemmy &amp; Friends\", which was intended to include a collaboration with Janet Jackson.\nIn 2014, he established his own recording label, Motorhead Music, to promote and develop new talent. Acts he signed to the label and helped develop include Barb Wire Dolls, Budderside, Others, and Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons.\nFilm and television.\nCameo appearances.\nLemmy made appearances in film and television, including 1990 science fiction film \"Hardware\" and the 1987 comedy \"Eat the Rich\", for which Mot\u00f6rhead also recorded the soundtracks including the title song. He appeared as himself in the 1986 \"The Comic Strip Presents...\" episode \"More Bad News\", along with fellow heavy metal musicians Ozzy Osbourne, the Scorpions and Def Leppard. In 1984, Mot\u00f6rhead were the musical guests on the TV show \"The Young Ones\", in the episode \"Bambi\". He appears in the 1994 comedy \"Airheads\" (in which he is credited as \"Lemmy von Mot\u00f6rhead\"). Lemmy has a cameo in Ron Jeremy's 1994 pornographic film \"John Wayne Bobbitt Uncut\" as the discoverer of Bobbitt's severed penis. The appendage is thrown from the window of a moving car and lands at Lemmy's feet who exclaims: \"Looks like a dick! Fucking hell! Ah well, it's not mine at least.\" The film's soundtrack also features the Mot\u00f6rhead song \"Under the Knife\".\nHe has also appeared in several movies from Troma Entertainment, including the narrator in 1996's \"Tromeo and Juliet\" and as himself in both \"Terror Firmer\" and \"\". His last role was portraying the President of the United States in \"Return to Nuke 'Em High\". He has a cameo role in the film \"Down and Out with the Dolls\" (Kurt Voss, 2001). He appears as a lodger who lives in a closet. He appeared on \"Down and Dirty with Jim Norton\" as the series DJ, and also wrote the theme music. He appeared in a 2001 advertisement for Kit Kat, playing violin as part of a string quartet in a genteel tearoom. In 2015, Lemmy appeared as a central figure in the Bj\u00f6rn Tagemose-directed silent film \"Gutterd\u00e4mmerung\" opposite Grace Jones, Henry Rollins, Iggy Pop, Tom Araya of Slayer and Eagles of Death Metal's Jesse Hughes.\n\"Lemmy\" film.\nThe 2010 rockumentary film \"Lemmy\" was directed and produced by Greg Olliver and Wes Orshoski. It consists of a combination of 16 mm film and HD video footage, produced over three years. It features interviews with friends, peers, and admirers such as Dave Grohl, Slash, Ozzy Osbourne, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo of Metallica, David Ellefson of Megadeth, Scott Ian of Anthrax, Alice Cooper, Peter Hook of Joy Division/New Order, Dee Snider, Nikki Sixx, Mick Jones of the Clash, Ice-T, Kat Von D, Henry Rollins, Lars Frederiksen of Rancid, Jim Heath of The Reverend Horton Heat, Slim Jim Phantom of the Stray Cats, Mike Inez, Joan Jett, pro skateboarder Geoff Rowley, pro wrestler Triple H, \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, Jarvis Cocker, Marky Ramone, former Hawkwind bandmates Dave Brock and Stacia, and Steve Vai.\nIn video games.\nHe was the main character in the 16-bit video game \"Mot\u00f6rhead\", released for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in 1992. Lemmy also appeared as an unlockable character in the 2009 game \"\". He also provided his voice for the 2009 video game \"Br\u00fctal Legend\", voicing the Kill Master, a character designed and based on his surname and likeness. Lemmy was also the inspiration for the Mario character Lemmy Koopa, who made his first appearance in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\". In the \"Victor Vran\" \"Downloadable content\" \"Motorhead Through The Ages\", there is a new \"Lemmy's Outfit\" armour. The other Mot\u00f6rhead bandmates' armour is also available. As an easter egg, a holographic woman in the final level of 2020's \"DOOM Eternal\" proclaims, \"Lemmy is God!\". The appearance of the character King Novik from the same video game is also loosely based on facial features of Lemmy. \"Deep Rock Galactic\" features one of Lemmy's hats as a cosmetic called \"The Ace of Spades\" with the description \"In honor of a motoring head.\"\nEquipment.\nLemmy positioned his microphone in an uncommonly high position, angled so that he appeared to be looking up at the sky rather than at the audience. He said that it was for \"personal comfort, that's all. It's also one way of avoiding seeing the audience. In the days when we only had ten people and a dog, it was a way of avoiding seeing that we only \"had\" ten people and a dog.\" Inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Lemmy recorded his vocals in the studio in total privacy, meaning he would sing in an enclosed recording booth where no one can see him, not even the producer.\nAs a member of Hawkwind, Lemmy first used a Rickenbacker belonging to Dave Anderson. When Anderson failed to show up for a charity gig, Lemmy took his place. Following the departure of Anderson, Kilmister bought a Hopf Studio bass off Hawkwind synth player Del Dettmar. He used Rickenbacker basses for most of his career. In September 1996, a Rickenbacker belonging to him was a featured part of the \"Bang Your Head\" exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, US. From 1996 onward, Lemmy's main bass was a Rickenbacker 4001LK, from a limited edition run of 50 instruments, featuring hand carved body wings, featuring oak leaves, three HB1 humbucker pick-ups and all gold plated hardware. Lemmy had commented that at last Rickenbacker had made decent pick-ups. When asked about the appeal of the Rickenbacker instruments, Lemmy said \"The shape. I'm all for the image \u2014 always. If you get one that looks good, you can always mess with the pickups if it sounds bad.\"\nWith Hawkwind Lemmy used a Selmer amplifier. With Motorhead, he got a Marshall Amplification 1992 JMP Super Bass Mark 2 bass stack from 1976, with a 4x15\" and a 4x12\" cabinet. In 2008, Marshall issued a model dedicated to Lemmy, the 1992LEM, which was available with the same cabinets Lemmy used.\nMusical style.\nLemmy described his style as \"I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.\"\nLemmy's unconventional playing style changed the dynamics of the group's rhythm section. Hawkwind drummer Simon King explained that \"A lot of the time I play with [guitarist] Dave - he'll get into a kind of rhythmic thing and I'll follow him so you get this kind of percussion and rhythmic guitar thing going, so Lemmy can loon forward a bit because he's very much a front man and gives off a lot of energy, so he can get out front and play a sort of lead on bass which sometimes is very effective\", and Mot\u00f6rhead drummer Taylor echoed the sentiment with \"Onstage he's difficult to follow cos he's not really a bass player. There's no solid bass lines to follow. A lot of the time I play more with Eddie [Clarke] than with Lemmy, but he's out on his own because he is what he is.\"\n \"For releases with Mot\u00f6rhead see the Mot\u00f6rhead discography\"\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lactose makes up around 2\u20138% of milk (by mass). The name comes from (gen.\u00a0), the Latin word for milk, plus the suffix \"-ose\" used to name sugars. The compound is a white, water-soluble, non-hygroscopic solid with a mildly sweet taste. It is used in the food industry.\nStructure and reactions.\nLactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, which form a \u03b2-1\u21924 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is \u03b2--galactopyranosyl-(1\u21924)--glucose. The glucose can be in either the \u03b1-pyranose form or the \u03b2-pyranose form, whereas the galactose can have only the \u03b2-pyranose form: hence \u03b1-lactose and \u03b2-lactose refer to the anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone. Detection reactions for lactose are the W\u00f6hlk and Fearon tests. They can be used to detect the different lactose content of dairy products such as whole milk, lactose free milk, yogurt, buttermilk, coffee creamer, sour cream, kefir, etc.\nLactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose, isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose, and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol. Lactulose is a commercial product, used for treatment of constipation.\nOccurrence and isolation.\nLactose comprises about 2\u20138% of milk by weight. Several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry.\nWhey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained, for example in the production of cheese. Whey is made up of 6.5% solids, of which 4.8% is lactose, which is purified by crystallisation. Industrially, lactose is produced from whey permeate \u2013 whey filtrated for all major proteins. The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sports nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60\u201365% solids and crystallized while cooling. Lactose can also be isolated by dilution of whey with ethanol.\nMetabolism.\nInfant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk, which is rich in lactose. The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme lactase (\u03b2-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed. Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most mammals, the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to weaning; the removal of lactose from the diet removes the metabolic pressure to continue to produce lactase for its digestion.\nMany people with ancestry in Europe, West Asia, South Asia, the Sahel belt in West Africa, East Africa and a few other parts of Central Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood due to selection for genes that continue lactase production. In many of these areas, milk from mammals such as cattle, goats, and sheep is used as a large source of food. It was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved. The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups. By descent, more than 70% of western Europeans can digest lactose as adults, compared with less than 30% of people from areas of Africa, eastern and south-eastern Asia and Oceania. In people who are lactose intolerant, lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora, which can lead to diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.\nBiological properties.\nThe sweetness of lactose is 0.2 to 0.4, relative to 1.0 for sucrose. For comparison, the sweetness of glucose is 0.6 to 0.7, of fructose is 1.3, of galactose is 0.5 to 0.7, of maltose is 0.4 to 0.5, of sorbose is 0.4, and of xylose is 0.6 to 0.7.\nWhen lactose is completely digested in the small intestine, its caloric value is 4 kcal/g, or the same as that of other carbohydrates. However, lactose is not always fully digested in the small intestine. Depending on ingested dose, combination with meals (either solid or liquid), and lactase activity in the intestines, the caloric value of lactose ranges from 2 to 4 kcal/g. Undigested lactose acts as dietary fiber. It also has positive effects on absorption of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium.\nThe glycemic index of lactose is 46 to 65. For comparison, the glycemic index of glucose is 100 to 138, of sucrose is 68 to 92, of maltose is 105, and of fructose is 19 to 27.\nLactose has relatively low cariogenicity among sugars. This is because it is not a substrate for dental plaque formation and it is not rapidly fermented by oral bacteria. The buffering capacity of milk also reduces the cariogenicity of lactose.\nApplications.\nIts mild flavor and easy handling properties have led to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products. Lactose is not commonly added directly to food, because its low solubility can lead to a gritty mouthfeel. Infant formula is a notable exception, where lactose is added to match the composition of human milk. However, lactose-reduced formulas are increasing in popularity.\nOne of the undesirable properties of lactose utilization is its low solubility, which can result in crystallization, giving a gritty and sandy mouthfeel in the final product. Usually, in supersaturated solution, sugars tend to crystallize, also forming big agglomerates, depending on the process condition.\nLactose is not fermented by most yeast during brewing, which may be used to advantage. For example, lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer; the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout.\nYeast belonging to the genus \"Kluyveromyces\" have a unique industrial application, as they are capable of fermenting lactose for ethanol production. Surplus lactose from the whey by-product of dairy operations is a potential source of alternative energy.\nAnother significant lactose use is in the pharmaceutical industry. Lactose is added to tablet and capsule drug products as an ingredient because of its physical and functional properties (examples are atorvastatin, levocetirizine or thiamazole among many others). For similar reasons, it can be used to dilute illicit drugs such as cocaine or heroin.\nHistory.\nThe first crude isolation of lactose, by Italian physician Fabrizio Bartoletti (1576\u20131630), was published in 1633. In 1700, the Venetian pharmacist Lodovico Testi (1640\u20131707) published a booklet of testimonials to the power of milk sugar (') to relieve, among other ailments, the symptoms of arthritis. In 1715, Testi's procedure for making milk sugar was published by Antonio Vallisneri. Lactose was identified as a sugar in 1780 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.\nIn 1812, Heinrich Vogel (1778\u20131867) recognized that glucose was a product of hydrolyzing lactose. In 1856, Louis Pasteur crystallized the other component of lactose, galactose. By 1894, Emil Fischer had established the configurations of the component sugars.\nLactose was named by the French chemist Jean Baptiste Andr\u00e9 Dumas (1800\u20131884) in 1843. In 1856, Pasteur named galactose \"lactose\". In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot renamed it \"galactose\", and transferred the name \"lactose\" to what is now called lactose. It has a formula of and the hydrate formula , making it an isomer of sucrose.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18644", "revid": "38666673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18644", "title": "Median lethal dose", "text": "Measurement of lethal dose of substance\nIn toxicology, the median lethal dose, LD50 (abbreviation for \"lethal dose, 50%\"), LC50 (lethal concentration, 50%) or LCt50 is a toxic unit that measures the lethal dose of a given substance. The value of LD50 for a substance is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD50 figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's acute toxicity. A lower LD50 is indicative of higher toxicity.\nThe term LD50 is generally attributed to John William Trevan. The test was created by J. W. Trevan in 1927. The term semilethal dose is occasionally used in the same sense, in particular with translations of foreign language text, but can also refer to a sublethal dose. LD50 is usually determined by tests on animals such as laboratory mice. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved alternative methods to LD50 for testing the cosmetic drug botox without animal tests.\nConventions.\nThe LD50 is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as milligrams of substance per kilogram of body mass, sometimes also stated as nanograms (suitable for botulinum toxin), micrograms, or grams (suitable for paracetamol) per kilogram. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass). For substances in the environment, such as poisonous vapors or substances in water that are toxic to fish, the concentration in the environment (per cubic metre or per litre) is used, giving a value of LC50. But in this case, the exposure time is important (see below).\nThe choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD50 is not the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD50. Measures such as \"LD1\" and \"LD99\" (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.\nLethal dosage often varies depending on the method of administration; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when intravenously administered. For this reason, LD50 figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., \"LD50 i.v.\"\nThe related quantities LD50/30 or LD50/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly within radiation health physics, for ionizing radiation, as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.\nA comparable measurement is LCt50, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m3. ICt50 is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of chemical warfare agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10\u00a0L/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration. The concept of Ct was first proposed by Fritz Haber and is sometimes referred to as Haber's law, which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100\u00a0mg/m3 is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10\u00a0mg/m3 (1 \u00d7 100 = 100, as does 10 \u00d7 10 = 100).\nSome chemicals, such as hydrogen cyanide, are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber's law. In these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as LC50 and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The material safety data sheets for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber's law.\nFor disease-causing organisms, there is also a measure known as the median infective dose and dosage. The median infective dose (ID50) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral). Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD50s to some test animal. In biological warfare infective dosage is the number of infective doses per cubic metre of air times the number of minutes of exposure (e.g., ICt50 is 100 medium doses - min/m3).\nLimitation.\nAs a measure of toxicity, LD50 is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.\nThere can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (\"cf.\" paracetamol toxicity), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be toxic to many animals. When used to test venom from venomous creatures, such as snakes, LD50 results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many venomous snakes are specialized predators on mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and mongooses may be exceptionally resistant. While most mammals have a very similar physiology, LD50 results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, such as humans, etc.\nExamples.\nNote: Comparing substances (especially drugs) to each other by LD50 can be misleading in many cases due (in part) to differences in effective dose (ED50). Therefore, it is more useful to compare such substances by therapeutic index, which is simply the ratio of LD50 to ED50.\nThe following examples are listed in reference to LD50 values, in descending order, and accompanied by LC50 values, {bracketed}, when appropriate.\nPoison scale.\nThe LD50 values have a very wide range. The botulinum toxin as the most toxic substance known has an LD50 value of 1\u00a0ng/kg, while the most non-toxic substance water has an LD50 value of more than 90\u00a0g/kg; a difference of about 1 in 100 billion, or 11 orders of magnitude. As with all measured values that differ by many orders of magnitude, a logarithmic view is advisable. Well-known examples are the indication of the earthquake strength using magnitude scales, the pH value, as a measure for the acidic or basic character of an aqueous solution or of loudness in decibels.\nIn this case, the negative decimal logarithm of the LD50 values, which is standardized in kg per kg body weight, is considered \u2212log10(LD50).\nThe dimensionless value found can be entered in a toxin scale. Water as the baseline substance is nearly 1 in the negative logarithmic toxin scale.\nProcedures.\nA number of procedures have been defined to derive the LD50. The earliest was the 1927 \"conventional\" procedure by Trevan, which requires 40 or more animals. The fixed-dose procedure, proposed in 1984, estimates a level of toxicity by feeding at defined doses and looking for signs of toxicity (without requiring death). The up-and-down procedure, proposed in 1985, yields an LD50 value while dosing only one animal at a time.\nSee also.\nOther measures of toxicity.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18645", "revid": "49376051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18645", "title": "Lactase", "text": "Milk-sugar digesting enzyme\nLactase (EC https://) is an enzyme produced by many organisms and is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk. It breaks down the sugar lactose into its component parts, galactose and glucose, simple sugars that can be absorbed into the bloodstream through an animal's intestines. A lactase is a type of \u03b2-galactosidase because it breaks down the \u03b2-glycosidic bond in -lactose. The chemical reaction it catalyzes is:\n C12H22O11 + H2O \u2192 C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 + heat.\nlactose + H2O \u2192 \u03b2--galactose + -glucose\nThe only human gene encoding a lactase is \"LCT\" or lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (alternative symbol LPH). LCT has a lactase domain and a phlorizin hydrolase domain. It is encoded on chromosome 2. Lactase is found in the brush border of the small intestine of humans and other mammals. People deficient in LCT or lacking functional LCT may experience the symptoms of lactose intolerance after consuming milk products.\nMicrobial \u03b2-galactosidases that can hydrolyze lactose (i.e. a lactase in the broader sense) can be purchased as a food supplement and is added to milk to produce \"lactose-free\" milk products. This enzyme can directly break down lactose when added to dairy. Some versions can survive passage through the human stomach and break down lactose in any ingested food before it reaches the colon.\nThe animal (including human) versions.\nAs mentioned above the human lactase is a protein with two \u03b2-galactosidase domains. The lactase domain functions as a lactase while the phlorizin hydrolase domain catalyzes the conversion of phlorizin to phloretin and glucose.\nStructure and biosynthesis.\nPreprolactase, the primary translation product, has a single polypeptide primary structure consisting of 1927 amino acids. It can be divided into five domains: (i) a 19-amino-acid cleaved signal sequence; (ii) a large prosequence domain that is not present in mature lactase; (iii) the mature lactase segment; (iv) a membrane-spanning hydrophobic anchor; and (v) a short hydrophilic carboxyl terminus. The signal sequence is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the resulting 215-kDa pro-LPH is sent to the Golgi apparatus, where it is heavily glycosylated and proteolytically processed to its mature form. The prodomain has been shown to act as an intramolecular chaperone in the ER, preventing trypsin cleavage and allowing LPH to adopt the necessary 3-D structure to be transported to the Golgi apparatus.\nMature human lactase consists of a single 160-kDa polypeptide chain that localizes to the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. It is oriented with the N-terminus outside the cell and the C-terminus in the cytosol. LPH contains two catalytic glutamic acid sites. In the human enzyme, the lactase activity has been connected to Glu-1749, while Glu-1273 is the site of phlorizin hydrolase function.\nGenetic expression and regulation.\nIn humans, lactase is encoded by a single genetic locus on chromosome 2. It is expressed exclusively by mammalian small intestine enterocytes and in very low levels in the colon during fetal development. Humans are born with high levels of lactase expression. In most of the world's population, lactase transcription is down-regulated after weaning, resulting in diminished lactase expression in the small intestine, which causes the common symptoms of adult-type hypolactasia, or lactose intolerance. The \"LCT\" gene provides the instructions for making lactase. Lactose intolerance in infants (congenital lactase deficiency) is caused by mutations in the \"LCT\" gene. Mutations are believed to interfere with the function of lactase, causing affected infants to have a severely impaired ability to digest lactose in breast milk or formula.\nSome population segments exhibit lactase persistence resulting from a mutation that is postulated to have occurred 5,000\u201310,000 years ago, coinciding with the rise of cattle domestication. This mutation has allowed almost half of the world's population to metabolize lactose without symptoms. Studies have linked the occurrence of lactase persistence to two different single-nucleotide polymorphisms about 14 and 22 kilobases upstream of the 5'-end of the LPH gene. Both mutations, C\u2192T at position -13910 and G\u2192 A at position -22018, have been independently linked to lactase persistence.\nThe lactase promoter is 150 base pairs long and is located upstream of the site of transcription initiation. The sequence is highly conserved in mammals, suggesting that critical cis-transcriptional regulators are located nearby. Cdx-2, HNF-1\u03b1, and GATA have been identified as transcription factors. Studies of hypolactasia onset have demonstrated that despite polymorphisms, little difference exists in lactase expression in infants, showing that the mutations become increasingly relevant during development. Developmentally regulated DNA-binding proteins may down-regulate transcription or destabilize mRNA transcripts, causing decreased LPH expression after weaning.\nMechanism.\nThe catalytic mechanism of -lactose hydrolysis retains the substrate anomeric configuration in the products.&lt;ref name = \"doi10.1021/bi011727i\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While the details of the mechanism are uncertain, the stereochemical retention is achieved via a double displacement reaction. Studies of \"E. coli\" lactase have proposed that hydrolysis is initiated when a glutamate nucleophile on the enzyme attacks from the axial side of the galactosyl carbon in the \u03b2-glycosidic bond. The removal of the -glucose leaving group may be facilitated by Mg-dependent acid catalysis. The enzyme is liberated from the \u03b1-galactosyl moiety upon equatorial nucleophilic attack by water, which produces -galactose.\nSubstrate modification studies have demonstrated that the 3\u2032-OH and 2\u2032-OH moieties on the galactopyranose ring are essential for recognition and hydrolysis by the mammalian lactase. The 3\u2032-hydroxy group is involved in initial binding to the substrate while the 2\u2032- group is not necessary for recognition but needed in subsequent steps. This is demonstrated by the fact that a 2-deoxy analog is an effective competitive inhibitor (Ki = 10mM). Elimination of specific hydroxyl groups on the glucopyranose moiety does not eliminate catalysis.\nThe temperature optimum for human lactase is about 37\u00a0\u00b0C and the pH optimum is 6.\nNon-animal lactases and their uses.\nLactase produced commercially is extracted both from yeasts such as \"Kluyveromyces fragilis\" and \"Kluyveromyces lactis\" and from molds, such as \"Aspergillus niger\" and \"Aspergillus oryzae\".\nAs mentioned earlier, lactase is an enzyme that some people are unable to produce in their small intestine. Without lactase, lactose-intolerant people pass the lactose undigested to the colon where bacteria break it down, creating carbon dioxide which leads to bloating and flatulence. The commercial forms of lactase can break down lactose when they are either added to food or put in the human digestive tract.\nAdded to food.\nLactase is added to dairy, thereby hydrolyzing the lactose in it, leaving it slightly sweet but digestible by everyone.\nTechnology to produce lactose-free milk, ice cream, and yogurt was developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service in 1985. Lactase from select species of mold are considered GRAS by the US FDA; as a result, they are allowed to be added to food in limited quantities as a processing aid. This is one of the primary commercial uses of lactase.\nIngested.\nLactase supplements can be used to treat lactose intolerance. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not independently evaluated these products, but there is consensus that they do work so long as the stated potency matches what is claimed by the label.\nCommercial lactase is used as a medication for lactose intolerance. Since it is an enzyme, its function can be inhibited by the acidity of the stomach. However, it is packaged in an acid-proof tablet, allowing the enzyme to pass through the stomach intact and remain in the small intestine. In the small intestine it can act on ingested lactose molecules, allowing the body to absorb the digested sugar which would otherwise cause cramping and diarrhea. Since the enzyme is not absorbed, it is excreted.\nBiotechnology.\nLactase (technically, \u03b2-galactosidase) is also used to screen for blue white colonies in the multiple cloning sites of various plasmid vectors in \"Escherichia coli\" or other bacteria. Besides the fungal types of \u03b2-galactosidase mentioned above, biotechnology also makes use of the \"E. coli\" \"lacZ\" \u03b2-galactosidase found in the lac operon.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18646", "revid": "31985108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18646", "title": "Linkin Park", "text": "American rock band\nLinkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon; after Bennington's death by suicide in July 2017, the band endured a seven-year hiatus, during which Bourdon chose to depart from the band. In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.\nCategorized mainly as alternative rock and nu metal, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, with their later music featuring more electronica and pop elements. Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, \"Hybrid Theory\" (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led to the singles \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\", and \"In the End\" all charting highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the number two spot on the nation's \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Their second album, \"Meteora\" (2003), continued the band's success. The band's third album, \"Minutes to Midnight\" (2007), marked a change in sound. By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.\nThe band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, \"A Thousand Suns\" (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, \"Living Things\" (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, \"The Hunting Party\" (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, while their seventh album, \"One More Light\" (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. The band's eighth album, \"From Zero\" (2024), returned to more of their original sound while also incorporating musical elements from all of their previous records.\nLinkin Park is one of the best-selling music acts of all time, having sold over 100 million records worldwide. They have won two Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, four \"Billboard\" Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, and three World Music Awards. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. \"Billboard\" ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade list. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared \"the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by \"Kerrang!\".\nHistory.\n1996\u20132000: Foundation and early years.\nLinkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson. The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled \"Xero\", released in November 1997. That same month, the band performed their first show, opening for SX-10 and System of a Down at the Whisky a Go Go, a nightclub in West Hollywood. Delson introduced the band to Jeff Blue, the vice president of A&amp;R for Zomba Music, whom he had interned for in college. Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels. Blue himself was impressed with Xero after watching them play a live show in 1998 but believed the band needed a different vocalist. Tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal. The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects. Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.\nAfter spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Chester Bennington, a vocalist from Arizona who was recommended by Jeff Blue in March 1999. Bennington, formerly of alternative rock band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. Additionally, the band recruited bassist Kyle Christner on a temporary basis. In May 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online \"street team\". In October 1999, Christner was replaced by Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck, whom along with Delson, provided bass tracks for the band's recordings.\nThe band still struggled to sign a record deal. They turned to Jeff Blue for additional help after facing numerous rejections from several major record labels. After failing to catch Warner Bros. Records on three previous reviews, Blue, who was now the vice president of Warner Bros. Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company as a developing artist in 1999. However, the label advised the band to change their name to avoid confusion with Hybrid. The band considered the names \"Plear\" and \"Platinum Lotus Foundation\" before deciding on \"Linkin Park\", a play on and homage to Santa Monica's Lincoln Park, now called Christine Emerson Reed Park. They initially wanted to use the name \"Lincoln Park\"; however, they changed it to \"Linkin\" to acquire the internet domain \"linkinpark.com\".\nBennington and Shinoda both reported that Warner Bros. Records was skeptical of Linkin Park's initial recordings. The label's A&amp;R was not pleased with the band's hip-hop and rock-style approach. An A&amp;R representative suggested that Bennington should demote or fire Shinoda and exclusively focus on making a rock record. Bennington supported Shinoda and refused to compromise Linkin Park's vision for the album. Farrell returned in late 2000, and the band released their breakthrough album, \"Hybrid Theory\", that same year.\n2000\u20132002: \"Hybrid Theory\" and \"Reanimation\".\nLinkin Park released \"Hybrid Theory\" on October 24, 2000. The album, which represented half a decade's worth of the band's work, was edited by Don Gilmore. \"Hybrid Theory\" was a massive commercial success; it sold more than 4.8\u00a0million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001. Singles such as \"Crawling\" and \"One Step Closer\" established themselves as staples among alternative rock radio play lists during the year, and \"In the End\" peaked at No. 2 on the US \"Billboard Hot 100\", the band's highest to date. Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films such as \"Dracula 2000\", \"Little Nicky\", and \"Valentine\". \"Hybrid Theory\" won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song \"Crawling\" and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video award for \"In the End\".\nDuring this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour, and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band worked with Jessica Sklar to found their official fan club and street team, \"Linkin Park Underground\", in November 2001. Linkin Park also formed their own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg. Within a year, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts. The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in their first DVD, \"Frat Party at the Pankake Festival\", which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album, dubbed \"Reanimation\", which would include works from \"Hybrid Theory\" and non-album tracks. \"Reanimation\" debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others. \"Reanimation\" claimed the second spot on the \"Billboard\" 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week. \"Hybrid Theory\" is also in the RIAA's \"Top 100 Albums\".\n2002\u20132004: \"Meteora\".\nFollowing the success of \"Hybrid Theory\" and \"Reanimation\", Linkin Park spent a significant amount of time touring around the United States. The band members began to work on new material amidst their saturated schedule, spending a sliver of their free time in their tour bus's studio. The band officially announced the production of a new studio album in December 2002, revealing their new work was inspired by the rocky region of Meteora in Greece, where numerous monasteries have been built on top of the rocks. \"Meteora\" features a mixture of the band's nu metal and rap metal style with newer innovative effects, including the induction of a shakuhachi (a Japanese flute made of bamboo) and other instruments. Linkin Park's second album debuted on March 25, 2003, and instantly earned worldwide recognition, peaking at No. 1 on the Rock &amp; Metal Albums Chart.\n\"Meteora\" continued the success from the band's debut. The album sold more than 800,000 copies during its first week, and it ranked as the best-selling album on the Billboard charts at the time. The album's singles, including \"Somewhere I Belong\", \"Breaking the Habit\", \"Faint\", and \"Numb\", received significant radio attention. By October 2003, \"Meteora\" sold nearly three million copies. The album's success allowed Linkin Park to form another Projekt Revolution tour. Additionally, Metallica invited Linkin Park to play at the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003, which included Limp Bizkit, Mudvayne and Deftones. The band released an album and DVD, titled \"Live in Texas\", which featured some audio and video tracks from the band's performances in Texas during the tour. In early 2004, Linkin Park embarked on the \"Meteora World Tour\".\n\"Meteora\" earned the band multiple awards and honors, including Best Rock Video for \"Somewhere I Belong\" and the Viewer's Choice Award for \"Breaking the Habit\". Linkin Park also received significant recognition during the 2004 Radio Music Awards, winning the Artist of the Year and Song of the Year (\"Numb\") awards. Although \"Meteora\" was not nearly as successful as \"Hybrid Theory\", it was the third best selling album in the United States during 2003. The band spent the first few months of 2004 touring around the world, first with the third Projekt Revolution tour, and later several European concerts. At the same time, the band's relationship with Warner Bros. Records rapidly deteriorated on account of several trust and financial issues. The band finally negotiated a new deal in December 2005.\n2004\u20132006: Side projects and \"Minutes to Midnight\".\nFollowing \"Meteora\"'s success, the band worked on many side projects. Bennington appeared on DJ Lethal's \"State of the Art\" and other work with Dead by Sunrise, while Shinoda did work with Depeche Mode, creating the remix song \"Enjoy the Silence 04\". In 2004, the band began to work with Jay-Z to produce another remix album, titled \"Collision Course\". The album, which featured intermixed lyrics and background tracks from both artists' previous albums, debuted in November 2004. Shinoda also formed Fort Minor as a side project. With the aid of Jay-Z, Fort Minor released their debut album, \"The Rising Tied\", to critical acclaim.\nLinkin Park also participated in numerous charitable events, which included raising money to benefit victims of Hurricane Charley in 2004 and later Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The band donated $75,000 to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation in March 2004. They also helped relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims by staging several charity concerts and setting up an additional fund called Music for Relief. The band participated at Live 8, a series of charitable benefit concerts set up to raise global awareness. Alongside Jay-Z, the band performed on Live 8's stage in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a global audience. The band would later be reunited with Jay-Z at the Grammy Award Ceremony 2006, during which they performed \"Numb/Encore\", en route to winning a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. They were joined on stage by Paul McCartney who added verses from the song \"Yesterday\". They would later go on to play at the 2006 Summer Sonic music festival, which was hosted by Metallica in Japan.\nLinkin Park returned to the recording studios in 2006 to work on new material. To produce the album, the band chose producer Rick Rubin. Despite initially stating the album would debut sometime in 2006, it was delayed until 2007. The band had recorded thirty to fifty songs in August 2006, when Shinoda stated the album was halfway completed. Bennington later added that the new album would stray away from their previous nu metal sound. Warner Bros. Records officially announced that the band's third studio album, titled \"Minutes to Midnight\", would be released on May 15, 2007, in the United States. After spending fourteen months working on the album, the band members opted to further refine their album by removing five of the original seventeen tracks. The album's title, a reference to the Doomsday Clock, foreshadowed the band's new lyrical themes. \"Minutes to Midnight\" sold over 623,000 copies in its first week, making it one of the most successful debut week albums in recent years. The album also took the top spot on the Billboard Charts.\nThe album's first single, \"What I've Done\", was released on April 2, and premiered on MTV and Fuse within the same week. The single peaked at no. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is also used in soundtrack for the 2007 action film, \"Transformers\". Mike Shinoda was also featured on the Styles of Beyond song \"Second to None\", which was also included in the film. Later in the year, the band won the \"Favorite Alternative Artist\" in the American Music Awards. The band also saw success with the rest of the album's singles, \"Bleed It Out\", \"Shadow of the Day\", \"Given Up\", and \"Leave Out All the Rest\", which were released throughout 2007 and early 2008. The band also collaborated with Busta Rhymes on his single \"We Made It\", which was released on April 29.\nLinkin Park embarked on a large world tour titled \"Minutes to Midnight World Tour\". The band promoted the album's release by forming their fourth Projekt Revolution tour in the United States which included many musical acts like My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, HIM, Placebo, and many others. They also played numerous shows in Europe, Asia, and Australia which included a performance at Live Earth Japan on July 7, 2007. and headlining Download Festival in Donington Park, England and Edgefest in Downsview Park, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The band completed touring on their fourth Projekt Revolution tour before taking up an Arena tour around the United Kingdom, visiting Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester, before finishing on a double night at the O2 arena in London. Bennington stated that Linkin Park plans to release a follow-up album to \"Minutes to Midnight\". However, he stated the band will first embark on a United States tour to gather inspiration for the album. Linkin Park embarked on another Projekt Revolution tour in 2008. The United States Projekt Revolution tour featured Chris Cornell, the Bravery, Ashes Divide, Street Drum Corps and many others. Mike Shinoda announced a live CD/DVD titled \"\", which is a live video recording from the Projekt Revolution gig at the Milton Keynes Bowl on June 29, 2008, which was officially released on November 24, 2008.\n2008\u20132011: \"A Thousand Suns\".\nIn May 2009, Linkin Park announced they were working on a fourth studio album, which was planned to be released in 2010. Shinoda told IGN that the new album would be 'genre-busting,' while building off of elements in \"Minutes to Midnight\". He also mentioned that the album would be more experimental and \"hopefully more cutting-edge\". Bennington also addressed the media to confirm that Rick Rubin would return to produce the new album. The band later revealed the album would be called \"A Thousand Suns\". While working on the new album, Linkin Park worked with successful film composer Hans Zimmer to produce the score for \"\". The band released a single for the movie, titled \"New Divide\". Joe Hahn created a music video for the song, which featured clips from the film. On June 22, Linkin Park played a short set in Westwood Village after the premier of the movie. After completing work for \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\", the band returned to the studio to finalize their album.\nOn April 26, the band released an app for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, a game called \"8-Bit Rebellion!\" It featured the band as playable characters, and a new song called \"Blackbirds\" which was unlockable by beating the game. The song was also later released as an iTunes bonus track on \"A Thousand Suns\".\n\"A Thousand Suns\" was released on September 14. The album's first single, \"The Catalyst\", was released on August 2. The band promoted their new album by launching a concert tour, which started in October 2010. Other singles from the album include, \"Waiting for the End\", \"Burning in the Skies\", and \"Iridescent\". Furthermore, a documentary about the album's production, titled \"Meeting of A Thousand Suns\", was available. On August 31, 2010, it was announced that the band would perform \"The Catalyst\" live for the first time at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010. The venue of the debut live performance of the single was Griffith Observatory, a location used in Hollywood movies.\nLinkin Park reached No.9 in the \"Billboard\" Social 50, a chart of the most active artists on the world's leading social networking sites. In other \"Billboard\" Year-End charts, the band reached No.92 in the \"Top Artists\" chart, as well as \"A Thousand Suns\" reaching No.53 in the Year-End chart of the \"Billboard\" Top 200 albums and \"The Catalyst\" reaching No.40 in the Year-End Rock Songs chart.\nThe band was nominated for six Billboard Awards in 2011 for Top Duo or Group, Best Rock Album for \"A Thousand Suns\", Top Rock Artist, Top Alternative Artist, Top Alternative Song for \"Waiting for the End\" and Top Alternative Album for \"A Thousand Suns\", but did not win any award. The band charted in numerous \"Billboard\" Year-End charts in 2011. The band was No.39 in the Top Artists Chart, No.87 in the \"Billboard\" 200 Artists chart, No.11 in the Social 50 Chart, No.6 in the Top Rock Artists Chart, No.9 in the Rock Songs Artists Chart, No.16 in the Rock Albums Chart, No.4 in the Hard Rock Albums Chart, and No.7 in the Alternative Songs Chart.\n2011\u20132013: \"Living Things\" and \"Recharged\".\nIn July 2011, Bennington told \"Rolling Stone\" that Linkin Park aims to produce a new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying \"We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time\u00a0... we like the direction that we're going in\". On March 28, 2012, Shinoda confirmed that the band was filming a music video for \"Burn It Down\", directed by Joe Hahn. Shinoda spoke to \"Co.Create\" about the album's art, saying that it will \"blow them [the fans] away\u00a0... the average person is not going to be able to look at it and go, I understand that that's completely new, like not just the image but the way they made the image is totally new. So there's going to be that\".\nIn April 2012, the band announced that \"Living Things\" would be the title of their fifth album and called it a \"return to form\". Shinoda stated that they chose the title \"Living Things\" because the album is more about people, personal interactions, and it is far more personal than their previous albums. The album's lead single, \"Burn It Down\", was released on April 16. The band promoted the album on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour, with co-headliners Incubus. Other singles from the album include \"Lost in the Echo\", \"Powerless\", and Castle of Glass\". The band performed \"Burn It Down\" at 2012 Billboard Music Awards.

The song would later be included on a remix album, entitled \"Recharged\", which was released on October 29, 2013. Similar to \"Reanimation\", the album features remixes of ten of the songs from \"Living Things\", with contributions from other artists, such as Pusha T, Rick Rubin, and Bun B. The band also worked on the soundtrack for the film \"Mall\", which was directed by Joe Hahn.\n2013\u20132015: \"The Hunting Party\".\nIn an interview with Fuse, Shinoda confirmed that Linkin Park had begun recording their sixth studio album in May 2013. The band released the first single from their upcoming album, titled, \"Guilty All the Same\" (featuring Rakim) on March 6, 2014, through Shazam. The single was later released on the following day by Warner Bros. Records and debut at No. 27 on the US Billboard Rock Airplay charts before peaking at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock charts in the following weeks. Shortly after the single's release, the band revealed their sixth album would be titled \"The Hunting Party\". The album was produced by Shinoda and Delson, who wanted to explore musical elements from \"Hybrid Theory\" and the band's earlier material. Shinoda commented the album is a \"90s style of rock record\". He elaborated, \"It's a rock record. It's loud and it's rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk-thrash.' The album includes musical contributions from rapper Rakim, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Daron Malakian of System of a Down. The songs \"Until It's Gone\", \"Wastelands\", \"Rebellion\" (featuring Daron Malakian), and \"Final Masquerade\" were released as singles from the album. \"The Hunting Party\" was released on June 13, 2014, in most countries, and later released in the United States on June 17.\nLinkin Park performed at Download Festival on June 14, 2014, where they played their debut album, \"Hybrid Theory\", in its entirety.

The song was debuted on Twitch on April 13 and released on April 14.\nLinkin Park performed at the closing ceremony of BlizzCon 2015, Blizzard's video game convention.\n2015\u20132017: \"One More Light\" and Bennington's death.\nLinkin Park began working on new material for a seventh studio album in November 2015. Chester Bennington commented on the album's direction by stating, \"We've got a lot of great material that I hope challenges our fanbase as well as inspires them as much as it has us.\" In February 2017, Linkin Park released promotional videos on their social network accounts, which featured Shinoda and Bennington preparing new material for the album. Mike Shinoda stated the band was following a new process when producing the album. Brad Delson elaborated: \"We've made so many records and we clearly know how to make a record and we definitely didn't take the easy way out this time.\"\nThe first single from the new album was revealed to be titled \"Heavy\"; it features pop singer Kiiara, marking the first time the band featured a female vocalist on an original song for a studio album. The lyrics for the song were cowritten by Linkin Park with Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter. The single was released on February 16. As they have done in the past, Linkin Park had cryptic messages online in relation to the new album. The album cover was revealed through digital puzzles across social media; the cover features six kids playing in the ocean. The band's seventh album, \"One More Light\", was released on May 19, 2017. The promotional singles, \"Battle Symphony\", \"Good Goodbye\" (featuring Pusha T and Stormzy), and \"Invisible\" were also released prior to the album's release.\nBennington died on July 20, 2017; his death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Shinoda confirmed Bennington's death on Twitter, writing, \"Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one\". The band had released a music video for their single \"Talking to Myself\" earlier that day. One day after Bennington's death, the band canceled the North American leg of their One More Light World Tour. On the morning of July 24, Linkin Park released an official statement on their website as a tribute to Bennington. On July 28, Shinoda announced that donations made to the band's Music for Relief charity would be redirected to the One More Light Fund, which had been set up in Bennington's memory. On August 4, when the band was initially scheduled to play on \"Good Morning America\", Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell's twelve-year-old daughter Toni appeared with OneRepublic to perform \"Hallelujah\" as a tribute to Bennington (who was the godfather to her younger brother, Christopher) and her father. Bennington had previously performed the song at the funeral for Cornell, who had also died from a suicide by hanging two months earlier.\nOn August 22, Linkin Park announced plans to hold a tribute concert in Los Angeles to honor Bennington. The band thanked fans for their support, stating, \"The five of us are so grateful for all of your support as we heal and build the future of Linkin Park\". The title track of \"One More Light\" was released as a single on October 3. The band later confirmed that the concert, titled , would take place on October 27 at the Hollywood Bowl. The event featured multiple guests performing Linkin Park songs along with the band. The event was over three hours long and was streamed live via YouTube.

We have a lot of rebuilding to do, and questions to answer, so it'll take time.\" On March 29, however, Shinoda stated that he was uncertain of Linkin Park's future when being interviewed by \"Vulture\". On April 17, Linkin Park was nominated for three awards at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards but did not win any of them. The band was presented with The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on May 18. On February 18, 2019, Shinoda said in an interview that the band is open to the idea of continuing though what form that takes has yet to be decided. Shinoda stated \"I know the other guys, they love to be onstage, they love to be in a studio, and so to not do that would be like, I don't know, almost like unhealthy.\" When asked about the band's future minus Bennington, Shinoda stated, \"It's not my goal to look for a new singer. If it does happen, it has to happen naturally. If we find someone that is a great person and good stylistic fit, I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody. I would never want to feel like we are replacing Chester.\"\nShinoda, Farrell and Hahn began working on new music together, without any public announcement; by 2019, they were later rejoined by Delson, but Bourdon chose not to participate. The band met Dead Sara vocalist Emily Armstrong in 2019, and began working on music with her shortly after, along with various other musicians, including drummer Colin Brittain. On April 28, 2020, bassist Dave Farrell revealed the band was working on new music. On August 13, the band released \"She Couldn't\", a track that was originally recorded in 1999, and it was included on a 20th anniversary edition of their debut album \"Hybrid Theory\", released on October 9. On January 8, 2021, Linkin Park released a remix of \"One Step Closer\" by American electronic duo 100 gecs. The band revealed it was the first of many new remixes inspired by \"Reanimation\" to come. On October 29, when asked about the band playing live shows again, Shinoda stated, \"Now is not the time [for the band's return]. We don't have the focus on it. We don't have the math worked out. And I don't mean that by financially math, I mean that like emotional and creative math.\" In April 2022, Shinoda reiterated that the band was not working on a new album, new music, or touring.\nIn February 2023, the band started an interactive game on their website teasing the 20th anniversary of \"Meteora\". On February 6, they revealed a previously unreleased demo, \"Lost\", that was formally released on February 10, as the lead single from the reissue of the album, released on April 7. The second single, \"Fighting Myself\" was released on March 24.\n2023\u2013present: Reformation and \"From Zero\".\nUnbeknownst to the public, in 2023, the band approached Armstrong and Brittain to reform as Linkin Park to record and release new music and perform the band's back catalogue. A previously unreleased song from the \"One More Light\" sessions, \"Friendly Fire\", was released on February 23, 2024. This was followed up by the band's first greatest hits album, \"Papercuts\", which was released on April 12. The collection also includes \"Friendly Fire\", as well as the first official release of the song \"Qwerty\", which first appeared on \"LP Underground 6.0\" in 2006. On April 30, 2024, \"Billboard\" reported that Linkin Park's booking agency WME had taken offers for both a potential reunion tour and headlining festival dates to take place in 2025, with the lineup featuring Shinoda, Delson, Farrell, and a female vocalist in place of Bennington.\nAt a livestreamed event on September 5, Linkin Park announced the band's comeback, including Armstrong and Brittain's entry into the band. In addition, the band performed and released \"The Emptiness Machine\", the lead single of the group's eighth album \"From Zero\", which was released on November 15, 2024. The band's decision to add Armstrong was met with some criticism due to her connections with the Church of Scientology and perceived support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson. The Mars Volta frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who had first directed the aforementioned accusations towards Armstrong back in 2023, stated that Linkin Park was \"not doing their due diligence before\u00a0hiring her\"; one of Bennington's sons said that Linkin Park \"betrayed the trust\" of the fanbase with the change. Armstrong responded to the criticism via an Instagram story, stating that she had not been in contact with Masterson since attending his 2020 court appearance and that she condemned his crimes; however, she did not clarify her status with Scientology. Though, BBC noted that the lyrical content she wrote for Dead Sara suggests Armstrong's rejection of their teachings.\nLinkin Park embarked on a nine-date arena tour across four continents on September 11 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. After Alex Feder performed in his place at the comeback event, Delson announced his decision to withdraw from touring to concentrate on the \"behind the scenes\" aspects of the band. This initial run of shows concluded in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, on November 16, 2024. Following this, the band announced a worldwide stadium and arena tour for 2025, a tour which included their first ever performance at Wembley Stadium in England. The album's second single, \"Heavy Is the Crown\", was released on September 24, 2024, and was used as the main theme for Riot Games' 2024 \"League of Legends\" World Championship. The album's third single, \"Over Each Other\", was released on October 24, 2024. The album's fourth single, \"Two Faced\", was released on November 13, 2024. Not long after the album's release, the band entered the studio again, sharing clips on social media.

On May 31, the band performed during the 2025 UEFA Champions League final at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. In November 2025, the band was nominated for two Grammys for the upcoming 68th Annual Grammy Awards, scheduled for February 1, 2026. \"From Zero\" was nominated for Best Rock Album and \"The Emptiness Machine\" was nominated for Best Rock Performance.\nPhilanthropy.\nOn January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled \"Not Alone\" as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called \"Download to Donate for Haiti\" in support of the Haiti Earthquake crisis. On February 10, 2010, Linkin Park released the official music video for the song on their homepage. \nOn January 11, 2011, an updated version of \"Download to Donate for Haiti\" was launched, called \"Download to Donate for Haiti V2.0\", with more songs to download. For the updated compilation, the band released Keaton Hashimoto's remix of \"The Catalyst\" from the \"Linkin Park featuring YOU\" contest.\nShinoda designed two T-shirts, in which the proceeds would go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters. Music for Relief released \"Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan\", another compilation of songs, in which the proceeds would go to Save the Children. The band released the song titled as \"Issho Ni\", meaning \"we're in this together\", on March 22, 2011, via \"\".\nIn the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the \"Music for Relief: Concert for the Philippines\" in Los Angeles, and raised donations for victims. The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15. Other artists during the show included the Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and the Filharmonic.\nMusical style and influences.\nLinkin Park combines elements of metal, industrial, punk, pop, electronic and hip hop. More specifically, the band has been categorized as alternative rock, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, alternative metal, electronic rock, pop rock, hard rock, industrial rock, and electropop. Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such.\nBoth \"Hybrid Theory\" and \"Meteora\" combine alternative metal, nu metal, rap rock, rap metal, and alternative rock sounds with elements of hip hop and electronica, utilizing programming and synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as \"a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style,\" whereas \"Rolling Stone\" described their song \"Breaking the Habit\" as \"risky, beautiful art\".\nIn \"Minutes to Midnight,\" the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and more varied range of genres and styles, a process \"Los Angeles Times\" compares to a stage in U2's work. Only two songs on the album's tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered as alternative rock.\nThe vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda played as a major part within Linkin Park's music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist. On Linkin Park's third album, \"Minutes to Midnight\", Shinoda sings lead vocals on \"In Between\", \"Hands Held High\", and on the B-side \"No Roads Left\". On numerous songs from the band's fourth album, \"A Thousand Suns\", such as the album's singles (\"The Catalyst\", \"Burning in the Skies\", \"Iridescent\"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica. James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to Radiohead's \"Kid A\", while Jordy Kasko of \"Review, Rinse, Repeat\" likened the album to both \"Kid A\" and Pink Floyd's landmark album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: \"Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because, although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively\". One of the record's political elements is its samples of speeches by American political figures. \"A Thousand Suns\" was described as trip hop, electronic rock, ambient, alternative rock, industrial rock, experimental rock, rap rock, and progressive rock.\nTheir fifth album, \"Living Things\", is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in a harder sound by comparison. The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums on \"The Hunting Party\", which was described as an alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock, rap rock, and rap metal album. Their seventh album, \"One More Light,\" was described as pop, pop rock and electropop.\nLinkin Park's influences include Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Jane's Addiction, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Descendents, Misfits, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, N.W.A, Public Enemy, KRS-One, Boogie Down Productions, Led Zeppelin, Rage Against the Machine, Strife, Helmet, and the Beatles.\nMany of the group's song lyrics deal with alienation, introversion, and personal struggle and suffering.\nLegacy.\nLinkin Park has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. The group's first studio album \"Hybrid Theory\" is one of the best-selling albums in the US (12\u00a0million copies shipped) and worldwide (30\u00a0million copies sold). \"Billboard\" estimates that Linkin Park earned US$5 million between May 2011 and May 2012, making them the 40th-highest-paid musical artist. 11 of the band's singles have reached the number one position on \"Billboard\"'s Alternative Songs chart, the second-most for any artist.\nIn 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. \"Billboard\" ranked Linkin Park No.\u00a019 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. The band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. By the end of the 2000s, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts. In 2014, the band was declared as the \"Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\" by \"Kerrang!\". In 2015, \"Kerrang!\" gave \"In the End\" and \"Final Masquerade\" the top two positions on \"Kerrang!\"'s Rock 100 list.\nLinkin Park became the first rock band to achieve more than one billion YouTube views. Linkin Park's \"Numb\" is the third and \"In the End\" is the sixth \"timeless song\" on Spotify. The two songs make Linkin Park the only artist to have two timeless songs in the top ten.\n\"Hybrid Theory\" by the group was listed in the 2005 edition of the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\", It was also ranked at No. 11 on \"Billboard\"'s \"Hot 200 Albums of the Decade\". In addition the album was included in \"Best of 2001\" by \"Record Collector\", \"The top 150 Albums of the Generation\" by \"Rock Sound\" and \"50 Best Rock Albums of the 2000s\" by \"Kerrang!\". The album \"Meteora\" was included in \"Top 200 Albums of the Decade\" by \"Billboard\" at No. 36. The album sold 20 million copies worldwide. The collaborative EP \"Collision Course\" with Jay-Z became the second ever EP to top the \"Billboard\" 200, going on to sell over 300,000 copies in its first week after Alice in Chains' \"Jar of Flies\" in 1994. The album \"Minutes to Midnight\", in the United States, had the biggest first week sales of 2007 at the time, with 625,000 albums sold. In Canada, the album sold over 50,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart. Worldwide, the album shipped over 3.3 million copies in its first four weeks of release.\n\"The New York Times\"' Jon Caramanica commented Linkin Park \"brought the collision of hard rock and hip-hop to its commercial and aesthetic peak\" at the beginning of the 2000s. Several rock and non-rock artists have cited Linkin Park as an influence, including Of Mice &amp; Men, One OK Rock, Kutless, My Heart to Fear, Ill Ni\u00f1o, Bishop Nehru, From Ashes to New, Bring Me the Horizon, Spyair, Hardy, I Prevail, Crossfaith, AJ Tracey, the Chainsmokers, the Devil Wears Prada, Steve Aoki, Blackbear, Halsey, Amber Liu, Machine Gun Kelly, Billie Eilish, Starset, the Weeknd, and You Me at Six.\nOn August 20, 2020, their 20th anniversary, Linkin Park collaborated with virtual reality rhythm game \"Beat Saber\" to release 11 maps based on their songs.\nBand members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTimeline\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nConcert tours.\nHeadlining\nCo-headlining\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18650", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18650", "title": "Flipper (cricket)", "text": "Type of bowling delivery in cricket\nThe flipper is a particular bowling delivery used in cricket, generally by a leg spin bowler. In essence it is a back spin ball. Squeezed out of the front of the hand with the thumb and first and second fingers, it keeps deceptively low after pitching and can accordingly be very difficult to play. The flipper is comparable to a riseball in fast-pitch softball. \nWith backspin on the ball the Magnus effect results in air travelling over the top of the ball quickly and cleanly while air travelling under the ball is turbulent. The lift so produced causes the ball to drop slower and it travels further than a normal delivery. The slower descent also results in the ball bouncing lower.\nThe flipper is bowled on the opposite side from a slider, much in the same way that the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler 'pinches' or clicks the thumb and forefinger, causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart sufficient backspin. In doing so the flipper will float towards the batsman and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or will cause the ball to proceed with very little bounce, though this may be harder to achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or topspinners, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop like a normal overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on either to hit the stumps or result in leg before wicket.\nMuch of the effectiveness of the flipper is attributable to the \"pop\", that is, the extra pace and change in trajectory that is imparted to the ball when it is squeezed out of the bowler's hand.\nOccasionally, the term 'flipper' has been used to describe other types of deliveries. The Australian leg spinner Bob Holland employed a back spinning ball that he simply pushed backwards with the heel of his palm. Sometimes this form of front-hand flipper is called a \"zooter\". It is easier to bowl but not as effective as the amount of backspin is much less.\nBowlers of the flipper.\nIt was reputedly invented by the Australian leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett. Grimmett became so enamoured with the delivery that at times he bowled it almost as frequently as his stock leg break. The great Don Bradman once remarked to Grimmett that he must have forgotten how to bowl a leg break, as he bowled so many flippers. Bradman was bowled shortly thereafter at a memorial match by Grimmett who produced a perfectly pitched stock ball that turned just enough to remove Bradman's off bail. \"There y'are Don, I told you I could bowl a leg break\" was Grimmett's alleged response.\nThe flipper was perfected by Cowandilla-raised \"leg spinning magician\" and Wisden Cricketer of the year, Bruce Dooland, who taught it to Richie Benaud. \nThe flipper was the signature delivery of Anil Kumble of India and the Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne in his earlier years, until injury and later shoulder surgery restricted his ability to bowl flippers accurately. Like the googly, it may become more difficult to bowl as a bowler ages due to the flexibility and suppleness it demands from the bowler's wrist.\nIt is difficult to disguise the flipper entirely when bowling, as the hand action is distinctly different from a leg break. When Clarrie Grimmett first began bowling the delivery, batsmen would listen for the telltale clicking sound of his fingers; to compensate, Grimmett would often click the fingers of his non-bowling hand when \"not\" bowling the flipper to confuse the batsman.\nAbdul Qadir of Pakistan achieved great success with the flipper making it one of his signature deliveries, along with him Shane Warne was also arguably the leading exponent of the flipper in more recent times. Anil Kumble of India used the flipper well to his advantage. Brad Hogg of Australia has also used the flipper with great success in limited overs cricket.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Of tectonic origin and with an area of , it is the largest fresh water lake in Central America, the 19th largest lake in the world (by area) and the tenth largest in the Americas, slightly smaller than Lake Titicaca. With an elevation of above sea level, the lake reaches a depth of . The intermittent Tipitapa River feeds Lake Nicaragua when Lake Managua has high water. Lake Cocibolca is between two other bodies of water, on top is Lake Xolotl\u00e1n and below is the San Juan River. These body of waters complete the largest international drainage basin in Central America.\nThe lake drains via the San Juan River flowing east to the Caribbean Sea, historically making the city Granada on the northwest shore an Atlantic port, although Granada (as well as the entire lake) is closer to the Pacific Ocean geographically. The Pacific is near enough to be seen from the mountains of the largest island in the lake, Ometepe. The lake has a history of Caribbean pirates who assaulted Granada on three occasions. Before construction of the Panama Canal, a stagecoach line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company connected the lake with the Pacific across the low hills of the narrow Isthmus of Rivas. Plans were made to take advantage of this route to build an Interoceanic Canal, the Nicaragua Canal, but the Panama Canal was built instead. In order to quell competition with the Panama Canal, the U.S. secured all rights to a canal along this route in the Bryan\u2013Chamorro Treaty of 1916. However, since this treaty was mutually rescinded by the United States and Nicaragua in 1970, the idea of another canal in Nicaragua still periodically resurfaced, such as the Ecocanal proposal . In 2014, the government of Nicaragua offered a 50-year concession to the Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND) to build a canal across Nicaragua at a cost of US$40 billion, with construction expected to begin in December 2014 and complete in 2019. Protests against the ecological and social effects of the canal as well as questions about financing led to doubts about the project, and in the end construction never began.\nLake ecology.\nLake Nicaragua, despite being a freshwater lake, has sawfish, tarpon, and sharks. Initially, scientists thought the sharks in the lake were an endemic species, the Lake Nicaragua shark (\"Carcharhinus nicaraguensis\"). In 1961, following comparisons of specimens, it was synonymized with the widespread bull shark (\"C. leucas\"), a species also known for entering freshwater elsewhere around the world. It had been presumed that the sharks were trapped within the lake, but this was found to be incorrect in the late 1960s, when it was discovered that they were able to jump along the rapids of the San Juan River \u2014 which connects Lake Nicaragua with the Caribbean Sea \u2014 almost like salmon. As evidence of these movements, bull sharks tagged inside the lake have later been caught in the open ocean (and vice versa), with some taking as little as 7 days to complete the journey. Numerous other species of fish live in the lake, including at least 16 cichlids that are endemic to the general region. None of these are strictly endemic to Lake Nicaragua, although \"Amphilophus labiatus\" is native only to Lake Nicaragua and Lake Managua. A non-native cichlid, a tilapia, is used widely in aquaculture within the lake. Owing to the large amount of waste they produce, and the risk of introducing diseases to which the native fish species have no resistance, they are potentially a serious threat to the lake's ecosystem.\nThe nation's largest source of freshwater, Nicaraguans call it or (literally \"Sweet Sea\"; in Spanish, \"freshwater\" is ). The lake has sizeable waves driven by the easterly winds blowing west to the Pacific Ocean. The lake holds Ometepe and Zapatera, which are both volcanic islands, as well as the archipelago of the Solentiname Islands. The lake has a reputation for periodically powerful storms.\nIn the past 37 years, considerable concern has been expressed about the ecological condition of Lake Nicaragua. In 1981 the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) conducted an environmental assessment study and found that half of the water sources sampled were seriously polluted by sewage. It was found that 32 tons (70,000 pounds) of raw sewage were being released into Lake Nicaragua daily. Industry located along the lake's shore had been dumping effluent for an extended period of time. Pennwalt Chemical Corporation was found to be the worst polluter. Nicaragua's economic situation has hampered the building of treatment facilities nationwide (see: Water supply and sanitation in Nicaragua).\nThe country's worst drought in 32 years took its toll on the lake in 2014; the Nicaraguan government recommended citizens to raise and eat iguanas over chickens to reduce water consumption. Also, plans for the Nicaragua Canal through the lake could lead to saltwater and other contamination during construction and operation of the canal.\nTransport.\nThe lake was historically important for both passenger and freight shipping. During the California Gold Rush of the late 1840s a trip up the Rio San Juan, through the lake and then across the short overland stretch was one of the two preferred routes to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific (the other being the overland route through Panama) as overland travel through the continental United States prior to the construction of the transcontinental railroad was too dangerous. \nUntil the construction of Ometepe Airport the only way to reach the island was by boat. The archipelago of Solentiname is still only reachable by boat. Prior to the construction of a fully paved road to San Carlos (Rio San Juan) travel by boat from Granada via Ometepe to San Carlos was the fastest overland option to reach the Rio San Juan Department.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between employee, employer, and union.\nIndividual labour law concerns employees' rights at work also through the contract for work. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Employment standards are social norms (in some cases also technical standards) for the minimum socially acceptable conditions under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. Government agencies (such as the former US Employment Standards Administration) enforce labour law (legislature, regulatory, or judicial).\nHistory.\nFollowing the unification of the city-states in Assyria and Sumer by Sargon of Akkad into a single empire ruled from his home city circa 2334 BC, common Mesopotamian standards for length, area, volume, weight, and time used by artisan guilds in each city was promulgated by Naram-Sin of Akkad (c. 2254\u20132218 BC), Sargon's grandson, including for shekels. Code of Hammurabi Law 234 (c. 1755\u20131750 BC) stipulated a 2-shekel prevailing wage for each 60-gur (300-bushel) vessel constructed in an employment contract between a shipbuilder and a ship-owner.\nLaw 275 stipulated a ferry rate of 3-gerah per day on a charterparty between a ship charterer and a shipmaster. Law 276 stipulated a 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-gerah per day freight rate on a contract of affreightment between a charterer and shipmaster, while Law 277 stipulated a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20446-shekel per day freight rate for a 60-gur vessel.\nIn 1816, an archeological excavation in Minya, Egypt (under an Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire) produced a Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty-era tablet from the ruins of the Temple of Antinous in Antino\u00f6polis, Aegyptus that prescribed the rules and membership dues of a burial society \"collegium\" established in Lanuvium, Italia in approximately 133 AD during the reign of Hadrian (117\u2013138) of the Roman Empire.\nA \"collegium\" was any association in ancient Rome that acted as a legal entity. Following the passage of the \"Lex Julia\" during the reign of Julius Caesar as Consul and Dictator of the Roman Republic (49\u201344 BC), and their reaffirmation during the reign of Caesar Augustus as \"Princeps senatus\" and Imperator of the Roman Army (27 BC\u201314 AD), \"collegia\" required the approval of the Roman Senate or the Emperor in order to be authorized as legal bodies. Ruins at Lambaesis date the formation of burial societies among Roman Army soldiers and Roman Navy mariners to the reign of Septimius Severus (193\u2013211) in 198 AD.\nIn September 2011, archeological investigations done at the site of the artificial harbour Portus in Rome revealed inscriptions in a shipyard constructed during the reign of Trajan (98\u2013117) indicating the existence of a shipbuilders guild. Rome's La Ostia port was home to a guildhall for a \"corpus naviculariorum\", a \"collegium\" of merchant mariners. \"Collegium\" also included fraternities of Roman priests overseeing ritual sacrifices, practicing augury, keeping scriptures, arranging festivals, and maintaining specific religious cults.\nLabour law arose in parallel with the Industrial Revolution as the relationship between worker and employer changed from small-scale production studios to large-scale factories. Workers sought better conditions and the right to join a labour union, while employers sought a more predictable, flexible and less costly workforce. The state of labour law at any one time is therefore both the product of and a component of struggles between various social forces.\nAs England was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to face the often appalling consequences of the industrial revolution in a less regulated economic framework. Over the course of the late 18th and early to the mid-19th century the foundation for modern labour law was slowly laid, However, in the early days, there were some unequal aspects, such as the target being limited to women and children and not adult men, as some of the more egregious aspects, of working conditions were steadily ameliorated through legislation. This was largely achieved through the concerted pressure from social reformers, notably Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, and others.\nChild labour.\nA serious outbreak of fever in 1784 in cotton mills near Manchester drew widespread public opinion against the use of children in dangerous conditions. A local inquiry presided over by Dr Thomas Percival, was instituted by the justices of the peace for Lancashire, and the resulting report recommended the limitation of children's working hours. In 1802, the first major piece of labour legislation was passed \u2212 the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act. This was the first, albeit modest, step towards the protection of labour. The act limited working hours to twelve a day and abolished night work. It required the provision of a basic level of education for all apprentices, as well as adequate sleeping accommodation and clothing.\nThe rapid industrialisation of manufacturing at the turn of the 19th century led to a rapid increase in child employment, and public opinion was steadily made aware of the terrible conditions these children were forced to endure. The Cotton Mills and Factories Act 1819 was the outcome of the efforts of the industrialist Robert Owen and prohibited child labour under nine years of age and limited the working hours to twelve. A great milestone in labour law was reached with the Factories Act 1833, which limited the employment of children under eighteen years of age, prohibited all night work, and, crucially, provided for inspectors to enforce the law. Pivotal in the campaigning for and the securing of this legislation were Michael Sadler and the Earl of Shaftesbury. This act was an important step forward, in that it mandated skilled inspection of workplaces and rigorous enforcement of the law by an independent governmental body.\nA lengthy campaign to limit the working day to ten hours was led by Shaftesbury and included support from the Anglican Church. Many committees were formed in support of the cause and some previously established groups lent their support as well. The campaign finally led to the passage of the Factory Act 1847, which restricted the working hours of women and children in British factories to effectively 10 hours per day.\nWorking conditions.\nThese early efforts were principally aimed at limiting child labour. From the mid-19th century, attention was first paid to the plight of working conditions for the workforce in general. In 1850, systematic reporting of fatal accidents was made compulsory, and basic safeguards for health, life and limb in the mines were put in place from 1855. Further regulations, relating to ventilation, fencing of disused shafts, signalling standards, and proper gauges and valves for steam-boilers and related machinery were also set down.\nA series of further Acts, in 1860 and 1872 extended the legal provisions and strengthened safety provisions. The steady development of the coal industry, an increasing association among miners, and increased scientific knowledge paved the way for the Coal Mines Act of 1872, which extended the legislation to similar industries. The same Act included the first comprehensive code of regulation to govern legal safeguards for health, life and limb. The presence of more certified and competent management and increased levels of inspection were also provided for.\nBy the end of the century, a comprehensive set of regulations was in place in England that affected all industries. A similar system (with certain national differences) was implemented in other industrializing countries in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century.\nIndividual labour law.\nEmployment terms.\nThe basic feature of labour law in almost every country is that the rights and obligations of the worker and the employer are mediated through a contract of employment between the two. This has been the case since the collapse of feudalism. Many contract terms and conditions are covered by legislation or common law. In the US for example, the majority of state laws allow for employment to be \"at-will\", meaning the employer can terminate an employee from a position for any reason so long as the reason is not explicitly prohibited, and, conversely, an employee may quit at any time, for any reason (or for no reason), and is not required to give notice.\nA major issue for any business is to understand the relationship between the worker and the master. There are two types of workers, independent contractors and employees. They are differentiated based on the level of control the master has on them. Workers provided tools and resources, closely supervised, paid regularly, etc., are considered employees of the company. Employees must act in the best interest of the employer.\nOne example of employment terms in many countries is the duty to provide written particulars of employment with the (Latin for \"essential terms\") to an employee. This aims to allow the employee to know concretely what to expect and what is expected. It covers items including compensation, holiday and illness rights, notice in the event of dismissal and job description.\nThe contract is subject to various legal provisions. An employer may not legally offer a contract that pays the worker less than a minimum wage. An employee may not agree to a contract that allows an employer to dismiss them for illegal reasons.\nIntellectual property is the vital asset of the business, employees add value to the company by creating Intellectual Property. As per Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), Intellectual Property is personal property. Intellectual property is used as competitive advantage by big companies to protect themselves from rivalry. Given the conditions, if the worker is in the agent-principal relationship, he is the employee of the company, and if the employee's invention is in the scope of employment i.e. if the employee creates a new product or process to increase the productivity and create organizations' wealth by utilizing the resources of the company, then the Intellectual property solely belongs to the company. New business products or processes are protected under Patents.\nThere are differing opinions on what constitutes a patentable invention. One area of disagreement is with respect to software inventions, but there have been court cases that have established some precedents. For example, in the case \"Diamond v. Diehr\" the US Supreme Court decided that Diehr is patent- eligible because they improved the existing technological process, not because they were implemented on a computer.\nMinimum wage.\nMany jurisdictions define the minimum amount that a worker can be paid per hour. Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, the US, Vietnam, Germany (in 2015) and others have laws of this kind. The minimum wage is set usually higher than the lowest wage as determined by the forces of supply and demand in a free market and therefore acts as a price floor. Each country sets its own minimum wage laws and regulations, and while a majority of industrialized countries has a minimum wage, many developing countries do not.\nMinimum wages are regulated and stipulated in some countries that lack explicit laws. The US has explicit minimum wage laws, whereas other countries such as Sweden might lack explicit laws. In Sweden minimum wages are negotiated between the labour market parties (unions and employer organizations) through collective agreements that also cover non-union workers at workplaces with collective agreements.\nAt workplaces without collective agreements there exist no minimum wages. Non-organized employers can sign substitute agreements directly with trade unions but far from all do. The Swedish case illustrates that in countries without statutory regulation part of the labour market may not have regulated minimum wages, as self-regulation only applies to workplaces and employees covered by collective agreements (in Sweden about 90 per cent of employees).\nNational minimum wage laws were first introduced in the United States in 1938, Brazil in 1940 India in 1948, France in 1950 and in the UK in 1998. In the European Union, 18 out of 28 member states have national minimum wages as of 2011.\nLiving wage.\nThe living wage is higher than the minimum wage and is designed so that a full-time worker should be able to support themselves and a small family at that wage.\nHours.\nThe maximum number of hours worked per day or other time intervals are set by law in many countries. Such laws also control whether workers who work longer hours must be paid additional compensation.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, the workday varied between 11 and 14 hours. With the growth of industrialism and the introduction of machinery, longer hours became far more common, reaching as high as 16 hours per day. The eight-hour movement led to the first law on the length of a working day, passed in 1833 in England. It limited miners to 12 hours and children to 8 hours. The 10-hour day was established in 1848, and shorter hours with the same pay were gradually accepted thereafter. The 1802 Factory Act was the first labour law in the UK.\nGermany was the next European country to pass labour laws. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's main goal was to undermine the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1878, Bismarck instituted a variety of anti-socialist measures, but despite this, socialists continued gaining seats in the Reichstag. To appease the working class, he enacted a variety of paternalistic social reforms, which became the first type of social security.\nIn 1883, the Health Insurance Act was passed, which entitled workers to health insurance. The worker paid two-thirds and the employer one-third of the premiums. Accident insurance was provided in 1884, while old-age pensions and disability insurance followed in 1889. Other laws restricted the employment of women and children. These efforts, however, were not entirely successful; the working class largely remained unreconciled with Bismarck's conservative government.\nIn France, the first labour law was voted in 1841. It limited under-age miners' hours. In the Third Republic labour law was first effectively enforced, in particular after the Waldeck-Rousseau 1884 law legalising trade unions. With the Matignon Accords, the Popular Front (1936\u201338) enacted the laws mandating 12 days each year of paid vacations for workers and the law limiting the standard workweek to 40 hours.\nHealth and safety.\nOther labour laws involve safety concerning workers. The earliest English factory law was passed in 1802 and dealt with the safety and health of child labourers in textile mills.\nDiscrimination.\nSuch laws prohibit discrimination against employees, in particular racial discrimination or gender discrimination.\nDismissal.\nConvention no. 158 of the International Labour Organization states that an employee \"can't be fired without any legitimate motive\" and \"before offering him the possibility to defend himself\". Thus, on April 28, 2006, after the unofficial repeal of the French First Employment Contract, the Longjumeau (Essonne) \"conseil des prud'hommes\" (labour law court) judged the New Employment Contract contrary to international law and therefore \"illegitimate\" and \"without any juridical value\". The court considered that the two-years period of \"fire at will\" (without any legal motive) was \"unreasonable\", and contrary to convention.\nChild labour.\nChild labour was not seen as a problem throughout most of history, only disputed with the beginning of universal schooling and the concepts of labourers' and children's rights. Use of child labour was commonplace, often in factories. In England and Scotland in 1788, about two-thirds of persons working in water-powered textile factories were children. Child labour can be factory work, mining or quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents' business, operating a small business (such as selling food), or doing odd jobs.\nChildren work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants (where they may also work). Other children do jobs such as assembling boxes or polishing shoes. However, rather than in factories and sweatshops, most child labour in the twenty-first century occurs in the informal sector, \"selling on the street, at work in agriculture or hidden away in houses\u00a0\u2014 far from the reach of official inspectors and from media scrutiny.\"\nCollective labour law.\nCollective labour law concerns the relationship between employer, employee and trade unions. Trade unions (also \"labour unions\" in the US) are organizations which generally aim to promote the interests of their members. This law regulates the wages, benefits, and duties of the employees, and the dispute management between the company and the trade union. Such matters are often described in a collective labour agreement (CLA).\nTrade unions.\nTrade unions are organized groups of workers who engage in collective bargaining with employers. Some countries require unions or employers to follow particular procedures in pursuit of their goals. For example, some countries require that unions poll the membership to approve a strike or to approve using members' dues for political projects. Laws may govern the circumstances and procedures under which unions are formed. They may guarantee the right to join a union (banning employer discrimination) or remain silent in this respect. Some legal codes allow unions to obligate their members, such as the requirement to comply with a majority decision in a strike vote. Some restrict this, such as \"right to work\" legislation in parts of the United States.\nIn the different organization in the different countries trade union discuses with the employee on behalf of employer. At that time trade union discussed or talk with the manpower of the organization. At that time trade union perform his roles like a bridge between the employee and employer.\nWorkplace participation.\nA legally binding right for workers as a group to participate in workplace management is acknowledged in some form in most developed countries. In a majority of EU member states (for example, Germany, Sweden, and France), the workforce has a right to elect directors on the board of large corporations. This is usually called \"codetermination\" and currently most countries allow for the election of one-third of the board, though the workforce can have the right to elect anywhere from a single director, to just under a half in Germany. However, German company law uses a split board system, in which a \"supervisory board\" appoints an \"executive board\".\nUnder the Mitbestimmungsgesetz 1976, shareholders and employees elect the supervisory board in equal numbers, but the head of the supervisory board with a casting vote is a shareholder representative. The first statutes to introduce board-level codetermination were in Britain, however, most of these measures, except in universities, were removed in 1948 and 1979. The oldest surviving statute is found in the United States, in the Massachusetts Laws on manufacturing corporations, introduced in 1919, however, this was always voluntary.\nIn the United Kingdom, similar proposals were drawn up, and a command paper produced named the Bullock Report (Industrial Democracy) was released in 1977 by the James Callaghan Labour Party government. Unions would have directly elected half of the board. An \"independent\" element would also be added. However, the proposal was not enacted. The European Commission offered proposals for worker participation in the \"fifth company law directive\", which was also not implemented.\nIn Sweden, participation is regulated through the \"Law on board representation\". The law covers all private companies with 25 or more employees. In these companies, workers (usually through unions) have a right to appoint two board members and two substitutes. If the company has more than 1,000 employees, this rises to three members and three substitutes. It is common practice to allocate them among the major union coalitions.\nInformation and consultation.\nWorkplace statutes in many countries require that employers consult their workers on various issues.\nCollective action.\nStrike action is the worker tactic most associated with industrial disputes. In most countries, strikes are legal under a circumscribed set of conditions. Among them may be that:\nA boycott is a refusal to buy, sell, or otherwise trade with an individual or business. Other tactics include go-slow, sabotage, work-to-rule, sit-in or en-masse not reporting to work. Some labour law explicitly bans such activity, none explicitly allows it.\nPicketing is often used by workers during strikes. They may congregate near the business they are striking against to make their presence felt, increase worker participation and dissuade (or prevent) strike breakers from entering the workplace. In many countries, this activity is restricted by law, by more general law restricting demonstrations, or by injunctions on particular pickets.\nFor example, labour law may restrict secondary picketing (picketing a business connected with the company not directly with the dispute, such as a supplier), or flying pickets (mobile strikers who travel to join a picket). Laws may prohibit obstructing others from conducting lawful business; outlaw obstructive pickets allow court orders to restrict picketing locations or behaving in particular ways (shouting abuse, for example).\nInternational labour law.\nThe labour movement has long been concerned that economic globalization would weaken worker bargaining power, as their employers could hire workers abroad to avoid domestic labour standards. Karl Marx said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The extension of the principle of free trade, which induces between nations such a competition that the interest of the workman is liable to be lost sight of and sacrificed in the fierce international race between capitalists, demands that such organizations [unions] should be still further extended and made international.\nThe International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization have been a primary focus among international bodies for regulating labour markets. Conflicts arise when people work in more than one country. EU law has a growing body of workplace rules.\nInternational Labour Organization.\nFollowing World War I, the Treaty of Versailles contained the first constitution of a new International Labour Organization (ILO) founded on the principle that \"labour is not a commodity\", and for the reason that \"peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice\". ILO's primary role has been to coordinate international labour law by issuing Conventions. ILO members can voluntarily adopt and ratify the Conventions. For instance, the first Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919 required a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members, although the Working Time Directive adopts its principles, subject to individual opt-out. ILO's constitution comes from the 1944 Declaration of Philadelphia and under the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work classified eight conventions as core.\nThese require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions No. 87 and 98), abolition of forced labour (29 and 105), abolition of labour by children before the end of compulsory school (138 and 182), and no discrimination at work (No. 100 and 111). Member compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, relying on publicity to create pressure to reform. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or less frequent basis.\nBecause the ILO's enforcement mechanisms are weak, incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organization's (WTO) operation has been proposed. WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, contravening WTO rules as recognized by the dispute settlement procedures opens a country to retaliation through trade sanctions. This could include reinstatement of targeted tariffs against the offender.\nProponents have called for a \"social clause\" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example, by amending Article XX, which provides an exception that allows imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow comparable action where a WTO member state breaches ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could undermine labour rights, because industries, and therefore workforces could be harmed with no guarantee of reform. Furthermore, it was argued in the 1996 Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that \"the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question.\"\nSome countries want to take advantage of low wages and fewer rules as a comparative advantage to boost their economies. Another contested point is whether business moves production from high wage to low wage countries, given potential differences in worker productivity. Since GATT, most trade agreements have been bilateral. Some of these protect core labour standards. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations, some countries give preference to countries that respect core labour rights, for example under the EC Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.\nWork in multiple countries.\nConflicts of laws (or private international law) issues arise where workers work in multiple jurisdictions. If a US worker performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a \"peripatetic\" worker) an employer may seek to characterize the employment contract as governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a UK labour law case, \"Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd\" Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of Halliburton. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in Egypt. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK Employment Rights Act 1996 he would have a right to claim unfair dismissal, but the Act left open the question of the statute's territorial scope. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that an expatriate worker, would be subject to UK rules if the worker could show a \"close connection\" to the UK, which was found in Rabat's case.\nThis fits within the general framework in the EU. Under EU Rome I Regulation article 8, workers have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. They may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.\nIt is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the Brussels I Regulation article 19, this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought or is engaged there.\nEU law.\nThe European Union has extensive labour laws that officially exclude, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), the fairness of dismissals and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the Working Time Directive guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the Equality Framework Directive prohibits all forms of discrimination and the Collective Redundancies Directive requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place on decisions about economic dismissals.\nThe European Court of Justice has recently extended the Treaties provisions via case law. Trade unions have sought to organize across borders in the same way that multinational corporations have organized production globally. Unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. This coordination was challenged in the European Union in two controversial decisions. In \"Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union\" a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden. The local union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective bargaining agreement.\nUnder the Posted Workers Directive, article 3 lays down minimum standards for foreign workers so that workers receive at least the minimum rights that they would have in their home country in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) says that this \"shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers\". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g., in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that only the local state could raise standards beyond its minimum for foreign workers. Any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would infringe the business' freedom under TFEU article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the Rome I Regulation, which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards.\nIn \"The Rosella\", the ECJ held that a blockade by the International Transport Workers' Federation against a business that was using an Estonian flag of convenience (i.e., saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under TFEU article 49. The ECJ said that it recognized the workers' \"right to strike\" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment.\nNational labour laws.\nAustralia.\nThe Fair Work Act of 2009 provides the regulations governing Australian workplaces and employers. Australia has a minimum wage and workplace conditions overseen by the Fair Work Commission.\nCanada.\nIn Canadian law, \"labour law\" refers to matters connected with unionized workplaces, while \"employment law\" deals with non-unionized employees.\nIn 2017, Premier Brad Wall announced that Saskatchewan's government is to cut 3.5 per cent from its workers and officers' wages in 2018. This salary cut includes MLA ministers and the Premier's office staff along with all people employed by the government. Unpaid days off will also be implemented as well as limiting overtime to assist the wage cut.\nChina.\nIn China the basic labour laws are the \"Labour Law of People's Republic of China\" (1994) and the \"Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China\" (adopted at the 10th National People's Congress, effective 2008). The administrative regulations enacted by the State Council, the ministerial rules and the judicial explanations of the Supreme People's Court stipulate detailed rules concerning various aspects of employment. The government-controlled All China Federation of Trade Unions is the sole legal labour union. Strikes are formally legal, but in practice are discouraged.\nCzech Republic.\nIn Czech Republic, the relevant regulation is called the Labour Code (). The new labour code of the Czech Republic No.262/2006\u00a0Sb. effective from 1 January 2007, superseded the Code of 65/1965.\nFrance.\nIn France, the first labour laws were Waldeck Rousseau's laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the Popular Front enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid vacation for workers, and a law limited the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The Grenelle agreements negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise. The minimum wage was increased by 25%.\nIn 2000, Lionel Jospin's government enacted the 35-hour workweek, reduced from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister Dominique de Villepin enacted the New Employment Contract (CNE). Addressing the demands of employers asking for more flexibility in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it favoured contingent work. In 2006, he then attempted to pass the First Employment Contract (CPE) through a vote by emergency procedure, but that was met by students and unions' protests. President Jacques Chirac finally had no choice but to repeal it.\nPoland.\nIn Poland, the main act on the Labour Law is the Polish Labour Code from 1974. Since its introduction into the legal system the act is constantly being adapted and updated to the current reality of the labour market in Poland. The basic form of employment in Poland is an employment contract, which can be concluded for a probation period, a definite period of time or an indefinite period of time. The Polish Labour Code provides regulations on employee benefits, annual leave, termination of the employment contract, discrimination in the workplace, disciplinary liability and many other employment-related issues. Polish employment contracts can be terminated in many ways, e.g. in a disciplinary mode, by a termination with a notice period or by a mutual agreement of both parts.\nLabor law in Poland is closely related to the social insurance system, which is crucial for both employees and employers. According to Polish regulations, employers are obligated to register employees with ZUS (Social Insurance Institution) and to pay contributions for pension, disability, accident, sickness, and health insurance. These insurances provide workers with protection in case of illness, work-related accidents, and guarantee benefits for old age or in case of incapacity to work. Thanks to these regulations, employees can enjoy a wide range of social and economic rights, which are an important aspect of social and financial stability in the country.\nIndia.\nOver fifty national and many more state-level laws govern work in India. So for instance, a permanent worker can be terminated only for proven misconduct or habitual absence. In the Uttam Nakate case, the Bombay High Court held that dismissing an employee for repeated sleeping on the factory floor was illegal \u2013 the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of India two decades later. In 2008, the World Bank criticized the complexity, lack of modernization and flexibility in Indian regulations.\nIn the Constitution of India from 1950, articles 14\u201316, 19(1)(c), 23\u201324, 38, and 41-43A directly concern labour rights. Article 14 states everyone should be equal before the law, article 15 specifically says the state should not discriminate against citizens, and article 16 extends a right of \"equality of opportunity\" for employment or appointment under the state. Article 19(1)(c) gives everyone a specific right \"to form associations or unions\". Article 23 prohibits all trafficking and forced labour, while article 24 prohibits child labour under 14 years old in a factory, mine or \"any other hazardous employment\".\nArticles 38\u201339, and 41-43A, like all rights listed in Part IV of the Constitution are not enforceable by courts, rather than creating an aspirational \"duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws\".[3] The original justification for leaving such principles unenforceable by the courts was that democratically accountable institutions ought to be left with discretion, given the demands they could create on the state for funding from general taxation, although such views have since become controversial. Article 38(1) says that in general the state should \"strive to promote the welfare of the people\" with a \"social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of national life.\nArticle 38(2) says the state should \"minimise the inequalities in income\" and based on all other statuses. Article 41 creates a \"right to work\", which the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 attempts to put into practice. Article 42 requires the state to \"make provision for securing just and human conditions of work and for maternity relief\". Article 43 says workers should have the right to a living wage and \"conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life\". Article 43A, inserted by the Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1976,[4] creates a constitutional right to codetermination by requiring the state to legislate to \"secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings\". The recently released New Labour Codes 2022 mentions that organizations can convert 9-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts and provide three days of leave every week. The 4-day workweek policy will be effective from 1 July 2022.\nAlso read: Labour Reforms by Government of India Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment (https://labour.gov.in/labour-reforms )\nIndonesia.\nIndonesia essentially rebuilt its labour law system in the early 2000s following regime change and with support of the ILO. These three statutes constituted a new legislative framework for industrial relations:\n1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Law No. 21 of 2000 on Trade Unions, which allowed free unionization; and\n2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Law No. 13 of 2003 on Manpower, which legislated other minimum labour rights; and\n3. \u00a0 \u00a0 Law No. 2 of 2004 on Industrial Relations Disputes Settlement, established a new industrial relations dispute resolution system.\nIran.\nIran has not ratified the two basic Conventions of the International Labour Organization on freedom of association and collective bargaining and one abolishing child labour.\nLithuania.\nLithuania began the work of rewriting the employment laws in 1996 and the Labour Code () bill was completed in 2001. It was heavily inspired by the Hungarian, Czech as well Polish laws and incorporated the vast majority of the European Union regulations. The new labour code was formally enacted in 2002. Another major reform of the labour code was implemented in 2016, bringing more flexibility, yet balancing it with protection for employees. The Labour Code 2016 formally entered force on 1 July 2017.\nMexico.\nMexican labour law reflects the historic interrelation between the state and the Confederation of Mexican Workers. The confederation is officially aligned with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI). While the law promises workers the right to strike and to organize, in practice it is difficult or impossible for independent unions to organize.\nSingapore.\nSingapore has a \"minimum legal obligation\" rule which applies to employment contracts and in other fields of contracting, and limits damages payments for breach of contract. The rule applies in wrongful dismissal cases: generally, its effect would be to limit an employee's damages to the minimum notice period under which the employer could properly have dismissed the employee. Various \"general principles\" have been identified which apply to the summary dismissal of employees on grounds of misconduct.\nSouth Africa.\nSouth African labour law is regulated by the Department of Employment and Labour and is based on the Labour Relations Act (LRA) 66 of 1995, which regulates the relationship between and rights of employers, employees and trade unions. The LRA also gives effect to Section 23 of the Constitution. The LRA lays out the procedures for dispute resolution via the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and establishes the Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court as superior courts with exclusive jurisdiction to decide matters arising from the Act.\nThe Labour Relations Act also regulates the issue of fairness, not only in termination but during employment. In 1998, most of the laws on unfair labour practices were removed from the Labour Relations Act and placed into the newly formed Employment Equity Act (EEA). The EEA also deals with issues such as fairness regarding a worker's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status or disability, as well as the issue of affirmative action.\nPrior to 1995, an employee could be dismissed in terms of the contract of employment, which could permit any reason for dismissal. Since 1995, an employee may be dismissed only for misconduct, operational reasons and incapacity, given that procedural fairness is maintained. The Labour Relations Act 1995 is a pivotal piece of legislation, as it recognises the need for fast and easy access to justice in labour disputes. The Industrial Court had the status of a High Court, and therefore was not accessible to all labourers.\nThe Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA), the Health and Safety Act and the Skills Development Act, must be read with the EEA. The Skills Development Act provides that a small percentage of a labourer's salary must be contributed to the Department of Labour, enabling certain workshops to be run which are designed to develop skills.\nSweden.\nIn Sweden many workplace issues such as working hours, minimum wage and right to overtime compensation are regulated through collective bargaining agreements in accordance with the Swedish model of \"self-regulation\", i.e. regulation by the labour market parties themselves in contrast to \"state regulation\" (labour laws). A notable exception is the Employment Protection act which regulates employment contracts and extensive employees' rights to employment under certain conditions.\nSwitzerland.\nThe labour law of Switzerland covers all standards governing the employment of some kind. The regulation of the employment by private employers is largely harmonized at the federal level, while public-sector employment still prevails a variety of cantonal laws. In particular, the civil standardization is distributed to a variety of laws. Of greater importance, particularly the new Federal Constitution of 1999, the Code of Obligations, the Labour Code as well as in the public sector, the Federal Personnel Act.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Factory Acts (first one in 1802, then 1833) and the 1823 Master and Servant Act were the first laws regulating labour relations in the United Kingdom. Most employment law before 1960 was based upon contract law. Since then there has been a significant expansion primarily due to movements for equality and the legal requirements imposed by the UK's former membership of the European Union. UK employment law comes from Acts of Parliament, secondary legislation (made by a Secretary of State under an Act of Parliament), case law (developed by various courts), and retained Community law following the UK's departure from the EU.\nThe first significant expansion was the Equal Pay Act 1970, brought in to try to ensure pay equality for women in the workplace. Since 1997, changes in UK employment law include enhanced maternity and paternity rights, the introduction of a National Minimum Wage and the Working Time Regulations, which covers working time, rest breaks and the right to paid annual leave. Discrimination law has been tightened, with protection from discrimination now available on the grounds of age, religion or belief and sexual orientation as well as gender, race and disability.\nUnited States.\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 set the maximum standard work week to 44 hours. In 1950 this was reduced to 40 hours. A green card entitles immigrants to work, without requirement a separate work permit. Despite the 40-hour standard maximum work week, some lines of work require more than 40 hours. For example, farm workers may work over 72 hours a week, followed by at least 24 hours off. Exceptions to the break period exist for certain harvesting employees, such as those involved in harvesting grapes, tree fruits and cotton.\nProfessionals, clerical (administrative assistants), technical, and mechanical employees cannot be terminated for refusing to work more than 72 hours in a work week.\nThese ceilings, combined with a competitive job market, often motivate American workers to work more hours. American workers on average take the fewest days off of any developed country.\nThe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution limit the power of the federal and state governments to discriminate. The private sector is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but several laws, particularly the Civil Rights Act of 1964, limit the private sector discrimination against certain groups. The Fifth Amendment has an explicit requirement that the Federal Government not deprive individuals of \"life, liberty, or property\", without due process of law and an implicit guarantee that each person receive equal protection of the law.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment explicitly prohibits states from violating an individual's rights of due process and equal protection. Equal protection limits the State and Federal governments' power to discriminate in their employment practices by treating employees, former employees, or job applicants unequally because of membership in a group, like a race, religion or sex. Due process protection requires that employees have a fair procedural process before they are terminated if the termination is related to a \"liberty\", like the right to free speech, or a property interest.\nThe National Labor Relations Act, enacted in 1935 as part of the New Deal legislation, guarantees workers the right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.\nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older.\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination, prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labour organizations, training programmes and employment agencies based on race or colour, religion, sex and national origin. Retaliation is also prohibited by Title VII against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available to Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to jury trial.\nUSSR.\nThe Soviet Union codified labour codes with the KZoT ().\nHalakhah (Jewish religious law).\nThe beginnings of halakhic labour law are in the Bible, in which two commandments refer to this subject: the law against delayed wages (Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:14\u201315) and the worker's right to eat the employer's crops (Deut. 23:25\u201326). The Talmudic law\u2014in which labour law is called \"laws of worker hiring\"\u2014elaborates on many more aspects of employment relations, mainly in Tractate Baba Metzi'a. In some issues the Talamud, following the Tosefta, refers the parties to the customary law: \"All is as the custom of the region [postulates]\".\nModern halakhic labour law developed very slowly. Rabbi Israel Meir Hacohen (the Hafetz Hayim) interprets the worker's right for timely payment in a tendency that clearly favours the employee over the employer, but does not refer to new questions of employment relations. Only in the 1920s we find the first halakhic authority to tackle the questions of trade unions (that could easily be anchored in Talmudic law) and the right of strike (which is quite problematic in terms of Talmudic law).\nRabbis A.I Kook and B.M.H. Uziel tend to corporatist settling of labour conflicts, while Rabbi Moshe Feinstein adopts the liberal democratic collective bargaining model. Since the 1940s the halakhic literature on labour law was enriched by books and articles that referred to growing range of questions and basically adopted the liberal democratic approach.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18664", "revid": "1005449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18664", "title": "Louis Riel", "text": "M\u00e9tis leader in Canada (1844\u20131885)\nLouis Riel (; ; 22 October 1844 \u2013 16 November 1885) was a Canadian politician, a founder of the province of Manitoba, and a political leader of the M\u00e9tis people. He led two resistance movements against the Government of Canada and its first prime minister John A. Macdonald. Riel fought to defend M\u00e9tis rights and identity as the Northwest Territories came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence. \nThe first resistance movement led by Riel was the Red River Resistance of 1869\u20131870. The provisional government established by Riel ultimately negotiated the terms under which the new province of Manitoba entered the Canadian Confederation. However, while carrying out the resistance, Riel had a Canadian nationalist, Thomas Scott, executed. Riel soon fled to the United States to escape prosecution. He was elected three times as member of the House of Commons, but, fearing for his life, never took his seat. During these years in exile he came to believe that he was a divinely chosen leader and prophet. He married in 1881 while in exile in the Montana Territory.\nIn 1884 Riel was called upon by the M\u00e9tis leaders in Saskatchewan to help resolve longstanding grievances with the Canadian government. He returned to Canada and led an armed conflict with government forces: the North-West Rebellion of 1885. Defeated at the Battle of Batoche, Riel was imprisoned in Regina where he was convicted at trial of high treason. Despite protests, popular appeals and the jury's call for clemency, Riel was executed by hanging. Riel was seen as a heroic victim by French Canadians; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethno-religious lines. The M\u00e9tis were marginalized in the Prairie provinces by the increasingly English-dominated majority. A long-term effect of these actions was the bitter alienation felt by Francophones across Canada, and their anger against the repression by their countrymen.\nRiel's historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous religious fanatic and rebel opposed to the Canadian nation, and, by contrast, as a charismatic leader intent on defending his M\u00e9tis people from the unfair encroachments by the federal government eager to give Orangemen-dominated Ontario settlers priority access to land. Riel has received among the most formal organizational and academic scrutiny of any figure in Canadian history.\nEarly life.\nThe Red River Settlement was a Rupert's Land territory administered by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). At the mid-19th-century the settlement was largely inhabited by M\u00e9tis people of mixed First Nations-European descent. Their ancestors were for the most part Scottish and English men married to Cree women, and French-Canadian men married to Saulteaux (plains Ojibwe) women.\nLouis Riel was born in 1844 in his grandparents' small one-room home in St-Boniface near the fork of the Red and Seine rivers. Riel was the eldest of eleven children in a locally well-respected family. His father, who was of Franco-Chipewyan M\u00e9tis descent, had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported Guillaume Sayer, a M\u00e9tis arrested and tried for challenging the HBC's historical trade monopoly. Sayer's eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.'s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore well known in the Red River area. His mother was the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodi\u00e8re and Marie-Anne Gaboury, one of the earliest White families to settle in Red River in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.\nRiel began his schooling at the age of seven, and by age ten he attended St.\u00a0Boniface Catholic schools, including eventually a school run by the French Christian Brothers. At age thirteen he came to the attention of Bishop Alexandre Tach\u00e9, who was eagerly promoting the priesthood for talented young M\u00e9tis. In 1858 Tach\u00e9 arranged for Riel to attend the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al. Descriptions of him at the time indicate that he was a fine scholar of languages, science, and philosophy. While a good student, he was also hot-tempered, extreme in his views, intolerant of criticism and opposition, and not opposed to arguing with his teachers.\nFollowing news of his father's premature death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time, he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave, following breaches of discipline. During Riel's period of mourning of his father, he believed that Louis Riel was dead and he himself was David Mordecai, a Jew from Marseilles, and as David, he was not eligible to the immense inheritance of his father (which, in fact, was of little value). Seized with religious fervour, he announced that he was going to form a new religious movement. He remained in Montreal for over a year, living at the home of his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie-Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fianc\u00e9e's family opposed her involvement with a M\u00e9tis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant and, by early 1866, he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in Chicago, while staying with poet Louis-Honor\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine, and that he was briefly employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River settlement on 26 July 1868.\nRed River Resistance.\nThe majority population of the Red River had historically been M\u00e9tis and First Nations people. Upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of Anglophone Protestant settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada had not addressed the political terms of transfer. Bishop Tach\u00e9 and the HBC governor William Mactavish both warned the Macdonald government that the lack of consultation and consideration of M\u00e9tis views would precipitate unrest. Finally, the Canadian minister of public works, William McDougall, ordered a survey of the area. The arrival of a survey party on 20 August 1869 increased anxiety among the M\u00e9tis as the survey was being carried out as a grid system of townships (an American system) that cut across existing M\u00e9tis river lots.\nIn late August, Riel denounced the survey in a speech, and on 11 October 1869, the survey's work was disrupted by a group of M\u00e9tis that included Riel. This group organized itself as the \"National Committee of the M\u00e9tis\" on 16 October, with Riel as secretary and John Bruce as president. When summoned by the HBC-controlled Council of Assiniboia to explain his actions, Riel declared that any attempt by Canada to assume authority would be contested unless Ottawa had first negotiated terms with the M\u00e9tis. Nevertheless, the non-bilingual McDougall was appointed the lieutenant governor-designate, and attempted to enter the settlement on 2 November. McDougall's party was turned back near the Canada\u2013US border, and on the same day, M\u00e9tis led by Riel seized Fort Garry.\nOn 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones to attend a convention alongside M\u00e9tis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded as a condition of union. Much of the settlement came to accept the M\u00e9tis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his home and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.\nProvisional government.\nHearing of the unrest, Ottawa sent three emissaries to the Red River, including HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith. While they were en route, the M\u00e9tis National Committee declared a provisional government on 8 December, with Riel becoming its president on 27 December.\nMeetings between Riel and the Ottawa delegation took place on 5 and 6 January 1870. When these proved fruitless, Smith chose to present his case in a public forum. After large meetings on 19 and 20 January, Riel suggested the formation of a new convention split evenly between Francophone and Anglophone settlers to consider Smith's proposals. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis. The provisional government established by Riel published its own newspaper titled \"New Nation\" and established the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia to pass laws. The Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia was the first elected government at the Red River Settlement and functioned from 9 March to 24 June 1870. The assembly had 28 elected representatives, including a president, Riel, an executive council (government cabinet), adjutant general (chief of military staff), chief justice and clerk.\nThomas Scott's execution.\nDespite the progress on the political front, the Canadian party continued to plot against the provisional government. They attempted to recruit supporters to overthrow Riel. However, they suffered a setback on 17 February, when forty-eight men, including Boulton and Thomas Scott, were arrested near Fort Garry.\nBoulton was tried by a tribunal headed by Ambroise-Dydime L\u00e9pine and sentenced to death for his interference with the provisional government. He was pardoned, but Scott interpreted this as weakness by the M\u00e9tis, whom he regarded with open contempt. After Scott repeatedly quarrelled with his guards, they insisted that he be tried for insubordination. At his court martial he was found guilty and was sentenced to death. Riel was repeatedly entreated to commute the sentence, but responded, \"I have done three good things since I have commenced: I have spared Boulton's life at your insistance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott.\"\nScott was soon executed by a M\u00e9tis firing squad on 4 March. Riel's motivations have been the cause of much speculation, but his justification was that he felt it necessary to demonstrate to the Canadians that the M\u00e9tis must be taken seriously. Protestant Canada did take notice, swore revenge, and set up a \"Canada First\" movement to mobilize their anger. Riel biographer Lewis H. Thomas noted that \"as people then and later have said, it was Riel's one great political blunder\".\nCreation of Manitoba and the Wolseley expedition.\nThe delegates representing the provisional government arrived in Ottawa in April. Although they initially met with legal difficulties arising from the execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-\u00c9tienne Cartier. The parties agreed on several of the demands in the list of rights, including language, religious, and land rights (excepting ownership of public lands). This agreement formed the basis for the Manitoba Act, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation; the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia unanimously supported joining. However, the negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for the provisional government; Cartier held that this was a question for the British government.\nAs a means of exercising Canadian authority in the settlement and dissuading American expansionists, a Canadian military expedition under Colonel Garnet Wolseley was dispatched to the Red River. Although the government described it as an \"errand of peace\", Riel learned that Canadian militia elements in the expedition meant to lynch him.\nIntervening years.\nAmnesty question.\nIt was not until 2 September 1870 that the new Lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the establishment of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia threatening his life, Riel fled to the safety of the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada\u2013US border in the Dakota Territory. The results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness\u2014perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions\u2014that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871.\nThe settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald issued a call to arms in October, and assured Riel that if he participated he would not be arrested. Riel organized several companies of M\u00e9tis troops for the defence of Manitoba. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signalling that a rapprochement had been effected.\nWhen this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec\u2013Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Tach\u00e9 to offer Riel a bribe of C$1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional \u00a3600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.\nNevertheless, by late June, Riel was back in Manitoba and was soon persuaded to run as a Member of Parliament in the riding of Provencher. However, following the early September defeat of George-\u00c9tienne Cartier in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier \u2014 on record as being in favour of amnesty for Riel \u2014 might secure a seat in Provencher. While Cartier won by acclamation, Riel's hopes for a swift resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier's death on 20 May 1873. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed as an Independent, although he had fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. Meanwhile L\u00e9pine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial.\nRiel made his way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether or not he should attempt to take up his seat in the House of Commons\u2014Edward Blake, the Premier of Ontario, had announced a bounty of $5,000 for his capture. Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great Pacific Scandal debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the prime minister. In the 1874 Canadian federal election, his party received a majority of seats in the House of Commons and he formed a government. Riel ran in Provencher and was easily re-elected. To take his seat, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had been elected the MP for the riding of Lisgar. \nRiel ran as a candidate again in the resulting by-election and won again. He was again expelled from the House of Commons.\nExile and mental illness.\nDuring this period, Riel had been staying with the Oblate fathers in Plattsburgh, New York, who introduced him to parish priest Fabien Martin \"dit\" Barnab\u00e9 in the nearby village of Keeseville. It was here that he received news of L\u00e9pine's fate: following his trial for the murder of Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, L\u00e9pine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both L\u00e9pine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the Governor General Lord Dufferin commuted L\u00e9pine's sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.\nDuring his time of exile, Riel was primarily concerned with religion rather than politics. Much of these emerging religious beliefs were based on a supportive letter dated 14 July 1875 that he received from Montreal's Bishop Ignace Bourget. His mental state deteriorated, and following a violent outburst he was taken to Montreal, where he was under the care of his uncle, John Lee, for a few months. But after Riel disrupted a religious service, Lee arranged to have him committed in an asylum in Longue-Pointe on 6 March 1876 under the assumed name \"Louis R. David\". Fearing discovery, his doctors soon transferred him to the Beauport Asylum near Quebec City under the name \"Louis Larochelle\". While he suffered from sporadic irrational outbursts, he continued his religious writing, composing theological tracts with an admixture of Christian and Judaic ideas. He consequently began calling himself \"Louis David Riel, Prophet, Infallible Pontiff and Priest King\".\nNevertheless, he slowly recovered, and was released from the asylum on 23 January 1878 with an admonition to lead a quiet life. He returned for a time to Keeseville, where he became involved in a passionate romance with Evelina Martin \"dite\" Barnab\u00e9, sister of Father Fabien. He asked her to marry him before moving west \"with the avowed intention of establishing himself\" before sending for her; however, their correspondence ended abruptly.\nMontana and family life.\nIn the fall of 1878, Riel returned to St. Paul, and briefly visited his friends and family. The Red River M\u00e9tis were encountering changing conditions\u2014the bison on which they depended were becoming scarce, the influx of settlers was ever-increasing, and unscrupulous land speculators were controlling more and more of the land. Like many other Red River M\u00e9tis, Riel left to start a new life elsewhere. Travelling to the Montana Territory, he became a trader and interpreter in the area surrounding Fort Benton. Seeing the detrimental impact of alcohol on M\u00e9tis and First Nations, he tried to curtail the whisky trade.\nIn Pointe-au-Loup, Fort Berthold, Dakota Territory in 1881, he married the young M\u00e9tis Marguerite Monet \"dite\" Bellehumeur, according to the custom of the country (\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on du pays), on 28 April, the marriage being solemnized on 9 March 1882. Evelina learned of this marriage from a newspaper and wrote a letter accusing Riel of \"infamy\". Marguerite and Louis were to have three children: Jean-Louis (1882\u20131908); Marie-Ang\u00e9lique (1883\u20131897); and a boy who was born and died on 21 October 1885, less than one month before Riel was hanged.\nRiel soon became involved in the politics of Montana, and in 1882, actively campaigned on behalf of the Republican Party. He brought a suit against a Democrat for rigging a vote, but was then himself accused of fraudulently inducing British subjects to take part in the election. In response, Riel applied for United States citizenship and was naturalized on 16 March 1883. With two young children, he had by 1884 settled down and was teaching school at the St. Peter's Jesuit mission in the Sun River district of Montana.\nNorth-West Rebellion.\nFollowing the Red River Resistance, M\u00e9tis travelled west and settled in the Saskatchewan Valley. But by the 1880s, the rapid collapse of the buffalo herd was causing near starvation among the First Nations. This was exacerbated by a reduction in government assistance, and by a general failure of Ottawa to live up to its treaty obligations. The M\u00e9tis were likewise obliged to give up the hunt and take up agriculture\u2014but this transition was accompanied by complex issues surrounding land claims similar to those that had previously arisen in Manitoba. Moreover, settlers from Europe and the eastern provinces were also moving into the Saskatchewan territories, and they too had complaints related to the administration of the territories. Virtually all parties therefore had grievances, and by 1884 Anglophone settlers, Anglo-M\u00e9tis and M\u00e9tis communities were holding meetings and petitioning a largely unresponsive government for redress.\nIn the electoral district of Lorne, a meeting of the south branch M\u00e9tis was held in the village of Batoche on 24 March, and representatives voted to ask Riel to return and represent their cause. On 6 May a joint \"Settler's Union\" meeting was attended by both the M\u00e9tis and English-speaking representatives from Prince Albert, including William Henry Jackson, an Ontario settler sympathetic to the M\u00e9tis and known to them as Honor\u00e9 Jackson, and James Isbister of the Anglo-M\u00e9tis. It was here resolved to send a delegation to ask Riel to return.\nReturn of Riel.\nThe head of the delegation to Riel was Gabriel Dumont, a respected buffalo hunter and leader of the Saint-Laurent M\u00e9tis who had known Riel in Manitoba. James Isbister was the lone Anglo-M\u00e9tis delegate. Riel was easily swayed to support their cause. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba.\nUpon his arrival M\u00e9tis and Anglophone settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints, and subsequently held meetings with Riel. However, the Native grievances were quite different from those of the settlers, and nothing was resolved.\nHonor\u00e9 Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition to be sent to Ottawa. In the interim, Riel's support began to waver. As Riel's religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical, the clergy distanced themselves, and father Alexis Andr\u00e9 cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. In response to bribes by territorial lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner Edgar Dewdney, local English-language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of Riel.\nNevertheless, Riel's campaign for better treatment continued, and on 16 December Riel forwarded the committee's petition to the government, along with the suggestion that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiation. Receipt of the petition was acknowledged by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Macdonald's Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it. By then many original followers had left; only 250 remained at Batoche when it fell in May 1885.\nWhile Riel awaited response from Ottawa he considered returning to Montana, but had by February resolved to stay. Without a productive course of action, Riel began to engage in obsessive prayer, and was experiencing a significant relapse of his mental agitations. He publicly espoused an increasingly heretical doctrine, causing a deterioration in his relationship with the Catholic clergy.\nOn 11 February 1885, the M\u00e9tis received a response to their petition. The government proposed to take a census of the North-West Territories, and to form a commission to investigate grievances. This angered a faction of the M\u00e9tis who saw it as a mere delaying tactic; they favoured taking up arms at once. Riel became the leader of this faction, but he lost the support of almost all Anglophones and Anglo-M\u00e9tis, and the Catholic Church. He also lost the support of the M\u00e9tis faction supporting local leader Charles Nolin. But Riel, undoubtedly influenced by his messianic delusions, became increasingly supportive of this course of action. Disenchanted with the status quo, and swayed by Riel's charisma and eloquent rhetoric, hundreds of M\u00e9tis remained loyal to Riel, despite his proclamations that Bishop Ignace Bourget should be accepted as pope, and that \"Rome has fallen\".\nOpen rebellion.\nThe Provisional Government of Saskatchewan was declared at Batoche on 19 March. Riel was the political and spiritual leader and Dumont assumed responsibility for military affairs. Riel formed a council called the Exovedate (a neologism meaning \"those who picked from the flock\"). On 21 March, Riel's emissaries demanded that Crozier surrender Fort Carlton. Scouting near Duck Lake on 26 March, a force led by Gabriel Dumont unexpectedly chanced upon a party from Fort Carlton. In the ensuing Battle of Duck Lake, the police were routed and the North-West Rebellion was begun in earnest.\nThe near-completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway allowed troops from eastern Canada to quickly arrive in the territory. Knowing that he could not defeat the Canadians in direct confrontation, Dumont had hoped to force the Canadians to negotiate by engaging in a sustained campaign of guerrilla warfare; Dumont realized a modest success along these lines at the Battle of Fish Creek on 24 April 1885. \nRiel, however, insisted on concentrating forces at Batoche to defend his \"city of God\". The outcome of the ensuing Battle of Batoche which took place from 9 to 12 May was never in doubt, and on 15 May a disheveled Riel surrendered to Canadian forces. Although Big Bear's forces managed to hold out until the Battle of Loon Lake on 3 June, the Rebellion was a dismal failure for Indigenous communities.\nTrial.\nSeveral individuals closely tied to the government requested that the trial be held in Winnipeg in July 1885. Some historians contend that the trial was moved to Regina because of concerns with the possibility of an ethnically mixed and sympathetic jury. Prime Minister Macdonald ordered the trial to be convened in Regina, where Riel was tried before a jury of six Anglophone Protestants. The trial began on 20 July 1885.\nRiel delivered two long speeches during his trial, defending his own actions and affirming the rights of the M\u00e9tis people. He rejected his lawyers' attempt to argue that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. The jury found him guilty but recommended mercy; nonetheless, Judge Hugh Richardson sentenced him to death on 1 August 1885, with the date of his execution initially set for 18 September 1885. \"We tried Riel for treason,\" one juror later said, \"And he was hanged for the murder of Scott.\" Lewis Thomas notes that \"the government's conduct of the case was to be a travesty of justice\".\nExecution.\nBoulton wrote in his memoirs that, as the date of his execution approached, Riel regretted his opposition to the defence of insanity and vainly attempted to provide evidence that he was not sane. Requests for a retrial, petitions for a commuted sentence, and an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain were denied. John A. Macdonald, who was instrumental in upholding Riel's sentence, is reported to have said \"He shall hang though every dog in Quebec bark in his favour\" (although the veracity of this quote is uncertain).\nBefore his execution, Riel received Father Andr\u00e9 as his spiritual advisor. He was also given writing materials and allowed to correspond with friends and relatives. He was hanged for treason on 16 November 1885 at the North-West Mounted Police barracks in Regina.\nBoulton writes of Riel's final moments:\n P\u00e8re Andr\u00e9, after explaining to Riel that the end was at hand, asked him if he was at peace with men. Riel answered \"Yes.\" The next question was, \"Do you forgive all your enemies?\" \"Yes.\" Riel then asked him if he might speak. Father Andr\u00e9 advised him not to do so. He then received the kiss of peace from both the priests, and Father Andr\u00e9 exclaimed in French, \"\" meaning \"So, go to heaven!\"\n\u00a0... [Riel's] last words were to say good-bye to Dr. Jukes and thank him for his kindness, and just before the white cap was pulled over his face he said, \"\" meaning \"Thank Mrs. Forget\".\nThe cap was pulled down, and while he was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not instantaneous. Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope around his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was accordingly done that night.\nFollowing the execution, Riel's body was returned to his mother's home in St. Vital, where it lay in state. On 12 December 1886, his remains were interred in the churchyard of the Saint-Boniface Cathedral following the celebration of a requiem mass.\nThe trial and execution of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The execution was both supported and opposed by the provinces. For example, conservative Ontario strongly supported Riel's execution, but Quebec was vehemently opposed to it. Francophones were upset Riel was hanged because they thought his execution was a symbol of Anglophone dominance of Canada. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. In Quebec, the politician Honor\u00e9 Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.\nHistoriography.\nHistorians have debated the Riel case so often and so passionately that he is the most written-about person in Canadian history. Interpretations have varied dramatically over time. The first amateur English language histories hailed the triumph of civilization, represented by English-speaking Protestants, over savagery represented by the half-breed M\u00e9tis who were Catholic and spoke French. Riel was portrayed as an insane traitor and an obstacle to the expansion of Canada to the West.\nBy the mid-20th century academic historians had dropped the theme of savagery versus civilization, deemphasized the M\u00e9tis, and focused on Riel, presenting his execution as a major cause of the bitter division in Canada along ethnocultural and geographical lines of religion and language. W. L. Morton says of the execution that it \"convulsed the course of national politics for the next decade\": it was well received in Ontario, particularly among Orangemen, but francophone Quebec defended Riel as \"the symbol, indeed as a hero of his race\". Morton concluded that some of Riel's positions were defensible, but that \"they did not present a program of practical substance which the government might have granted without betrayal of its responsibilities\". J. M. Bumsted in 2000 said that for Manitoba historian James Jackson, the shooting of Scott\u2014\"perhaps the result of Riel's incipient madness\u2014was the great blemish on Riel's achievement, depriving him of his proper role as the father of Manitoba.\"\nThe Catholic clergy had originally supported the M\u00e9tis, but reversed themselves when they realized that Riel was leading a heretical movement. They made sure that he was not honoured as a martyr. However the clergy lost their influence during the Quiet Revolution, and activists in Quebec found in Riel the perfect hero, with the image now of a freedom fighter who stood up for his people against an oppressive government in the face of widespread racist bigotry. He was made a folk hero by M\u00e9tis, French Canadian and other Canadian minorities. Activists who espoused violence embraced his image; in the 1960s, the Quebec terrorist group, the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec adopted the name \"Louis Riel\" for one of its terrorist cells.\nAcross Canada there emerged a new interpretation of reality in his rebellion, holding that the M\u00e9tis had major unresolved grievances; that the government was indeed unresponsive; that Riel had chosen violence only as a last resort; and he was given a questionable trial, then executed by a vengeful government. John Foster said in 1985 that \"the interpretive drift of the last half-century ... has witnessed increasingly shrill though frequently uncritical condemnations of Canadian government culpability and equally uncritical identification with the \"victimization\" of the \"innocent\" M\u00e9tis\". However, political scientist Thomas Flanagan reversed his views after editing Riel's writings: he argued that \"the M\u00e9tis grievances were at least partly of their own making\", that Riel's violent approach was unnecessary given the government's response to his initial \"constitutional agitation\", and \"that he received a surprisingly fair trial\".\nAn article by Doug Owram appearing in the \"Canadian Historical Review\" in 1982 found that Riel had become \"a Canadian folk hero\", even \"mythical\", in English Canada, corresponding with the designation of Batoche as a national historic site and the compilation of his writings. That compilation consisted of three volumes of letters, diaries, and other prose writings; a fourth volume of his poetry; and a fifth volume which contained reference materials. Edited by George Stanley, Raymond Huel, Gilles Martel, Thomas Flanagan and Glen Campbell, this work \"ma[de] it possible to think comprehensively about Riel's life and his achievements\", but was also criticized for some of its editorial decisions. In a 2010 speech, Beverley McLachlin, then Chief Justice of Canada, summed up Riel as being a rebel by the standards of the time but a patriot \"viewed through our modern lens\".\nLegacy.\nThe Saskatchewan M\u00e9tis' requested land grants were all provided by the government by the end of 1887, and the government resurveyed the M\u00e9tis river lots in accordance with their wishes. However, much of the land was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realized\u2014following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalization in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The M\u00e9tis themselves were increasingly forced to live in shantytowns on undesirable land. Saskatchewan did not become a province until 1905.\nRiel's execution and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec. Honor\u00e9 Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics (particularly in Quebec) by the Liberal party in the 20th century.\nSince the 1980s, numerous federal politicians have introduced private member's bills seeking to pardon Riel or recognize him as a Father of Confederation. In 1992, the House of Commons passed a resolution recognizing \"the unique and historic role of Louis Riel as a founder of Manitoba and his contribution in the development of Confederation\". The CBC's \"Greatest Canadian\" project ranked Riel as the 11th \"Greatest Canadian\" on the basis of a public vote.\nOn 19 February 2024, Riel was formally recognized as Manitoba's first premier by virtue of \"The Louis Riel Act\".\nCommemorations.\nIn 2007, Manitoba's provincial government voted to recognize Louis Riel Day as a provincial holiday, observed on the third Monday of February.\nTwo statues of Riel are located in Winnipeg. One of these statues, the work of architect \u00c9tienne Gaboury and sculptor Marcien Lemay, depicts Riel as a naked and tortured figure. It was unveiled in 1971 and stood in the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the M\u00e9tis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Universit\u00e9 de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced with a statue of Riel designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 12 May 1996, in Winnipeg. A statue of Riel on the grounds of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Regina was installed and later removed for similar reasons.\nIn numerous communities across Canada, Riel is commemorated in the names of streets, schools, neighbourhoods, and other buildings. Examples in Winnipeg include the landmark Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge linking old Saint-Boniface with Downtown Winnipeg, and the Louis Riel School Division. The student centre at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon is named after Riel, as is the Louis Riel Trail. There are schools named after Riel in four major Canadian cities: Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa and Winnipeg.\nPortrayals of Riel's role in the Red River Resistance include the 1979 CBC television film \"Riel\" and Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown's acclaimed 2003 graphic novel \"Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography\". An opera about Riel entitled \"Louis Riel\" was commissioned for Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967; it was written by Harry Somers, with an English and French libretto by Mavor Moore and Jacques Languirand.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Named after Joseph Lister, who pioneered antiseptic surgery at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary in United Kingdom, Listerine was developed in 1879 by Joseph Lawrence, a chemist in St. Louis, Missouri.\nOriginally marketed by the Lambert Pharmacal Company (which later became Warner\u2013Lambert), Listerine has been manufactured and distributed by Johnson &amp; Johnson since that company's acquisition of Pfizer's consumer healthcare division on December 20, 2006.\nThe Listerine brand name is also used in toothpaste, chewable tablets, and self-dissolving teeth-whitening strips.\nHistory.\nInspired by Louis Pasteur's ideas on microbial infection, the English doctor Joseph Lister demonstrated in 1865 that use of carbolic acid on surgical dressings would significantly reduce rates of post-surgical infection. Lister's work in turn inspired St. Louis-based doctor Joseph Lawrence to develop an alcohol-based formula for a surgical antiseptic which included eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol (its exact composition was a trade secret). Lawrence named his antiseptic \"Listerine\" in honor of Lister.\nLawrence hoped to promote Listerine's use as a general germicide as well as a surgical antiseptic, and licensed his formula to a local pharmacist named Jordan Wheat Lambert in 1881. Lambert subsequently started the Lambert Pharmacal Company, marketing Listerine. Listerine was promoted to dentists for oral care in 1895 and was the first over-the-counter mouthwash sold in the United States, in 1914.\nLambert's licensing agreement with Lawrence required that he and his \"heirs, executors and assigns\" be paid royalties by Lambert or its successors for each bottle sold in perpetuity, until such time that Lambert or its successors ceases manufacturing Listerine. Most of these royalty shares are held by Lawrence's heirs. Real estate broker John Reynolds bought a roughly 50% stake in the royalties in the 1950s, which he then transferred to the Archdiocese of New York, and was later resold to other parties to help fund the diocese. The Salvation Army, American Bible Society, and Wellesley College also held shares in Listerine royalties.\nListerine entered common household use after Jordan Wheat Lambert's son Gerard Lambert joined the company and promoted an aggressive marketing campaign. According to Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner's book \"Freakonomics\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Listerine, for instance, was invented in the nineteenth century as powerful surgical antiseptic. It was later sold, in distilled form, as both a floor cleaner and a cure for gonorrhea. But it wasn't a runaway success until the 1920s, when it was pitched as a solution for \"chronic halitosis\"\u2014a then obscure medical term for bad breath. Listerine's new ads featured forlorn young women and men, eager for marriage but turned off by their mate's rotten breath. \"Can I be happy with him in spite of \"that\"?\" one maiden asked herself. Until that time, bad breath was not conventionally considered such a catastrophe. But Listerine changed that. As the advertising scholar James B. Twitchell writes, \"Listerine did not make mouthwash as much as it made halitosis.\" In just seven years, the company's revenues rose from $115,000 to more than $8\u00a0million.\nIn 1955, Lambert Pharmacal merged with New York\u2013based Warner-Hudnut and became Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company, and incorporated in Delaware with its corporate headquarters in Morris Plains, New Jersey. Following the merger, Warner-Lambert attempted to back out of the aforementioned royalty agreements with Lawrence by filing a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The company cited that the payments were based upon Listerine's formula having initially been a trade secret, but that since the formula had been published in 1931, the property no longer had a value, and that the indefinite agreement was legally unreasonable. The court, however, ruled in favor of Lawrence and the defendants, citing that the conditions were plainly-worded, implicit, and could be waived by ending production of the product.\nIn 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert. Among Lambert's assets was the original land for Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.From 1921 until the mid-1970s, Listerine was also marketed as preventive and remedy for colds and sore throats. In 1976, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that these claims were misleading, and that Listerine had \"no efficacy\" at either preventing or alleviating the symptoms of sore throats and colds. Warner-Lambert was ordered to stop making the claims, and to include in the next $10.2\u00a0million worth of Listerine ads specific mention that \"Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity.\" The advertisement run by Listerine added the preamble \"contrary to prior advertising\".\nFor a short time, beginning in 1927, the Lambert Pharmaceutical Company marketed Listerine Cigarettes.\nFrom the 1930s into the 1950s, advertisements claimed that applying Listerine to the scalp could prevent \"infectious dandruff\".\nListerine was packaged in a glass bottle inside a corrugated cardboard tube for nearly 80 years before the first revamps were made to the brand: in 1992, Cool Mint Listerine was introduced in addition to the original Listerine Antiseptic formula and, in 1994, both brands were introduced in plastic bottles for the first time. In 1995, FreshBurst was added, then in 2003 Natural Citrus. In 2006 a new addition to the \"less intense\" variety, Vanilla Mint, was released. Nine different kinds of Listerine are on the market in the U.S. and elsewhere: Original, Cool Mint, FreshBurst, Natural Citrus, Naturals, Soft Mint (Vanilla Mint), UltraClean (formerly Advanced Listerine), Tooth Defense (mint shield), and Whitening pre-brush rinse (clean mint). In the United Kingdom, where in recent years the only option for most residents to obtain the original Listerine was to purchase from a dwindling number of larger branches of Boots the Chemist only the flavoured products are now obtainable as Boots has removed the Original from its selection. Original is not listed on the Listerine UK website as among the Listerine products available in the United Kingdom.\nComposition.\nAccording to the product overview, the ingredients are as following for Listerine Total Care. Similar distribution is contained in other varieties, which also list the essential oils as active ingredients.\nListerine Total Care.\nInactive ingredients.\nDistributions in case of Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Original-05/22/2008 for essential oils are: menthol (mint) 0.042%, thymol (thyme) 0.064%, methyl salicylate (wintergreen) 0.06%, and eucalyptol (eucalyptus) 0.092%.\nBenefits.\nIn combination, all have an antiseptic effect, and there is some thought that methyl salicylate may have an anti-inflammatory effect as well. Ethanol, which is toxic to bacteria at concentrations of 40%, is present in concentrations of 21.6% in the flavored product and 26.9% in the original gold Listerine Antiseptic. At this concentration, the ethanol serves to dissolve the active ingredients.\nResearch indicates that Listerine can reduce dental plaque by 22.2% and gingivitis by 28.2% at 6 months. Dental plaque by 20.8% and gingivitis by 27.7% at 6 months, when compared with vehicle in test. The vehicle was 26.9% hydroalcoholic containing all ingredients in Listerine Antiseptic except its essential oils.\nListerine also sell a formulation called Listerine Advanced Defence Gum Treatment containing a common food preservative, ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE) at 0.147%.\nSafety.\nAlcohol.\nThe addition of essential oils means the ethanol is considered to be undrinkable, known as denatured alcohol, and it is therefore not regulated as an alcoholic beverage in the United States (Specially Denatured Alcohol Formula 38-B, specified in Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 21, Subpart D). However, consumption of mouthwash to obtain intoxication does occur, especially among alcoholics and underage drinkers.\nThe use of alcohol-containing mouthwash such as Listerine may increase the risk of developing oral cancer in some cases, see . In 2009, Johnson and Johnson launched a new alcohol-free version of the product called Listerine Zero.\nContaminants.\nOn April 11, 2007, McNeil-PPC disclosed that there were potentially contaminants in all Listerine Agent Cool Blue products sold since its launch in 2006, and that all bottles were being recalled. The recall affected some 4,000,000 bottles sold since that time. According to the company, Listerine Agent Cool Blue is the only product affected by the contamination and no other products in the Listerine family were under recall.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18666", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18666", "title": "Ludo", "text": "Board game\nLudo (; from la \" ludo\"\u00a0'[I] play') is a strategy-based board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;tokens&lt;/dfn&gt; from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo originated from the Indian game Pachisi. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.\nHistory.\nLudo has its origins in the Indian game of Pachisi, created in India in the sixth century CE. It was modified to use a cubic die with a die cup and patented as \"Ludo\" in England in 1896 by Alfred Coller.Coller eventually patented the game and sold it as \"Royal Ludo\". The board game Uckers, popular in the Royal Navy, is based on Ludo.\nLudo board.\nSpecial areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;playspace&lt;/dfn&gt;, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's home column. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's starting square. At the centre of the board is a large finishing square, often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting \"arrows\" pointing to the finish).\nRules.\nOverview.\nTwo, three, or four can play, without partnerships. At the beginning of the game, each player's four tokens are out of play and &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;staged&lt;/dfn&gt; in the player's yard (one of the large corner areas of the board in the player's colour). When able to, the players enter their tokens one per turn on their respective starting squares and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the game track (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When reaching the square below their home column, a player continues by moving tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single die control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finishing square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue to play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.\nGameplay.\nEach player rolls a die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a six. Players can draw a token from home every time they get a six unless home is empty or move a piece six times. The start box has two own tokens (is doubled). If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a six, the turn passes to the next player.\nPlayers must always move a token according to the die value rolled. Once players have one or more tokens in play, they select a token and move it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die. If a token advances onto a spot occupied by opponent's token then the opposing token is returned to its respective home point. This forces the opponent to roll another six to take it out of their home and move it again. If a token advances onto a spot occupied by a token of the same colour, then they create something that is called a \"block\". If an opposing token lands on the same spot as the block, the advancing token is returned to its respective home point.\nIf the player cannot draw a token from home, rolling a six earns the player an additional or \"bonus\" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a six again, the player earns again an additional bonus roll. If the third roll is also a six, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.\nA player's home column squares are always safe, since no opponent may enter them. In the home column, a player cannot jump over; after one rotation is completed, the player must enter the home and roll the exact number needed to get each token onto the home triangle.\nVariants.\nList of international variants.\nLudo exists under different names and brands, and in various game derivations:\nMensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht.\nMensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht (Man, Don't Become Annoyed), is a German game from 1914 and has equivalent names in Albanian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, Greek, Italian, Macedonian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, and Turkish.\nHasbro.\nHasbro has multiple brand names for ludo-like games from its acquisitions including:\nLatvian.\nThe Latvian version of the game is called \"Ri\u010du-Ra\u010du\". The board is larger than the original board with seven home spaces instead of four (but the player must always reach the four farthest home spaces anyway, if the player overrolls, then they must move the extra spaces back and wait for their next turn). Captures are allowed and two tokens cannot occupy the same space. If a player rolls a one or a six, they can either get a second roll or move a token to the starting position.\nDifferences.\nAfrican.\nIn some parts of Africa including Nigeria, Ghana, Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho and South Africa, the following rules are reportedly played:\nIndian.\nThe Indian Ludo is based on the ancient game Pachisi. It was first played on cloth boards using cowrie shells and small tokens. Over time, it changed into a simpler version with a square board and a single die. This version is now played in homes across the country.\nPlayers take turns rolling the die and moving their tokens around the board to reach the home area. If a token lands on another, it can be sent back to start.\nIn recent years, digital versions have become popular. Mobile apps like Zupee Ludo, Ludo King and MPL, offer different ways to play. Some include quick matches, no-dice formats, or reward-based systems. These are often grouped under the term online Ludo. Many people in India now play both offline and online versions. With almost 79% of the players that are from India, making the majority of the audience.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18669", "revid": "44976381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18669", "title": "Life expectancy", "text": "Measure of average lifespan in a given population\nHuman life expectancy is a statistical measure of the estimate of the average remaining years of life at a given age. The most commonly used measure is life expectancy at birth (LEB, or in demographic notation \"e\"0, where \"e\"x denotes the average life remaining at age \"x\"). This can be defined in two ways. \"Cohort\" LEB is the mean length of life of a birth cohort (in this case, all individuals born in a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born so long ago that all their members have died. \"Period\" LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year. National LEB figures reported by national agencies and international organizations for human populations are estimates of \"period\" LEB.\nHuman remains from the early Bronze Age indicate an LEB of 24. In 2019, world LEB was 73.3. A combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 would have relatively few people dying at exactly 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity, LEB can be grossly misinterpreted, leading to the belief that a population with a low LEB would have a small proportion of older people. A different measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood. For instance, in a society with a life expectancy of 30, it may nevertheless be common to have a 40-year remaining timespan at age 5 (but not a 60-year one).\nAggregate population measures\u2014such as the proportion of the population in various age groups\u2014are also used alongside individual-based measures\u2014such as formal life expectancy\u2014when analyzing population structure and dynamics. Pre-modern societies had universally higher mortality rates and lower life expectancies at every age for both males and females.\nLife expectancy, longevity, and maximum lifespan are not synonymous. Longevity refers to the relatively long lifespan of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Mathematically, life expectancy is denoted formula_1 and is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age formula_2, with a particular mortality. Because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or after the expected survival.\nLife expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology, and in life tables (also known as actuarial tables). The concept of life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects, though the related term shelf life is commonly used for consumer products, and the terms \"mean time to breakdown\" and \"mean time between failures\" are used in engineering.\nHistory.\nThe earliest documented work on life expectancy was done in the 1660s by John Graunt, Christiaan Huygens, and Lodewijck Huygens.\nHuman patterns.\nMaximum.\nThe longest verified lifespan for any human is that of French woman Jeanne Calment, who is verified as having lived to age 122 years, 164 days, between 21 February 1875 and 4 August 1997. This is referred to as the \"maximum life span\", which is the upper boundary of life, the maximum number of years any human is known to have lived. Although maximum life expectancy is around 125 years, genetic enhancements could allow humans to live for a maximum of 245 years, according to InsideTracker. According to a study by biologists Bryan G. Hughes and Siegfried Hekimi, there is no evidence for a limit on human lifespan. However, this view has been questioned on the basis of error patterns. A theoretical study shows that the maximum life expectancy at birth is limited by the human life characteristic value \u03b4, which is around 104 years.\nVariation over time.\nThe following information is derived from the 1961 \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the world population as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.\nLife expectancy at birth takes account of infant mortality and child mortality but not prenatal mortality.\nEnglish life expectancy at birth averaged about 36 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, one of the highest levels in the world although infant and child mortality remained higher than in later periods. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early Colony of Virginia, and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40% died before reaching adulthood. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. Recorded deaths among children under the age of 5 years fell in London from 74.5% of the recorded births in 1730\u201349 to 31.8% in 1810\u201329, though this overstates mortality and its fall because of net immigration (hence more dying in the metropolis than were born there) and incomplete registration (particularly of births, and especially in the earlier period). English life expectancy at birth reached 41 years in the 1840s, 43 in the 1870s and 46 in the 1890s, though infant mortality remained at around 150 per thousand throughout this period.\nPublic health measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy. During the 20th century, despite a brief drop due to the 1918 flu pandemic, the average lifespan in the United States increased by more than 30 years, of which 25 years can be attributed to advances in public health.\nRegional variations.\nThere are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet.\nHuman beings are expected to live on average 60 years in Eswatini and 82.6 years in Japan. An analysis published in 2011 in \"The Lancet\" attributes Japanese life expectancy to equal opportunities, excellent public health, and a healthy diet.\nThe World Health Organization announced that the COVID-19 pandemic reversed the trend of steady gain in life expectancy at birth. The pandemic wiped out nearly a decade of progress in improving life expectancy.\nAfrica.\nDuring the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. This is most apparent by the impact of AIDS on many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010\u20132015 (if HIV/AIDS did not exist) would have been:\nEastern Europe.\nOn average, eastern Europeans tend to live shorter lives than their western counterparts. For example, Spaniards from Madrid can expect to live to 85, but Bulgarians from the region of Severozapaden are predicted to live just past their 73rd birthday. This is in large part due to poor health habits, such as heavy smoking and high alcoholism in the region, and environmental factors, such as high air pollution.\nUnited States.\nIn 2023, the life expectancy at birth was 78.4 in the United States, a 0.9 year increase from 2022. Although American life expectancy has been on a general increase, from 73.7 in 1980 to 78.4 in 2023. Compared to other industrialized countries, the United States has fallen significantly behind, with the gap between the U.S and \"peer countries\" increasing from 0.9 years in 1980 to 4.1 years in 2023.\nIn what has been described as a \"life expectancy crisis\", there were a total of 14.7 million \"missing Americans\" from 1980 to 2023, deaths that would have been averted if it had the standard mortality rate of \"wealthy nations\". The annual number of \"missing Americans\" has been increasing, with 622,534 in 2019 alone.\nBlack Americans have generally shorter life expectancies than their White American counterparts. For example, white Americans in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest, the greatest difference being 7.1 years in 1993. In contrast, Asian American women live the longest of all ethnic and gender groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years. The life expectancy of Hispanic Americans is 81.2 years.\nJapan.\nIn 2023, the life expectancy was 84.5 in Japan, 4.2 years above the OECD average, and one of the highest in the world. This represents a significant change from the 1960s, when Japan's life expectancy used to be among the lower G7 countries, due to high rates of cerebrovascular disease and stomach cancer. Since then, these rates have significantly decreased, as have the rates of coronary artery disease and other types of cancer, which were already low. High intake of fish and plant food with a modest intake of meat, milk, and dairy products is thought to contribute to these changes.\nIn cities.\nCities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In American cities such as Cincinnati, the life expectancy gap between low income and high-income neighborhoods touches 20 years.\nEconomic circumstances.\nEconomic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas. In Glasgow, the disparity is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of Lenzie, which is only away.\nA study published in the American Geriatrics Society found that the average life expectancy of the Chinese emperors (which have much wealth) from the first Qin Dynasty (221\u2013207 BC) to the last Qing Dynasty, was 41.3 years. This is much lower than that of the Buddhist monks (66.9 years) traditional Chinese doctors (75.1 years) and the emperors' servant, who survived to 71.3 years (range 55\u201394), during the same time.\nA 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy. However, in contrast, a study by Jos\u00e9 A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the University of Michigan found that life expectancy actually \"increased\" during the Great Depression, and during recessions and depressions in general. The authors suggest that when people are working harder during prosperous economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and the likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.\nLife expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) have lower life expectancies than average. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet, and exercise.\nSex differences.\nModern female human life expectancy is greater than that of males, despite females having higher morbidity rates (see health survival paradox). There are several potential reasons for this. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have consumed more tobacco, alcohol, and drugs than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war, or car wrecks) or intentional (suicide). Men are also more likely to die from the leading causes of death (some already stated) than women. Some of these in the United States include cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer. In the past, mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups were higher than for males at the same age.\nA paper from 2015 found that female foetuses have a higher mortality rate than male foetuses. This finding contradicts papers dating from 2002 and earlier that attribute the male sex to higher in-utero mortality rates. Among the smallest premature babies (those under ), females have a higher survival rate. At the other extreme, about 90% of individuals aged 110 are female. The difference in life expectancy between men and women in the United States dropped from 7.8\u00a0years in 1979 to 5.3\u00a0years in 2005, with women expected to live to age\u00a080.1 in 2005. Data from the United Kingdom shows the gap in life expectancy between men and women decreasing in later life. This may be attributable to the effects of infant mortality and young adult death rates.\nSome argue that shorter male life expectancy is another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger-sized individuals within a species tend, on average, to have shorter lives. This biological difference occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.\nIn her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, modern males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. However, Kalben's study was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where the demographic transition occurred relatively early. United Nations statistics from mid-twentieth century onward, show that in all parts of the world, females have a higher life expectancy at age 60 than males. Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. Except for birds, males of almost all animal species studied have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in humans is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.\nOne recent suggestion is that mitochondrial mutations which shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore, such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.\nAnother explanation is the unguarded X hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, one reason for why the average lifespan of males is shorter than females\u2013\u2013by 18% on average, according to the study\u2013\u2013is that they have a Y chromosome which cannot protect an individual from harmful genes expressed on the X chromosome, while a duplicate X chromosome, as present in female organisms, can ensure harmful genes are not expressed.\nIn developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880, death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline. Most of the difference in life expectancy between the sexes is accounted for by differences in the rate of death by cardiovascular diseases among persons aged 50\u201370.\nGenetics.\nThe heritability of lifespan is estimated to be less than 10%, meaning the majority of variation in lifespan is attributable due to differences in environment rather than genetic variation. However, researchers have identified regions of the genome which can influence the length of life and the number of years lived in good health. For example, a genome-wide association study of 1 million lifespans found 12 genetic loci which influenced lifespan by modifying susceptibility to cardiovascular and smoking-related disease. The locus with the largest effect is APOE. Carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele live approximately one year less than average (per copy of the \u03b54 allele), mainly due to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.\nIn July 2020, scientists identified 10 genomic loci with consistent effects across multiple lifespan-related traits, including healthspan, lifespan, and longevity. The genes affected by variation in these loci highlighted haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. This study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans.\nA follow-up study which investigated the genetics of frailty and self-rated health in addition to healthspan, lifespan, and longevity also highlighted haem metabolism as an important pathway, and found genetic variants which lower blood protein levels of LPA and VCAM1 were associated with increased healthy lifespan.\nCentenarians.\nIn developed countries, the number of centenarians is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which doubles the centenarian population every 13\u00a0years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1\u00a0million in 2050. Japan has the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1\u00a0million inhabitants in September 2010). Shimane Prefecture had an estimated 743 centenarians per million inhabitants.\nIn the United States, the number of centenarians grew from 32,194 in 1980 to 71,944 in November 2010 (232 centenarians per million inhabitants).\nMental illness.\nMental illness is reported to occur in approximately 18% of the American population.\nThe mentally ill have been shown to have a 10- to 25-year reduction in life expectancy. The reduction of lifespan in the mentally ill population compared to the mentally stable population has been studied and documented.\nThe greater mortality of people with mental disorders may be due to death from injury, from co-morbid conditions, or medication side effects. For instance, psychiatric medications can increase the risk of developing diabetes. The psychiatric medication olanzapine can increase risk of developing agranulocytosis, among other comorbidities. Psychiatric medicines also affect the gastrointestinal tract; the mentally ill have a four times risk of gastrointestinal disease.\nAs of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found an increased risk of death in the mentally ill.\nOther illnesses.\nThe life expectancy of people with diabetes, which is 9.3% of the U.S. population, is reduced by roughly 10\u201320 years. People over 60 years old with Alzheimer's disease have about a 50% life expectancy of 3\u201310 years. Other people that tend to have a lower life expectancy than average include transplant recipients and the obese.\nEducation.\nEducation on all levels has been strongly associated with increased life expectancy. This association may be due partly to higher income, which can lead to increased life expectancy. Despite the association, among identical twin pairs with different education levels, there is only weak evidence of a relationship between educational attainment and adult mortality.\nAccording to a paper from 2015, the mortality rate for the Caucasian population in the United States from 1993 to 2001 is four times higher for those who did not complete high school compared to those who have at least 16 years of education. In fact, within the U.S. adult population, people with less than a high school education have the shortest life expectancies.\nPreschool education also plays a large role in life expectancy. It was found that high-quality early-stage childhood education had positive effects on health. Researchers discovered this by analyzing the results of the Carolina Abecedarian Project, finding that the disadvantaged children who were randomly assigned to treatment had lower instances of risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their mid-30s.\nEvolution and aging rate.\nVarious species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms which\u2014by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle\u2014live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span. That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad; however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.\nOne prominent and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span from a very limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That is the key to why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.\nThe ability of skin fibroblasts to perform DNA repair after UV irradiation was measured in shrew, mouse, rat, hamster, cow, elephant and human. It was found that DNA repair capability increased systematically with species life span. Since this original study in 1974, at least 14 additional studies were performed on mammals to test this correlation. In all, but two of these studies, lifespan correlated with DNA repair levels, suggesting that DNA repair capability contributes to life expectancy. See DNA damage theory of aging.\nIn a broad survey of zoo animals, no relationship was found between investment of the animal in reproduction and its life span.\nCalculation.\nIn actuarial notation, the probability of surviving from age formula_2 to age formula_4 is denoted formula_5 and the probability of dying during age formula_2 (i.e. between ages formula_2 and formula_8) is denoted formula_9 . For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the age-specific death probability at 90 would be 10%. This probability describes the \"likelihood\" of dying at that age, and is not the \"rate\" at which people of that age die. It can be shown that&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe \"curtate future lifetime\", denoted formula_10, is a discrete random variable representing the remaining lifetime at age formula_2, rounded down to whole years. Life expectancy, more technically called the \"curtate expected lifetime\" and denoted \"formula_12 ,\" is the mean of formula_10\u2014that is to say, the expected number of whole years of life remaining, assuming survival to age formula_2. So,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSubstituting (1) into the sum and simplifying gives the final result\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf the assumption is made that, on average, people live a half year on the year of their death, the complete life expectancy at age formula_2 would be formula_16, which is denoted by e\u030ax, and is the intuitive definition of life expectancy.\nBy definition, life expectancy is an arithmetic mean. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in the year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.\nThe starting point for calculating life expectancy is the age-specific death rates of the population members. If a large amount of data is available, a statistical population can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years \"exposed to risk\" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to remove (as much as possible) the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the Gompertz function, but more sophisticated methods are now used. The most common modern methods include:\nThe age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, or smokers and non-smokers) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them. The life of a product, more often termed shelf life, is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications (e.g. aircraft), methods like accelerated aging are used to model the life expectancy of a component.\nThe life expectancy statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population. However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends, but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality, like the Lee\u2013Carter model.\nAs discussed above, on an individual basis, some factors correlate with longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use (including smoking and alcohol consumption), disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care. As of 2025, some AI apps claim to be able to predict individual life expectancy and death dates through a combination of population statistics and individual factors.\nHealthy life expectancy.\nTo assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury. Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan \"Healthy People 2010\". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.\nThe long-standing quest for longer life led in the 2010s to a focus on increasing HALE, also known as a person's \"healthspan\". Besides the benefits of keeping people healthier longer, a goal is to reduce health-care expenses on the many diseases associated with cellular senescence. Approaches being explored include fasting, exercise, and senolytic drugs.\nForecasting.\nForecasting life expectancy and mortality form an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs (like U.S. Social Security and pension) since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.\nLife expectancy forecasting is usually based on one of two different approaches:\nPolicy uses.\nLife expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.\nLife expectancy is used in describing the physical quality of life of an area. It is also used for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy is sold for a cash asset.\nDisparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is income inequality. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = \u22120.907). There is a similar relationship among states in the U.S. (r = \u22120.620).\nLife expectancy vs. other measures of longevity.\nLife expectancy may be confused with the average age an adult could expect to live, creating the misunderstanding that an adult's lifespan would be unlikely to exceed their life expectancy at birth. This is not the case, as life expectancy is an average of the lifespans of all individuals, including those who die before adulthood. One may compare the life expectancy of the period after childhood to estimate also the life expectancy of an adult.\nAs a measure of the years of life remaining, life expectancy decreases with age after initially rising in early childhood, but the average age to which a person is likely to live increases as they survive to successive higher ages. In the table above, the estimated modern hunter-gatherer average expectation of life at birth of 33 years (often considered an upper-bound for Paleolithic populations) equates to a life expectancy at 15 of 39 years, so that those surviving to age 15 will on average die at 54.\nIn England in the 13th\u201319th centuries with life expectancy at birth rising from perhaps 25 years to over 40, expectation of life at age 30 has been estimated at 20\u201330 years, giving an average age at death of about 50\u201360 for those (a minority at the start of the period but two-thirds at its end) surviving beyond their twenties.\nThe table above gives the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles as 30\u201333, but having surviving to the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy could expect to live:\nA further concept is that of modal age at death, the single age when deaths among a population are more numerous than at any other age. In all pre-modern societies the most common age at death is the first year of life: it is only as infant mortality falls below around 33\u201334 per thousand (roughly a tenth of estimated ancient and medieval levels) that deaths in a later year of life (usually around age 80) become more numerous. While the most common age of death in adulthood among modern hunter-gatherers (often taken as a guide to the likely most favourable Paleolithic demographic experience) is estimated to average 72 years, the number dying at that age is dwarfed by those (over a fifth of all infants) dying in the first year of life, and only around a quarter usually survive to the higher age.\nMaximum life span is an individual-specific concept, and therefore is an upper bound rather than an average. Science author Christopher Wanjek writes, \"[H]as the human race increased its life span? Not at all. This is one of the biggest misconceptions about old age: we are not living any longer.\" The maximum life span, or oldest age a human can live, may be constant. Further, there are many examples of people living significantly longer than the average life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates (71), Saint Anthony the Great (105), Michelangelo (88), and John Adams (90).\nHowever, anthropologist John D. Hawks criticizes the popular conflation of life span (life expectancy) and maximum life span when popular science writers falsely imply that the average adult human does not live longer than their ancestors. He writes, \"[a]ge-specific mortality rates have declined across the adult lifespan. A smaller fraction of adults die at 20, at 30, at 40, at 50, and so on across the lifespan. As a result, we live longer on average... In every way we can measure, human lifespans are longer today than in the immediate past, and longer today than they were 2000 years ago... age-specific mortality rates in adults really have reduced substantially.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18671", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18671", "title": "Lesser Poland", "text": "Historical region of Poland\nLesser Poland, often known by its Polish name Ma\u0142opolska (; ), is a historical region situated in southern and south-eastern Poland. Its capital and largest city is Krak\u00f3w. Throughout centuries, Lesser Poland developed a separate culture featuring diverse architecture, folk costumes, dances, cuisine, traditions and a rare Lesser Polish dialect. The region is rich in historical landmarks, monuments, castles, natural scenery and UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nThe region should not be confused with the modern Lesser Poland Voivodeship, which covers only the southwestern part of Lesser Poland. Historical Lesser Poland was much larger than the current voivodeship that bears its name. It reached from Bielsko-Bia\u0142a in the southwest as far as to Siedlce in the northeast. It consisted of the three voivodeships of Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz and Lublin.\nIt comprised almost 60,000\u00a0km2 in area; today's population in this area is about 9,000,000 inhabitants. Its landscape is mainly hilly, with the Carpathian Mountains and Tatra Mountain Range in the south. It is located in the basin of the upper Vistula river. It has been noted for its mighty aristocracy (\"magnateria\") and wealthy nobility (\"szlachta\").\nBetween the 14th and 18th century, the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland also encompassed the historical regions of Podlachia, Volhynia, Podolia and Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities. In the era of partitions, the southern part of Lesser Poland became known as Galicia, which was under Austrian control until Poland regained its independence in 1918. As a result of this long-lasting division, many inhabitants of the northern part of Lesser Poland (including those in such cities as Lublin, Radom, Kielce and Cz\u0119stochowa) do not recognize their Lesser Polish identity. \nHowever, while Lublin \"(Lubelskie)\" was declared an independent Voivodeship as early as 1474, it still has speakers of the Lesser Polish dialect.\nAcross history, many ethnic and religious minorities existed in Lesser Poland as they fled persecution from other areas or countries. Poland's once tolerant policy towards these minorities allowed them to flourish and create separate self-governing communities. Some minorities still remain, but are on the verge of extinction, most notably Wymysorys-speaking Vilamovians, Halcnovians, Gorals, Lemkos, and once Polish Jews and Walddeutsche Germans.\nGeography and boundaries.\nLesser Poland lies in the area of the upper confluence of the Vistula river and covers a large upland, including the \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains with the Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland further west, Ma\u0142opolska Upland, Sandomierz Basin, and Lublin Upland. Unlike other historical parts of the country, such as Kujawy, Mazovia, Podlachia, Pomerania, or Greater Poland, Lesser Poland is mainly hilly, with Poland's highest peak, Rysy, located within the borders of the province. Flat are northern and central areas of the province \u2013 around Tarnobrzeg, Stalowa Wola, Radom and Siedlce, also valleys of the main rivers \u2013 the Vistula, the Pilica, and the San. Apart from Rysy, there are several other peaks located in the province \u2013 Pilsko, Babia G\u00f3ra, Turbacz, as well as \u0141ysica in the \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains. The southern part of the province is covered by the Carpathian Mountains, which are made of smaller ranges, such as Pieniny, Tatry, and Beskidy.\nAlmost the whole area is located in the Vistula Basin, with the exception of the western and southern parts, belonging to the Odra and Dunaj Basins. The main rivers of the province are the Vistula, upper Warta, So\u0142a, Skawa, Raba, Dunajec, Wis\u0142ok, Wis\u0142oka, San, Wieprz, Przemsza, Nida, Kamienna, Radomka, and Pilica. The major lakes of the province are Lake Ro\u017cn\u00f3w, Lake Czch\u00f3w, Lake Dobczyce, Lake Czorsztyn, Lake Czaniec, Lake Mi\u0119dzybrodzie, Lake Klimk\u00f3wka and \u017bywiec Lake. Most of them are man-made reservoirs.\nLesser Poland stretches from the Carpathians in the south to Pilica and Liwiec rivers to the north. It borders Mazovia to the north, Podlaskie to the northeast, Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities to the east, Slovakia to the south, Silesia to the west, and Greater Poland to the northwest. Currently, the region is divided between Polish voivodeships \u2013 Lesser Poland Voivodeship (whole), \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship (whole), Silesian Voivodeship (eastern half), Podkarpackie Voivodeship (western part), Masovian Voivodeship (southern part), \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship (southeastern corner), and Lublin Voivodeship (western part).\nIn Silesian Voivodeship, the border between Silesia and Lesser Poland is easy to draw, because, with only a few exceptions, it goes along boundaries of local counties. In the south, it goes along the western boundary of the ancient Duchy of Teschen, with the borderline along the Bia\u0142a river, with Zwardo\u0144, Mil\u00f3wka and Rajcza located in Lesser Poland. Bielsko-Bia\u0142a is a city made up of two parts \u2013 Lesser Poland's Biala (also called \"Biala Krakowska\"), makes up the eastern half of the city, and only in 1951 was it merged with Silesian Bielsko. Further north, the border goes along the western boundaries of the cities of Jaworzno, and Sosnowiec, along the Przemsza and Brynica rivers. Then it goes northwest, leaving Czelad\u017a, Siewierz, Kozieg\u0142owy, Blachownia, K\u0142obuck and Krzepice within Lesser Poland. From Krzepice, the border goes eastwards, towards Koniecpol, and along the Pilica river, with such towns as Przedborz, Opoczno, Drzewica, Bia\u0142obrzegi, and Kozienice located within Lesser Poland. East of Bia\u0142obrzegi, the boundary goes mainly along the Radomka river, to the Vistula. East of the Vistula, the boundary goes north of \u0141askarzew and \u017belech\u00f3w, and south of Mazovian town of Garwolin, turning northwest. The northernmost point of the province is marked by the Liwiec river, with both Siedlce, and \u0141uk\u00f3w being part of Lesser Poland. The line then goes south, with Miedzyrzec Podlaski being part of the historical Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Radzy\u0144 Podlaski as well as Parczew left in Lesser Poland.\nBetween the Vistula and the Bug Rivers, the eastern border of Lesser Poland goes west of Leczna, but east of Krasnystaw and Szczebrzeszyn, both of which historically belong to Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities. Further south, Lesser Poland includes Frampol, and Bi\u0142goraj, which lie in the southeastern corner on Lesser Poland's historical Lublin Voivodeship, close to the border with Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities. The border then goes west of Bi\u0142goraj, turning south, towards Le\u017cajsk (which belongs to Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities). The boundary between Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities was described by Ukrainian historian and geographer Myron Korduba as being along the line Dukla \u2013 Krosno \u2013 Domaradz \u2013 Czudec \u2013 Krzesz\u00f3w nad Sanem. The border towns of Lesser Poland were: Rudnik, Kolbuszowa, Ropczyce, S\u0119dzisz\u00f3w Ma\u0142opolski, Strzy\u017c\u00f3w, Jas\u0142o, Gorlice, and Biecz. The southern border of Lesser Poland goes along the Carpathian Mountains, and, except in a few cases, it has not changed for centuries. The cities of Le\u017cajsk, Rzesz\u00f3w, Sanok, Brzoz\u00f3w, and Krosno do not belong to historical Lesser Poland, as they are part of Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities (Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship, around today's Lviv, Ukraine).\nHistorically, Lesser Poland was divided into two lands - Krak\u00f3w Land and Sandomierz Land, both of which emerged after the Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty. In the 14th century, Sandomierz Voivodeship and Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship were created, and in 1474, Lublin Voivodeship was carved out of three Sandomierz Voivodeship counties, located on the right bank of the Vistula. Historian Adolf Pawi\u0144ski, who in the late 19th century was the director of the Polish Central Archives of Historical Records, estimated in his book \"Polska XVI wieku pod wzgl\u0119dem geograficzno-statystycznym\", that the size of Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship was 19,028\u00a0km2. Sandomierz Voivodeship had an area of 25,762\u00a0km2, and Lublin Voivodeship had an area of 11,033\u00a0km2. Together with the Duchy of Siewierz (607\u00a0km2), and the parts of Spi\u0161 that belonged to Poland after the Treaty of Lubowla (1211\u00a0km2), the total area of Lesser Poland was 57,640 square kilometers. Apart from the three historic lands, Lesser Poland includes other smaller regions, such as Podhale, Ponidzie, and Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie.\nEtymology.\nZygmunt Gloger in his work \"Historical geography of land of ancient Poland\" (\"Geografia historyczna ziem dawnej Polski\") states that according to a Polish custom, whenever a new village was formed next to an older one, the name of the new entity was presented with an adjective \"little\" (or \"lesser\"), while the old village was described as \"greater\". The same procedure was used in naming two Polish provinces\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the \"older\" one, the cradle of the Polish state, was called \"Greater Poland\", and its \"younger sister\", which became part of Poland a few years later, was called \"Lesser Poland\". The name Greater Poland (\"Polonia Maior\") was for the first time used in 1242, by princes Boleslaw and Przemys\u0142aw I, who named themselves \"Duces Majoris Poloniae\" (\"Princes of the Older Poland\"). Lesser Poland, or \"Polonia Minor\", appeared for the first time in historical documents in 1493, in the Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w, during the reign of King Jan Olbracht, to distinguish this province from Greater Poland (\"Polonia Maior\").\nHistory.\nEarly period and Kingdom of Poland.\nIn the first years of Polish statehood, southern Lesser Poland was inhabited by the West Slavic tribe of Vistulans, with two major centers in Krak\u00f3w and Wi\u015blica. Their land, which had probably been part of Great Moravia, and Bohemia, was annexed by Mieszko I of Poland some time in the late 10th century. Cosmas of Prague in his \"Chronicle of Bohemians\" wrote: \"Polish prince Mieszko, a cunning man, seized by ruse the city of Krak\u00f3w, killing with sword all Czechs he found there\". Northern part of Lesser Poland (Lublin and Sandomierz) was probably inhabited by another tribe, the Lendians, and Dr Antoni Podraza, historian of the Jagiellonian University claims that ancient division of Lesser Poland into two major parts \u2013 Land (Duchy) of Krak\u00f3w, and Land (Duchy) of Sandomierz, is based on the existence of two Slavic tribes in the area. However, exact location of the Lendians has not been determined to this day. Some historians speculate that they occupied Cherven Cities, and their center was in Przemy\u015bl.\nAround the year 1000, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w was created, and its borders covered whole area of Lesser Poland. During the reign of Casimir I the Restorer, Krak\u00f3w for the first time became the capital of Poland (around 1040), since Greater Poland and Silesia, with main Polish urban centers, such as Gniezno and Pozna\u0144 were ravaged by Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia. In 1138, following the Testament of Boles\u0142aw III Krzywousty, the country was divided between his sons (see also Fragmentation of Poland). Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth created the Seniorate Province, which, among others, consisted of Krak\u00f3w. At the same time, Lesser Poland was divided into two parts, when its eastern part formed the Duchy of Sandomierz, carved by the ruler for his son Henry of Sandomierz.\nDuring the fragmentation period, both lands of Lesser Poland were frequently ruled by the same prince. Among them were Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old, Casimir II the Just, Leszek I the White, Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high, and King of Bohemia, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who united Lesser Poland in 1290/1291. The province was pillaged during the Mongol invasion of Poland, when a combined army of Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz was destroyed by Baidar in the Battle of Chmielnik. The loss was so heavy that Norman Davies wrote: \"At Chmielnik, the assembled nobility of Ma\u0142opolska perished to a man.\" During their 1241, 1259, and 1287 invasions, the Mongols burned major cities of Lesser Poland, killing thousands of people. Furthermore, the province, especially its northeastern part, was often raided by the Lithuanians, Rusyns, Yotvingians, and Old Prussians. The city of Lublin suffered most frequently \u2013 among others, it was burnt by the Rusyns in 1244, the Lithuanians 1255, the Prussians in 1266, and the Yotvingians in 1282. Another center of the province, Sandomierz, was destroyed by the Tartars in 1260, and burnt by the Lithuanians in 1349.\nUnlike other Polish provinces, especially Silesia, Lesser Poland did not undergo further fragmentation, and in the early 14th century became the core of the reunited nation (together with Greater Poland). The period of nation's fragmentation came to a symbolic end on 30 January 1320, when W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high was crowned as King of Poland. The ceremony took place in Krak\u00f3w's Wawel Cathedral, and the king of the reunited country decided to choose Krak\u00f3w as the capital. Through 14th and 15th centuries, Lesser Poland's position as the most important province of the nation was cemented. It became visible during the reign of Casimir III the Great, who favored less known Lesser Poland's noble families, at the expense of Greater Poland's nobility. The reign of Casimir the Great was a period of growing prosperity of Lesser Poland. With high density of population, fertile soils and rich deposits of minerals (especially salt in Bochnia and Wieliczka, as well as lead in Olkusz), the province was the richest part of Poland. After the recapture of the Cherven Cities/Red Ruthenia, Lesser Poland lost its status of the borderland, and both regions created an economic bridge between Poland and the ports of the Black Sea. The king, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe to his country, built several castles along western border of Lesser Poland, with the most notable ones in Skawina, Pieskowa Ska\u0142a, B\u0119dzin, Lanckorona, Olkusz, Lel\u00f3w, Bobolice, Krzepice, Ogrodzieniec, Ojc\u00f3w, Olsztyn, Bobolice, Mir\u00f3w (see also Eagle Nests Trail). Furthermore, he built or strengthened castles in other parts of the province, such as Szydlow, Ch\u0119ciny, Wi\u015blica, Radom, Niedzica, Opoczno, Lublin, Sandomierz, as well as the Wawel Castle. Also, during his reign (1333\u20131370), Casimir the Great founded on Magdeburg rights several cities, urbanizing hitherto rural province. Among major Lesser Poland's cities founded by the King, there are:\nIn the Kingdom of Poland, Lesser Poland was made of three voivodeships \u2013 Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship, Sandomierz Voivodeship, and Lublin Voivodeship, created in 1474 out of eastern part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship. Borders of the province remained unchanged until 1772. The only exception was large part of contemporary Upper Silesia (the area around Bytom, Toszek, Siewierz, and O\u015bwi\u0119cim), which belonged to Duchy of Krak\u00f3w until 1179. In that year, prince of Krak\u00f3w Casimir II the Just, handed these lands to Prince of Opole Mieszko I Tanglefoot. The Duchy of Siewierz, ruled since 1443 by the Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, merged with Lesser Poland in 1790. Other Silesian realms lost in 1179, also returned to Lesser Poland \u2013 Duchy of Zator (in 1513), and Duchy of O\u015bwi\u0119cim (1564). Both duchies merged into a Silesian County of the Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship, and shared the fate of Lesser Poland. Apart from Jews, among other ethnic minorities of the province were the Walddeutsche, who settled the borderland of Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia (14th through 17th centuries). In the Middle Ages, the Germans inhabited several cities of Lesser Poland, especially Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz (see Rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert).\nIn the late Middle Ages, Lesser Poland gradually became the center of Polish statehood, with Krak\u00f3w being the capital of the country from the mid-11th century until 1596. Its nobility ruled Poland when Queen Jadwiga was too young to control the state, and the Union of Krewo with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the brainchild of Lesser Poland's szlachta.\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, Lesser Poland remained the most important part of the country. After the death of Casimir the Great, Lesser Poland's nobility promoted Louis I of Hungary as the new king, later supporting his daughter Jadwiga of Poland in exchange for Privilege of Koszyce. Since Jadwiga, crowned on 16 October 1384, was too young to rule the country, Poland was in fact governed by the Lesser Poland's nobility, who decided to find her a husband, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Jogaila. Consequently, unions of Poland and Lithuania at Krewo and Horod\u0142o were the brainchildren of Lesser Poland's nobility, among whom the most influential individuals were Spytek z Melsztyna, and cardinal Zbigniew Olesnicki. Other famous Lesser Poland's families are Lubomirski family, Kmita family, Tarnowski family, Potocki family, Sobieski family, Koniecpolski family, Ossolinski family, Poniatowski family.\nSince Lesser Poland was the most important province of the country, several important events took place on its territory. In 1364, Casimir the Great called the Congress of Krak\u00f3w, and in 1401, the Union of Vilnius and Radom was signed. In 1505 in Radom, the Sejm adopted the Nihil novi title, which forbade the King to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. In the same year, also in the same city, Polish law was codified in the \u0141aski's Statute, and the Crown Tribunal (the highest appeal court in the Crown of the Polish Kingdom) held its sessions in Lublin. In 1525, the Treaty of Krak\u00f3w was signed, ending the Polish\u2013Teutonic War. Lesser Poland also is home to the oldest Polish university \u2013 the Jagiellonian University, founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great, and several outstanding figures of early Polish culture were born here, such as Jan Kochanowski, Miko\u0142aj Rej, Jan z Lublina, Miko\u0142aj Gom\u00f3\u0142ka, Maciej Miechowita, Marcin Kromer, \u0141ukasz G\u00f3rnicki, and Miko\u0142aj Radomski.\nPolish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn the 16th century, Lesser Poland retained its position as the most important province of the country. As no major conflicts took place on its territory, it was the center of Renaissance in Poland. The province was home to numerous scholars, writers and statesmen, and it was here where Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was created in 1569 (see Union of Lublin). In the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland proper was the base of the Lesser Poland Province, which covered southern lands of the vast country. The province was made of Lesser Poland itself, also Podlachia, Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities, Volhynia, Podolia, and Ukrainian voivodeships of Kij\u00f3w (Kyiv) and Czernih\u00f3w (Chernihiv), which, until 1569, had been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\nThe period in Polish history known as the Polish Golden Age was very fortunate for Lesser Poland. Kings of the Jagiellonian dynasty, especially Sigismund I the Old (himself born in Lesser Poland's Kozienice), and his son Sigismund II Augustus (born in Krak\u00f3w), resided in Krak\u00f3w, which was the capital of the immense Polish \u2013 Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lesser Poland's prosperity was reflected in numerous examples of Renaissance architecture complexes, built across the province. In 1499, hitherto Gothic Wawel Castle was damaged in a fire, and a few years later, Sigismund I, with help of the best native and foreign artists (such as Francesco the Florentine, Bartholomeo Berrecci or Niccolo Castiglione) refurbished the complex into a splendid Renaissance palace. Furthermore, in the early 16th century, several palaces were built in Lesser Poland \u2013 in Drzewica, Szyd\u0142owiec, Ogrodzieniec, and Pieskowa Ska\u0142a. The province became rich mostly due to the grain trade, conducted along the Vistula, and among cities which prospered in the 16th century, there are Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz, Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, Pilzno, Tarn\u00f3w, Radom, Biecz. In later years of the 16th century, further palaces were built or remodelled in Baranow Sandomierski, and Niepo\u0142omice.\nIn the early 16th century, Protestant Reformation spread across the Commonwealth, and Lesser Poland became one of early centers of the movement, when students from Wittenberg brought the news to Cracow. In the first years of the century, professor of Jagiellonian University Jakub of I\u0142\u017ca (Jakub z Ilzy, died 1542) became one of the main promoters of the movement in the region. He actively supported the notions of Martin Luther, and in 1528 was called to the Bishop of Krak\u00f3w's court. Convicted of heresy, he was forced to leave Poland in 1535. Reformation soon became very popular among Lesser Poland's nobility, especially Calvinism, and according to one estimate, some 20% of local szlachta converted from Roman Catholicism. They were attracted by Calvinism's democratic character, and Lesser Poland's center of the movement was set in the town of Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w, which came to be known as \"Sarmatian Athens\". It was in Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w, where a local nobleman converted a Roman Catholic parish into a Protestant one, opened a Calvinist Academy, and published its Antitrinitarian confession in 1560 and in 1561. Several Calvinist synods took place in Lesser Poland \u2013 the first one in S\u0142omniki (1554), Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w (the first united Synod of Poland and Lithuania \u2013 1556 1561), and Krak\u00f3w (1562). In 1563, also in Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w, the so-called Brest Bible was translated into Polish. In 1570, the Sandomierz Agreement was signed by a number of Protestant groups, with the exception of the Polish Brethren, another religious group very influential in Lesser Poland. The Brethren had their center in Lesser Poland's village of Rak\u00f3w, where a main Arian printing press, as well as a college, known as Akademia Rakowska (\"Gymnasium Bonarum Artium\") founded in 1602 were located. Among distinguished European scholars associated with the school, there were Johannes Crellius, Corderius, and Valentinus Smalcius (who translated into German the Racovian Catechism).\nIn 1572, the Jagiellon dynasty died out, and next year, Henry III of France became first elected king of the country. After his short reign, and War of the Polish Succession (1587\u201388), which also took place in Lesser Poland, the new ruler was Stephen B\u00e1thory of Poland, who died in 1586. The ruler from Transylvania was followed by Sigismund III Vasa of Sweden, whose election marked gradual decline of the province. Sigismund's eyes were set on Sweden, and for many years he concentrated his efforts on a futile attempt to regain his former Swedish throne (see Polish\u2013Swedish union, War against Sigismund). Therefore, Lesser Poland, located in southwestern corner of the Commonwealth, began to lose its importance, which was marked in 1596, when Sigismund moved his permanent residence, court and the crown headquarters to centrally located Warsaw.\nEven though first half of the 17th century was filled with wars, all major conflicts did not reach Lesser Poland, and the province continued to prosper, which was reflected in its castles and palaces, such as the enormous Krzyztopor. Apart from minor wars, such as Zebrzydowski Rebellion, and Kostka-Napierski Uprising, the province remained safe. Cossacks of the Khmelnytsky Uprising reached as far west as Zamo\u015b\u0107 and Lw\u00f3w, but did not enter Lesser Poland. The province did not witness other wars, such as Polish\u2013Swedish War (1626\u20131629), Polish\u2013Russian War (1609\u20131618), Polish\u2013Ottoman War (1620\u20131621), and Smolensk War. Nevertheless, Lesser Poland's nobility took active part in these conflicts \u2013 Marina Mniszech, the daughter of Voivode of Sandomierz, Jerzy Mniszech, was wife of False Dmitriy I, as well as False Dmitriy II. Furthermore, Lesser Poland's lands, especially its northeastern part, became a base for Polish troops, fighting the Cossacks, and King John II Casimir Vasa often stayed in Lublin with his court, preparing military campaigns in Ukraine. The situation changed with the outbreak of the Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667). In October 1655, the Russo-Cossack armies under Ivan Vyhovsky entered Eastern Lesser Poland, reaching the Vistula, and pillaging Lublin, Pu\u0142awy, and Kazimierz Dolny. The invaders quickly retreated, but a few months later, Lesser Poland was flooded by the Swedes.\nSwedish invasion of Poland had catastrophic consequences for the hitherto prosperous province. The attackers, supported by their allies from Transylvania, seized whole Lesser Poland, reaching as far south as Nowy Targ, Nowy S\u0105cz, and \u017bywiec. All major cities were looted and burned, and some of them, like Radom, did not recover until the 19th century. The Swedes captured and pillaged Sandomierz (where they destroyed the Royal Castle, and after the invasion, the city never recovered), Opoczno, Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny Pilzno, Szydlow, Szyd\u0142owiec, Tarn\u00f3w, Kielce, Kra\u015bnik, and Krak\u00f3w. The invaders seized the capital of Lesser Poland after a short siege, and their occupation of the province was confirmed after their victories in the Battle of Wojnicz, and the Battle of Golab. In those years, one of the most important and symbolic events in the history of the nation took place in Lesser Poland. It was the Siege of Jasna G\u00f3ra, which, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war. Furthermore, following the Treaty of Radnot, Lesser Poland was invaded in January 1657 by George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, whose troops caused more destruction. Foreign armies were not chased out of Lesser Poland until 1657, Krak\u00f3w itself was recaptured on 18 August 1657. After these invasions, the province was ruined, with hundreds of villages, towns and cities burned. The population decreased (the urban population by nearly half), the peasantry starved, and like other parts of the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland was devastated. The period of peace lasted for about forty years, when in 1700, another major conflict, the Great Northern War began. Lesser Poland once again became a battleground, with Battle of Klisz\u00f3w taking place there in 1702, and the Sandomierz Confederation formed in 1704.\nAfter the conflict, Lesser Poland began a recovery, which was hampered by several other factors. Province's cities frequently burned (Lublin 1719, Nowy Targ 1784, Nowy S\u0105cz, Dukla 1758, Wieliczka 1718, Miech\u00f3w 1745, Drzewica), there also were numerous outbreaks of plagues and typhus (in 1707\u20131708, some 20,000 died in Krak\u00f3w and its area)\nLesser Poland was one of main centers of the Bar Confederation. On 21 June 1786 in Krak\u00f3w, local confederation was announced, and on the same day Voievode of Krak\u00f3w, Michal Czarnocki, urged his citizens to join the movement. Soon afterwards, Krak\u00f3w was captured by the Russian troops, and the center of Lesser Poland's insurgency moved to the mountainous south \u2013 areas around Dukla and Nowy S\u0105cz. During the Confederation, several battles and skirmishes took place there. In 1770, after the Battle of Iwonicz, the Russians ransacked Biecz. The movement ended in 1772, and its decline was connected with the Partitions of Poland. Another local center of the movement was Jasna G\u00f3ra Monastery in Cz\u0119stochowa, which was defended by Kazimierz Pulaski for almost two years (1770\u20131772).\nPartitions of Poland (1772\u20131918).\nThe Partitions of Poland began earlier in Lesser Poland than in other provinces of the country. In 1769, Austrian Empire annexed a small territory of Spisz, and next year, the towns of Czorsztyn, Nowy S\u0105cz and Nowy Targ. In 1771, the Russians and the Prussians agreed on the first partition of the country, and in early 1772, Austrian Emperor Maria Theresa decided to join the two powers. In the first partition of the Commonwealth, the Austrians seized the territory which would later be called Galicia, and which included southwestern corner of Lesser Poland (south of the Vistula river), with \u017bywiec, Tarn\u00f3w, and Biecz, but without major urban centers of the province, such as Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz, Radom, Lublin, Cz\u0119stochowa, and Kielce.\nSecond Partition of Poland (1793) did not result in significant changes of boundaries in the area, as the Austrian Empire did not participate in it. However, the Prussians moved on, and in 1793 they annexed northwestern corner of the province, together with the city of Cz\u0119stochowa, and its vicinity, which became part of the newly created province of South Prussia. Therefore, in late 1793, Lesser Poland was already divided between three countries \u2013 Austrian Empire (south of the Vistula), Kingdom of Prussia (Cz\u0119stochowa and northwestern corner), and still existing Commonwealth. After the Third Partition (1795), most of Lesser Poland was annexed by Austria, with all major cities. Prussia managed to seize a small, western part of the province, with the towns of Siewierz, Zawiercie, B\u0119dzin, and Myszk\u00f3w, calling this land New Silesia, while the Austrians decided to name newly acquired lands of northern Lesser Poland West Galicia. In 1803, West Galicia was merged with Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, but retained some autonomy. Lesser Poland was one of major centers of Polish resistance against the occupiers. On 24 March 1794 in Krak\u00f3w, Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko announced the general insurrection (see Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising), mobilising all able males of Lesser Poland. Two weeks later, Battle of Rac\u0142awice took place, ending with a Polish victory. The uprising was suppressed by combined Prusso \u2013 Russian forces, and among battles fought in Lesser Poland, there is Battle of Szczekociny.\nDuring Napoleonic Wars, the Duchy of Warsaw was created by Napoleon Bonaparte out of Polish lands which had been granted to Prussia in the Partitions. In 1809, after the Polish\u2013Austrian War, and the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn, the Duchy was expanded, when northern Lesser Poland was added to its territory (with Kielce, Radom, and Lublin). Following the Congress of Vienna, Duchy of Warsaw was turned into Russian-ruled Congress Poland, and historical capital of the province, Krak\u00f3w, was turned into Free City of Krak\u00f3w, which also included the towns of Trzebinia, Chrzan\u00f3w, Jaworzno, and Krzeszowice. In Congress Poland, the lands of Lesser Poland were initially divided between four palatinates \u2013 Palatinate of Krak\u00f3w (with capital in Kielce), Palatinate of Sandomierz (with capital in Radom), Palatinate of Lublin, and Palatinate of Podlasie (with capital in Siedlce), (see also Administrative division of Congress Poland). Later, the palatinates were turned into governorates. Thus, Russian part of Lesser Poland was divided into Kielce Governorate, Lublin Governorate, Radom Governorate, Siedlce Governorate, and Piotrk\u00f3w Governorate (western counties, with Cz\u0119stochowa and industrial area of Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie). Borders of these administrative units did not reflect historical boundaries of the province.\nMost of the November Uprising, which began in 1830, missed Lesser Poland, as major battles took place in the area around Warsaw. In early 1831, when Russian forces advanced into Congress Poland, some skirmishes took place in northern counties of the province \u2013 at Pu\u0142awy, Kurow, and Kazimierz Dolny. In early 1846, a group of Polish patriots attempted a failed uprising in the Free City of Krak\u00f3w. The insurrection was quickly suppressed by the Austrian troops, and as a result, the Free City was annexed by the Austrian Empire. In the same year, Austrian part of Lesser Poland was witness to a massacre of Polish nobility by the peasantry, known as Galician slaughter. The peasants, led by Jakub Szela, murdered about 1000 nobles, and destroyed about 500 manors. These events took place in three counties \u2013 Sanok, Jas\u0142o and Tarn\u00f3w.\nNorthern and central Lesser Poland (the part of the province which was taken by the Russian Empire) was one of the main centers of the January Uprising (1863\u20131864). In the first days of the insurrection, skirmishes with the Russian Army took place in such towns, as \u0141uk\u00f3w, Kra\u015bnik, Szyd\u0142owiec, Bodzentyn, and Suchedni\u00f3w. Since the Poles were poorly armed, the Russians did not have major problems with them, and soon afterwards, the insurrectionists decided to organize military camps. Among biggest camps in Lesser Poland, there were Ojc\u00f3w (3000 soldiers), and W\u0105chock, where Marian Langiewicz gathered up to 1500 people. The uprising died out by early spring of 1864, and among counties where it continued for the longest time, was the extreme northeastern corner of Lesser Poland, around \u0141uk\u00f3w, where reverend Stanis\u0142aw Brz\u00f3ska was active. Since Russian military supremacy was crushing, the Poles were forced to limit their actions to guerrilla warfare. Among the biggest battles which took place in Lesser Poland there are: Battle of Szyd\u0142owiec (23 January 1863); Battle of Miech\u00f3w (17 February 1863); Battle of Ma\u0142ogoszcz (24 February 1863); Battle of Stasz\u00f3w (17 February 1863); Battle of Pieskowa Ska\u0142a (4 March 1863); two Battles of Opat\u00f3w (25 November 1863, 21 February 1864).\nAs a result of their support of the failed insurrection, several Lesser Poland's towns lost their charters and were turned into villages. Among them were Kra\u015bnik, Bodzentyn, Opat\u00f3w, I\u0142\u017ca, Ma\u0142ogoszcz, W\u0105chock, Busko-Zdr\u00f3j, J\u0119drzej\u00f3w, Cmielow, Zwole\u0144, Drzewica, Wierzbica, Czelad\u017a, Kazimierz Dolny, Wolborz, Stopnica, Daleszyce, Wi\u015blica, Paj\u0119czno, Lipsko, Pacan\u00f3w, O\u017car\u00f3w, Wolbrom, Proszowice, Nowe Miasto Korczyn, W\u0142oszczowa, Przysucha, Opole Lubelskie.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lesser Poland remained one of the centers of Polish culture, especially the city of Krak\u00f3w, where Jagiellonian University was one of only two Polish-language colleges of that period (the other one was University of Lw\u00f3w). Another significant center of national culture was the town of Pu\u0142awy, where in the late 18th century, a local palace owned by Czartoryski family became a museum of Polish national memorabilia and a major cultural and political centre. A number of prominent artists, both representing Romanticism, and Positivism was born in Lesser Poland, including Wincenty Pol (born in Lublin), Stefan \u017beromski (born near Kielce), Aleksander \u015awi\u0119tochowski (born near \u0141uk\u00f3w in extreme northeast corner of Lesser Poland), Walery Przyborowski (born near Kielce), Piotr Micha\u0142owski, Helena Modjeska, Henryk Wieniawski (born in Lublin), Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski (born near Siedlce), Juliusz Kossak (born in Nowy Wi\u015bnicz), J\u00f3zef Szujski (born in Tarn\u00f3w). In the early 20th century, Lesser Poland, especially its part which belonged to Austria-Hungary, was a center of a cultural movement called Young Poland. Many artists associated with the movement were born in Lesser Poland, with the most prominent including W\u0142adys\u0142aw Orkan, Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Xawery Dunikowski, Jacek Malczewski, J\u00f3zef Mehoffer, and Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski.\nSince Austrian part of Poland enjoyed a wide autonomy, the province of Galicia, whose western part was made of Lesser Poland, became a hotbed of Polish conspirational activities. In anticipation of a future war, Galician Poles, with help of their brethren from other parts of the divided country, created several paramilitary organizations, such as Polish Rifle Squads, and Riflemen's Association. The capital of Lesser Poland, Krak\u00f3w, was a key center of pro-independence movements, with such individuals, as J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, being actively involved in those activities. In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, Pilsudski's Legions crossed the Austrian \u2013 Russian border north of Krak\u00f3w, and entered Congress Poland. However, the Pilsudski and his soldiers were disappointed to see that the inhabitants of Kielce did not welcome them with joy. The division of Lesser Poland was more visible than ever.\nDuring World War I, Lesser Poland became one of main theaters of the Eastern Front. Russian push into the territory of Austria \u2013 Hungary resulted in the Battle of Galicia. Among other major battles which took place in Lesser Poland, there are the Battle of the Vistula River, and the Gorlice-Tarn\u00f3w Offensive. After Russian troops had retreated east, whole province was under control of the Austrians and the Germans, and northern Lesser Poland was part of the German-sponsored Kingdom of Poland (1916\u20131918). In later stages of the conflict, the divided province once again became a center of Polish independence movement. An independent Polish government was re-proclaimed in northern Lesser Poland's city of Lublin, on 7 November 1918. Soon afterwards, it formed the basis of the new government of the country. In other parts of the province, other governments were formed \u2013 Polish Liquidation Commission in Krak\u00f3w, also the short-lived Republic of Tarnobrzeg.\nThe division of Lesser Poland along the Vistula river, which lasted from 1772 until 1918, is visible even today. For more than 100 years, southern Lesser Poland (Krak\u00f3w, Tarn\u00f3w, Biala Krakowska, and Nowy S\u0105cz) was administered by Austria, while northern, larger part of the province (Cz\u0119stochowa, Sosnowiec, Kielce, Radom, Lublin, Sandomierz) was forcibly part of the Russian Empire. Inhabitants of Austrian part of Poland enjoyed limited autonomy, with Polish language institutions, such as Jagiellonian University. At the same time, Russian-controlled Poland was subject to Russification. As a result of decades of this division, most inhabitants of the areas stolen by Russia are not aware of their Lesser Poland's heritage. Furthermore, current administrative boundaries of the country still reflect the defunct border between the former Russian and Austria\u2013Hungarian Empires.\nInterwar Poland (1918\u20131939).\nIn 1918, when Second Polish Republic was created, whole historical Lesser Poland became part of restored Poland. The historical area of the province was divided between four voivodeships: Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship (whole), Kielce Voivodeship (whole), Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship (northwestern corner), and Lublin Voivodeship (western part). Furthermore, in the counties of central Lesser Poland, another administrative unit, Sandomierz Voivodeship was planned, but due to the outbreak of World War II, it was never created. Boundaries between two major Lesser Poland voivodeships \u2013 Krak\u00f3w, and Kielce, were the same as pre-1914 boundaries of Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Nevertheless, in the interbellum period, the notion of Lesser Poland was frequently associated only with former Austrian province of Galicia. Therefore, Western Galicia to the San river, was called \"Western Lesser Poland\", while Eastern Galicia, east of the San, with the city of Lw\u00f3w (Lviv), was called \"Eastern Lesser Poland\" (voivodeships of Tarnopol, Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w, and Lw\u00f3w). According to a Polish historian Jan Pisuli\u0144ski, using the term \"Eastern Lesser Poland\" to denomine Eastern Galicia is incorrect, as it has no historical justification, being only a designation of nationalist and propaganda significance (similarly to analogous term \"Western Ukraine\" used at the same time by the Ukrainian side), which served in the 1920s and 1930s to make a stronger connection of the area between rivers of San and Zbruch with the Polish state and to emphasize the allegedly indigenously Polish nature of that region.\nIn late 1918, Lesser Poland emerged as one of main centers of fledgling Polish administration and independence movement. According to historian Kazimierz Banburski of Tarn\u00f3w's District Museum, Tarn\u00f3w was the first Polish city which became independent, after 123 years of oppression. On 31 October 1918, at 8\u00a0am, Tarn\u00f3w's inhabitants began disarming demoralized Austrian soldiers, and after three hours, the city was completely in Polish hands. On 28 October 1918, Polish Liquidation Committee was created in Krak\u00f3w. A few days later, socialist peasants founded the Republic of Tarnobrzeg. In the night of 6/7 November 1918, \"Polish People's Republic\" was proclaimed in Lublin, by Ignacy Daszynski and other activists. In 1919, the legislative election took place in Lesser Poland without major problems.\nAt that time Lesser Poland, like other provinces of the country, faced several problems. Even though major post-World War I conflicts (such as Polish\u2013Soviet War) did not take place there, it suffered from unemployment, overpopulation, and poverty, especially in towns and countryside. Furthermore, Polish government had to connect parts of the hitherto divided country. There was no direct rail link between Krak\u00f3w, and Kielce, Radom, and Lublin, and until 1934, when line from Krak\u00f3w to Tunel was opened, all travelers had to go via Sosnowiec \u2013 Maczki. Lack of rail communication between former Austrian and former Russian parts of Lesser Poland is visible even today. Between Krak\u00f3w and D\u0119blin, there are only two rail bridges along the Vistula. Residents of the province tried to improve their conditions using legal means, but when it turned out to be impossible, they took to fighting (1923 Krak\u00f3w riot, 1937 peasant strike in Poland). As if to exacerbate the desperate situation, Lesser Poland witnessed a catastrophic flood in 1934, after which the government decided to construct dams on local rivers.\nEven though Lesser Poland's countryside was almost exclusively Polish, its towns and cities were inhabited by numerous Jews, whose communities were very vibrant. In Krak\u00f3w, Jews made 25% of the population, in Lublin \u2013 31%, in Kielce \u2013 30%, and in Radom \u2013 32%. Apart from the Jews, and Gypsies scattered in the south, there were no other significant national minorities in interbellum Lesser Poland.\nSince Lesser Poland was safely located in the middle of the country, away from both German and Soviet border, in the mid-1930s Polish government initiated one of the most ambitious project of the Second Polish Republic \u2013 Central Industrial Region, which was located almost exclusively in Lesser Poland. Even though the project was never completed, several plants were constructed, both in Old-Polish Industrial Region, and in other counties of the province. The brand new city of Stalowa Wola was established in dense forests, around a steel mill. In the late 1930s, Lesser Poland was quickly changing, as construction of several factories, and job opportunities caused influx of rural inhabitants to the towns. Such towns, as D\u0119bica, Starachowice, Pu\u0142awy, or Kra\u015bnik, quickly grew, with their population rising. Earlier, in 1927, Lesser Poland's D\u0119blin became a major center of Polish aviation, when Polish Air Force Academy was opened there, and in Mielec, PZL Mielec was opened, which was the largest aerospace manufacturer in Poland. Central Industrial Region, however, did not affect western counties of Lesser Poland, which had already been urbanized and industrialized (Biala Krakowska, \u017bywiec, Krak\u00f3w, Jaworzno, Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie, Zawiercie, and Cz\u0119stochowa). The government of Poland planned further investments, such as a major East \u2013 West rail line, linking Volhynia, and Upper Silesia, but they never materialized. Desperate situation and lack of jobs caused thousands of inhabitants of Lesser Poland (especially from its southern part) to leave their land, mostly for the United States of America, but also Brazil, and Canada.\nLesser Poland remained a center of Polish culture, with Krak\u00f3w's Jagiellonian University, AGH University of Science and Technology, and Catholic University of Lublin, which was opened in 1918. Several important figures of interbellum political, military, and cultural life of Poland were born in Lesser Poland. Among them were Wincenty Witos, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, J\u00f3zef Dowbor-Mu\u015bnicki, J\u00f3zef Haller, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Belina-Pra\u017cmowski, Tadeusz Kutrzeba, Feliks Koneczny, Stefan \u017beromski, Tadeusz Peiper, Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska, Witold Gombrowicz, Jan Kiepura, Stefan Jaracz. In 1920, in Lesser Poland's town of Wadowice, Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II, was born.\nWorld War II.\nOn 1 September 1939, armed forces of Nazi Germany attacked Poland (see: Invasion of Poland). Lesser Poland, due to its proximity to the then-border with Germany, became a battleground on the first day of the invasion. The Germans attacked the province both in its northwest (area west of Cz\u0119stochowa), and in the south (Podhale), along the border with Slovakia, which also participated in the invasion.\nLesser Poland was defended by the following Polish armies:\nAfter a few days the Battle of the Border was lost, and forces of German Army Group South advanced deep into Lesser Poland's territory. Polish troops resisted fiercely, and among major battles in initial stages of the war, which took place in Lesser Poland, there are Battle of Mokra, Battle of Jordan\u00f3w, and Battle of W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka. By 6 September, Polish forces were in general retreat and Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y ordered all troops to fall back to the secondary lines of defences at the Vistula and San Rivers. German units entered Cz\u0119stochowa on 3 September (where on the next day they murdered hundreds of civilians), Kielce on 5 September, Krak\u00f3w on 6 September, and Radom on 8 September (see also Battle of Radom). Within a week, almost whole Lesser Poland was under Nazi occupation. Northeastern part of the province, the area of Lublin, was held by the Poles until 17 September, but eventually, and after fierce battles (see Battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski), all Lesser Poland was firmly under Nazi control. First draft of Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact stipulated that northEastern Lesser Poland (east of the Vistula river) was to be occupied by the Soviet Union, and forces of the Red Army reached the area of Lublin after 20 September, but withdrew east on 28 September.\nOn 12 October 1939, upon a decree of Adolf Hitler, General Government, a separate region of the Greater German Reich was created, with Hans Frank as its Governor-General. Its capital was established in Krak\u00f3w, and it covered most of the area of historical Lesser Poland, except for its western counties, which were directly incorporated into Nazi Germany's Upper Silesia Province (B\u0119dzin, Sosnowiec, Zawiercie, Bia\u0142a, \u017bywiec, Chrzan\u00f3w, Olkusz).\nIn Lesser Poland, like in all provinces of the occupied country, the Nazis ruled with savage brutality, killing hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, both Polish and Jewish (see: World War II crimes in Poland, Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945), Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Poland, Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles, German AB-Aktion in Poland, Sonderaktion Krakau). The Auschwitz concentration camp, located at the border of Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia, was opened on 14 June 1940, and on 1 October 1941, the Germans opened Majdanek concentration camp on the outskirts of Lublin. The third concentration camp in Lesser Poland was in Krak\u00f3w's district of P\u0142asz\u00f3w. In late 1939 and early 1940, in Lesser Poland's spa of Zakopane, and in Krak\u00f3w, several Gestapo\u2013NKVD Conferences took place, during which the mutual cooperation between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union was discussed.\nAnti-Nazi resistance was particularly strong in Lesser Poland, and it was in the extreme northwestern corner of the province (around Opoczno), that armed struggle against the occupiers began in late 1939 and early 1940 (see Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski). Structures of the Home Army were well-developed in the region. Lesser Poland's independent areas of the Home Army were located in Krak\u00f3w, Kielce-Radom, and Lublin. During Operation Tempest in mid-1944, several Lesser Poland's towns were liberated, also uprising in Krak\u00f3w was prepared, but never realized. Apart from the Home Army, other resistance groups were strong in the province, such as pro-Communist Armia Ludowa, peasant's Bataliony Ch\u0142opskie, and right-wing National Armed Forces, with its Holy Cross Mountains Brigade.\nIn all major Lesser Poland's cities, Jewish ghettos were opened, with the biggest ones in Krak\u00f3w, and Lublin. At first the Nazis were planning to create a so-called \"reservation\" for European Jews, located around Lesser Poland's town of Nisko (see Nisko Plan), but they changed the plan, and decided to murder all Jews. Condemned to death, Jews in Lesser Poland took to fighting (see Cz\u0119stochowa Ghetto Uprising), but their efforts failed. As a result of The Holocaust in Poland, once thriving and numerous Jewish population of Lesser Poland was decimated.\nGermany operated several prisoner-of-war camps, including Stalag 301, Stalag 307, Stalag 359, Stalag 367, Stalag 369, Stalag 380, Stalag XII-C, Oflag 77, and multiple forced labour subcamps of Stalag VIII-B/344, for Polish, French, Belgian, Italian, Soviet, Dutch, Senegalese and other Allied POWs in the region.\nIn the summer of 1944, after Lvov\u2013Sandomierz Offensive, Red Army pushed the Wehrmacht from Eastern Lesser Poland. The city of Lublin was captured by the Soviets on 22 July 1944, Stalowa Wola \u2013 on 1 August, and Sandomierz, on the left bank of the Vistula \u2013 on 18 August. The front line stabilized along the Vistula for about six months (with some bridgeheads on the western bank on the Vistula \u2013 see Battle of Studzianki), and in early 1945, Soviet Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive began, which pushed Germans to the gates of Berlin. The Soviets entered Kielce on 15 January, Cz\u0119stochowa \u2013 on 17 January, and Krak\u00f3w on 19 January. On 27 January, the Red Army entered Sosnowiec. In took the Soviets much longer to clear the areas in the mountains \u2013 they did not enter \u017bywiec until 5 April 1945.\nPost-World War II.\nTogether with the Red Army, NKVD and Soviet authorities followed, whose purpose was to make Poland a Communist country, with a puppet government, formed as Polish Committee of National Liberation. Since 1 August 1944, the provisional government was officially headquartered in Lesser Poland's Lublin. Thousands of people took to the forests, to continue their fight for free Poland (see Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944\u201346)). Lesser Poland again was one of the main centers of the resistance. Several skirmishes took place in the province, including Battle of Kury\u0142\u00f3wka. The Communists did not hesitate to kill those rebels they captured (Public execution in D\u0119bica (1946)), and by 1947, the resistance movement was crushed. The last Polish cursed soldier, J\u00f3zef Franczak, was killed in 1963 near \u015awidnik in northEastern Lesser Poland. Also, all victims of the 1951 Mokot\u00f3w Prison execution were members of Lesser Poland's branch of Freedom and Independence. Another well-known anti-Communist fighter from Lesser Poland is J\u00f3zef Kura\u015b, who was active in the southern region of Podhale.\nIn early 1945, the lands of Lesser Poland were divided between three voivodeships \u2013 those of Krak\u00f3w, Lublin, and Kielce. Since summer 1945, several counties were transferred to neighboring voivodeships \u2013 Eastern Lesser Poland (D\u0119bica, Jas\u0142o, Mielec) became part of Rzesz\u00f3w Voivodeship, while western counties of B\u0119dzin and Zawiercie were transferred to Katowice Voivodeship. In 1950, the city of Cz\u0119stochowa became part of Katowice Voivodeship, and next year, the city of Bielsko-Bia\u0142a was created out of Lesser Poland's Biala Krakowska, and Upper Silesia's Bielsko. The new city became part of Katowice Voivodeship. Lesser Poland was further divided in 1975, when territorial reform was carried out (see Voivodeships of Poland (1975\u20131988)). Counties were abolished, and several small voivodeships were created, in such Lesser Poland's towns and cities, as Tarnobrzeg, Tarn\u00f3w, Nowy S\u0105cz, Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Radom, Cz\u0119stochowa, and Siedlce.\nThe government of Communist Poland invested in heavy industry, following the pre-1939 idea of Central Industrial Area. In Krak\u00f3w, a new district of Nowa Huta was constructed in the 1950s. In Cz\u0119stochowa and Zawiercie, the steelworks were significantly expanded, and in early 1970, the government initiated construction of Katowice Steelworks, which, despite its name, is located in Lesser Poland's D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza. To connect Katowice Steelworks with Soviet plants, in late 1970s Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line was opened, which crossed Lesser Poland from west to east. Among other major factories, opened in Lesser Poland during Communist rule, there are:\nOther Lesser Poland's major plants were significantly expanded after 1945, including \u017bywiec Brewery, Okocim Brewery, Fablok, \u0141ucznik Arms Factory, F\u0141T-Kra\u015bnik, Jaworzno Power Station, Siersza Power Plant, Huta Stalowa Wola, Janina Coal Mine, Sobieski Coal Mine, Zak\u0142ady Azotowe Tarn\u00f3w-Mo\u015bcice. Furthermore, in early 1950s significant sulfur resources were discovered in Tarnobrzeg, as a result of which Siarkopol company was founded, and the city of Tarnobrzeg quickly grew. In 1975, coal was discovered northeast of Lublin, and soon afterwards, Bogdanka Coal Mine and Piaski Coal Mine were opened.\nBetween 1971 and 1977, Central Trunk Line was opened, which goes along western boundary of the province, and which connects Krak\u00f3w and Katowice, with Warsaw. In the early 1980s, construction of a highway between Krak\u00f3w and Katowice began. The 61-kilometer road is now run by Stalexport Autostrada Ma\u0142opolska, and is part of A4 highway.\nResidents of Lesser Poland frequently protested against Communist government. Major centers of anti-Communist resistance were in Krak\u00f3w, Nowa Huta, Radom, and Lublin. Among major protests that took place in the province were 1968 Polish political crisis (with Krak\u00f3w as one of major centers of protests), June 1976 protests (in Radom), Lublin 1980 strikes, 31 August 1982 demonstrations in Poland (in several locations), 1988 Polish strikes (with Stalowa Wola as one of major centers). Several anti-Nazi, and anti-Communist leaders hailed from Lesser Poland: Jan Piwnik, Emil August Fieldorf, Leopold Okulicki, Ryszard Siwiec, Stanis\u0142aw Pyjas, Hieronim Dekutowski, Andrzej Gwiazda, Andrzej Czuma.\nA number of key personalities of Communist government were born in Lesser Poland, including J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz, Boles\u0142aw Bierut, Edward Gierek, Wojciech Jaruzelski, Czes\u0142aw Kiszczak, Stanis\u0142aw Kania, Hilary Minc, Edward Ochab, Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski, J\u00f3zef Oleksy.\nAmong prominent personalities of Polish cultural life of the 20th century, who were born in Lesser Poland, there are: Xawery Dunikowski, Witold Gombrowicz, Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski, S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek, Tadeusz Kantor, Jan Kanty Pawlu\u015bkiewicz, Marek Kondrat, Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska, Krzysztof Penderecki, Zbigniew Preisner, Leon Schiller, Jerzy Stuhr, Jan Sztaudynger, Grzegorz Turnau, Jerzy Turowicz.\nLocal Government Reorganization Act (1998).\nIn 1998, the government of Poland carried out administrative reform of the country. For the first time in history, Lesser Poland Voivodeship was created, with its capital in Krak\u00f3w, and an area of 15,108 square kilometers. The new province covers only a small, southwestern part of historical Lesser Poland.\nToday, Lesser Poland is divided between several voivodeships: whole Lesser Poland Voivodeship, whole \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship, western half of Lublin Voivodeship, western part of Subcarpathian Voivodeship, eastern half of Silesian Voivodeship, southern part of Mazovian Voivodeship and southeastern corner of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship (around Opoczno).\nThere were suggestions that Lesser Poland Voivodeship should stretch from Bielsko-Bia\u0142a to Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski and Sandomierz. Furthermore, creation of an Old Poland Voivodeship was proposed, on the historical lands of northern Lesser Poland. Also, since about half of territory of current Silesian Voivodeship belongs to historical Lesser Poland, there are suggestions to rename it into \"Silesian \u2013 Lesser Poland Voivodeship\".\nMajor cities and towns (by size).\nIn the Kingdom of Poland and Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, several other locations used to be important urban centers of Lesser Poland, but in the course of the time, their significance declined. The main example is Sandomierz, which for hundreds of years was one of the most important cities of Poland, but now is a town of 25,000. Other examples of historically important places, which are now little towns or villages are:\nEconomy and industry.\nHistory of industry in Lesser Poland goes back to prehistoric times, when in \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains, first bloomeries were constructed. In the Middle Ages, first plants were opened in that area, and as a result, Old-Polish Industrial Region was created, which was a major industrial region of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the 17th century, first Polish blast furnaces were constructed in Samson\u00f3w by Italian engineer Hieronim Caccio. Apart from iron products, used for military purposes, Old-Polish Industrial Region also manufactured charcoal and glass. In 1782, in Poland there were 34 bloomeries, out of which 27 were located in Old-Polish Industrial Region. Another major industrial area of Lesser Poland is Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie, where in the 16th century, lead, silver, and zinc were found. As early as in the 15th century, coal was extracted in Trzebinia \u2013 Siersza, and in the following centuries, especially in the 19th century, several coal mines and steel mills were opened in Zag\u0142\u0119bie and in Zag\u0142\u0119bie Krakowskie (first coal mine in Jaworzno was opened in 1792). In nearby Olkusz, the history of zinc mining dates to the 12th century when Casimir II the Just set up a mining settlement. Also, in the towns of Wieliczka and Bochnia, salt mines were established in the 12th and 13th centuries (see Bochnia Salt Mine, Wieliczka Salt Mine).\nIn the 20th century, natural resources were also discovered in central and eastern counties Lesser Poland.\nIn 1964, the world's largest open-pit sulfur mine was opened in Mach\u00f3w near Tarnobrzeg. Other sulfur deposits in the area of Tarnobrzeg are Jeziorko, Grzyb\u00f3w-Gacki, and Gr\u0119b\u00f3w-Wydza. The mine at Mach\u00f3w is now closed. In the late 1960s, Eastern Lesser Poland became one of three coal basins of the country, when Lublin Basin was created. Major coal mine in the area is KWK Bogdanka near \u0141\u0119czna, which is the only coal mine in Poland which has continuously generated a profit. Other Polish coal mines located in Lesser Poland are those found in western part of the province, along the boundary with Upper Silesia \u2013 KWK Janina in Jaworzno, KWK Sobieski, and also in Jaworzno. Copper and silver are extracted in Myszk\u00f3w (see Myszk\u00f3w mine).\nIn the late 1930s, the government of the Second Polish Republic created Central Industrial Region, which was almost exclusively located in Lesser Poland. Currently, within borders of the province, there are following industrial regions:\nIn 2009, Polityka weekly made its own list of 500 biggest Polish companies. According to the list, second biggest company of the country was Polska Grupa Energetyczna, which, as Polityka stated, is headquartered in Lublin. Third biggest company of Poland in 2009 was \"Fiat Auto Poland\" from Bielsko-Bia\u0142a. Other Lesser Polish companies which ranked high were: \"BP Poland\" from Krak\u00f3w (ranked 12th), \"Emperia Holding\" from Lublin (ranked 26th), Kolporter Holding from Kielce (ranked 43rd), and \u017bywiec Brewery (ranked 44th). Other major companies of Lesser Poland are \"Azoty Tarn\u00f3w\", Bank BPH, Bogdanka Coal Mine, Carlsberg Polska, Comarch, \"D\u0119bica SA\", \"Huta Cz\u0119stochowa\", \"Huta Katowice\", Fablok, F\u0141T-Kra\u015bnik, Huta Stalowa Wola, \"Instal-Lublin\", Janina Coal Mine, Jaworzno Power Station, Kozienice Power Station, \u0141ucznik Arms Factory, \"Nowiny Cement Plant\" near Kielce, Po\u0142aniec Power Station, PZL Mielec, PZL-\u015awidnik, Sobieski Coal Mine, Tadeusz Sendzimir Steelworks.\nSince the lands of historical Lesser Poland belong now to different voivodeships, unemployment rate differs from one region to another. In January 2010, in Poland the unemployment rate was 12,7%. In Silesian Voivodeship, eastern half of which is Lesser Poland, it was 9,9%, in Lesser Poland Voivodeship \u2013 10,5%, in Subcarpathian Voivodeship \u2013 16,3%, in Holy Cross Voivodeship \u2013 15,5%, in Lublin Voivodeship \u2013 13,6%, and in Mazovian Voivodeship (southern part of which is Lesser Poland) \u2013 9,6%. In Lesser Poland's cities, the best situation was in Krak\u00f3w (as for November 2009), where 4,1% had no job. In Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, the rate was 5,7%, in Lublin \u2013 8,8%, in Siedlce \u2013 9,1%, in Tarn\u00f3w \u2013 9,2%, in Nowy S\u0105cz \u2013 10%, in Kielce and Cz\u0119stochowa \u2013 10,1%, in Jaworzno \u2013 10,2%, in D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza \u2013 10,3%, in Sosnowiec \u2013 12,2%, and in Tarnobrzeg \u2013 14,3%. The worst situation on the job market (as for November 2009) was in Radom, where unemployment rate was 20,9% (it made Radom second worst city county of the nation, only after Grudzi\u0105dz).\nTransport.\nRoads.\nSeveral European roads (see International E-road network) cross Lesser Poland. The most important one is the European route E40, which goes from west to east, across whole Europe. In Lesser Poland, the E40 goes from Jaworzno, via Krak\u00f3w and Tarn\u00f3w, towards eastern border of the country. Another main European road in Lesser Poland is the E77, which goes from north to south, via Radom, Kielce and Krak\u00f3w, to southern border of Poland at Chy\u017cne. Third major European road in Lesser Poland is the E30, which crosses the territory of the province in its extreme northeast corner, in Siedlce. Apart from these roads, Lesser Poland is crossed by the following European routes:\nAirports.\nWithin borders of historical Lesser Poland, there are four airports \u2013 John Paul II International Airport Krak\u00f3w\u2013Balice, Lublin Airport, Warsaw Radom Airport and Katowice International Airport, which is located in the village of Pyrzowice, on the border between Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia. Pyrzowice is part of Gmina O\u017carowice, which after Partitions of Poland, and Congress of Vienna belonged to B\u0119dzin County of the Russian Empire. In the interbellum, the area of future airport belonged to Lesser Poland's Kielce Voivodeship, and in 1945, was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (initially \"Silesian-D\u0105browa Voivodeship\"). In 1998, O\u017carowice, together with the airport, was attached to Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry County, despite the fact that it is not located in Upper Silesia\nFurther airports in Lesser Poland will be opened in the future \u2013 Kielce \u2013 Obice. Also, Rzesz\u00f3w-Jasionka Airport is located on eastern border of the province.\nRailroads.\nRailroad network of Lesser Poland is very unevenly distributed. It is very dense in the west, along the border with Upper Silesia, and sparse in the east, especially along the Vistula, and around Lublin. All major cities of the province are connected with each other, however traveling from Krak\u00f3w to Lublin is time-consuming, as trains have to take an extended route, via Kielce, Radom, and D\u0119blin. Also, there is no direct connection between Tarn\u00f3w and Kielce, as these cities belonged to different countries before 1918. Underdevelopment of the railroads in northern and Eastern Lesser Poland is the result of the policy of the Russian Empire. For military reasons, the Russians were not interested in construction of a dense network of lines along the border with Germany and Austria-Hungary, allowing only the construction of narrow-gauge connections. Along the Vistula, between Krak\u00f3w and D\u0119blin (the distance of some 320 kilometers), there are only four rail bridges \u2013 in D\u0119blin (rebuilt after the war, in 1947), in Sandomierz (built in 1928), in Tarnobrzeg-Nagnaj\u00f3w (built in 1961, together with a road bridge), and in Zaduszniki (built in 1979 for the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line). In Krak\u00f3w itself, there are three rail bridges over the Vistula.\nAmong rail hubs of Lesser Poland, there are Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Chab\u00f3wka, Cz\u0119stochowa, D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza, D\u0119bica, D\u0119blin, Jaworzno-Szczakowa, Kalwaria Zebrzydowska Lanckorona, Kielce, Koniecpol, Koz\u0142\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w, Lublin, \u0141uk\u00f3w, Muszyna, Nowy S\u0105cz, O\u015bwi\u0119cim, Siedlce, Spytkowice, Skar\u017cysko-Kamienna, Stalowa Wola, Str\u00f3\u017ce, Sucha Beskidzka, Radom, Tarn\u00f3w, Trzebinia, Tunel, Zawiercie, and \u017bywiec.\nIn the late 1970s, the Communist government built the broad-gauge Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line, which crosses Lesser Poland from west to east along the Vistula.\nTourism and nature.\nThe historical capital of Lesser Poland \u2013 Krak\u00f3w \u2013 is regarded as the cultural capital of Poland, while Zakopane is considered the winter capital of Poland. In 1978, UNESCO placed Krak\u00f3w's Old Town on the list of World Heritage Sites. From Sandomierz to Krak\u00f3w goes the re-established Lesser Polish Way, one of the routes of the medieval Way of St. James. Every year, hundreds of thousands of tourists come to Lesser Poland, to see its historic cities \u2013 Sandomierz, Kazimierz Dolny, Zakopane, Biecz, Opat\u00f3w, Szyd\u0142\u00f3w, Lublin, and Krak\u00f3w. Famous Jasna G\u00f3ra Monastery in Cz\u0119stochowa, spiritual capital of the country, attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, as well as Auschwitz concentration camp (also placed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites List). Lesser Poland has many museums, the city of Krak\u00f3w itself has about sixty of them. Among the most famous are The Czartoryski Museum, The Galicia Jewish Museum, The National Museum, Krak\u00f3w, Polish Aviation Museum, Sukiennice Museum, and Wawel Castle. There are museums in other locations of the province, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, Bielsko-Bia\u0142a Museum, Holy Father John Paul II Family Home in Wadowice, \"Jacek Malczewski Museum in Radom\", \"Lublin Museum\", \"Museum of Cz\u0119stochowa\", \"Museum of Sandomierz Diocese\", \"Museum of \u017bywiec Brewery\", \"Museum of Zag\u0142\u0119bie in B\u0119dzin\", Przypkowscy Clock Museum, \"Regional Museum in Wi\u015blica\", \"Regional Museum in Siedlce\", \"Tytus Cha\u0142ubi\u0144ski Tatra Museum in Zakopane\".\nAmong other major places of interest of the province are: Baran\u00f3w Sandomierski Castle, B\u0119dzin Castle, Ch\u0119ciny Castle, Czarnolas in Zwole\u0144, Dunajec river castles, Kalwaria Zebrzydowska park (UNESCO World Heritage Sites List), Krzy\u017ctop\u00f3r, Lipnica Murowana, Lublin Castle, \u0141ysa G\u00f3ra, Maczuga Herkulesa, Majdanek concentration camp, Niedzica Castle, Ogrodzieniec, Pieskowa Ska\u0142a, Temple of the Sibyl, Trail of the Eagles' Nests, Wieliczka Salt Mine (UNESCO World Heritage Sites List), Wooden Churches of Southern Lesser Poland (UNESCO World Heritage Sites List). Furthermore, thousands of tourists come to Radom in northern Lesser Poland, to watch the popular, biannual Radom Air Show. Lesser Poland has a number of open-air museums \u2013 \"G\u00f3ra Bir\u00f3w\" in Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland, \"Museum of Kielce Village\" in Kielce, \"Museum of Lublin Village\" in Lublin, \"Museum of Folk Culture\" in Kolbuszowa, \"Museum of Radom Village\" in Radom, \"Vistula River Etnographic Park\" in Babice, \"Nowy S\u0105cz Etnographic Park\" in Nowy S\u0105cz, \"Orawa Etnographic Park\" in Zubrzyca G\u00f3rna, \"Chab\u00f3wka Rolling-Stock Heritage Park\" in Chab\u00f3wka. The Ma\u0142opolska Institute of Culture, located in Krak\u00f3w, promotes the activities of regional museums and smaller sites of interest.\nLesser Poland is famous for its underground waters and spas, such as Busko-Zdr\u00f3j, Solec-Zdr\u00f3j, Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w, Muszyna, Szczawnica, Piwniczna, Wysowa-Zdr\u00f3j, Rabka, Swoszowice, \u017begiest\u00f3w, Krzeszowice, Wieliczka, and Krynica-Zdr\u00f3j. Mountains and resorts of the province make it a major center of Polish tourism \u2013 Tatra National Park is visited by around 3 million tourists every year.\nThe following National Parks are located in Lesser Poland:\nEducation.\nUniversities.\nLesser Poland is home to Poland's oldest university \u2013 Krak\u00f3w's Jagiellonian University, which was established in 1364. For centuries, it was the only college of the province, and of the whole country. In December 1918, John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin was opened, becoming second university of Lesser Poland. In 1944, also in Lublin, Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University was established.\nTechnical universities.\nThere are several technical universities in Lesser Poland \u2013 Krak\u00f3w's AGH University of Science and Technology, and University of Technology, as well as University of Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Cz\u0119stochowa University of Technology, Lublin University of Technology, Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski Technical University of Radom, and Kielce University of Technology.\nOther colleges.\nFuture teachers may study at Pedagogical University of Cracow, or Jan D\u0142ugosz University in Cz\u0119stochowa, and future physicians at Jagiellonian University Medical College, and Medical University of Lublin. Other state colleges are Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Pontifical University of John Paul II in Krak\u00f3w, Agricultural University of Cracow, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, and Cracow University of Economics. Unique in the country is the Polish Air Force Academy, located in D\u0119blin. Among private colleges of Lesser Poland, there is Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Biznesu \u2013 National-Louis University in Nowy S\u0105cz.\nRegional identity and culture.\nSince Lesser Poland ceased to exist as a unified region in the late 18th century, during the Partitions of Poland, most of its inhabitants are not aware of their heritage. Even the residents of Jaworzno, a city which for centuries belonged to Krak\u00f3w Land and only in 1975 was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (see Voivodeships of Poland (1975\u201398)), are not familiar with their Lesser Polish roots. In a poll in April 2011, 57% of Jaworzno's inhabitants stated that their city is historically tied with Lesser Poland, but as many as 36% said their city is tied with Upper Silesia. Polish linguist Jan Miodek emphasizes the fact that linguistically, B\u0119dzin is closer to My\u015blenice than to Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry, only 20\u00a0km away. Miodek wrote that even though Upper Silesia and Lesser Poland's Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie are industrially and administratively tied, both regions are culturally and linguistically different from each other. Residents of Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie are known for their dislike of Upper Silesians, whom they call \"hanysy\", while the Silesians call them \"gorole\". In recent years, more inhabitants of Zag\u0142\u0119bie become aware of their Lesser Poland's heritage, Also, after Partitions of Poland, when Austrian province of Galicia was created, the cities of Rzesz\u00f3w and Przemy\u015bl, which are part of historical Red Ruthenia/Cherven Cities, became associated with Lesser Poland. Therefore, currently the notion of Lesser Poland most commonly applies to the two voivodeships which in the past belonged to Austrian Empire \u2013 Lesser Poland Voivodeship, and Subcarpathian Voivodeship\nAmong several Lesser Poland's regional organizations, one of the most important is \"Stowarzyszenie Gmin i Powiat\u00f3w Ma\u0142opolski\" (\"The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland\"). It publishes a magazine called \"Wsp\u00f3lnota Ma\u0142opolska\" (\"Lesser Polish Community\"), and every year it chooses a \"Lesser Polish Person of the Year\" (among winners are John Paul II, Anna Dymna, and Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz). \"The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland\" has over 120 members from four Polish voivodeships. Among members are cities of Krak\u00f3w, Cz\u0119stochowa, Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Tarn\u00f3w, and Przemy\u015bl.\nArguably, the most famous product of Lesser Polish cuisine is the bagel, which was invented in Krak\u00f3w. Other famous food specialties of the province are oscypek (EU Protected Geographical Status), slivovitz from the village of \u0141\u0105cko, bublik, papal cream cake from Wadowice, Lisiecka Sausage (EU Protected Geographical Status), and Bryndza Podhala\u0144ska. Among other popular products that are made in Lesser Poland, there are beers (Browary Lubelskie, \u017bywiec Beer, and Okocim Beer), pastas and snacks from Lublin's Lubella, Kielce Mayonnaise, coffee substitute beverage INKA from Skawina, chocolates from Krak\u00f3w's Wawel Factory, juices from Tymbark, vodka \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa Gorzka produced in Lublin, and Chopin produced in Siedlce.\nFolk costumes from Lesser Poland are widely known across the country \u2013 a dancing couple, dressed in traditional Krak\u00f3w costume (Krakowiacy), is presented on the logo of renowned \u017bywiec beer, and Podhale is one of few Polish regions, where people regularly wear their traditional costumes. Both Krak\u00f3w and Podhale folk costumes are among most popular garbs in Poland. Other folk costumes from the region are those of Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie, Sandomierz, Rzesz\u00f3w, Cz\u0119stochowa, Kielce, Radom (regarded as the most traditional of all Polish costumes), Opoczno, Holy Cross Mountains, Nowy S\u0105cz, and Lublin. There are several folk festivals in Lesser Poland, such as \"On the frontier of Lesser Poland and Mazovia\" (in Opoczno), \"Folk Festival of J\u00f3zef Myszka\" (in Museum of Radom Village in I\u0142\u017ca), annual \"Days of Lesser Poland's Cultural Heritage\", \"Week of the Beskidy Culture\" (in several locations), Wianki in Krak\u00f3w, \"Festival of Old Music and Culture\" in Niepo\u0142omice, \"Festival of Folk Bands and Folk Singers\" in Kazimierz Dolny, \"International Folklore Meetings of Ignacy Wachowiak\" in Lublin, \"International Festival of Folklore of Mountain Lands\" in Zakopane, Jewish Culture Festival in Krak\u00f3w. Krakowiak is one of Polish national dances, other popular Lesser Poland's folk dances are \"Zb\u00f3jnicki\" from Podhale and dances from Lublin. Among Lesser Poland's customs are Lajkonik, and Krak\u00f3w szopka.\nSports and entertainment.\nSeveral renowned sportspeople and entertainers come from Lesser Poland. Among them are some of the most famous personalities of contemporary Polish sports \u2013 boxer Tomasz Adamek, Formula 1 driver Robert Kubica, swimmer Pawe\u0142 Korzeniowski, skier Justyna Kowalczyk, tennis player Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska, football and volleyball stars Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski, Artur Boruc, and Piotr Gruszka. Among late and retired sports stars who were born in the region, there also are Polish Sportspersonalities of the Year: tennis player and Wimbledon finalist Jadwiga J\u0119drzejowska, skier J\u00f3zef \u0141uszczek, ski jumper Stanis\u0142aw Marusarz, and driver Sobies\u0142aw Zasada.\nKrak\u00f3w's major association football teams \u2013 KS Cracovia, and Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w, are multiple champions of the country, also Stal Mielec won Polish championship twice (1973, 1976), and Garbarnia Krak\u00f3w and Rak\u00f3w Cz\u0119stochowa once each (1931 and 2023). Other popular football teams from Lesser Poland are Zag\u0142\u0119bie Sosnowiec (four time Polish Cup winner), G\u00f3rnik \u0141\u0119czna, Korona Kielce, Motor Lublin, Radomiak Radom, Stal Stalowa Wola, and Sandecja Nowy S\u0105cz.\nBesides association football, Lesser Poland's teams were multiple national champions in other sports:\nMajor sports venues of the province are Stadion Miejski im. Henryka Reymana, Stadion Cracovii im. J\u00f3zefa Pi\u0142sudskiego and Tauron Arena Krak\u00f3w in Krak\u00f3w, Stadion Miejski, Hala Legion\u00f3w and Kielce Racetrack in Kielce, Arena Lublin and Hala Globus in Lublin, Miejski Stadion Sportowy \"KSZO\" w Ostrowcu Sw., Zag\u0142\u0119biowski Park Sportowy in Sosnowiec, D\u0119bowiec Sports Arena in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Arena Cz\u0119stochowa, Hala Sportowa MOSiR in Radom, Wielka Krokiew in Zakopane.\nAmong popular rock music bands from Lesser Poland, there are Budka Suflera, Golec uOrkiestra, Maanam, and Zakopower. From Lesser Poland hail composers Jan Kanty Pawlu\u015bkiewicz, and Krzysztof Penderecki, as well as singers Basia, Ewa Demarczyk, Justyna Steczkowska, Grzegorz Turnau, Maciej Zembaty. Major music festivals in the province are: \"Coke Live Music Festival\" in Krak\u00f3w, \"Celtic Music Festival ZAMEK\" in B\u0119dzin, \"Film Music Festival\" in Krak\u00f3w, \"Gaude Mater\" in Cz\u0119stochowa, \"Boyscout's Festival of School Music\" in Kielce, \"Summer with Chopin\" in Busko-Zdr\u00f3j, \"Festiwal of Shanties\" in Krak\u00f3w, and \"Festival of Student Song\" in Krak\u00f3w.\nLesser Polish dialect of Polish.\nLesser Polish dialect is spoken in southeastern corner of Poland, both in lands which belong to historical Lesser Poland, and in areas which are not part of the province (around Sieradz and \u0141\u0119czyca). On the other hand, as seen on the map, the Lesser Polish dialect is not spoken in the extreme northeast of Lesser Poland, in Siedlce and vicinity, where people rather speak Masovian dialect. Descending from the language of the Vistulans, it is the most numerous dialectal group in modern Poland. According to Wincenty Pol, it is divided into three subdivisions: Sandomierz dialect, Lublin dialect, and Sanok dialect.\nIn the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Lesser Polish dialect, together with Greater Polish dialect, contributed to creation of standard Polish, it also greatly influenced Silesian (see Dialects of Polish), as well as dialects of Polish used in southern part of Kresy Wschodnie. Later on, however, its importance diminished and was replaced by Masovian dialect, which became the leading dialect of Polish. After Partitions of Poland, when Lesser Poland was divided between Austria and Russia, northern areas of the province took over many features of the Masovian dialect, while Lesser Polish dialect in Austrian province of Galicia was heavily influenced by German.\nAccording to Multimedia Guide to Polish Dialects, a webpage maintained by University of Warsaw, Lesser Polish dialect is divided into the following subdialects:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(LTCM) was an American hedge fund which used highly leveraged strategies. In 1998 when LTCM was on the verge of collapse, the fund received a $3.6 billion bailout from a group of 14 banks, in a deal brokered and put together by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, due to fears the collapse of LTCM would have disastrous effects on the larger financial system.\nLTCM was founded in 1994 by John Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who three years later in 1997 shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for having developed the Black\u2013Scholes model of financial dynamics.\nLTCM was initially successful, with annualized returns (after fees) of around 21% in its first year, 43% in its second year and 41% in its third year. However, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months due to a combination of high leverage and exposure to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and 1998 Russian financial crisis. The master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed soon thereafter, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998, among 14 financial institutions for a $3.65 billion recapitalization under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. The fund was liquidated and dissolved in early 2000.\nFounding.\nJohn Meriwether headed Salomon Brothers' bond arbitrage desk until he resigned in 1991 amid a trading scandal. According to Chi-fu Huang, later a Principal at LTCM, the bond arbitrage group was responsible for 80\u2013100% of Salomon's global total earnings from the late 1980s until the early 1990s.\nIn 1993 Meriwether created Long-Term Capital as a hedge fund and recruited several Salomon bond traders; Larry Hilibrand and Victor Haghani in particular would wield substantial clout and two future winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize, Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton. Other principals included Eric Rosenfeld, Greg Hawkins, William Krasker, Dick Leahy, James McEntee, Robert Shustak, and David W. Mullins Jr.\nThe company consisted of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a Delaware-incorporated company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. LTCM managed trades in Long-Term Capital Portfolio LP, a partnership registered in the Cayman Islands. The fund's operation was designed to have extremely low overhead; trades were conducted through a partnership with Bear Stearns and client relations were handled by Merrill Lynch.\nMeriwether chose to start a hedge fund to avoid the financial regulation imposed on more traditional investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, as established by the Investment Company Act of 1940\u00a0\u2013 funds which accepted stakes from 100 or fewer individuals each with more than $1 million in net worth were exempt from most of the regulations that bound other investment companies. The bulk of the money raised, in late 1993, came from companies and individuals connected to the financial industry. With the help of Merrill Lynch, LTCM also secured hundreds of millions of dollars from high-net-worth individuals including business owners and celebrities, as well as private university endowments and later the Italian central bank. By 24 February 1994, the day LTCM began trading, the company had amassed just over $1.01 billion in capital.\nTrading strategies.\nThe main strategy was to find pairs of bonds which should have a predictable spread between their prices, and then when this spread widened further to basically place a bet that the two prices would come back towards each other.\nThe core investment strategy of the company was then known as involving convergence trading: using quantitative models to exploit deviations from fair value in the relationships between liquid securities across nations, and between asset classes (i.e. Fed model-type strategies). In fixed income the company was involved in US Treasuries, Japanese Government Bonds, UK Gilts, Italian BTPs, and Latin American debt, although their activities were not confined to these markets or to government bonds. LTCM was the brightest star on Wall Street at that time.\nFixed income arbitrage.\nFixed income securities pay a set of coupons at specified dates in the future, and make a defined redemption payment at maturity. Since bonds of similar maturities and the same credit quality are close substitutes for investors, there tends to be a close relationship between their prices (and yields). Whereas it is possible to construct a single set of valuation curves for derivative instruments based on LIBOR-type fixings, it is not possible to do so for government bond securities because every bond has slightly different characteristics. It is therefore necessary to construct a theoretical model of what the relationships between different but closely related fixed income securities should be.\nFor example, the most recently issued treasury bond in the US \u2013 known as the benchmark \u2013 will be more liquid than bonds of similar but slightly shorter maturity that were issued previously. Trading is concentrated in the benchmark bond, and transaction costs are lower for buying or selling it. As a consequence, it tends to trade more expensively than less liquid older bonds, but this expensiveness (or richness) tends to have a limited duration, because after a certain time there will be a new benchmark, and trading will shift to this security newly issued by the Treasury. One core trade in the LTCM strategies was to purchase the old benchmark \u2013 now a 29.75-year bond, and which no longer had a significant premium \u2013 and to sell short the newly issued benchmark 30-year, which traded at a premium. Over time the valuations of the two bonds would tend to converge as the richness of the benchmark faded once a new benchmark was issued. If the coupons of the two bonds were similar, then this trade would create an exposure to changes in the shape of the typically upward sloping yield curve: a flattening would depress the yields and raise the prices of longer-dated bonds, and raise the yields and depress the prices of shorter-dated bonds. It would therefore tend to create losses by making the 30-year bond that LTCM was short more expensive (and the 29.75-year bond they owned cheaper) even if there had been no change in the true relative valuation of the securities. This exposure to the shape of the yield curve could be managed at a portfolio level, and hedged out by entering a smaller steepener in other similar securities.\nLeverage and portfolio composition.\nBecause the magnitude of discrepancies in valuations in this kind of trade is small (for the benchmark Treasury convergence trade, typically a few basis points), in order to earn significant returns for investors, LTCM used leverage to create a portfolio that was a significant multiple (varying over time depending on their portfolio composition) of investors' equity in the fund. It was also necessary to access the financing market in order to borrow the securities that they had sold short. In order to maintain their portfolio, LTCM was therefore dependent on the willingness of its counterparties in the government bond (repo) market to continue to finance their portfolio. If the company were unable to extend its financing agreements, then it would be forced to sell the securities it owned and to buy back the securities it was short at market prices, regardless of whether these were favorable from a valuation perspective.\nAt the beginning of 1998, the firm had equity of $4.7 billion and had borrowed over $124.5 billion with assets of around $129 billion, for a debt-to-equity ratio of over 25 to 1. It had off-balance sheet derivative positions with a notional value of approximately $1.25 trillion, most of which were in interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps. The fund also invested in other derivatives such as equity options.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThanks to the use of complex derivatives, LTCM turned an equity base of less than $5 billion into derivative positions with a notional value of approximately $1.25 trillion. These derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, were developed with the supposed goal of allowing firms to manage risk on exchange rates and interest rate movements. Instead, they allowed speculation on an unparalleled scale.\nSecret and opaque operations.\nLTCM was open about its overall strategy, but very secretive about its specific operations, including scattering trades among banks. And in perhaps a disconcerting note, \"since Long-Term was flourishing, no one needed to know exactly what they were doing. All they knew was that the profits were coming in as promised,\" or at least perhaps what should have been a disconcerting note when looked at in hindsight.\nOpaqueness may have made even more of a difference and investors may have had even a harder time judging the risk involved when LTCM moved from bond arbitrage into arbitrage involving common stocks and corporate mergers.\nUBS investment.\nUnder prevailing US tax laws, there was a different treatment of long-term capital gains, which were taxed at 20.0 percent, and income, which was taxed at 39.6 percent. The earnings for partners in a hedge fund was taxed at the higher rate applying to income, and LTCM applied its financial engineering expertise to legally transform income into capital gains. It did so by engaging in a transaction with UBS (Union Bank of Switzerland) that would defer foreign interest income for seven years, thereby being able to earn the more favorable capital gains treatment. LTCM purchased a call option on 1 million of their own shares (valued then at $800 million) for a premium paid to UBS of $300 million. This transaction was completed in three tranches: in June, August, and October 1997. Under the terms of the deal, UBS agreed to reinvest the $300 million premium directly back into LTCM for a minimum of three years. In order to hedge its exposure from being short the call option, UBS also purchased 1 million of LTCM shares. Put-call parity means that being short a call and long the same amount of notional as underlying the call is equivalent to being short a put. So the net effect of the transaction was for UBS to lend $300 million to LTCM at LIBOR+50 and to be short a put on 1 million shares. UBS's own motivation for the trade was to be able to invest in LTCM \u2013 a possibility that was not open to investors generally \u2013 and to become closer to LTCM as a client. LTCM quickly became the largest client of the hedge fund desk, generating $15 million in fees annually.\nDiminishing opportunities and broadening of strategies.\nLTCM attempted to create a splinter fund in 1996 called LTCM-X that would invest in even higher risk trades and focus on Latin American markets. LTCM turned to UBS to invest in and write the warrant for this new spin-off company.\nLTCM faced challenges in deploying capital as their capital base grew due to initially strong returns, and as the magnitude of anomalies in market pricing diminished over time. James Surowiecki concludes that LTCM grew such a large portion of such illiquid markets that there was no diversity in buyers in them, or no buyers at all, so the wisdom of the market did not function and it was impossible to determine a price for its assets (such as Danish bonds in September 1998).\nIn Q4 1997, a year in which it earned 27%, LTCM returned capital to investors. It also broadened its strategies to include new approaches in markets outside of fixed income: many of these were not market neutral \u2013 they were dependent on overall interest rates or stock prices going up (or down) \u2013 and they were not traditional convergence trades. By 1998, LTCM had accumulated extremely large positions in areas such as merger arbitrage (betting on differences between a proprietary view of the likelihood of success of mergers and other corporate transactions would be completed and the implied market pricing) and S&amp;P 500 options (net short long-term S&amp;P volatility). LTCM had become a major supplier of S&amp;P 500 vega, which had been in demand by companies seeking to essentially insure equities against future declines.\nEarly skepticism.\nDespite the fund's prominent leadership and strong growth at LTCM, there were skeptics from the very beginning. Investor Seth Klarman believed it was reckless to have the combination of high leverage and not accounting for rare or outlying scenarios. Software designer Mitch Kapor, who had sold a statistical program with LTCM partner Eric Rosenfeld, saw quantitative finance as a faith, rather than science. Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Samuelson was concerned about extraordinary events affecting the market. Economist Eugene Fama found in his research that stocks were bound to have extreme outliers. Furthermore, he believed that, because they are subject to discontinuous price changes, real-life markets are inherently riskier than models. Fama became even more concerned when LTCM began adding stocks to their bond portfolio.\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger were two of the individual investors that Meriwether approached in 1993 to invest in the fund. Both analyzed the company but turned down the offer, considering the leverage plan to be too risky.\nDownturn.\nRiskier investments starting in 1997.\nLTCM's profit percentage for 1996 was 40%. However, for 1997, profits dropped to 17%, which similar to other hedge funds. A key reason for the drop in profits was other financial companies were mimicking LTCM's strategies and greater competition left fewer arbitrage opportunities for LTCM themselves.\nAs a result, LTCM began a new concept for them of investing in emerging market debt and foreign currencies. Some of the major partners, particularly Myron Scholes, had their doubts about these new investments. For example, when LTCM took a major position in the Norwegian krone, Scholes warned that they had no \"informational advantage\" in this area.\nIn June 1998 \u2013 before the Russian financial crisis \u2013 LTCM posted a 10% loss, which was their biggest monthly loss to date.\n1997 Asian financial crisis.\nAlthough 1997 had been a very profitable year for LTCM (17%), the lingering effects of the 1997 Asian crisis continued to shape developments in asset markets into 1998. Despite the crisis originating in Asia, its effects were not confined to that region. The rise in risk aversion had raised concerns amongst investors regarding all markets heavily dependent on international capital flows, and this shaped asset pricing in markets outside Asia too.\n1998 Russian financial crisis.\nAlthough periods of distress have often created tremendous opportunities for relative value strategies, this did not prove to be the case on this occasion, and the seeds of LTCM's demise were sown before the Russian default of 17 August 1998. LTCM had returned $2.7 bn to investors in Q4 of 1997, although it had also raised a total in capital of $1.066 bn from UBS and $133 m from CSFB. Since position sizes had not been reduced, the net effect was to raise the leverage of the fund.\nIn May and June 1998, returns from the fund were -6.42% and -10.14% respectively, reducing LTCM's capital by $461 million. This was further aggravated by the exit of Salomon Brothers from the arbitrage business in July 1998. Because the Salomon arbitrage group (where many of LTCM's strategies had first been incubated) had been a significant player in the kinds of strategies also pursued by LTCM, the liquidation of the Salomon portfolio (and its announcement itself) had the effect of depressing the prices of the securities owned by LTCM and bidding up the prices of the securities LTCM was short. According to Michael Lewis in the \"New York Times\" article of July 1998, returns that month were circa -10%. One LTCM partner commented that because there was a clear temporary reason to explain the widening of arbitrage spreads, at the time it gave them more conviction that these trades would eventually return to fair value (as they did, but not without widening much further first).\nSuch losses were accentuated through the 1998 Russian financial crisis in August and September 1998, when the Russian government defaulted on its domestic local currency bonds. This came as a surprise to many investors because according to traditional economic thinking of the time, a sovereign issuer should never need to default given access to the printing press. There was a flight to quality, bidding up the prices of the most liquid and benchmark securities that LTCM was short, and depressing the price of the less liquid securities it owned. This phenomenon occurred not merely in the US Treasury market but across the full spectrum of financial assets. Although LTCM was diversified, the nature of its strategy implied an exposure to a latent factor risk of the price of liquidity across markets. As a consequence, when a much larger flight to liquidity occurred than had been anticipated when constructing its portfolio, its positions designed to profit from convergence to fair value incurred large losses as expensive but liquid securities became more expensive, and cheap but illiquid securities became cheaper. By the end of August, the fund had lost $1.85 billion in capital.\nBecause LTCM was not the only fund pursuing such a strategy, and because the proprietary trading desks of the banks also held some similar trades, the divergence from fair value was made worse as these other positions were also liquidated. As rumors of LTCM's difficulties spread, some market participants positioned in anticipation of a forced liquidation. Victor Haghani, a partner at LTCM, said about this time \"it was as if there was someone out there with our exact portfolio... only it was three times as large as ours, and they were liquidating all at once.\"\nBecause these losses reduced the capital base of LTCM, and its ability to maintain the magnitude of its existing portfolio, LTCM was forced to liquidate a number of its positions at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer further losses. A vivid illustration of the consequences of these forced liquidations is given by Lowenstein (2000). He reports that LTCM established an arbitrage position in the dual-listed company (DLC) Royal Dutch Shell in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8%\u201310% premium relative to Shell. In total $2.3 billion was invested, half of which was \"long\" in Shell and the other half was \"short\" in Royal Dutch. LTCM was essentially betting that the share prices of Royal Dutch and Shell would converge because in their belief the present value of the future cashflows of the two securities should be similar. This might have happened in the long run, but due to its losses on other positions, LTCM had to unwind its position in Royal Dutch Shell. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22%, which implies that LTCM incurred a large loss on this arbitrage strategy. LTCM lost $286 million in equity pairs trading and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the Royal Dutch Shell trade.\nThe company, which had historically earned annualized compounded returns of almost 40% up to this point, experienced a flight to liquidity. In the first three weeks of September, LTCM's equity tumbled from $2.3 billion at the start of the month to just $400 million by September 25. With liabilities still over $100 billion, this translated to an effective leverage ratio of more than 250-to-1.\n1998 bailout.\nLong-Term Capital Management did business with nearly every important person on Wall Street. Indeed, much of LTCM's capital was composed of funds from the same financial professionals with whom it traded. As LTCM teetered, Wall Street feared that Long-Term's failure could cause a chain reaction in numerous markets, causing catastrophic losses throughout the financial system.\nAfter LTCM failed to raise more money on its own, it became clear it was running out of options. On September 23, 1998, Goldman Sachs, AIG, and Berkshire Hathaway offered then to buy out the fund's partners for $250 million, to inject $3.75 billion and to operate LTCM within Goldman's own trading division. The offer of $250 million was stunningly low to LTCM's partners because at the start of the year their firm had been worth $4.7 billion. Warren Buffett gave Meriwether less than one hour to accept the deal; the time lapsed before a deal could be worked out.\nSeeing no options left, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of $3.625 billion by the major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. The principal negotiator for LTCM was general counsel James G. Rickards. The contributions from the various institutions were as follows:\nIn return, the participating banks got a 90% share in the fund and a promise that a supervisory board would be established. LTCM's partners received a 10% stake, still worth about $400 million, but this money was completely consumed by their debts. The partners once had $1.9 billion of their own money invested in LTCM, all of which was wiped out.\nThe fear was that there would be a chain reaction as the company liquidated its securities to cover its debt, leading to a drop in prices, which would force other companies to liquidate their own debt in a vicious cycle.\nThe total losses were found to be $4.6 billion. The losses in the major investment categories were (ordered by magnitude):\nLong-Term Capital was audited by Price Waterhouse LLP. After the bailout by the other investors, the panic abated, and the positions formerly held by LTCM were eventually liquidated at a small profit to the rescuers. Although termed a bailout, the transaction effectively amounted to an orderly liquidation of the positions held by LTCM with creditor involvement and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank. No public money was injected or directly at risk, and the companies involved in providing support to LTCM were also those that stood to lose from its failure. The creditors themselves did not lose money from being involved in the transaction.\nSome industry officials said that Federal Reserve Bank of New York involvement in the rescue, however benign, would encourage large financial institutions to assume more risk, in the belief that the Federal Reserve would intervene on their behalf in the event of trouble (see Greenspan put). Federal Reserve Bank of New York actions raised concerns among some market observers that it could create moral hazard since even though the Fed had not directly injected capital, its use of moral suasion to encourage creditor involvement emphasized its interest in supporting the financial system.\nLTCM's strategies were compared to \"picking up nickels in front of a bulldozer\" \u2013 a likely small gain balanced against a small chance of a large loss, like the payouts from selling an out-of-the-money naked call option. This contrasts with the market efficiency aphorism that there are no $100 bills lying on the street, as someone else has already picked them up.\nAftermath.\nIn 1998, the chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland resigned as a result of a $780 million loss incurred from writing put options on LTCM, which had become significantly in-the-money due to LTCM's collapse.\nAfter the bailout, Long-Term Capital Management continued operations. In the year following the bailout, it earned 10%. By early 2000, the fund had been liquidated, and the consortium of banks that financed the bailout had been paid back, but the collapse was devastating for many involved. Mullins, once considered a possible successor to Alan Greenspan, saw his future with the Fed dashed. The theories of Merton and Scholes took a public beating. In its annual reports, Merrill Lynch observed that mathematical risk models \"may provide a greater sense of security than warranted; therefore, reliance on these models should be limited.\"\nAfter helping unwind LTCM, John Meriwether launched JWM Partners. Haghani, Hilibrand, Leahy, and Rosenfeld signed up as principals of the new firm. By December 1999, they had raised $250 million for a fund that would continue many of LTCM's strategies \u2013 this time, using less leverage. With the credit crisis of 2008, JWM Partners LLC was hit with a 44% loss from September 2007 to February 2009 in its Relative Value Opportunity II fund. As such, JWM Hedge Fund was shut down in July 2009. Meriwether then launched a third hedge fund in 2010 called JM Advisors Management. A 2014 \"Business Insider\" article stated that his later two funds used \"the same investment strategy from his time at LTCM and Salomon.\"\nAnalysis.\nHistorian Niall Ferguson proposed that LTCM's collapse stemmed in part from their use of only five years of financial data to prepare their mathematical models, thus drastically under-estimating the risks of a profound economic crisis:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The firm's value at risk (VaR) models had implied that the loss Long Term suffered in August was so unlikely that it ought never to have happened in the entire life of the universe. But that was because the models were working with just five years' worth of data. If the models had gone back even eleven years, they would have captured the 1987 stock market crash. If they had gone back eighty years they would have captured the last great Russian default, after the 1917 Revolution. Meriwether himself, born in 1947, ruefully observed: \"If I had lived through the Depression, I would have been in a better position to understand events.\" To put it bluntly, the Nobel prize winners had known plenty of mathematics, but not enough history.\u2014\u200a\nThese ideas were expanded in a 2016 CFA article written by Ron Rimkusk, which pointed out that the VaR model, one of the major quantitative analysis tool by LTCM, had several flaws in it. A VaR model is calculated based on historical data, but the data sample used by LTCM excluded previous economic crises such as those of 1987 and 1994. VaR also could not interpret extreme events such as a financial crisis in terms of timing.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational, professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses.\nThe term \"liberal arts\" for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed its meaning considerably, mostly expanding it. The seven subjects in the ancient and medieval meaning came to be divided into the trivium of rhetoric, grammar, and logic, and the quadrivium of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, and music. Liberal arts colleges and schools often have names such as \"arts and social sciences\", \"arts and sciences\" and \"humanities\". Liberal arts degrees from today's universities and colleges traditionally include the following disciplines: Anthropology, English, Literature, Fine arts, Foreign languages, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Music, Journalism, Economics, Law, Communications, Architecture, Creative arts, Art, and History. Degrees in Liberal studies are often confused with those in a liberal arts discipline. Liberal studies refers to degrees with a broad curriculum, across multiple liberal arts disciplines and/or sciences and technologies. \nEnrollment in liberal arts degree programs has been declining in the 2010s and 2020s in the United States, in part because of a perception of worse job prospects. As of 2023, liberal arts degrees holders in the United States had a median wage of 60,000 USD, as opposed to 70,000 USD for all degree holders.\nHistory.\nBefore they became known by their Latin variations (, , ), the liberal arts were the continuation of Ancient Greek methods of inquiry that began with a \"desire for a universal understanding.\" Pythagoras argued that there was a mathematical (and geometric) harmony to the cosmos or the universe; his followers linked the four arts of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, and music into one area of study to form the \"disciplines of the mediaeval quadrivium\". In the 4th-century-BC Athens, the government of the polis, or city-state, respected the ability of rhetoric or public speaking above almost everything else. Eventually rhetoric, grammar, and dialectic (logic) became the educational programme of the trivium. Together they came to be known as the seven liberal arts. Originally these subjects or skills were held by classical antiquity to be essential for a free person (, \"worthy of a free person\") to acquire in order to take an active part in civic life, something that included among other things participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and participating in military service. While the arts of the quadrivium might have appeared prior to the arts of the trivium, by the Middle Ages educational programmes taught the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) first while the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy) were the following stage of education.\nRooted in the basic curriculum \u2013 the or \"well-rounded education\" \u2013 of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece, the \"liberal arts\" or \"liberal pursuits\" (Latin ) were already called so in formal education during the Roman Empire. The first recorded use of the term \"liberal arts\" () occurs in by Marcus Tullius Cicero, but it is unclear if he created the term. Seneca the Younger discusses liberal arts in education from a critical Stoic point of view in \"Moral Epistles\". The exact classification of the liberal arts varied however in Roman times, and it was only after Martianus Capella in the 5th century influentially brought the seven liberal arts as bridesmaids to the \"Marriage of Mercury and Philology\", that they took on canonical form.\nThe four \"scientific\" \u2013 music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy \u2013 were known from the time of Boethius onwards as the \"quadrivium\". After the 9th century, the remaining three arts of the \"humanities\" \u2013 grammar, logic, and rhetoric \u2013 were grouped as the \"trivium\". It was in that two-fold form that the seven liberal arts were studied in the medieval Western university. During the Middle Ages, logic gradually came to take predominance over the other parts of the \"trivium\".\nIn the 12th century the iconic image \u2013 (Philosophy and seven liberal arts) \"\u2013\" was produced by an Alsatian nun and abbess Herrad of Landsberg with her community of women as part of the . Their encyclopedia compiled ideas drawn from philosophy, theology, literature, music, arts, and sciences and was intended as a teaching tool for women of the abbey. The image \"Philosophy and seven liberal arts\" represents the circle of philosophy, and is presented as a rosette of a cathedral: a central circle and a series of semicircles arranged all around. It shows learning and knowledge organised into seven relations, the or Seven Liberal Arts. Each of these arts find their source in the Greek \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, philosophia, literally \"love of wisdom\". St. Albert the Great, a doctor of the Catholic Church, asserted that the seven liberal arts were referred to in Sacred Scripture, saying: \"It is written, 'Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars' (Proverbs 9:1). This house is the Blessed Virgin; the seven pillars are the seven liberal arts.\" \nIn the Renaissance, the Italian humanists and their Northern counterparts, despite in many respects continuing the traditions of the Middle Ages, reversed that process. Re-christening the old trivium with a new and more ambitious name: , and also increasing its scope, they downplayed logic as opposed to the traditional Latin grammar and rhetoric, and added to them history, Greek, and moral philosophy (ethics), with a new emphasis on poetry as well. The educational curriculum of humanism spread throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and became the educational foundation for the schooling of European elites, the functionaries of political administration, the clergy of the various legally recognized churches, and the learned professions of law and medicine. The ideal of a liberal arts, or humanistic education grounded in classical languages and literature, persisted in Europe until the middle of the twentieth century; in the United States, it had come under increasingly successful attack in the late 19th century by academics interested in reshaping American higher education around the natural and social sciences.\nSimilarly, Wilhelm von Humboldt's educational model in Prussia (now Germany), which later became the role model for higher education also in North America, went beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and \u2013 according to their condition \u2013 well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life.\nThe philosopher Julian Nida-R\u00fcmelin has criticized discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, arguing that we need to decide between \"McKinsey and Humboldt\".\nModern usage.\nThe modern use of the term liberal arts consists of four areas: the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Academic areas that are associated with the term liberal arts include:\nFor example, the core courses for Georgetown University's Doctor of Liberal Studies program cover philosophy, theology, history, art, literature, and the social sciences. Wesleyan University's Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program includes courses in visual arts, art history, creative and professional writing, literature, history, mathematics, film, government, education, biology, psychology, and astronomy.\nSecondary school.\nLiberal arts education at the secondary school level prepares students for higher education at a university.\nCurricula differ from school to school, but generally include language, chemistry, biology, geography, art, mathematics, music, history, philosophy, civics, social sciences, and foreign languages.\nIn the United States.\nIn the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing undergraduate study in the liberal arts. The teaching at liberal arts colleges is often Socratic, typically with small classes; professors are often allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than are professors at research universities.\nScience and mathematics are integral to four-year liberal arts colleges, and indeed their graduates have been demonstrated to be more likely to apply to graduate school in science and mathematics than their peers and make up a higher proportion of National Academy of Science members than would usually be expected for the number of science and mathematics graduates produced by an institution. \nTraditionally, a bachelor's degree in one particular area within liberal arts, with substantial study outside that main area, is earned over four years of full-time study. However, some universities such as Saint Leo University, Pennsylvania State University, Florida Institute of Technology, and New England College have begun to offer an associate degree in liberal arts. Colleges like the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts offer a unique program with only one degree offering, a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, while the Harvard Extension School offers both a Bachelor of Liberal Arts and a Master of Liberal Arts. Additionally, colleges like the University of Oklahoma College of Liberal Studies and the Harvard Extension School offer an online, part-time option for adult and nontraditional students.\nMost students earn either a Bachelor of Arts degree or a Bachelor of Science degree.\nGreat Books movement.\nOrigins (1910s\u20131930s).\nThe movement's intellectual roots lie in Charles William Eliot\u2019s \"Harvard Classics\" (1909) and in John Erskine\u2019s \u201cGeneral Honors\u201d course at Columbia (1919), where primary texts replaced survey textbooks. Erskine's colleagues Mortimer J. Adler and Robert Maynard Hutchins exported the seminar model to Chicago in 1931, contending that sustained engagement with classic works would provide a common stock of ideas essential to democratic citizenship.\nIn 1937 St. John's College radically shifted its curriculum to focus on the \"Great Books of the Western World,\" aiming to provide a form of liberal arts education that stood apart from increasingly specialized nature of higher education. \nConsolidation and popularisation (1940s\u20131950s).\nHutchins, Adler and labour organiser Henry Johnson founded the nonprofit Great Books Foundation in 1947 to sponsor adult discussion groups nationwide. \nIn 1952, \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" published a 54 volume set titled the \"Great Books of the Western World\" under the direction of Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler. It was published in a second edition with an updated 60 volumes in 1990. \nCritique and decline (1960s\u20131980s).\nDuring the cultural upheavals of the 1960s the movement attracted criticism for privileging Euro-American male authors and for treating texts ahistorically. Louis Menand observes that its classroom practice \u201cpositioned itself against the grain of academic disciplinary paradigms,\u201d thereby provoking recurring disputes over expertise and identity politics. Journalists likewise questioned its relevance: a 1992 \"Washington Post\" profile of St. John's dubbed the college \u201cthe ultimate anachronism\u201d for focusing on \u201cdead white men,\u201d even as it praised graduates\u2019 analytical skills.\nIn 1990, a second edition was released, expanding the collection to 60 volumes and updating its content to reflect more contemporary works and scholarship. \nRevival and diversification (1990s\u2013present).\nAmid concern over declining humanities enrolments, a \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" survey in 1999 identified eleven new or revitalised great-books programmes at U.S. campuses, often launched with support from the National Association of Scholars. Many such curricula now incorporate works by women and non-Western authors, while advocates argue that juxtaposing, for example, Homer and Toni Morrison demonstrates the canon's adaptability to diverse classrooms.\nInterest among Muslim education institutions.\nToday, many neo-traditional Muslim scholars such as Shaykh Hamza Yusuf and Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad (Tim Winter) have advocated for learning the Great Books of the Western World and the Liberal Arts tradition, noting that Muslims have long since been directly involved in promoting and advocating for the trivium and quadrivium. As such, students of Zaytuna College and Cambridge Muslim College generally have an appreciation for these sciences.\nLegacy.\nGreat-books seminars remain core requirements at Columbia, Chicago and St. John's, underpin discussion groups run by the Great Books Foundation, and inform executive-education offerings at the Aspen Institute. Supporters contend that shared inquiry into enduring questions fosters civic deliberation, whereas detractors view the canon as an exclusionary relic. The debate itself confirms the movement's enduring cultural resonance.\nIn Europe.\nIn most parts of Europe, liberal arts education is deeply rooted. In Germany, Austria and countries influenced by their education system it is called '\"humanistische Bildung\"' (humanistic education). The term is not to be confused with some modern educational concepts that use a similar wording. Educational institutions that see themselves in that tradition are often a \"Gymnasium\" (high school, grammar school). They aim at providing their pupils with comprehensive education (\"Bildung\") to form personality with regard to a pupil's own humanity as well as their innate intellectual skills. Going back to the long tradition of the liberal arts in Europe, education in the above sense was freed from scholastic thinking and re-shaped by the theorists of the Enlightenment; in particular, Wilhelm von Humboldt. Since students are considered to have received a comprehensive liberal arts education at \"gymnasia\", very often the role of liberal arts education in undergraduate programs at universities is reduced compared to the US educational system. Students are expected to use their skills received at the \"gymnasium\" to further develop their personality in their own responsibility, e.g. in universities' music clubs, theatre groups, language clubs, etc. Universities encourage students to do so and offer respective opportunities but do not make such activities part of the university's curriculum.\nThus, on the level of higher education, despite the European origin of the liberal arts college, the term \"liberal arts college\" usually denotes liberal arts colleges in the United States. With the exception of pioneering institutions such as Franklin University Switzerland (formerly known as Franklin College), established as a Europe-based, US-style liberal arts college in 1969, only recently some efforts have been undertaken to systematically \"re-import\" liberal arts education to continental Europe, as with Leiden University College The Hague, University College Utrecht, University College Maastricht, Amsterdam University College, Roosevelt Academy (now University College Roosevelt), University College Twente (ATLAS), Erasmus University College, the University of Groningen, Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts, Leuphana University of L\u00fcneburg, Central European University, and Bard College Berlin, formerly known as the European College of Liberal Arts. Central European University launched a liberal arts undergraduate degree in Culture, Politics, and Society in 2020 as part of its move to Vienna and accreditation in Austria. As well as the colleges listed above, some universities in the Netherlands offer bachelors programs in Liberal Arts and Sciences (Tilburg University). Liberal arts (as a degree program) is just beginning to establish itself in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does St. Marys University College Belfast, both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology since the late 1990s. The four-year bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students. The first Liberal Arts degree program in Sweden was established at Gothenburg University in 2011, followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at Uppsala University's Campus Gotland in the autumn of 2013. The first Liberal Arts program in Georgia was introduced in 2005 by American-Georgian Initiative for Liberal Education (AGILE), an NGO. Thanks to their collaboration, Ilia State University became the first higher education institution in Georgia to establish a liberal arts program.\nIn France, Chavagnes Studium, a Liberal Arts Study Centre in partnership with the Institut Catholique d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures, and based in a former Catholic seminary, is launching a two-year intensive BA in the Liberal Arts, with a distinctively Catholic outlook. It has been suggested that the liberal arts degree may become part of mainstream education provision in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In 1999, the European College of Liberal Arts (now Bard College Berlin) was founded in Berlin and in 2009 it introduced a four-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English, leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities.\nIn England, the first institution to retrieve and update a liberal arts education at the undergraduate level was the University of Winchester with their BA (Hons) Modern Liberal Arts program which launched in 2010. In 2012, University College London began its interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences BASc degree (which has kinship with the liberal arts model) with 80 students. In 2013, the University of Birmingham created the School of Liberal Arts and Natural Sciences, home of a suite of flexible 4-year programs in which students study a broad range of subjects drawn from across the university, and gain qualifications including both traditional Liberal Arts and Natural Sciences, but also novel thematic combinations linking both areas. King's College London launched the BA Liberal Arts, which has a slant towards arts, humanities and social sciences subjects. The New College of the Humanities also launched a new liberal education programme. Richmond American University London is a private liberal arts university where all undergraduate degrees are taught with a US liberal arts approach over a four-year programme. Durham University has both a popular BA Liberal Arts and a BA Combined Honours in Social Sciences programme, both of which allow for interdisciplinary approaches to education. The University of Nottingham also has a Liberal Arts BA with study abroad options and links with its Natural Sciences degrees. In 2016, the University of Warwick launched a three/four-year liberal arts BA degree, which focuses on transdisciplinary approaches and problem-based learning techniques in addition to providing structured disciplinary routes and bespoke pathways. And for 2017 entry UCAS lists 20 providers of liberal arts programmes.\nIn Scotland, the four-year undergraduate Honours degree, specifically the Master of Arts, has historically demonstrated considerable breadth in focus. In the first two years of Scottish MA and BA degrees students typically study a number of different subjects before specialising in their Honours years (third and fourth year).\nThe Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts (BISLA), a private institution located in the Old Town of Bratislava, Slovakia, is the first liberal arts college in Central Europe and has been granting three-year degrees since its opening in September 2006.\nIn Asia.\nThe Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines mandates a General Education curriculum required of all higher education institutions; it includes a number of liberal arts subjects, including history, art appreciation, and ethics, plus interdisciplinary electives. Many universities have much more robust liberal arts core curricula; most notably, the Jesuit universities such as Ateneo de Manila University have a strong liberal arts core curriculum that includes philosophy, theology, literature, history, and the social sciences. \nForman Christian College is a liberal arts university in Lahore, Pakistan. It is one of the oldest institutions in the Indian subcontinent. It is a chartered university recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. Aga Khan University offers a worldclass liberal arts education in the arts and sciences in Karachi, Pakistan, and Habib University in Karachi, Pakistan offers a holistic liberal arts and sciences experience to its students through its uniquely tailored liberal core program which is compulsory for all undergraduate degree students.\nIn India, there are many institutions that offer undergraduate UG or bachelor's degree/diploma and postgraduate PG or master's degree/diploma as well as doctoral PhD and postdoctoral studies and research, in this academic discipline. \nElsewhere in Asia, Lingnan University in Hong Kong, Asian University for Women and University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh are other liberal arts colleges. International Christian University in Tokyo is the first and one of the very few liberal arts universities in Japan. Fulbright University Vietnam is the first liberal arts institution in Vietnam.\nIn Australia.\nCampion College is a Roman Catholic dedicated liberal arts college, located in the western suburbs of Sydney. Founded in 2006, it is the first tertiary educational liberal arts college of its type in Australia. Campion offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts as its sole undergraduate degree. The key disciplines studied are history, literature, philosophy, and theology.\nThe Millis Institute is the School of Liberal Arts at Christian Heritage College located in Brisbane. Founded by Dr. Ryan Messmore, former President of Campion College, the Millis Institute offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts in which students can choose to major in philosophy, theology, history or literature. It also endorses a 'Study Abroad' program whereby students can earn credit towards their degree by undertaking two units over a five-week program at the University of Oxford. As of 2022, Elizabeth Hillman is currently the President of the Millis Institute.\nA new school of Liberal Arts has been formed in the University of Wollongong; the new Arts course entitled 'Western Civilisation' was first offered in 2020. The interdisciplinary curriculum focuses on the classic intellectual and artistic literature of the Western tradition. Courses in the liberal arts have recently been developed at the University of Sydney and the University of Notre Dame.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An example of a lateral consonant is the English \"L\", as in \"Larry\". Lateral consonants contrast with central consonants, in which the airstream flows through the center of the mouth.\nFor the most common laterals, the tip of the tongue makes contact with the upper teeth (see dental consonant) or the upper gum (see alveolar consonant), but there are many other possible places for laterals to be made. The most common laterals are approximants and belong to the class of liquids, but lateral fricatives and affricates are also common in some parts of the world. Some languages, such as the Iwaidja and Ilgar languages of Australia, have lateral flaps, and others, such as the Xhosa and Zulu languages of Africa, have lateral clicks.\nWhen pronouncing the labiodental fricatives , the lip blocks the airflow in the center of the vocal tract, so the airstream proceeds along the sides instead. Nevertheless, they are not considered lateral consonants because the airflow never goes over the side of the tongue. No known language makes a distinction between lateral and non-lateral labiodentals. Plosives are never lateral, but they may have lateral release. Nasals are almost never lateral either, but reported in Nzema, and some languages have lateral nasal clicks. For consonants articulated in the throat (laryngeals), the lateral distinction is not made by any language, although pharyngeal and epiglottal laterals are reportedly possible.\nExamples.\nEnglish has one lateral phoneme: the lateral approximant , which in many accents has two allophones. One, found before vowels (and /j/) as in \"lady\" or \"fly\" (or \"value\"), is called \"clear l\", pronounced as the alveolar lateral approximant with a \"neutral\" position of the body of the tongue. The other variant, so-called \"dark l\", found before consonants or word-finally, as in \"bold\" or \"tell\", is pronounced as the velarized alveolar lateral approximant with the tongue assuming a spoon-like shape with its back part raised, which gives the sound a - or -like resonance. In some languages, like Albanian, those two sounds are different phonemes. Malsia e Madhe Gheg Albanian and Salamina Arvanitika even have the three-way distinction of laterals , and . East Slavic languages contrast and but do not have [l].\nIn many British accents (e.g. Cockney), dark may undergo vocalization through the reduction and loss of contact between the tip of the tongue and the alveolar ridge, becoming a rounded back vowel or glide. This process turns \"tell\" into , as must have happened with \"talk\" or \"walk\" at some stage. A similar process happened during the development of many other languages, including Brazilian Portuguese, Old French, and Polish, in all three of these resulting in voiced velar approximant or voiced labio-velar approximant , whence Modern French \"sauce\" as compared with Spanish \"salsa\", or Polish \"Wis\u0142a\" (pronounced ) as compared with English \"Vistula\".\nIn central and Venice dialects of Venetian, intervocalic has turned into a semivocalic , so that the written word \"\u0142a ba\u0142a\" is pronounced . The orthography uses the letter \u0142 to represent this phoneme (it specifically represents not the sound but the phoneme that is, in some dialects, and, in others, ).\nMany aboriginal Australian languages have a series of three or four lateral approximants, as do various dialects of Irish. Rarer lateral consonants include the retroflex laterals that can be found in many languages of India and in some Swedish dialects, and the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative , found in many Native North American languages, Welsh and Zulu. In Adyghe and some Athabaskan languages like H\u00e4n, both voiceless and voiced alveolar lateral fricatives occur, but there is no approximant. Many of these languages also have lateral affricates. Some languages have palatal or velar voiceless lateral fricatives or affricates, such as Dahalo and Zulu, but the IPA has no symbols for such sounds. However, appropriate symbols are easy to make by adding a lateral-fricative belt to the symbol for the corresponding lateral approximant (see below). Also, a devoicing diacritic may be added to the approximant.\nNearly all languages with such lateral obstruents also have the approximant. However, there are a number of exceptions, many of them located in the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. For example, Tlingit has but no . Other examples from the same area include Nuu-chah-nulth and Kutenai, and elsewhere, Mongolian, Chukchi, and Kabardian.\nStandard Tibetan has a voiceless lateral approximant, usually romanized as \"lh\", as in the name Lhasa.\nA uvular lateral approximant has been reported to occur in some speakers of American English.\nPashto has a retroflex lateral flap that becomes voiced retroflex approximant when it is at the end of a syllable and a word.\nThere are a large number of lateral click consonants; 17 occur in !X\u00f3\u00f5.\nLateral trills are also possible, but they do not occur in any known language. They may be pronounced by initiating or with an especially forceful airflow. There is no symbol for them in the IPA. They are sometimes used to imitate bird calls, and they are a component of Donald Duck talk.\nList of laterals.\nFricatives.\nOnly the alveolar lateral fricatives have dedicated letters in the IPA proper, though the retroflex letters are 'implied'. The others are provided by the extIPA.\nAmbiguous centrality.\nThe IPA requires sounds to be defined as to centrality, as either central or lateral. However, languages may be ambiguous as to some consonants' laterality. A well-known example is the liquid consonant in Japanese, represented in common transliteration systems as \u27e8r\u27e9, which can be recognized as a (post)alveolar tap , alveolar lateral flap /\u027a/, (post)alveolar lateral approximant /l/, (post)alveolar approximant /\u0279/, voiced retroflex stop /\u0256/, and various less common forms.\nLateralized consonants.\nA superscript \u27e8\u27e9 is defined as lateral release.\nConsonants may also be pronounced with simultaneous lateral and central airflow. This is well-known from speech pathology with a lateral lisp. However, it also occurs in nondisordered speech in some southern Arabic dialects and possibly some Modern South Arabian languages, which have pharyngealized nonsibilant and (simultaneous and ) and possibly a sibilant (simultaneous ). Examples are 'pain' in the dialect of Al-Rub\u016b\u02bdah and 'back' and 'hyena' in Rijal Alma\u02bda. (Here the \u27e8\u27e9 indicates simultaneous laterality rather than lateral release.) Biblical Hebrew may have had non-emphatic central-lateral sibilants and , while Old Arabic has been analyzed as having the emphatic central\u2013lateral fricatives , and .\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA common/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA pulmonic consonants/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA co-articulated consonants/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"IPA vowels/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18679", "revid": "49704958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18679", "title": "Liquid consonant", "text": "Class of speech sounds\nIn linguistics, a liquid consonant or simply liquid is any of a class of consonants that consists of rhotics and voiced lateral approximants, which are also sometimes described as \"R-like sounds\" and \"L-like sounds\". The word \"liquid\" seems to be a calque of the Ancient Greek word ( 'moist'), initially used by grammarian Dionysius Thrax to describe Greek sonorants.\nLiquid consonants are more prone to be part of consonant clusters and of the syllable nucleus. Their third formants are generally non-predictable based on the first two formants. Another important feature is their complex articulation, which makes them a hard consonant class to study with precision and the last consonants to be produced by children during their phonological development. They are also more likely to undergo certain types of phonological changes such as assimilation, dissimilation and metathesis.\nMost languages have at least one liquid in their phonemic inventory. English has two, and .\nHistory and etymology.\nThe grammarian Dionysius Thrax used the Ancient Greek word (, transl.\u2009moist) to describe the sonorant consonants () of classical Greek. It is assumed that the term referred to their changing or inconsistent (or \"fluid\") effect on meter in classical Greek verse when they occur as the second member of a consonant cluster. This word was calqued into Latin as \"liquidus\" (possibly because of a mistranslation) and this calque has been retained in the Western European phonetic tradition.\nSonority and syllable structure.\nIn the sonority hierarchy, liquids are considered the most sonorous sounds after vowels and glides, with laterals considered to be less sonorous than rhotics. This explains why they are more likely to be part of consonant clusters than other consonants (excluding glides), and to follow obstruents in initial consonant clusters and precede them in final consonant clusters.\nLiquids also hold this position in the hierarchy of syllable peaks, which means that liquids are theoretically more likely to be syllabic (or, in other words, be part of a syllable nucleus) than any other consonants, although some studies show that syllabic nasals are overall more favoured. Thus Czech, Slovak and other Slavic languages allow their liquid consonants and to be the center of their syllables \u2013 as witnessed by the classic tonguetwister \"push (your) finger through (your) throat.\" Additionally, Slovak also has long versions of these syllabic consonants, \u0155 and \u013a, e.g.: \"k\u013ab\" [k\u026b\u0329\u02d0p] 'joint', \"v\u0155ba\" [\u02c8vr\u0329\u02d0ba] 'willow', \"\u0161kv\u0155n\" [\u0283kvr\u0329\u02d0n] '(of) spots'. This is also true for General American English (see the words \"barrel and \"anchor) and other English accents.\nSequences of an obstruent and a liquid consonant are often ambiguous as far as syllabification is concerned. In these cases, whether the two consonants are part of the same syllable or not heavily depends on the individual language, and closely related languages can behave differently (such as Icelandic and Faroese). In Latin and Ancient Greek, obstruent + liquid consonant clusters (known as \"muta cum liquida\") supposedly were ambiguous in this sense, and as such were often used to manipulate meter.\nAcoustic and articulatory phonetics.\nAcoustically, liquids seem to have a third formant of unexpected value when compared to the first and second formants. This contrasts with non-liquid approximants, whose third formant value is expected based on the first two formants.\nIn articulatory phonetics, liquids are described as \"controlled gestures,\" which are slower and require more precise tongue movement during the \"homing phase\", when the tongue adjusts towards the place of articulation of the consonant. Due to the fact that babies prefer \"ballistic gestures\", which rely on the propelling motion of the jaw, liquids usually occur later in a child's phonological development, and they are more likely to be deleted in consonant clusters before the age of three. Liquids have also been described as consonants involving \"complex lingual geometries.\"\nTo better determine the full range of articulatory and acoustic characteristics of liquids, the use of ultrasound paired with audio recordings is increasing. This is due to this consonant group being difficult to analyse on a purely auditory base.\nLiquids and phonological change.\nLiquids seem to be more or less subjected to certain sound changes or phonological processes than other consonants. On an auditory level, liquid consonants resemble each other, which is likely the reason they undergo or trigger assimilation, dissimilation and metathesis.\nMetathesis.\nCross-linguistically, liquids tend to be more prone to metathesis than other consonants, especially long-distance metathesis.\nIn Spanish, a frequent example is the behaviour of /r/ and /l/:\nIn English, \"comfortable\" is frequently pronounced /\u02c8k\u028cmf.t\u025a.b\u0259l/ in rhotic varieties, even though its stem, \"comfort\", is pronounced /\u02c8k\u028cm.f\u025at/, with the rhotic /\u0279/ in its original position.\nAssimilation.\nLiquid consonants can also undergo assimilation: compare Italian \"parlare\" \"to speak\" with Sicilian \"parrari\". This phenomenon, which is not so common worldwide, is attested in Finnish: e.g., the root \"tul-\" \"to come\" combined with the past participle suffix -\"nut\", yields the surface form \"tullut\". This is one of the reasons long liquids are common in Finnish.\nA specific form of liquid assimilation, liquid harmony, is present is some languages. In Sundanese, some morphemes have two different realisations depending on what liquid is present in the root.\nDissimilation.\nLiquids are also prone to dissimilation when they occur in sequence. For example, Old Italian \"colonnello\" \"colonel\" is borrowed into Middle French as \"coronnel\", which is in turned loaned into English as \"colonel\", with an orthography inspired by Italian but with the /\u02c8k\u025an\u0259l/ or /\u02c8k\u025c\u02d0nel/ pronunciation with the rhotic \"r\", which is absent in writing.\nEpenthesis.\nEpenthesis, or the addition of sounds, is common in environments where liquids are present, especially consonant clusters. The epenthetic sound can be a vowel or a consonant. For example, the genitive of the Ancient Greek noun \u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03c1 \"an\u1e17r\" \"man\" is \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \"andr\u00f3s\", with the insertion of a [d] sound between a nasal consonant and the liquid [r]. Another example is the Irish word \"bolg\" \"belly\", usually pronounced with an epenthetic schwa after the liquid : .\nOther types of phonological change.\nLiquids can often be the result of lenition, the change of a consonant towards characteristics that are typical of vowels, making it \"weaker\". They are also likely to become vowels or glides, a process known as vocalisation. See, for example, the pronunciation of Spanish as in the Cibao region of the Dominican Republic at the end of a syllable: standard Spanish is optionally pronounced as in Cibae\u00f1o Spanish.\nOccurrence and geographical distribution.\nAccording to a survey by linguist Ian Maddieson, most languages have one to three liquids (with systems of two liquids being the most common) and they are usually dental or alveolar. Liquid consonants are also rarely geminated cross-linguistically.\nMany languages, such as Japanese, Korean, or Polynesian languages (see below), have a single liquid phoneme that has both lateral and rhotic allophones.\nEnglish has two liquid phonemes, one lateral, and one rhotic, , exemplified in the words led\" and red\".\nMany other European languages have one lateral and one rhotic phoneme. Some, such as Greek, Italian and Serbo-Croatian, have more than two liquid phonemes. All three languages have the set , with two laterals and one rhotic. Similarly, the Iberian languages contrast four liquid phonemes. , , , and a fourth phoneme that is an alveolar trill in most Iberian languages except for many varieties of Portuguese, where it is a uvular trill or fricative (also, the majority of Spanish speakers lack and use the central instead). Some European languages, for example Russian and Irish, contrast a palatalized lateral\u2013rhotic pair with an unpalatalized (or velarized) set (e.g. in Russian).\nElsewhere in the world, two liquids of the types mentioned above remains the most common attribute of a language's consonant inventory except in North America and Australia. A majority of indigenous North American languages do not have rhotics at all and there is a wide variety of lateral sounds, though most are obstruent laterals rather than liquids. Most indigenous Australian languages, in contrast, are very rich in liquids, with some having as many as seven distinct liquids. They typically include dental, alveolar, retroflex and palatal laterals, and as many as three rhotics.\nOn the other side, there are many indigenous languages in the Amazon Basin and eastern North America, as well as a few in Asia and Africa, with no liquids.\nPolynesian languages typically have only one liquid, which may be either a lateral or a rhotic. Non-Polynesian Oceanic languages usually have both and , occasionally more (e.g. Araki has , , ) or less (e.g. Mwotlap has only ). Hiw is unusual in having a prestopped velar lateral as its only liquid.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He won an IFBB Mr. America title and two consecutive IFBB Mr. Universe titles, and appeared in the documentary film \"Pumping Iron\" (1977). As an actor, he is best known for his title role in the CBS television series \"The Incredible Hulk\" (1977\u20131982) and vocally reprising the role in subsequent animated and computer-generated incarnations. He has also appeared in European-produced fantasy-adventures such as \"Hercules\" (1983) and \"Sinbad of the Seven Seas\" (1989), and as himself in the sitcom \"The King of Queens\" and the 2009 comedy \"I Love You, Man\".\nEarly life.\nFerrigno was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Victoria and Matt Ferrigno, a police lieutenant. He is of Italian, specifically Campanian, descent, with his mother hailing from Conca dei Marini and his paternal grandparents from Amalfi and Cava de' Tirreni. Ferrigno says he lost 75% to 80% of his hearing to what he believes were a series of ear infections soon after he was born, though his condition was not diagnosed until he was three years old. Hearing loss and his speech impediment caused Ferrigno to be bullied by peers during his childhood who called him \"deaf\" and \"mute\". He began reading comic books such as \"Hulk\" and \"Spider-Man\" at this time, later saying \"I was obsessed with power,\" and \"I wanted to be strong enough so that I could be able to defend myself,\" which eventually made him take up bodybuilding: \"My father rejected me because I was not the perfect son, so I fantasized about being like The Hulk and that\u2019s what led to bodybuilding\".\nFerrigno started weight training at the age of 13, citing the bodybuilder and \"Hercules\" star Steve Reeves as one of his role models. Because he could not afford to buy weights, he made his own using a broomstick and pails which he partially filled with cement. Ferrigno attended St. Athanasius Grammar School and Brooklyn Technical High School, where he learned metal working.\nBodybuilding career.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1969, Ferrigno won his first major title, IFBB Mr. America. Four years later, he won the title IFBB Mr. Universe. Early in his career he lived in Columbus, Ohio, and trained with Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 1974, he came in second on his first attempt at the Mr. Olympia competition. He came in third the following year, and his attempt to beat Schwarzenegger was the subject of the 1977 documentary \"Pumping Iron\". The documentary made Ferrigno famous.\nThese victories, however, did not provide enough income for him to earn a living. His first paying job was as a $10-an-hour sheet metal worker in a Brooklyn factory, where he worked for three years. He did not enjoy the dangerous work, and left after a friend and co-worker accidentally cut off his own hand.\nFollowing this, Ferrigno left the competition circuit for many years, a period that included a brief stint as a defensive lineman for the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He had never played football, and was cut after two games. Ferrigno left the world of Canadian football after he broke the legs of a fellow player during a scrimmage.\nDuring competition, Ferrigno weighed in 1973 and in 1976.\nFerrigno competed in the first annual World's Strongest Man competition in 1977, where he finished fourth in a field of eight competitors.\nIn the early 1990s Ferrigno returned to bodybuilding, competing for the 1992 and 1993 Mr. Olympia titles. Finishing 12th and 10th, respectively, he then turned to the 1994 Masters Olympia, where his attempt to beat Robbie Robinson and Boyer Coe was the subject of the 1996 documentary \"Stand Tall\". After this, he retired from competition.\nActing career.\n1977\u20132008.\nIn 1977, Ferrigno was cast as the Hulk in \"The Incredible Hulk\". Though they were rarely on camera together, Ferrigno and who played the Hulk's \"normal\" alter became friends; Ferrigno has described Bixby as a \"mentor\" and \"father figure\" who took him under his wing. Ferrigno also singles out the instances in which Bixby directed Ferrigno in some episodes as particularly memorable. Ferrigno continued playing the Hulk role until 1981, although the last two episodes were not broadcast until May 1982. Later, he and Bixby co-starred in three \"The Incredible Hulk\" TV movies.\nIn November 1978 and again in May 1979 Ferrigno appeared in \"Battle of the Network Stars\". He portrayed the titular character in the 1983 science fantasy adventure film \"Hercules\", and received mixed-to-negative reviews for his performance. He was, however, praised by Marylynn Uricchio, a film critic for the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", and Andy Brack of \"Charleston City Paper\". Gary Allen Smith, author of the book \"Epic Films\", complimented Ferrigno's physical strength and aesthetics in the film: \"At 6'52\" and 280 pounds, he is a massive and thoroughly convincing Hercules\". In 2014, \"Decider\" named Ferrigno the tenth \"hottest onscreen Hercules ever\".\nIn 1983, Ferrigno appeared as John Six in the short-lived medical drama \"Trauma Center\".\nFerrigno played himself during intermittent guest appearances on the CBS sitcom \"The King of Queens\", beginning in 2000 and continuing until the program's conclusion in 2007. He and his wife Carla were depicted as the main characters' next-door neighbors, enduring their jokes about him being the Hulk.\nHe made cameo appearances as a security guard in both the 2003 film \"Hulk\" and the 2008 film \"The Incredible Hulk\", in which he also voiced the Hulk. In the latter film, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) bribes him with a pizza to gain entry into a university building. He voiced the Hulk in other Marvel Cinematic Universe films, uncredited. He voiced the Hulk until 2015's \"\". Mark Ruffalo has voiced Hulk in subsequent films.\n2009\u2013present.\nHe trained Michael Jackson intermittently beginning in the early 1990s, and in 2009, he helped Jackson get into shape for a planned series of concerts in London, which were ultimately cancelled after Jackson's death.\nFerrigno took part in a Smosh sketch, titled \"I Love Lou Ferrigno\", in which he is tracked down by one of Smosh's members, Anthony Padilla, in Hollywood. The skit ends with Ferrigno knocking Padilla unconscious in response to Ian Hecox's claim that Padilla stole Ferrigno's Butterfinger.\nFerrigno has his own line of fitness equipment called Ferrigno Fitness. In January 2009, he provided equipment to \"The Price Is Right\" for use as a One Bid prize and demonstrated the equipment himself.\nIn 2016, Ferrigno appeared as a playable Lego version of himself in \"Lego Marvel's Avengers\".\nNon-acting endeavors.\nIn February 2006, Ferrigno was sworn in as a Los Angeles County, California, reserve sheriff's deputy, Level II. In November 2010, Maricopa County, Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio swore Ferrigno in as a member of a volunteer sheriff posse, which also included actors Steven Seagal and Peter Lupus, in order to help control illegal immigration in the Phoenix Valley area.\nFerrigno was a contestant on season five of the NBC reality television series \"The Celebrity Apprentice\", which premiered in February 2012. He appeared on the program in order to raise money for his charity, the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Ferrigno was Team Unanimous' project manager for the task depicted in the fifth episode, \"I'm Going to Mop the Floor With You,\" which was to create a viral video to promote O-Cedar's ProMist Spray Mop, placing him in competition with actress Tia Carrere, the project manager of the women's team, Forte. In addition to the usual $20,000 awarded to the charity of the project manager of the winning team, O-Cedar pledged an additional $30,000 for that task. Team Unanimous' video\u2014in which Ferrigno appeared dancing while mopping\u2014won the task, winning the $50,000 for Muscular Dystrophy Association. He was fired in episode nine, \"Ad Hawk\", which involved creating a 60-second commercial for Entertainment.com.\nIn June 2012, Ferrigno was sworn in as a reserve deputy to the San Luis Obispo County, California, Sheriff's Department. There he completed his level I law enforcement academy, bringing his training up to full peace officer status. In September 2013, Ferrigno was sworn in as a special deputy to the Delaware County, Ohio, Sheriff's Department.\nIn 2017, Ferrigno was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.\nIn May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Ferrigno to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness &amp; Nutrition.\nPersonal life.\nDue to ear infections he had soon after birth, Ferrigno lost 75 to 80% of his hearing and has been using hearing aids since the age of five. Ferrigno says his hearing loss helped shape his sense of determination in his youth, saying, \"I think that if I wasn't hard of hearing I wouldn't be where I am now. Early on, as a youngster it was difficult, but I'm not ashamed to talk about it because many people have misconceptions about hearing loss; like who has hearing loss and what it's like not to hear, so I do talk about it. I think my hearing loss helped create a determination within me to be all that I can be, and gave me a certain strength of character too. Anytime I do a movie or a TV show, I make them aware of my hearing loss at the beginning, and that makes it much easier for all of us to communicate and get the job done.\" Later in life, he received a cochlear implant which restored much of his hearing.\nFerrigno married Susan Groff in 1978, divorcing a year later. On May 3, 1980, he married psychotherapist Carla Green, who then also began serving as his manager; she later became a personal trainer. They have three children: Shanna (born 1981), Louis Jr. (born 1984), and Brent (born 1990). Shanna has a recurring role as Nurse Janice in \"Days of Our Lives\" and has also appeared in the NBC series \"Windfall\", the television film \"Within\", and the E! reality television series \"\". Louis Jr. was a linebacker for the University of Southern California Trojans football team and later became an actor, with recurring roles in TV series such as \"S.W.A.T.\" and \"Outer Banks\".\nFerrigno has filed suit against his younger brother, Andrew, on two occasions over the use of the name Ferrigno in business ventures.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18687", "revid": "50502953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18687", "title": "Leninism", "text": "Political theory developed by Vladimir Lenin\nLeninism (, ) is a political ideology developed by Russian Marxist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin that proposes the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat led by a revolutionary vanguard party as the political prelude to the establishment of communism. Lenin's ideological contributions to the Marxist ideology relate to his theories on the party, imperialism, the state, and revolution. The function of the Leninist vanguard party is to provide the working classes with the political consciousness (education and organisation) and revolutionary leadership necessary to depose capitalism in the Russian Empire (1721\u20131917).\nLeninist revolutionary leadership is based upon \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848), identifying the communist party as \"the most advanced and resolute section of the working class parties of every country; that section which pushes forward all others.\" As the vanguard party, the Bolsheviks viewed history through the theoretical framework of dialectical materialism, which sanctioned political commitment to the successful overthrow of capitalism, and then to instituting socialism; and, as the revolutionary national government, to realise the socio-economic transition by all means.\nIn the aftermath of the October Revolution (1917), Leninism was the dominant version of Marxism in Russia and the basis of soviet democracy, the rule of directly elected soviets. In establishing the socialist mode of production in Bolshevik Russia\u2014with the Decree on Land (1917), war communism (1918\u20131921), and the New Economic Policy (1921\u20131928)\u2014the revolutionary r\u00e9gime suppressed most political opposition, including Marxists who opposed Lenin's actions, the anarchists and the Mensheviks, factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. The Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922), which included the seventeen-army Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131925), and left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks (1918\u20131924), was an external and internal war which transformed Bolshevik Russia into the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (RSFSR), the core republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\nAs revolutionary praxis, Leninism originally was neither a proper philosophy nor a discrete political theory. Leninism comprises politico-economic developments of orthodox Marxism and Lenin's interpretations of Marxism, which function as a pragmatic synthesis for practical application to the actual conditions (political, social, economic) of the post-emancipation agrarian society of Imperial Russia in the early 20th century. As a political-science term, Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution entered common usage at the fifth congress of the Communist International (1924), when Grigory Zinoviev applied the term \"Leninism\" to denote \"vanguard-party revolution.\" \"Leninism\" was accepted as part of CPSU's vocabulary and doctrine around 1922, and in January 1923, despite objections from Lenin, it entered the public vocabulary.\nHistorical background.\nIn the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote the \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\" (1848), in which they called for the political unification of the European working classes in order to achieve communist revolution; and proposed that because the socio-economic organisation of communism was of a higher form than that of capitalism, a workers' revolution first would occur in the industrialised countries. In Germany, Marxist social democracy was the political perspective of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, inspiring Russian Marxists, such as Lenin.\nIn the early 20th century, the socio-economic backwardness of Imperial Russia (1721\u20131917) \u2014 characterized by combined and uneven economic development \u2014 facilitated rapid and intensive industrialisation, which produced a united, working-class proletariat in a predominantly agrarian society. Moreover, because industrialisation was financed chiefly with foreign capital, Imperial Russia did not possess a revolutionary bourgeoisie with political and economic influence upon the workers and the peasants, as had been the case in the French Revolution (1789\u20131799) in the 18th century. Although Russia's political economy was agrarian and semi-feudal, the task of democratic revolution fell to the urban, industrial working class as the only social class capable of effecting land reform and democratisation, in view that the Russian bourgeoisie would suppress any revolution.\nIn the \"April Theses\" (1917), the political strategy of the October Revolution (7\u20138 November 1917), Lenin proposed that the Russian revolution was not an isolated national event but a fundamentally international event\u2014the first socialist revolution in the world. Lenin's practical application of Marxism and proletarian revolution to the social, political, and economic conditions of agrarian Russia motivated and impelled the \"revolutionary nationalism of the poor\" to depose the absolute monarchy of the three-hundred-year dynasty of the House of Romanov (1613\u20131917), as tsars of Russia.\nImperialism.\nIn \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\" (1916), Lenin's economic analyses indicated that capitalism would transform into a global financial system, by which industrialised countries exported financial capital to their colonies and so realise the exploitation of the labour of the natives and the exploitation of the natural resources of their countries. Such superexploitation allows wealthy countries to maintain a domestic labour aristocracy with a slightly higher standard of living than most workers, ensuring peaceful labour\u2013capital relations in the capitalist homeland. Therefore, a proletarian revolution of workers and peasants could not occur in capitalist countries whilst the imperialist global-finance system remained in place. The first proletarian revolution would have to occur in an underdeveloped country, such as Imperial Russia, the politically weakest country in the capitalist global-finance system in the early 20th century. In the \"United States of Europe Slogan\" (1915), Lenin wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Workers of the world, unite!\u2014Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible, first in several, or even in one capitalist country taken separately. The victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and organised its own socialist production, would stand up against the rest of the world, the capitalist world.\u2014\u200a\nIn \"\" (1920), Lenin wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The more powerful enemy can be vanquished only by exerting the utmost effort, and by the most thorough, careful, attentive, skillful and obligatory use of any, even the smallest, rift between the enemies, any conflict of interests among the bourgeoisie of the various countries and among the various groups or types of bourgeoisie within the various countries, and also by taking advantage of any, even the smallest, opportunity of winning a mass ally, even though this ally is temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional. Those who do not understand this reveal a failure to understand even the smallest grain of Marxism, of modern scientific socialism in general. Those who have not proved in practice, over a fairly considerable period of time and in fairly varied political situations, their ability to apply this truth in practice have not yet learned to help the revolutionary class in its struggle to emancipate all toiling humanity from the exploiters. And this applies equally to the period before and after the proletariat has won political power.\u2014\u200a\nLeninist praxis.\nVanguard party.\nIn Chapter II, \"Proletarians and Communists\", of \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848), Marx and Engels present the communist party as the political vanguard solely qualified to lead the proletariat in revolution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Communists, therefore, are, on the one hand, practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.\nThe revolutionary purpose of the Leninist vanguard party is to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat with the working class's support. The communist party would lead the popular deposition of the Tsarist government and then transfer government power to the working class; that change of the ruling class\u2014from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat\u2014makes establishing socialism possible. In \"What Is To Be Done?\" (1902), Lenin said that a revolutionary vanguard party, recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign because only in that way would the proletariat successfully realise their revolution; unlike the economic campaign of trade-union-struggle advocated by other socialist political parties and the anarcho-syndicalists. Like Marx, Lenin distinguished between the aspects of a revolution, the \"economic campaign\" (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions) that featured diffused plural leadership; and the \"political campaign\" (socialist changes to society), which required the decisive, revolutionary leadership of the Bolshevik vanguard party.\nDemocratic centralism.\nBased upon the First International (IWA, International Workingmen's Association, 1864\u20131876), Lenin organised the Bolsheviks as a democratically centralised vanguard party; wherein free political speech was recognised as legitimate until policy consensus; afterwards, every member of the party was expected to abide by the agreed policy. Democratic debate was Bolshevik practice, even after Lenin banned factions among the Party in 1921. Despite being a guiding political influence, Lenin did not exercise absolute power and continually debated to have his points of view accepted as a course of revolutionary action. In \"Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action\" (1905), Lenin said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of course, the application of this principle in practice will sometimes give rise to disputes and misunderstandings; but only on the basis of this principle can all disputes and all misunderstandings be settled honourably for the Party. ... The principle of democratic centralism and autonomy for local Party organisations implies universal and full freedom to criticise, so long as this does not disturb the unity of a definite action; it rules out all criticism which disrupts or makes difficult the unity of an action decided on by the Party.\nProletarian revolution.\nBefore the October Revolution, despite supporting moderate political reform\u2014including Bolsheviks elected to the Duma when opportune\u2014Lenin said that capitalism could only be overthrown with proletarian revolution, not with gradual reforms\u2014from within (Fabianism) and from without (social democracy)\u2014which would fail because the bourgeoisie's control of the means of production determined the nature of political power in Russia. As epitomised in the slogan \"For a Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Peasantry\", a proletarian revolution in underdeveloped Russia required a united proletariat (peasants and industrial workers) to assume government power in the cities successfully. Moreover, owing to the middle-class aspirations of much of the peasantry, Leon Trotsky said that the proletarian leadership of the revolution would ensure truly socialist and democratic socio-economic change.\nDictatorship of the proletariat.\nIn Bolshevik Russia, government by direct democracy was realised and effected by the soviets (elected councils of workers), which Lenin said was the \"democratic dictatorship of the proletariat\" postulated in orthodox Marxism. The soviets comprised representative committees from the factories and the trade unions but excluded the capitalist social class to establish a proletarian government by and for the working class and the peasants. Concerning the political disenfranchisement of the capitalist social class in Bolshevik Russia, Lenin said that \"depriving the exploiters of the franchise is a purely Russian question, and not a question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in general.\u00a0... In which countries\u00a0...democracy for the exploiters will be, in one or another form, restricted\u00a0...is a question of the specific national features of this or that capitalism.\" In chapter five of \"The State and Revolution\" (1917), Lenin describes the dictatorship of the proletariat as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of crushing the oppressors.\u00a0... An immense expansion of democracy, which, for the first time, becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the rich\u00a0... and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, for the exploiters and oppressors of the people\u2014this is the change which democracy undergoes during the 'transition' from capitalism to communism.\nConcerning the disenfranchisement from democracy of the capitalist social class, Lenin said: \"Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, of the exploiters and oppressors of the people\u2014this is the change democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism.\" The dictatorship of the proletariat was effected with soviet constitutionalism, a form of government opposite to the dictatorship of capital (privately owned means of production) practised in bourgeois democracies. Under soviet constitutionalism, the Leninist vanguard party would be one of many political parties competing for election to government power. Nevertheless, because of the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131924) and the anti-Bolshevik terrorism of opposing political parties aiding the White Armies' counter-revolution, the Bolshevik government banned all other political parties, which left the Leninist vanguard party as the only political party in Russia. Lenin said that such political suppression was not philosophically inherent to the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nEconomics.\nThe Bolshevik government nationalised industry and established a foreign-trade monopoly to allow the productive coordination of the national economy and so prevent Russian national industries from competing against each other. To feed the populaces of town and country, Lenin instituted war communism (1918\u20131921) as a necessary condition\u2014adequate supplies of food and weapons\u2014for fighting the Russian Civil War. In March 1921, the New Economic Policy (NEP, 1921\u20131929) allowed limited local capitalism (private commerce and internal free trade) and replaced grain requisitions with an agricultural tax managed by state banks. The NEP was meant to resolve food-shortage riots by the peasantry and allowed limited private enterprise; the profit motive encouraged farmers to produce the crops required to feed town and country; and to economically re-establish the urban working class, who had lost many workers to fight the counter-revolutionary Civil War. The NEP nationalisation of the economy then would facilitate the industrialisation of Russia, politically strengthen the working class, and raise the standards of living for all Russians. Lenin said that the appearance of new socialist states was necessary for strengthening Russia's economy in establishing Russian socialism. Lenin's socio-economic perspective was supported by the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919, the Italian insurrection and general strikes of 1920, and worker wage-riots in the UK, France, and the US.\nNational self-determination.\nIn recognising and accepting nationalism among oppressed peoples, Lenin advocated their national right to self-determination and so opposed Russian chauvinism because such ethnocentrism was a cultural obstacle to establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in every territory of the deposed Russian Empire (1721\u20131917). In \"The Right of Nations to Self-determination\" (1914), Lenin said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We fight against the privileges and violence of the oppressor nation, and do not in any way condone strivings for privileges on the part of the oppressed nation.\u00a0:... The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression, and it is this content that we unconditionally support. At the same time, we strictly distinguish it from the tendency towards national exclusiveness.\u00a0... Can a nation be free if it oppresses other nations? It cannot.\nThe socialist internationalism of Marxism and Bolshevism is based upon class struggle and a people's transcending nationalism, ethnocentrism, and religion\u2014the intellectual obstacles to progressive class consciousness\u2014which are the cultural \"status quo\" that the capitalist ruling class manipulates in order to divide the working classes and the peasant classes politically. To overcome that barrier to establishing socialism, Lenin said that acknowledging nationalism, as a people's right of self-determination and right of secession, naturally would allow socialist states to transcend the political limitations of nationalism to form a federation. In \"The Question of Nationalities, or 'Autonomisation\"' (1923), Lenin said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[N]othing holds up the development and strengthening of proletarian class solidarity so much as national injustice; \"offended\" nationals are not sensitive to anything, so much as to the feeling of equality, and the violation of this equality, if only through negligence or jest \u2013 to the violation of that equality by their proletarian comrades.\nSocialist culture.\nThe role of the Leninist vanguard party was to politically educate the workers and peasants to dispel the societal false consciousness of religion and nationalism that constitute the cultural \"status quo\" taught by the bourgeoisie to the proletariat to facilitate their economic exploitation of peasants and workers. Influenced by Lenin, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party stated that the development of the socialist workers' culture should not be \"hamstrung from above\" and opposed the \"Proletkult\" (1917\u20131925) organisational control of the national culture.\nLeninism after 1924.\nStalinism and Marxism\u2013Leninism.\nIn post-Revolutionary Russia, the Stalinist application of Marxism\u2013Leninism (socialism in one country), and Trotskyism (permanent world revolution) were the principal philosophies of communism that claimed legitimate ideological descent from Leninism; thus, within the Communist Party, each ideological faction denied the political legitimacy of the opposing faction. Until shortly before his death, Lenin countered Stalin's disproportionate political influence in the Communist Party and the bureaucracy of the Soviet government, partly because of abuses he had committed against the populace of Georgia and partly because the autocratic Stalin had accumulated administrative power disproportionate to his office of General Secretary of the Communist Party.\nThe counter-action against Stalin aligned with Lenin's advocacy of the right of self-determination for the national and ethnic groups of the deposed Tsarist Empire. Lenin warned the Party that Stalin had \"unlimited authority concentrated in his hands, and I am not sure whether he will always be capable of using that authority with sufficient caution\" and formed a faction with Leon Trotsky to remove Stalin as the General Secretary of the Communist Party.\nTo that end followed proposals reducing the administrative powers of party posts to reduce bureaucratic influence upon the policies of the Communist Party. Lenin advised Trotsky to emphasise Stalin's recent bureaucratic alignment in such matters (e.g. undermining the anti-bureaucratic workers' and peasants' Inspection) and argued to depose Stalin as General Secretary. Despite advice to refuse \"any rotten compromise\", he did not heed Lenin's advice and General Secretary Stalin retained power over the Communist Party and the bureaucracy of the Soviet government.\nTrotskyism.\nIn 1922, Lenin allied with Leon Trotsky against the party's growing bureaucratisation and the influence of Joseph Stalin. Lenin himself never mentioned the concept of \"Trotskyism\" after Trotsky became a member of the Bolshevik party but the term was employed by Stalin and the troika to present Trotsky's views as factional and anathematical to Leninist thought.\nAfter Lenin's death (21 January 1924), Trotsky ideologically battled the influence of Stalin, who formed ruling blocs within the Russian Communist Party (with Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, then with Nikolai Bukharin and then by himself) and so determined soviet government policy from 1924 onwards. The ruling blocs continually denied Stalin's opponents the right to organise as an opposition faction within the party\u2014thus, the reinstatement of democratic centralism and free speech within the Communist Party were key arguments of Trotsky's Left Opposition and the later Joint Opposition.\nIn instituting government policy, Stalin promoted the doctrine of socialism in one country (adopted 1925), wherein the Soviet Union would establish socialism upon Russia's economic foundations (and support socialist revolutions elsewhere). In a 1936 interview with journalist Roy W. Howard, Stalin articulated his rejection of world revolution and stated that \u201cWe never had such plans and intentions\u201d and that \u201cThe export of revolution is nonsense\u201d.\nConversely, Trotsky held that socialism in one country would economically constrain the industrial development of the Soviet Union and thus required assistance from the new socialist countries in the developed world\u2014which was essential for maintaining soviet democracy\u2014in 1924, much undermined by the Russian Civil War of White Army counter-revolution. Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution proposed that socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would further dismantle feudal r\u00e9gimes and establish socialist democracies that would not pass through a capitalist stage of development and government. Hence, revolutionary workers should ally politically with peasant political organisations, not capitalist political parties. In contrast, Stalin and his allies proposed that alliances with capitalist political parties were essential to realising a revolution where communists were too few. Said Stalinist practice failed, especially in the Northern Expedition, which resulted in the right-wing Kuomintang's massacre of the Chinese Communist Party. Despite the failure, Stalin's policy of mixed-ideology political alliances nonetheless became Comintern's policy.\nUntil exiled from Russia in 1929, Trotsky developed and led the Left Opposition (and the later Joint Opposition) with members of the Workers' Opposition, the Decembrists and (later) the Zinovievists. Trotskyism predominated the politics of the Left Opposition, which demanded the restoration of soviet democracy, the expansion of democratic centralism in the Communist Party, national industrialisation, international permanent revolution and socialist internationalism. According to historian Sheila Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation.\nThe Trotskyist demands countered Stalin's political dominance of the Communist Party, which was officially characterised by the \"cult of Lenin\", the rejection of permanent revolution, and advocated the doctrine of socialism in one country. The Stalinist economic policy vacillated between appeasing the capitalist interests of the kulak in the countryside and destroying them as a social class. Initially, the Stalinists also rejected the national industrialisation of Russia but then pursued it in full, sometimes brutally. In both cases, the Left Opposition denounced the regressive nature of Stalin's policy towards the wealthy kulak social class and the brutality of forced industrialisation. Trotsky described Stalinist vacillation as a symptom of the undemocratic nature of a ruling bureaucracy.\nDuring the 1920s and the 1930s, Stalin fought and defeated the political influence of Trotsky and the Trotskyists in Russia using slander, antisemitism, censorship, expulsions, exile (internal and external), and imprisonment. The anti-Trotsky campaign culminated in the executions (official and unofficial) of the Moscow Trials (1936\u20131938), which were part of the Great Purge of Old Bolsheviks who had led the Revolution.\nCriticism.\nCriticsim of Leninism's economics has been wide-ranging from the political left and the right. \n20th century criticism.\nJohn Maynard Keynes wrote in his essay on persuasion in 1931 on Leninism: \"I cannot perceive that Russian Communism has made any contribution to our economic problems of intellectual interest or scientific value. I do not think that it contains, or is likely to contain, any piece of useful economic technique which we could not apply, if we chose, with equal or greater success in a society which retained all the marks, I will not say of nineteenth-century individualistic capitalism, but of British bourgeois ideals. Theoretically at least, I do not believe that there is any economic improvement for which Revolution is a necessary instrument. On the other hand, we have everything to lose by the methods of violent change. In Western industrial conditions the tactics of Red Revolution would throw the whole population into a pit of poverty and death.\"Noam Chomsky interviewed in 2013 noted the outcome of Leninsim:\"When he became the leader, he didn\u2019t waste much time, and Trotsky helped him, in instituting a pretty repressive regime with the basic elements of Stalinism. They moved pretty quickly to dismantle most of the organs of popular power. Not over night, but over a short time they were able to basically dismantle the soviets, the factory councils, to convert the labor force into a labor army. The peasant revolutionary forces were very much opposed to this incidentally. As distinct from Marx who saw revolutionary potential in the Russian peasantry, the urban communists, like Lenin were strongly opposed to that.\"\nLeft-wing criticism.\nAs a form of Marxism, revolutionary Leninism was criticised as an undemocratic interpretation of socialism. In \"The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution\" (1918), Rosa Luxemburg criticised the Bolsheviks for the suppression of the All Russian Constituent Assembly (January 1918); the partitioning of the feudal estates to the peasant communes; and the right of self-determination of every national people of the Russias. That the strategic (geopolitical) mistakes of the Bolsheviks would create significant dangers for the Russian Revolution, such as the bureaucratisation that would arise to administrate the large country that was Bolshevik Russia. In defence of the expedient revolutionary practice, in \"\" (1920), Lenin dismissed the political and ideological complaints of the anti-Bolshevik critics, who claimed ideologically correct stances that were to the political left of Lenin. In Marxist philosophy, left communism is a range of left-wing political perspectives among communists. Left communism criticizes the Bolshevik Party's ideology as the revolutionary vanguard. Ideologically, left communists present their perspectives and approaches as authentic Marxism and thus more oriented to the proletariat than the Leninism of the Communist International at their first (1919) and second (1920) congresses. Proponents of left communism include Amadeo Bordiga, Herman Gorter, Paul Mattick, Sylvia Pankhurst, Antonie Pannekoek and Otto R\u00fchle.\nHistorically, the Dutch-German communist left has been most critical of Lenin and Leninism, yet the Italian communist left remained Leninist. Bordiga said: \"All this work of demolishing opportunism and 'deviationism' (Lenin: \"What Is To Be Done?\") is today the basis of party activity. The party follows revolutionary tradition and experiences in this work during these periods of revolutionary reflux and the proliferation of opportunist theories, which had as their violent and inflexible opponents Marx, Engels, Lenin, and the Italian Left.\" In \"The Lenin Legend\" (1935), Paul Mattick said that the council communist tradition, begun by the Dutch-German leftists, also is critical of Leninism. Contemporary left-communist organisations, such as the Internationalist Communist Tendency and the International Communist Current, view Lenin as an essential and influential theorist but remain critical of Leninism as political praxis for the proletarian revolution.\nNonetheless, the Bordigism of the International Communist Party abides Bordiga's strict Leninism. Ideologically aligned with the Dutch-German left, among the ideologists of contemporary communisation, the theorist Gilles Dauv\u00e9 criticised Leninism as a \"by-product of Kautskyism\". In \"The Soviet Union Versus Socialism\" (1986), Noam Chomsky said that Stalinism was the logical development of Leninism and not an ideological deviation from Lenin's policies, which resulted in collectivisation enforced with a police state. He also argued, in light of the tenets of socialism, Leninism was a right-wing deviation from Marxism.\nThe vanguard-party revolution of Leninism became the ideological basis of the communist parties in the socialist political spectrum. In the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party organised itself with Maoism (the Thought of Mao Zedong), socialism with Chinese characteristics. In Singapore, the People's Action Party (PAP) featured internal democracy and initiated single-party dominance in the government and politics of Singapore. In the event, the practical application of Maoism to the socio-economic conditions of Third World countries produced revolutionary vanguard parties, such as the Communist Party of Peru \u2013 Red Fatherland.\nLegacy.\nDebated influence on Stalinism.\nSome historians such as Richard Pipes consider Stalinism as the natural consequence of Leninism, that Stalin \"faithfully implemented Lenin's domestic and foreign policy programs\". Robert Service notes that \"institutionally and ideologically Lenin laid the foundations for a Stalin ... but the passage from Leninism to the worse terrors of Stalinism was not smooth and inevitable.\" Historian and Stalin biographer Edvard Radzinsky believes that Stalin was a genuine follower of Lenin, exactly as he claimed himself. Proponents of continuity cite a variety of contributory factors, in that it was Lenin, rather than Stalin, whose civil war measures introduced the Red Terror with its hostage-taking and internment camps; that it was Lenin who developed the infamous Article 58 and who established the autocratic system within the Russian Communist Party. Proponents also note that Lenin put a ban on factions within the party and introduced the one-party state in 1921, a move that enabled Stalin to get rid of his rivals easily after Lenin's death and cite Felix Dzerzhinsky, who exclaimed during the Bolshevik struggle against opponents in the Russian Civil War: \"We stand for organized terror\u2014this should be frankly stated.\"\nOther scholars have had a differing view and attributed the establishment of the one-party system in the Soviet Union to the wartime conditions imposed on Lenin's government and others have highlighted the initial attempts to form a coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. According to historian Marcel Liebman, Lenin's wartime measures such as banning opposition parties was prompted by the fact that several political parties either took up arms against the new Soviet government, or participated in sabotage, collaborated with the deposed Tsarists, or made assassination attempts against Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. Liebman also argued that the banning of parties under Lenin did not have the same repressive character as later bans enforced under the Stalinist regime. Several scholars have highlighted the socially progressive nature of Lenin's policies such as universal education, universal healthcare and equal rights for women. Conversely, Stalin's regime reversed Lenin's policies on social matters such as sexual equality, legal restrictions on marriage, rights of sexual minorities and protective legislation. Historian Robert Vincent Daniels also viewed the Stalinist period as a counter-revolution in Soviet cultural life which revived patriotic propaganda, the Tsarist programme of Russification and traditional, military ranks which had been criticized by Lenin as expressions of \"Great Russian chauvinism\". Daniels also regarded Stalinism to represent an abrupt break with the Leninist period in terms of economic policies in which a deliberated, scientific system of economic planning that featured former Menshevik economists at Gosplan had been replaced with a hasty version of planning with unrealistic targets, bureaucratic waste, bottlenecks and shortages.\nRevisionist historians and some post\u2013Cold War and otherwise dissident Soviet historians, including Roy Medvedev, argue that \"one could list the various measures carried out by Stalin that were actually a continuation of anti-democratic trends and measures implemented under Lenin\", but that \"in so many ways, Stalin acted, not in line with Lenin's clear instructions, but in defiance of them.\" In doing so, some historians have tried to distance Stalinism from Leninism to undermine the totalitarian view that the negative facets of Stalin were inherent in communism from the start. Critics include anti-Stalinist communists such as Leon Trotsky, who pointed out that Lenin attempted to persuade the Russian Communist Party to remove Stalin from his post as its General Secretary. Lenin's Testament, the document which contained this order, was suppressed after Lenin's death. Trotsky also argued that he and Lenin had intended to lift the ban on the opposition parties such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as soon as the economic and social conditions of Soviet Russia had improved. Various historians have cited Lenin's proposal to appoint Trotsky as a Vice-chairman of the Soviet Union as evidence that he intended Trotsky to be his successor as head of government. In his biography of Trotsky, Polish-British historian Isaac Deutscher says that, on being faced with the evidence, \"only the blind and the deaf could be unaware of the contrast between Stalinism and Leninism.\" According to Stalin's secretary, Boris Bazhanov, Stalin was jubilant over Lenin's death while \u201cpublicly putting on the mask of grief\u201d. French historian Pierre Broue disputed the historical assessments of the early Soviet Union by modern historians such as Dmitri Volkogonov in which he argued had falsely equated Leninism, Stalinism and Trotskyism to present the notion of ideological continuity and reinforce the position of counter-communism. Other revisionist historians, such as Orlando Figes, whilst critical of the Soviet era, acknowledge that Lenin had actively sought to counter the growing influence of Stalin through a number of actions such as his alliance with Trotsky in 1922\u201323, opposition to Stalin on foreign trade, the Georgian affair and proposed party reforms which included the democratisation of the Central Committee and recruitment of 50\u2013100 ordinary workers into the lower organs of the party.\nNikita Khrushchev, Stalin's successor, argued that Stalin's regime differed profusely from the leadership of Lenin in his \"Secret Speech\", delivered in 1956. He was critical of the cult of the individual which was constructed around Stalin whereas Lenin stressed \u201cthe role of the people as the creator of history\u201d. He also emphasized that Lenin favored a collective leadership which relied on personal persuasion and recommended the removal of Stalin from the position of General Secretary. Khrushchev contrasted this with the \u201cdespotism\u201d of Stalin which require absolute submission to his position and he also highlighted that many of the people who were later annihilated as \u201cenemies of the party\", \"had worked with Lenin during his life\u201d. He also contrasted the \u201csevere methods\u201d used by Lenin in the \u201cmost necessary cases\u201d as a \u201cstruggle for survival\u201d during the Civil War with the extreme methods and mass repressions used by Stalin even when the Revolution was \u201calready victorious\u201d. In his memoirs, Khrushchev argued that Stalin's widespread purges of the \"most advanced nucleus of people\" among the Old Bolsheviks and leading figures in the military and scientific fields had \"undoubtedly\" weakened the nation.\nSome Marxist theoreticians have disputed the view that the Stalinist dictatorship was a natural outgrowth of the Bolsheviks' actions as most of the original central committee members from 1917 were later eliminated by Stalin. George Novack stressed the initial efforts by the Bolsheviks to form a government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and bring other parties such as the Mensheviks into political legality. Tony Cliff argued the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition government dissolved the democratically elected Russian Constituent Assembly due to a number of reasons. They cited the outdated voter-rolls which did not acknowledge the split among the Socialist Revolutionary party and the assemblies conflict with the Russian Congress of the Soviets as an alternative democratic structure.\nA similar analysis is present in more recent works such as those of Graeme Gill, who argues that \"[Stalinism was] not a natural flow-on of earlier developments; [it formed a] sharp break resulting from conscious decisions by leading political actors.\" However, Gill notes that \"difficulties with the use of the term reflect problems with the concept of Stalinism itself. The major difficulty is a lack of agreement about what should constitute Stalinism.\" Revisionist historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have criticized the focus on the upper levels of society and the use of Cold War concepts such as totalitarianism, obscuring the system's reality.\nRussian historian Vadim Rogovin stated that \"Under Lenin, the freedom to express a real variety of opinions existed in the party, and in carrying out political decisions, consideration was given to the positions of not only the majority, but a minority in the party\". He compared this practice with subsequent leadership blocs which violated party tradition, ignored proposals of opponents and expelled the Opposition from the party on falsified charges which culminated with the Moscow Trials of 1936\u20131938. According to Rogovin, 80-90% of the members of the Central Committee elected at the Sixth through to the Seventeenth Congresses were physically annihilated.\nThe Right Opposition and Left Opposition have been held by some scholars as representing political alternatives to Stalinism despite their shared beliefs in Leninism due to their policy platforms which were at variance with Stalin. This ranged from areas related to economics, foreign policy and cultural matters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nSelected works by Vladimir Lenin\nHistories\nOther authors\nExternal links.\nWorks by Vladimir Lenin\nOther thematic links"}

The decoration is issued to members of the eight uniformed services of the United States as well as to military and political figures of foreign governments.\nThe Legion of Merit (Commander degree) is one of only two United States military decorations to be issued as a neck order (the other being the Medal of Honor), and the only United States military decoration that may be issued in degrees (much like an order of chivalry or certain orders of merit), although the degrees including a neck ribbon are only awarded to non-U.S. nationals.\nThe Legion of Merit is seventh in the order of precedence of all U.S. military awards and is worn after the Defense Superior Service Medal and before the Distinguished Flying Cross. In contemporary use in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Legion of Merit is typically awarded to Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force general officers and colonels, and Navy and Coast Guard flag officers and captains occupying senior command or very senior staff positions in their respective services. It may also be awarded to officers of lesser rank, senior warrant officers (typically in command positions at the rank of chief warrant officer 5), and to very senior enlisted personnel (typically in the rank of command sergeant major and Sergeant Major of the Army in the Army, fleet master chief petty officer and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy in the Navy, command chief master sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in the Air Force, command chief master sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant of the Space Force in the Space Force, and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in the Marine Corps), but these instances are less frequent, typically by exception, and the circumstances vary by branch of service.\nAuthority to award the Legion of Merit is reserved for general officers and flag officers in pay grade O-9 (i.e., lieutenant general, vice admiral) and above, civilian Department of Defense personnel at assistant service secretary or Assistant Secretary of Defense level and above, or equivalent secretary-level civilian personnel with the Department of Homeland Security with direct oversight of the U.S. Coast Guard.\nCriteria.\nThe degrees of Chief Commander, Commander, Officer, and Legionnaire are awarded only to members of armed forces of foreign nations under the criteria outlined in Army Regulation 672-7 and is based on the relative rank or position of the recipient as follows:\n#Chief Commander: Head of state or government. However, this degree was awarded by President Roosevelt to some Allied World War II theater commanders, usually for joint amphibious landings or invasions. (The President had this power under Executive Order of October 29, 1942, paragraph 3b.)\n#Commander: Equivalent of a U.S. military chief of staff or higher position, but not to a head of state.\n#Officer: General or flag officer below the equivalent of a U.S. military chief of staff; colonel or equivalent rank (e.g., Navy or Coast Guard captain) for service in assignments equivalent to those normally held by a general or flag officer in U.S. military service; or military attach\u00e9s.\n#Legionnaire: All recipients not included above.\nWhen the Legion of Merit is awarded to members of the uniformed services of the United States, it is awarded without reference to degree. The criteria are \"for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements\" and is typically reserved for senior officers at O-6 level and above, typically in connection with senior leadership/command positions or other senior positions of significant responsibility.\nThe degrees and the design of the decoration were influenced by the French Legion of Honour (\"L\u00e9gion d'honneur\").\nHistory.\nWorld War II.\nAlthough recommendations for creation of a medal for meritorious service were initiated as early as September 1937, no formal action was taken toward approval.\nIn a letter to the Quartermaster General (QMG) dated December 24, 1941, the Adjutant General formally requested action be initiated to create a meritorious service medal, and provide designs in the event the decoration was established. Proposed designs prepared by Bailey Banks and Biddle, and the Office of the Quartermaster General were provided to the Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel (Colonel Heard) by the QMG on January 5, 1942.\nThe Assistant Chief of Staff (G-1), Brigadier General John H. Hilldring, in a response to the QMG on April 3, 1942, indicated the Secretary of War had approved the design recommended by the QMG. The design of the Legion of Merit (change of name) would be ready for issue immediately after legislation authorizing it was enacted into law. (A separate medal called the Meritorious Service Medal was established in 1969.)\nAn act of Congress (Public Law 671, 77th Congress, Chapter 508, 2d Session) on July 20, 1942, established the Legion of Merit and provided that the medal \"shall have suitable appurtenances and devices and not more than four degrees, and which the President, under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe, may award to\n(a) personnel of the Armed Forces of the United States and of the Government of the Commonwealth Philippines and\n(b) personnel of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations who, since the proclamation of an emergency by the President on 1939-09-08, shall have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services.\"\nThe medal was announced in War Department Bulletin No. 40, dated August 5, 1942. Executive Order 9260, dated October 29, 1942, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, established the rules for the Legion of Merit, and required the President's approval for the award.\nFollowing the invasion of North Africa in November 1942, a number of United States officers were awarded the Legion of Merit in the degree of Officer. One of the recipients was future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lyman Lemnitzer. Soon after, regulations for the award of the Legion of Merit were revised so that it would not be awarded in the degrees above Legionnaire to United States military personnel.\nThe Legion of Merit is similar to the French Legion of Honor in both its design, a five-armed cross, and in that it is awarded in multiple degrees. Unlike the Legion of Honor, however, the Legion of Merit is only awarded to military personnel. In addition, it is the only award in the world with multiple degrees of which the higher degrees cannot be awarded to citizens of the country of the award's origin.\nIn October 1942, Brazilian Army Brigadier General Amaro Soares Bittencourt became the first person awarded the Legion of Merit (Commander) and a week later, Lieutenant, junior grade Ann A. Bernatitus, a U.S. Navy Nurse Corps officer, became the first member of the United States Armed Forces and the first woman to receive the Legion of Merit. She received the award for her service during the defense of the Philippines. LTJG Bernatitus was also the first recipient of the Legion of Merit authorized to wear a Combat \"V\" with the medal.\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower was presented the Legion of Merit by President Roosevelt while he was en route to the Tehran Conference, in Cairo, Egypt, on November 26, 1943.\nIn 1943, at the request of the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, approval authority for U.S. personnel was delegated to the Department of War. Executive Order 10600, dated March 15, 1955, by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, again revised approval authority. Current provisions are contained in Title 10, United States Code 1121. As a result, awarding authority for the Legion of Merit resides with general officers/flag officers at the Lieutenant General / Vice Admiral level or higher.\nThe U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, unlike the Army and later the Air Force, provided for the Legion of Merit to be awarded with a \"V\" device indicating awards for participation in combat operations.\nFrom 1942 to 1944, the Legion of Merit was awarded for a fairly wide range of achievements. This was because it was, until the establishment of the Bronze Star Medal in 1944, the only decoration below the Silver Star which could be awarded for combat valor, and the only decoration below the Distinguished Service Medal which could be awarded for meritorious noncombat service.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter the establishment of the Bronze Star Medal (BSM) in February 1944, the Legion of Merit was awarded almost exclusively to senior officers in the rank of lieutenant colonel (Army, Marine Corps and Air Force) or commander (Navy and Coast Guard) (O-5), and above. Beginning in the 1980s, the Legion of Merit began to be awarded more frequently to senior-ranking warrant officers (W-4 and W-5), as well as to senior enlisted service members (E-8 and E-9), usually as a retirement award. When not awarded as a retirement award, it is most commonly awarded to officers in pay grade O-6 and higher.\nThe Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) was established in 1969 as a \"junior\" version of the Legion of Merit and prior to 2003 was only awarded for non-combat service. The MSM is awarded more frequently, and to more lower-ranking military personnel, than the Legion of Merit. Recipients of the MSM are usually in pay grades E-7 through E-9, W-3 through W-5 (Army Only), and O-4 through O-6 for the Army, Air Force, and Space Force; for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard the MSM is usually presented to those in pay grades E-9, W-4, W-5, O-5 and O-6.\nThe neck ribbon for the degree of Commander is wide and consists of the following stripes: white 67101; center crimson and white.\nInsignia.\nThe ribbon for all of the decorations is wide and consists of the following stripes: white; center crimson; and white. The reverse of all of the medals has the motto taken from the Great Seal of the United States, \"\" (\"He [God] has favored our undertakings\") and the date \"\" (1782), which is the date of America's first decoration, the Badge of Military Merit, now known as the Purple Heart. The ribbon design also follows the pattern of the Purple Heart ribbon.\nAdditional awards of the Legion of Merit are denoted by oak leaf clusters (in the Army, Air Force, and Space Force), and by gold stars (in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard). Until 2017, the sea services (the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard) awarded the Combat \"V\" for wear on the LOM. The Army, Air Force, and Space Force do not authorize the \"V\" device for the Legion of Merit.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18692", "revid": "626138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18692", "title": "Lint (software)", "text": "Tool to flag poor computer code\nLint is the computer science term for a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. A program which performs this function is also known as a \"linter\" or \"linting tool\".\nHistory.\nStephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, came up with the term \"lint\" in 1978 while debugging the yacc grammar he was writing for C and dealing with portability issues stemming from porting Unix to a 32-bit machine. The term was borrowed from the word lint, the tiny bits of fiber and fluff shed by clothing, as the command he wrote would act like a lint trap in a clothes dryer, capturing waste fibers while leaving whole fabrics intact. In 1979, lint programming was used outside of Bell Labs for the first time, in the seventh version (V7) of Unix.\nOver the years, different versions of lint have been developed for many C and C++ compilers, and while modern-day compilers have lint-like functions, lint-like tools have also advanced their capabilities. For example, Gimpel's PC-Lint, introduced in 1985 and used to analyze C++ source code, is still for sale.\nOverview.\nIn his original 1978 paper Johnson stated his reasoning in creating a separate program to detect errors, distinct from that which it analyzed: \"...the general notion of having two programs is a good one\" [because they concentrate on different things, thereby allowing the programmer to] \"concentrate at one stage of the programming process solely on the algorithms, data structures, and correctness of the program, and then later retrofit, with the aid of lint, the desirable properties of universality and portability\".\nSuccessor linters.\nThe analysis performed by lint-like tools can also be performed by an optimizing compiler, which aims to generate faster code. Even though modern compilers have evolved to include many of lint's historical functions, lint-like tools have also evolved to detect an even wider variety of suspicious constructs. These include \"warnings about syntax errors, uses of undeclared variables, calls to deprecated functions, spacing and formatting conventions, misuse of scope, implicit fallthrough in switch statements, missing license headers, [and]...dangerous language features\".\nLint-like tools are especially useful for dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python. Because the interpreters of such languages typically do not enforce as many and as strict rules during execution, linter tools can also be used as simple debuggers for finding common errors (e.g. syntactic discrepancies) as well as hard-to-find errors such as heisenbugs (drawing attention to suspicious code as \"possible errors\"). Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of source code.\nLint-like tools have also been developed for other aspects of software development, such as enforcing grammar and style guides for given language source code. Some tools (such as ESLint) also allow rules to be auto-fixable: a rule definition can also come with the definition of a transform that resolves the warning. Rules about style are especially likely to come with an auto-fix. If the linter is run in \"fix all\" mode on a file that triggers only rules about formatting, the linter will act just like a formatter.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are especially prized by aquarium owners. Among aquarium fish, livebearers are nearly all members of the family Poeciliidae and include: guppy, molly, platy, endler\u2019s and swordtails.\nThe advantages of livebearing to the aquarist are that the newborn juvenile fish are larger than newly-hatched fry, have a lower chance of mortality and are easier to care for. Unusual livebearers include seahorses and pipefish, where the males care for the young, and certain cichlids that are mouthbrooders, with the parent incubating the eggs in the buccal cavity.\nCommon aquarium livebearers.\nSpecies of interest to aquarists are almost always members of the family Poeciliidae, most commonly guppies, mollies, platies, swordtails, Endler's livebearer, and mosquitofish. Most of these are ovoviviparous, with the developing embryos receiving no nourishment from the parent fish, but a few are viviparous, receiving food from the maternal blood supply. \nBecause the newborn fish are large compared to the fry of oviparous fish, which are those that lay eggs, newborn fish of livebearers are easier to feed than the fry of egg-laying species, such as characins and cichlids. This makes them much easier to raise, and for this reason, aquarists often recommend them for beginning fish breeder hobbyists. The larger livebearer fry makes them far less vulnerable to predation, as the parents often eat fry if hungry. With the sufficient cover in the way of plants or porous objects, they can sometimes mature in a community tank.\nOvoviviparous and viviparous fish compared.\nMost of the Poeciliidae are ovoviviparous, that is, while the eggs are retained inside the body of the female for protection, the eggs are essentially independent of the mother and she does not provide them with any nutrients. In contrast, fish such as splitfins and halfbeaks are viviparous, with the eggs receiving food from the maternal blood supply through structures analogous to the placenta of placental mammals.\nAberrant livebearers and mouthbrooders.\nSeahorses and pipefish can be defined as livebearers, although in these cases the males incubate the eggs rather than the females. In many cases, the eggs are dependent on the male for oxygen and nutrition so these fish can be further defined as viviparous livebearers. \nMany cichlids are mouthbrooders, with the female (or more rarely the male) incubating the eggs in the mouth. Compared with other cichlids, these species produce fewer but bigger eggs, and when they emerge, the fry is better developed and has higher survivability. Because the eggs are protected from the environment but do not absorb nutrients from the parent, this condition is analogous to, though not identical with, ovoviviparity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Luperci, the priests of Faunus, celebrated certain ceremonies of the Lupercalia at the cave, from the earliest days of the City until at least 494 AD.\nModern discovery.\nIn January 2007, Italian archaeologist Irene Iacopi announced that she had probably found the legendary cave beneath the remains of Emperor Augustus's house, the \"Domus Livia\", on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 15-meter-deep cavity while working to restore the decaying palace.\nOn 20 November 2007, the first set of photos were released showing the vault of the grotto which is encrusted with colourful mosaics, pumice stones and seashells. The center of the ceiling features a depiction of a white eagle, the symbol of the Roman Empire. Archaeologists had not yet found the grotto's entrance, so they continued looking.\nIts location below Augustus' residence was thought to be significant; Octavian, before he became Augustus, had considered taking the name Romulus to indicate that he intended to found Rome anew.\nOpposing opinions.\nAdriano La Regina (formerly Rome's archaeological superintendent 1976\u20132004, professor of Etruscology at Sapienza University of Rome), Professor Fausto Zevi (professor of Roman Archaeology at Rome's La Sapienza University) and Professor Henner von Hesberg (head of the German Archaeological Institute, Rome) denied the identification of the grotto with Lupercal on topographic and stylistic grounds. They concluded that the grotto is actually a nymphaeum or underground triclinium from Neronian times. The current scholarly consensus is that the grotto is not the Lupercal and that the cave was located lower southwest, closer to piazza Sant'Anastasia al Palatino.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "18696", "revid": "42122274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18696", "title": "Limp Bizkit", "text": "American nu metal band\n Limp Bizkit is an American nu metal band from Jacksonville, Florida. Its lineup consists of lead vocalist Fred Durst, drummer John Otto, guitarist Wes Borland, and turntablist DJ Lethal. The band's musical style is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, sold 40 million records worldwide, and won several other awards.\nFormed in 1994 by Durst and Sam Rivers, the band was soon joined by Otto and later Borland. Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records (with distribution from Interscope), who released the band's debut album, \"Three Dollar Bill, Y'all\" (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with its second and third studio albums, \"Significant Other\" (1999) and \"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\" (2000). However, this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding its performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.\nBorland left the group in 2001; however, Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their fourth album \"Results May Vary\" (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded the EP \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\" (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal, and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band once again reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album \"Gold Cobra\" (2011), after which it left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records; DJ Lethal quit the band soon afterward, returning in 2018. After years of teasing an album tentatively titled \"Stampede of the Disco Elephants\", the band released its sixth studio album \"Still Sucks\" on October 31, 2021. Founding bassist Sam Rivers, who was also responsible for recruiting Otto into the band, died in October 2025.\nThe band has released 26 singles. Their most notable singles include \"Nookie\", \"Re-Arranged\", \"Break Stuff\", \"Take a Look Around\", \"Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)\", \"My Generation\", \"My Way\", \"Eat You Alive\", and their cover of The Who's 1971 single \"Behind Blue Eyes\"; all of these have charted within the top 20 of the US Alternative Airplay Chart.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1994\u20131996).\nWhile growing up in Gastonia, North Carolina, Fred Durst took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock, and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox, and DJ.\nWhile mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop. Durst played with three other bands: Split 26, Malachi Sage (both of which were unsuccessful), and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band. Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, \"You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'.\" Rivers suggested that John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become the band's drummer. Durst, Rivers, and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together and after brief stints with guitarists Rob Waters and Terry Balsamo, Wes Borland joined as their permanent guitarist.\nDurst named the band \"Limp Bizkit\" because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, \"The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music.\" Durst said that the band liked quirky and corny things and that they did not take themselves seriously all the time. Thus, the name \"Limp Bizkit\" represented these characteristics and the band as a whole. Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name. On an article for The Grand Rapids Press in November 1997, Wes stated \"just because they wanted us to do it, we were determined not to change the name. We gave them other options, like Funky Moses and the Red Sea Pedestrians, and 600 Pounds of Furious Pig\".\nLimp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band's local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest. Milkbar owner Danny Wimmer stated that Limp Bizkit \"had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.\" However, the band knew that to achieve national success, it would have to distinguish themselves in its live performances. Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael's \"Faith\" and Paula Abdul's \"Straight Up\" and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes. Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.\nDurst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&amp;R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager. Later when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs \"Pollution\", \"Counterfeit\", and \"Stalemate\". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience. The band attempted to expand its sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer and DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.\nRecord label deals and \"Three Dollar Bill, Y'all\" (1997\u20131998).\nAfter its performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit were offered a record deal with the Los Angeles-based independent label Flip Records, who attempted to sign the band for $50,000. Soon after that, however, they were also offered a record deal with the major label Mojo, a subsidiary of MCA Records. According to Flip Records' founder Jordan Schur, Limp Bizkit stated that the only way the band would not sign with Mojo was if the band's van flipped over on the way to Los Angeles.\nWhile heading to California to record its first album, the band's van flipped over five times, resulting in all of the band's members sustaining serious injuries. As a result of the near-death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band. The accident also strained the band's relationship with Mojo, who Durst felt wanted the band to resume working prematurely, resulting in Schur buying out the band's record and management contract and signing the band to Flip, which cost him $175,000.\nArvizu persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song \"Sour\". The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, \"Everything\". Schur bankrolled the recording sessions for the album, and following its completion negotiated a 50/50 agreement with Interscope Records to distribute the album.\nDespite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song \"Faith\", Robinson was opposed to recording it and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming as well as DJ scratching, impressed him. Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously. The progressive metal band Tool provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of Maynard James Keenan.\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, Limp Bizkit named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, titling it \"Three Dollar Bill, Y'all\". The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to its music.\nAfter the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; \"Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel\" music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating \"The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile.\" That same year, they also notably served as an opening act on the Album of the Year Tour for Faith No More, a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. They were subject to a hostile reception from Faith No More's fans, with the group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalling, \"That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude. He was kind of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene.\"\nInterscope proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that a Portland, Oregon, radio station play the song \"Counterfeit\" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope. The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as \"payola\". The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a \"brilliant marketing move\". Durst stated, \"It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing.\"\nFollowing the release of \"Counterfeit\" as a single, \"Three Dollar Bill, Yall\" was released on July 1, 1997, and was met with minimal response. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, \"They might not have many original ideas ... but they do the sound well. They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks, most of which make up for the uneven songwriting.\" However, Robert Christgau panned the album. Despite the minimal response to his band's album, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&amp;R at Interscope.\nLimp Bizkit joined the Warped Tour, performing alongside the bands Pennywise, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sick of It All, Lagwagon, and Blink-182. Preceding the band's first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions to collaborate with him better on stage. In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's largely male fanbase by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.\nIn 1998, Limp Bizkit toured with Soulfly and Cold on Soulfly's first European tour. Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit's success and the second single from \"Three Dollar Bill, Y'all\", a cover of George Michael's \"Faith\", became a successful radio hit, leading to a slot on Ozzfest, a tour organized by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. In July, Snot singer Lynn Strait was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit's prop toilet, and was charged with indecent exposure. Because Limp Bizkit's fans would often break through the barricades, the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days. In August, John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills, Michigan on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon after allegedly firing a BB gun and being arrested for carrying a switchblade.\nAfter completing Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit took a break from performing and later performed on Korn's Family Values Tour. Durst also directed a music video for the band's single \"Faith\" in promotion for its appearance in the film \"Very Bad Things\", but was unsatisfied with it and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones, and Korn, who appeared in the video. Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the song's writer, hated the cover and \"hates us for doing it\".\n\"Significant Other\" (1999\u20132000).\nFollowing the radio success of \"Faith\", the band was determined to record the follow-up to its first album in order to show that they were not a Korn soundalike or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from its newfound fame. Terry Date, who had produced albums for Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen to produce the album. The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with Method Man. The song was originally titled \"Shut the Fuck Up\", but was retitled \"N 2 Gether Now\" for marketing purposes. Durst also recorded with Eminem, but the collaboration, \"Turn Me Loose\", was left off the album. The album also featured guest appearances by Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Staind singer Aaron Lewis, and interludes by Les Claypool and Matt Pinfield.\n\"Significant Other\" saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines including \"Spin\" and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs; the band was allowed to interact directly with its fans on a website established by Dike 99. Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. \"Significant Other\" was seen as an improvement over its debut and was generally well received by critics with mixed-to-positive reviews. However, the band also continued to be criticized by the media; an article profiling the band in \"Spin\" and discussing \"Significant Other\" claimed that \"Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song\", and musicians Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor criticized the band.\nThe band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago as radio stations received a strong number of requests for the album's first single, \"Nookie\". \"Significant Other\" climbed to No.\u00a01 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release. In its second week of release the album sold an additional 335,000 copies.\nOn the opening night of the band's Limptropolis tour with Kid Rock, Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue's poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set. On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota and was later arrested on assault charges. Further criticisms of the band appeared in \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The New York Times\". \"New York Times\" writer Ann Powers wrote, \"DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop's break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer\".\nIn the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock '99 show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after the band's performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song \"Break Stuff\". Several sexual assaults were also reported in the concert's aftermath . Durst stated during the concert, \"People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy\". Durst later stated in an interview, \"I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?\" Les Claypool told \"The San Francisco Examiner\", \"Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is 'no press is bad press', so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he's a great guy.\" Jonathan Davis of Korn also defended the band: \"I think Bizkit is being blamed for it because they were the heavy band \u2026 I don't think it was their fuckin' fault\". \"It's easy to point the finger and blame [us], but they hired us for what we do \u2014 and all we did is what we do. I would turn the finger and point it back to the people that hired us,\" said Durst in reference to original Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang.\nDurst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event's controversy, and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single \"Re-Arranged\", which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowned in milk while performing the song. Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock '99 were at fault for booking his band due to their reputation for raucous performances.\nDespite this controversy, \"Significant Other\" remained at No.\u00a01 on the \"Billboard\" charts; the band also headlined the year's Family Values Tour. Durst directed a music video for \"N 2 Gether Now\" which featured Method Man and Pauly Shore, and was inspired by Inspector Clouseau's fights with his butler Cato Fong in the \"Pink Panther\" film series.\n\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\" (2000\u20132001).\nIn 2000, Durst announced that the band's third studio album would be titled \"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\". The press thought he was joking about this title. The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase \"Chocolate Starfish\" refers to the human anus and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an \"asshole\". Borland contributed the other half of the album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop did not have hot dog or meat-flavored water.\nIn June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the WXRK Dysfunctional Family Picnic, but showed up an hour late for their set. An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band's set time. During the band's performance, Durst criticized Creed singer Scott Stapp, calling him \"an egomaniac\". Creed's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual.\nIn the summer, Limp Bizkit's tour was sponsored by the controversial file sharing service Napster, doing free shows with a metal cage as the only thing separating them from the audience. Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing. They also did a \"Guerrilla Tour\", which involved the band setting up illegal and impromptu public gigs on rooftops and alleyways, some being shut down by the police.\nDuring the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Durst performed \"Livin' It Up\", a song from the upcoming album, as a duet with Christina Aguilera. In response to the performance, Filter frontman Richard Patrick was quoted as saying \"Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all.\" In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, \"People always just wanna talk about Britney or Christina. What's the problem? Because they make a type of music we aren't allowed to like? Or you think they are the nemesis of what our music is about? Why segregate? Why be so musically fuckin' racist? What do you mean, I can't hang out with these types of people? Clearly I didn't give a fuck, which fed a lot of it, too. I mean, someone that's not going to give in and apologise... it's gonna make people carry on talking\".\nDurst also appeared in the music video for Eminem's song \"The Real Slim Shady\", a song in which Eminem suggests that Christina Aguilera and Durst had a sexual relationship. Durst denied the rumors and defended Aguilera, saying: \"For one thing, it's not true, so it doesn't bother me. [Eminem is] sort of answering the critics. He's going to the extreme with everything he can to now slap them in the face... It's so over-the-top. For one thing, Christina's amazing. I really like that girl. I think she's an amazing singer. She's gonna have longevity. She's going to be one of those amazing icon women. I'm really attracted to her, I like her, and I've talked to her a couple of times, and that's that. I haven't had any type of relationship with her, or any type of intercourse with her. She's never sucked my dick, she's never sucked Carson's.\"\nReleased on October 17, \"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\" set a record for highest first-week sales for a rock album, with over one million copies sold in the US in its first week of release. 400,000 of those sales happened during the first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever and breaking the record held for seven years by Pearl Jam's \"Vs.\" \"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\" was certified Gold, Platinum, and six times Multi-Platinum.\nThe album received mixed reviews, with AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing, \"Durst's self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly \u2013 it's the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" writer David Browne named it as the worst album title of 2000, whilst readers of \"Kerrang!\" magazine voted it the worst album of the year, as well as voting Limp Bizkit and Fred Durst as the worst band of 2000 and the \"Arse of the Year\", respectively.\nDuring a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney, fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit and teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation. In court, Durst, represented by long-time attorney Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert's organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce, and Amar Tailor, as well as the concert's promoter Vivian Lees, of the potential dangers of such minimal security. After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, the coroner said it was evident that the crowd's density was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage, stating that Fred Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent. Durst stated that he was \"emotionally scarred\" because of the teenager's death. Durst also stated that he was aware of the security problems, but that he and the band were forced to play in the festival: \"There was a demand for us to play Big Day Out 2001, so we filled it. When we came to play we said, \"The barricades aren't right \u2013 people are gonna go crazy so we're not playing.\" And they go, \"No, you're goddamn wrong. You are playing \u2013 you're the headliners.\" And we go, \"No, you gotta have the right barricade.\" The promoters who owned Big Day Out at the time were rude. The police came and it turned into this huge thing, with them telling us, \"There's gonna be a riot if you don't play and if that happens, we're arresting you\".\nLater in 2001, numerous hip-hop artists including P. Diddy, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx, and Everlast remixed famous songs from the band into hip-hop versions, adding their own styles and modifications. The album was called \"New Old Songs\".\nDeparture of Borland and \"Results May Vary\" (2001\u20132003).\nIn October 2001, Durst released a statement on their website stating that \"Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors.\" Durst also stated that the band would \"comb the world for the illest guitar player known to man\" to replace Borland. When asked why Borland quit the band, Ross Robinson stated that he quit because \"He doesn't sell out for money anymore\".\nDurst held a nationwide audition for a new guitarist called \"Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is.\" However, Mike Henderson, who was one of the guitarists who went for the audition, revealed that the event was nothing more than a publicity stunt. Durst had no intention to recruit a new guitarist and the whole thing was intended to sell Guitar Center products. This caused an uproar amongst the guitarists who had been waiting for hours. The band eventually recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith, though they later scrapped the initial recording sessions with Smith. In May 2002, Durst posted Wes Borland's personal email address online and told fans to ask him to rejoin the group. Borland stated that 75% or more of all the emails pleaded for him not to return to the band.\nDuring the album's production, the working title changed from \"Bipolar\" to \"Panty Sniffer\", and was completed under the title \"Results May Vary\". Under Durst's sole leadership, the album encompassed a variety of styles and featured a cover of the Who's \"Behind Blue Eyes\", which differed from the original's arrangement in its inclusion of a Speak &amp; Spell during the song's bridge. \"Results May Vary\" consisted of various recording sessions, some of which included Smith on guitars and some without; however, Smith continued to play live shows with the band.\nLimp Bizkit performed at WWE WrestleMania XIX, with both Smith and Korn's Brian Welch on guitars. In the summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour headlined by Metallica. At the tour's Chicago stop, concert attendees threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting \"Fuck Fred Durst\" and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He repeatedly said, \"Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!\" until a roadie took his microphone away. An article in the \"Sun-Times\" stated that the hostility was started by radio personality Mancow.\n\"Results May Vary\" was released on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, \"the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [and] all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?\" \"The Guardian\" reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, \"At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto ... But Durst's problems are ever-present \u2013 and does anybody still care?\" Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.\u00a03 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Smith departed from the band in August 2004. Durst later told a fan site that he had a falling-out with Smith, saying \"We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally.\"\nBorland's return, \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\" and hiatus (2004\u20132008).\nIn August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit, which began recording their first EP, \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\".\nIn May, \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\" was released. Sammy Siegler took over drumming duties for the band for much of the EP, which featured a more experimental sound, described by AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \"neo-prog alt-metal\". At Durst's insistence, the EP was released as an underground release without any advertising or promotion. Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was \"self-sabotage\": \"Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn't really want to put it out there.\"\nThe EP received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the music, calling it \"a step in the right direction \u2013 it's more ambitious, dramatic, and aggressive, built on pummeling verses and stop-start choruses.\" However, he felt that the band was being \"held back\" by Durst, whom he called \"the most singularly unpleasant, absurd frontman in rock.\" IGN writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review, as he felt that the EP lacked direction, but that showed potential for the band's musical growth.\n\"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\" sold over 37,000 copies in its first week of release, and debuted at No.\u00a024 on the \"Billboard\" 200, but due to its lack of advertising sales fell off quickly and only sold 88,000 copies in the United States by March 2006. Following the release of the band's \"Greatest Hitz\" album, the band went on hiatus. Borland stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to \"The Unquestionable Truth\" would be produced and that \"As of right now, none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit.\"\nReunion, \"Gold Cobra\" and departure from Interscope (2009\u20132011).\nIn 2009, Limp Bizkit reunited with Borland playing guitar and launched the Unicorns N' Rainbows Tour. Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album, which Borland titled \"Gold Cobra\". Borland said that the title does not have any meaning, and that it was chosen because it fit the style of music the band was writing for the album. The band recorded a spoken intro written by Durst and performed by Kiss member Gene Simmons for the album, but it was left off the completed album. The band also recorded additional \"non-album\" tracks, including \"Combat Jazz\", which featured rapper Raekwon and \"Middle Finger\", featuring Paul Wall.\n\"Shotgun\" was released as a single on May 17, 2011. The song is noted for featuring a guitar solo by Borland, something that the band is not known for. \"Shotgun\" received favorable reviews, with Artistdirect writing, \"['Shotgun'] feels like Bizkit approached the signature style on \"Three Dollar Bill Y'All\" and \"Significant Other\" with another decade-plus of instrumental experience and virtuosity, carving out a banger that could get asses moving in the club or fists flying in the mosh pit.\"\n\"Gold Cobra\" was released on June 28 and received mixed to positive reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it \"a return to the full-throttled attack of \"Three Dollar Bill Y'All\". IGN writer Chad Grischow wrote, \"Though far from their best work, Limp Bizkit's latest at least proves that their 2005 \"Greatest Hitz\" album may have been premature.\" \"Metal Hammer\" writer Terry Bezer appraised the album, writing \"Aside from the odd duff moment, Gold Cobra throws out the hot shit that'll make you bounce in the mosh pit over and over again.\" The band launched the Gold Cobra Tour in support of the album. A music video for the title track was released. \"Gold Cobra\" sold nearly 80,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No.\u00a016 on the \"Billboard\" 200; however, the band left Interscope after the album's release.\n\"Stampede of the Disco Elephants\" and \"Still Sucks\" (2012\u20132022).\nIn February 2012, the band returned to Australia for the first time in 11 years to perform at the Soundwave festival. Durst dedicated the shows to Jessica Michalik, who died during the Limp Bizkit performance at Big Day Out 2001. Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records. Following a dispute between Durst, Lethal, and Otto about the latter two's alleged chronic drug and alcohol use, DJ Lethal angrily left the band. DJ Lethal later posted an apology to the band on Twitter, but was ultimately not allowed back into the band.\nFred Durst was featured in the song \"Champions\" by Kevin Rudolf, which was used as a theme for WWE's Night of Champions. The song debuted on \"WWE Raw\" on September 3, 2012. This was the first time Limp Bizkit has worked with WWE since 2003.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe's been in and out and in and out. I know what he wants to do but don't know what he would do if he came back into the band. He's kind of all over the place, and I don't know if he wants to be in the band. When we had him back, nothing materialized as far as material coming out of him to add to the record. We're talking to him. We've opened up dialogue back with him recently, and we'll see what happens.\n \u2014Wes Borland on the band's relationship with DJ Lethal\nThe band recorded their seventh studio album, \"Stampede of the Disco Elephants\" with producer Ross Robinson, who also produced the band's debut album \"Three Dollar Bill, Yall\" and the 2005 EP \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\".\nOn March 24, 2013, the first single from the album, \"Ready to Go\" (featuring Lil Wayne) was released on limpbizkit.com. In November a cover of the Ministry song \"Thieves\" was released by the band via their official Facebook and Twitter accounts. In December, the band released the previously leaked song \"Lightz\" along with an accompanying music video. The next single off the album, \"Endless Slaughter\", was set to be released only on cassette and during concerts, but can be downloaded at the band's official website.\nIn October 2014, Fred Durst revealed that the band had left Cash Money and became independent again. The split was carried out amicably and Fred says that \"We really love the jam we did with Lil Wayne, though. We love that song.\"\nLimp Bizkit performed as headliners of the ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., and Sevendust among others. The band announced their major 2015 tour called \"Money Sucks\", a Russian 20-date tour to take place during October and November celebrating Limp Bizkit's 20th anniversary. The tour name was a nod to the difficult economic situation that Russia was facing at the time. The tour gathered criticism on the background of the Russo-Ukrainian War and Durst's behavior, who was shown in a picture that had surfaced during the tour, holding a flag saying \"Crimea = Russia\" in reference to the illegal annexation by Russia.\nBefore the band traveled to Europe to attend the \"Money Sucks\" Tour, Sam Rivers was diagnosed with a degenerative disease of the spinal discs that was complicated due to a pinched nerve, causing a lot of pain in such areas and which prevented him from being with the band. 23-year-old German bassist Samuel Gerhard Mpungu replaced Rivers for the tour.\nLimp Bizkit offered several concerts in the United Kingdom during winter 2016 alongside Korn. Regarding this tour, Fred says: \"You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favorite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And ... make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It's time to bring it back!\"\nBecause of little information and constant delays for the release of \"Stampede\", in an interview/talk with the podcast \"Someone Who Isn't Me\", Wes said that Fred \"isn't happy\" with what he was working on. The guitarist said that Durst will \"just keep working on something until he's happy with it, even if it takes years and years\". \nDJ Lethal resumed performing with the band on March 17, 2018, at the Storm the Gates festival in Auckland, New Zealand. On July 8, 2019, the band played a new song from their forthcoming album called \"Wasteoid\" live in Paris.\nBorland provided an album update in June 2021, detailing the struggles with the album: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We've probably, in the last 10 years, been in the studio to try and complete the record, I wanna say, seven times, to different studios. And we've been working on stuff, working on stuff, working on stuff. And Fred [Durst] has been consistently kind of unsatisfied with where vision is, I guess...We probably have 35 songs recorded instrumentally, and he's done vocals on them and then thrown the vocals away \u2014 done vocals and then [gone], 'Fuck this,' [and] thrown it away. So I think he's finally at the point now where he's gonna pick a set of these songs that he's finally cool with and finish 'em and we're gonna finish the record. So, fingers crossed.\"\nIn August 2021, just a week after their main stage set at Lollapalooza, the band canceled their summer tour, \"out of an abundance of caution and concern for the safety of the band, crew and most of all the fans\" in relation to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States.\nOn August 25, 2021, the band revealed new music would be \"leaked\" in rapid succession with their new album to follow soon after.\nOn September 30, 2021, the band released a new single \"Dad Vibes\". On October 19, Durst teased on Instagram that more songs would be coming soon, revealing the titles \"Turn It Up Bitch\" and \"Goodbye\", as well as the album containing 12 tracks. On October 28, 2021, Durst confirmed via Instagram that the band's sixth album \u2013 now titled \"Still Sucks\" \u2013 would be released on October 31, 2021.\nUpcoming seventh studio album and Sam Rivers' death (2023\u2013present).\nBorland revealed in early 2023 that plans for Limp Bizkit's seventh studio album were underway for 2024. In late October 2024, Durst confirmed that he was \"in the studio with John Otto\" recording drum tracks for the album. The band's first song in four years was initially teased in a staged partial leak on Instagram, and released on September 12, 2025, entitled \"Making Love to Morgan Wallen\", as part of the soundtrack for the video game \"Battlefield 6\". They also contributed the song \"Battlefield: The After-party\" (a reimagining of the traditional \"Battlefield\" theme) to the soundtrack, and their 2000 single \"Break Stuff\" to the game's trailer.\nBassist Sam Rivers, who last performed with Limp Bizkit at the August 2025 Leeds Festival in the United Kingdom, died on October 18, 2025 at the age of 48.\nOn November 29, 2025, Limp Bizkit performed their first concert in Mexico City without their original bassist, with Richie Buxton, formerly part of Ecca Vandal's touring band, taking place of Rivers.\nArtistry.\nMusic.\nDurst wanted Limp Bizkit to be a \"megaband\" which could cross over into as many different styles of music as possible. Limp Bizkit's music has predominately been described as nu metal, rap metal and rap rock. Limp Bizkit have also been described as alternative metal, alternative rock, post-grunge and hard rock. In 2000, the \"New York Daily News\" labelled the band as \"frat-metal\".\nLimp Bizkit's music is noted for its \"kinetic, frenzied energy\". Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music to bebop and funk. DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, \"I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. ... It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player.\" Borland's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven-string guitars. \"Three Dollar Bill, Yall\" features him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. The song \"Stuck\" uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.\nAllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the band's album \"Significant Other\" contains \"flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers\" and \"swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background\". The band did not employ solos until \"Gold Cobra\" (except for the song \"Underneath the Gun\" from \"Results May Vary\"), however, during the recording of \"Significant Other\", drummer John Otto performed an extended solo in the middle of the song \"Nobody Like You\". A drum solo can also be heard on \"9 Teen 90 Nine\" from the same album.\nLyrics.\nDurst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. The song \"Sour\", from the album \"Three Dollar Bill, Yall\", was inspired by Durst's problems with his girlfriend. His breakup with her inspired the \"Significant Other\" songs \"Nookie\" and \"Re-Arranged\". When describing Limp Bizkit's lyrics, \"The Michigan Daily\" said \"In a less-serious vein, Limp Bizkit used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs.\" Durst said that people failed to understand the band's proposal, \"There was always a lot of pain in my life. Mental and physical abuse happens regularly in my life. I've been bullied my whole life, but I also love having fun and getting crazy and being silly and outrageous. We always had that in our band and a lot of people didn't understand that.\" Durst also said that the band's purpose was to serve as a satire but \"We just didn't make it that obvious.\" The band's guitarist, Wes Borland, said that \"Limp Bizkit is definitely a dumb rock band.\" Limp Bizkit's lyrics have also been described as \"misogynistic\". In response to these accusations, Durst said: \"That's because I said the words whore and bitch. My whole record is about my girlfriend who put me through the ringer [\"sic\"] for three years and my insecurity about it. It became this big thing.\" \"The Baltimore Sun\" talked about the band's song \"Nookie\", which is accused of being sexist and misogynistic, \"Despite its seemingly salacious title, 'Nookie' is not about the joy of sex; instead, it finds singer Fred Durst talking about how he let his girlfriend take advantage of him because he was a fool for love. So when he gets to the chorus catch-phrase - 'I did it all for the nookie' - what we hear is more self-recrimination than boast.\" \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\" focuses on more serious and darker lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame.\nLive performances.\nGuitarist Wes Borland is known for his use of costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a \"burnt match\". Describing the character, he stated, \"I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black\u2014from the neck up\u2014and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth.\" Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series \"Babylon 5\".\nIn addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film \"Apocalypse Now\", with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan \"Primus sucks\": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, \"they finger us back\u2014and you know what that means to us\u2014that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'\"\nDuring the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by \"flushing\" cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls. During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour, Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the \"Los Angeles Times\" described as \"a mix of \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"Mars Attacks\"\". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances. During the band's Halloween performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career.\nInfluences.\nLimp Bizkit cites their inspirations and influences as such acts as Metallica, Faith No More, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, the Jesus Lizard, Tomahawk, Dave Matthews Band, Portishead, Mr. Bungle, Sepultura, Ministry, Prong, Tool, Primus, Pantera, Anthrax, Testament, Suicidal Tendencies, Minor Threat, the Angry Samoans, Black Flag, N.W.A, the Fat Boys, the Treacherous Three, the Cold Crush Brothers, Urban Dance Squad, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Deftones, Jane's Addiction, the Circle Jerks, and John Zorn.\nCriticism.\nDespite receiving praise for their artistry and musical contributions, the band has received a share of negative criticism from fellow musicians. As pointed out by author Joel McIver, Limp Bizkit's mix of rap and metal was notably preceded by the bands Rage Against the Machine and Faith No More, but its lyrics widely differed from the radical politics of the former and the existential poetry of the latter. Durst cited both bands as two of his biggest influences. Faith No More's semi-ironic cover of \"Easy\" by the Commodores in 1992 hinted what would be the recording of George Michael's \"Faith\" by Limp Bizkit in 1997. The frontmen of both groups have distanced themselves from Limp Bizkit; Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine stated that Limp Bizkit \"sucks\", while Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton paraphrased the quote attributed to G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, \"Er kann mich am Arsch lecken\" \u2013 \"He can lick my ass\", when asked by a German reporter about Durst's interest in releasing his music through Interscope Records. During the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford climbed part of the set in protest of Limp Bizkit winning the award for Best Rock Video, later expressing his dislike of the band during a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, claiming \"I apologize for inspiring such shit\".\nFeuds.\nSlipknot.\nKorn and Limp Bizkit shared a long-standing friendship after bassist Reginald Arvizu assisted the latter in acquiring a record deal in 1996. The bands continued to strengthen their relationship as they often toured together frequently throughout the late 1990s. Slipknot at the time was an up-and-coming band and would have its self-titled debut produced by Ross Robinson (a producer who worked with all three bands). While on tour promoting their upcoming album during the 1999 Ozzfest tour, lead singer Corey Taylor took notice of Korn drummer David Silveria's modeling campaign for Calvin Klein in several magazines while the band was at a truck stop in Texas. Disgusted with Silveria's business decisions to expand into modeling, Taylor purchased numerous copies of the magazine issue and publicly burned copies onstage during Slipknot's live performances. According to Taylor, Durst and DJ Lethal were enraged by this and attacked Slipknot in various interviews in the spring of 1999. Taylor admits that he and multiple Slipknot members were impressed with Limp Bizkit's 1997 debut record, even citing it as an influence on their debut album, but he later claimed they lost respect for the band following the release of \"Significant Other\" in 1999, accusing the band of selling out. Durst would make further retaliatory comments towards Slipknot's fans in December 1999, referring to them as \"fat, ugly kids\". Slipknot singer Corey Taylor responded during a February 2000 fan interview in Sydney, Australia by claiming that the fans of Slipknot \"for the most part, enjoy all kinds of music, like Limp Bizkit\u2026 maybe.\" Taylor went on to claim that insulting fans of Slipknot could also be insulting fans of Limp Bizkit. During an interview with VH1 in October 2000, Durst praised Slipknot's music, expressing his desire to quell the tension between both sides. When asked about Slipknot's music Durst told reporters: \"Man this band is super phat, man; we don't even know them. That's their whole thing, that's their chant, that's their thing, that's cool. Maybe all this hate that's going around the world, that's why I said 'It's all the world has even seen lately'\". Despite this, Taylor retorted with praise for Durst's financial ventures but attacked his artistic motives, claiming \"Fred Durst is a great businessman, but he is not an artist\". Despite the attacks between the two bands, they shared numerous UK festival dates together through 2000, including the 2000 Reading and Leeds Festivals.\nTaylor later claimed that feud began to subside during the late 2000s after the two bands shared a friendly encounter during the 2009 Download Festival in which Durst approached him, informing Taylor that his children were fans of Slipknot's music. Durst asked Taylor if he would sign several autographs for his son, to which Taylor kindly obliged. The two would continue to find themselves on friendlier terms in 2010. While Limp Bizkit was recording \"Gold Cobra\", Durst included a line on the song 90.2.10 giving a shoutout to Taylor. Limp Bizkit was later booked on the 2014 Japanese leg of Slipknot's Knotfest tour along with Korn.\nIn August 2021, Limp Bizkit gave a public tribute to Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison who had recently died on July 26. Durst and the band paid tribute to him during their concert in Des Moines, Iowa (Slipknot's hometown). Durst asked the audience: \"Slipknot's from somewhere around here, aren't they?\" before expressing support for Jordison and the rest of the band, later telling the crowd \"Rest in peace, let's hear it! That's beautiful. Life is short and it's always fleeting so, man, let's just remember all we are is right now\" while riling the crowd to chant Jordison's name. On May 19, 2024, Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson made a live appearance during Limp Bizkit's performance at that year's Sonic Temple festival in Columbus, Ohio.\nMarilyn Manson and Trent Reznor.\nMarilyn Manson was known to be overly vocal against Limp Bizkit's music; in 1999, he attacked the band's artistry and their fans, referring to them as \"illiterate apes that beat your ass in high school for being a 'fag' and now sell you tuneless testosterone anthems of misogyny and pretend to be outsiders...\". Manson, along with Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, once again took aim at Durst and the band in Nine Inch Nails' video for the song \"Starfuckers, Inc.\", in which the two take aim at multiple artists, ranging from The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., and (most blatantly) Durst and Limp Bizkit. In a 2000 interview, Manson later explained: \"With this video, we didn't wanna seem bitching like about somehow that Limp Bizkit's doing better than we are, in their mind.\" Reznor later added to the comment, stating; \"I don't have to say Limp Bizkit sucks, you know it, I know it, I shouldn't have to say it\". Durst responded to Manson and Reznor's insults: \"I understand that Marilyn Manson is very unhappy that his career has gone in a shambles and he's alienated his fans, so if he has to say things like that because he's very mad at himself, I would forgive him. And Trent Reznor's in the fucking same boat. Trent Reznor is obviously unhappy with how he's alienated the world, how long he took to make a record, and how he thought he was immortal. We're just here doing what we do and we have nothing to say about anybody. I wish them both luck and I feel sorry that they're so jealous and mad at themselves that they have to talk shit.\" Durst's relationship with Manson had seemingly grown cordial as the two later appeared on the cover of a \"Rolling Stone\" magazine issue in June 2003 alongside James Hetfield and Ozzy Osbourne. Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland later joined Manson's touring band in 2008. Borland later departed Manson's touring band after less than nine months, citing an inability to songwrite and criticizing Manson's overbearing leadership. In 2021, Manson would become the subject of further controversy surrounding numerous sexual abuse allegations against him. Borland proceeded to attack Manson in numerous interviews, denouncing him as a \"bad fucking dude\". Trent Reznor, in an apparent change-of-heart, supported Borland's claims against Manson's misconduct, while also attacking him for the abuse allegations, during an interview with \"Ultimate Guitar\".\nPlacebo.\nLimp Bizkit and Placebo began a long-standing feud, stemming from a show Durst was hosting at Irving Plaza in December 1998. Durst claimed he was prepared to introduce Placebo to the audience before singer Brian Molko insulted him, unaware of who he was. Durst later explained: \"I was on the side of the stage, and the singer comes and pushes me and says, 'Get the fuck out of here!' And I'm like, 'I'm just here because I was asked to introduce you.' And he's like, 'I don't give a fuck who you are, get off my stage' or whatever the fuck he was saying. So I guess he didn't know I was from Limp Bizkit, and I was introducing him.\" Molko's behavior prompted Durst to rile up the crowd to chant \"Placebo sucks!\" prior to their performance. Molko later expressed that he was completely unaware that Durst was hosting the show. On June 11, 1999, Durst was introducing the band Staind, prior to their performance as part of K-Rock's \"Dysfunctional Family Picnic\" in Holmdel, New Jersey, when he once again instigated the audience to chant \"Fuck Placebo\". The feud was reignited during \"Big Day Out\" 2001, in which Placebo were billed below Limp Bizkit, with the band's bassist, Stefan Olsdal, claiming Placebo was fearful of the audience as they hostily waited for Limp Bizkit's performance during their set. By 2004, the feud had reportedly ended.\nLegacy and influence.\nLimp Bizkit is considered one of the defining bands of the nu metal genre. \"Alternative Press\" said: \"As the years have gone by, some n\u00fc-metal outfits have progressively downplayed their bracket's hip-hop sensibilities. Even so, you can guarantee one of their primary influences were Limp Bizkit... the happily mismatched band from Jacksonville, Florida, established the ground rules of n\u00fc metal.. blur(ring) the lines between the two most polarizing genres in music... Limp Bizkit created timeless odes to teenage angst that, in time, we've discovered still apply right into adulthood.\"\n\"Kerrang!\" magazine talked about the impact of the band's song \"Break Stuff\": \"If Deftones represented something deeper about nu-metal, Limp Bizkit represented something entirely at the other end of the scale. Despite having a genuinely innovative guitarist in Wes Borland, whose vision for his genre-straddling band was probably more in line with bands like Primus, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle... Break Stuff, ahem, broke Limp Bizkit through its fiendishly simple two-chord motif, kick-up-the-arse drop, and its glued-to-MTV video featuring Jonathan Davis, Flea, as well as rap megastars Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Dr. Dre, taking them to an audience far beyond metal. The celebrity that followed was huge. The influence it left was huger.\"\nAlthough Limp Bizkit inspired nu metal bands like Linkin Park in the 2000s, new bands in the genre continue to use Bizkit's sound as an influence, such as acclaimed nu metal revival band Wargasm, whose members grew up listening to Limp Bizkit and have said that they \"wouldn't be the band we are today without them\". Other bands that have cited Limp Bizkit as influence include Emmure, Hacktivist, Lionheart, Islander, Vision Eternel, and Zeal &amp; Ardor.\nRichard Cheese performed a lounge rendition of the songs \"Nookie\" and \"Break Stuff\" on his debut album, \"Lounge Against the Machine\". The Vitamin String Quartet recorded a tribute album called \"The String Quartet Tribute to Limp Bizkit: Break Stuff\", which contains reinterpretations of the band's songs performed by a violinist backed by cellos, synthesizers, and keyboard percussion. The Blackout covered \"My Generation\" for the compilation \"Higher Voltage!: Another Brief History of Rock\".\nLimp Bizkit also had a major impact on the professional wrestling world. They famously provided the track \"My Way\" for the music video for the WrestleMania 17 clash between Steve Austin and The Rock. Fred Durst is also featured in the SmackDown! Just Bring It video game. They performed their buzz single \"Crack Addict\" and also during WWE Legend, The Undertaker's entrance at Wrestlemania 19. They are the favorite band of several wrestlers including former WWE Diva's Champion and fellow Jacksonville native Kelly Kelly and former AEW athlete Sonny Kiss.\nThe band was negatively perceived in the early 21st century. In 2003, \"Guitar World\" readers voted Limp Bizkit the \"worst band of the year\". A 2013 \"Rolling Stone\" readers' poll voted Limp Bizkit as the third-worst band of the 1990s, behind Creed and Nickelback. The band was insulted by fellow musicians including Deftones' Chino Moreno and Slayer's Kerry King, with King admitting that Limp Bizkit's popularity made him consider quitting music. \"Slate\" noted how \"liking Limp Bizkit can seem like an ethical failure: Durst's lyrics frequently affirm a noxious value system in which a seething hatred of The Man coexists with a seething hatred of women.\" \"The Independent\" stated that \"Limp Bizkit was often... used as a similar shorthand for the misery bad rock music has apparently wrought upon the world.\" Following the band's set at Lollapalooza 2021, which was broadcast on Hulu, and the release of the song \"Dad Vibes\", the band began having a shift in public opinion, garnering positive responses from critics and audiences. The band's comeback album \"Still Sucks\" helped with the shifting opinion, with the album receiving mostly positive reviews.\nLimp Bizkit was mentioned in a scene between Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik and Idris Elba's Knuckles in the film \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\" (2022), where Robotnik compares Knuckles to being as useless as a \"Limp Bizkit backstage pass\".\nLimp Bizkit appears in \"Generation Kill\" (2004), originally conceived by journalist Evan Wright as a three-part \"Rolling Stone\" magazine series, before being released as a full-length book and becoming a 2008 HBO mini-series under the same name. \"Generation Kill\" chronicles Wright's experience as a reporter traveling with a platoon of U.S. Recon Marines during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While driving along a winding canal en route to Baghdad, a Ripped, Fuel-ed Corporal from Missouri named Josh Ray Person (played by actor James Ransone) memorably \"recounts the band he formed after high school, Me or Society. A heavy-metal rap group, his band once opened for Limp Bizkit at a show in Kansas City. 'We sucked, but so did they,' Person says. 'The only difference is, they became famous right after we played together. I became a Marine.\nBand members.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccolades.\nLimp Bizkit has been nominated for and won several awards. Limp Bizkit has been nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Hard Rock Performance (\"Nookie\"), Best Rock Album (\"Significant Other\") and Best Hard Rock Performance (\"Take A Look Around\"). Limp Bizkit has been nominated for 3 American Music Awards for Favorite Alternative Artist, winning one of them in 2002.\nIn 1999, the band won the Maximum Vision Award at the Billboard Music Video Awards for their music video \"Nookie\" At the 2000 and 2001 Blockbuster Awards, the band won the Favorite Group (Rock) award. That year also saw the band winning a MuchMusic Award for Best International Video, honoring their video for the song \"Break Stuff\". At the 2001 Echo Awards, the band won the Best International Metal Band award. At the 2009 Kerrang! Awards, the band won the Hall of Fame award. Further expanding upon the group's achievements and popularity, they were also the first group inducted into MTV's \"Total Request Live\" \"Hall of Fame\" on May 26, 2001.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The capital of Lazio is Rome, which is the capital city of Italy.\nLazio was the home of the Etruscan civilization, then stood at the center of the Roman Republic, of the Roman Empire, of the Papal States, of the Kingdom of Italy and of the Italian Republic. Lazio boasts a rich cultural heritage. Great artists and historical figures lived and worked in Rome, particularly during the Italian Renaissance period.\nIn remote antiquity, Lazio (\"Latium\") included only a limited part of the current region, between the lower course of the Tiber, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Monti Sabini and the Pontine Marshes.\nAfter the end of World War II and the fall of the Fascist regime Lazio and Italy saw rapid economic growth, in particular in Rome. Today, Lazio is a large center of services and international trade, industry, public services, and tourism, supported by an extensive network of transport infrastructures thanks to its geographical position in the center of Italian Peninsula and the presence of Rome within it.\nGeography.\nLazio comprises a land area of and it has borders with Tuscany, Umbria, and Marche to the north, Abruzzo and Molise to the east, Campania to the south, and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west. The region is mainly hilly (56%) and mountainous (26%), with some plains (20%) along the coast and the Tiber valley.\nThe coast of Lazio is mainly composed of sandy beaches, punctuated by the headlands of Cape Circeo (541 m) and Gaeta (171 m). The Pontine Islands, which are part of Lazio, are off Lazio's southern coast. Behind the coastal strip, to the north, lies the Maremma Laziale (the continuation of the Tuscan Maremma), a coastal plain interrupted at Civitavecchia by the Tolfa Mountains (616 m). The central section of the region is occupied by the Roman Campagna, a vast alluvial plain surrounding the city of Rome, with an area of approximately . The southern districts are characterized by the flatlands of Agro Pontino, a once swampy and malarial area, that was reclaimed over the centuries.\nThe Preapennines of Latium, marked by the Tiber Valley and the Liri with the Sacco tributary, include on the right of the Tiber, three groups of mountains of volcanic origin: the Volsini, Cimini and Sabatini, whose largest former craters are occupied by the Bolsena, Vico and Bracciano lakes. To the south of the Tiber, other mountain groups form part of the Preapennines: the Alban Hills, also of volcanic origin, and the calcareous Lepini, Ausoni and Aurunci Mountains. The Apennines of Latium are a continuation of the Apennines of Abruzzo: the Reatini Mountains with Terminillo (2,213 m), Mounts Sabini, Prenestini, Simbruini and Ernici which continue east of the Liri into the Mainarde Mountains. The highest peak is Mount Gorzano (2,458 m) on the border with Abruzzo.\nClimate.\nThe region's climate has considerable variability from area to area. In general, along the coast, there is a Mediterranean climate, the temperature values vary between in January and in July.\nTowards the interior, the climate is more continental and, on the hills, winters are cold and at night, temperatures can be quite frigid.\nAmong the regional capital cities in Italy, Rome is the one with the highest number of hours of sunshine and days with clear skies during the year.\nHistory.\nThe Italian word Lazio descends from the Latin word Latium, the region of the Latins, \"Latini\" in the Latin language spoken by them and passed on to the Latin city-state of Ancient Rome. Although the demography of ancient Rome was multi-ethnic, including, for example, Etruscans, Sabines and other Italics besides the Latini, the latter were the dominant constituent. In Roman mythology, the tribe of the Latini took their name from King Latinus. Apart from the mythical derivation of Lazio given by the ancients as the place where Saturn, ruler of the golden age in Latium, hid (latuisset) from Jupiter there, a major modern etymology is that Lazio comes from the Latin word \"latus\", meaning \"wide\", expressing the idea of \"flat land\" meaning the Roman Campagna. Much of Lazio is in fact flat or rolling. The lands originally inhabited by the Latini were extended into the territories of the Samnites, the Marsi, the Hernici, the Aequi, the Aurunci and the Volsci, all surrounding Italic tribes. This larger territory was still called Latium, but it was divided into Latium adiectum or Latium Novum, the added lands or New Latium, and Latium Vetus, or Old Latium, the older, smaller region. The northern border of Lazio was the Tiber river, which divided it from Etruria.\nThe emperor Augustus officially united almost all of present-day Italy into a single geo-political entity, Italia, dividing it into eleven regions. The part of today's Lazio south of the Tiber river \u2013 together with the present region of Campania immediately to the southeast of Lazio and the seat of Neapolis \u2013 became Region I (\"Latium et Campania\"), while modern Upper Lazio became part of \"Regio VII \u2013 Etruria\", and today's Province of Rieti joined \"Regio IV \u2013 Samnium\".\nAfter the Gothic conquest of Italy at the end of the fifth century, modern Lazio became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, but after the Gothic War between 535 and 554 and conquest by the Byzantine Empire, the region became the property of the Eastern Emperor as the Duchy of Rome. However, the long wars against the Longobards weakened the region. With the Donation of Sutri in 728, the Pope acquired the first territory in the region beyond the Duchy of Rome.\nThe strengthening of the religious and ecclesiastical aristocracy led to continuous power struggles between secular lords (\"Baroni\") and the Pope until the middle of the 16th century. Innocent III tried to strengthen his own territorial power, wishing to assert his authority in the provincial administrations of Tuscia, Campagna and Marittima through the Church's representatives, in order to reduce the power of the Colonna family. Other popes tried to do the same. During the period when the papacy resided in Avignon, France (1309\u20131377), the feudal lords' power increased due to the absence of the Pope from Rome. Small communes, and Rome above all, opposed the lords' increasing power, and with Cola di Rienzo, they tried to present themselves as antagonists of the ecclesiastical power. However, between 1353 and 1367, the papacy regained control of Lazio and the rest of the Papal States. From the middle of the 16th century, the papacy politically unified Lazio with the Papal States, so that these territories became provincial administrations of St. Peter's estate; governors in Viterbo, in Marittima and Campagna, and in Frosinone administered them for the papacy.\nLazio was part of the short-lived Roman Republic, after which it became a puppet state of the First French Republic under the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte. Lazio was returned to the Papal States in October 1799. In 1809, it was annexed to the French Empire under the name of the Department of Tibre, but returned to the Pope's control in 1815.\nOn 20 September 1870 the capture of Rome, during the reign of Pope Pius IX, and France's defeat at Sedan, completed Italian unification, and Lazio was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy. In 1927, the territory of the province of Rieti, belonging to Umbria and Abruzzo, joined Lazio. Towns in Lazio were devastated by the 2016 Central Italy earthquake.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture, crafts, animal husbandry and fishery are the main traditional sources of income. Agriculture is characterized by the cultivation of wine grapes, fruit, vegetables and olives. Lazio is the main growing region of kiwifruit in Italy.\nApproximately 73% of the working population are employed in the services sector, which contribute 85.8% of regional GDP; this is a considerable proportion, but is justified by the presence of Rome, which is the core of public administration, media, utility, telecommunication, transport, tourism and other sectors. Many national and multinational corporations, public and private, have their headquarters in Rome (ENI, Italiana Petroli, Enel, Acea, Terna, TIM, Poste italiane, Leonardo, ITA Airways, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, RAI).\nLazio's limited industrial sector and highly developed service industries allowed the region to well outperform the Italian economy during the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, but it was strongly affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns.\nIndustrial development in Lazio is limited to the areas south of Rome. Communications and \u2013 above all \u2013 the setting of the border of the Cassa del Mezzogiorno some kilometers south of Rome have influenced the position of industry, favouring the areas with the best links to Rome and those near the Autostrada del Sole, especially around Frosinone. Additional factor was cheap energy supply from Latina Nuclear Power Plant and Garigliano Nuclear Power Plant, which are now out of the operation after Italian nuclear energy referendum.\nLazio is served by Rome Fiumicino Airport. The airport is the busiest airport in the country, the eighth-busiest airport in Europe and the world's 39th-busiest airport with over 49.2 million passengers served in 2024. Rome Ciampino Airport is the region's second international airport and is mainly serving low-cost carriers.\nIndustry.\nIndustry contributes a small part of GDP: its share is 8.9% compared to 25.0% in Veneto and 24.0% in Emilia-Romagna. In Rome it is even less with 7%, compared with 12% from tourism. Since a large part of Lazio's GDP is produced by the service sector, with high value added.\nFirms are often small to medium in size and operate in the following industries:\nThere is some R&amp;D activity in high technology: IBM (IBM Rome Software Lab), Ericsson, Leonardo Electronics (Rome-Tiburtina, Rome-Laurentina, Pomezia, Latina), Rheinmetall (\"Radar House\") and tire industry: Bridgestone (R&amp;D center in Rome and proving grounds in Aprilia).\nConsumer goods.\nThe most distinctive industry in Lazio is production of household chemicals, pharmaceutical, hygiene goods and medical products: Sigma-Tau, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive, Henkel, Pfizer, Abbott, Catalent, Angelini, Menarini, Biopharma, Wepa.\nAgriculture.\nFrom fruits the most important are kiwifruit (1st place in Italy) and hazel nuts \"Nocciola romana\". Italy itself is the second largest producer of kiwifruit worldwide and was surpassed only by China. Infrastructure which has been used for grape growing was easily adapted for kiwifruit cultivation.\nAnimal husbandry.\nOnly sheep and buffalo herds are significant nationwide. Both are kept predominantly for milk, which is used in the production of \"pecorino romano\" and \"mozzarella di bufala\" cheese. Sheep herds are the 3rd nationwide after Sardinia and Sicily. 40% of sheep are bred in province of Viterbo.\nViticulture.\nVineyards cover in Lazio. 90% of wines are white. In production of quality wine Lazio has rank 14 of 20 with 190.557 hl.\nThere are 3 DOCG wines:\nTourism.\nTourism in Lazio is a thriving sector especially as regards tourism linked to art and monuments and places of interest in the region (Rome in particular), religious tourism (Vatican City, Rome and the sanctuaries of Lazio), summer seaside tourism especially in upper and lower Lazio (Santa Marinella, Ladispoli, Anzio, Nettuno, Sabaudia, San Felice Circeo, Terracina, Sperlonga, Gaeta) and summer/winter tourism in the ski resorts of the Lazio Apennines (Monte Terminillo, Leonessa, Cittareale, Monte Livata, Campo Staffi and Campocatino, Altipiani di Arcinazzo). Other points of interest in the region are the area of the Roman Castles, located south-east of the city of Rome, around the Alban Hills, made up of a group of towns and cities, partly in the territory of Latium Vetus, surrounded by the Roman Campagna. Also the areas around Lake Bracciano and Lake Bolsena, Lazio is home to 14 lakes of volcanic origin. One of the most important archaeological park in Italy is Ostia Antica, known as the port of ancient Rome, Ostia was a city of the Latium Vetus, located near the mouth of the Tiber river. Civita di Bagnoregio, also known as \"the dying city\", has become a popular tourist destination in the country.\nAccording to Istat data relating to 2018, Lazio is one of the most visited regions in Italy and Europe and one of the first in terms of number of international presences. Rome is the most visited city in Italy with around 30 million visitors per year. Among the most visited sites of interest include the Colosseum and Imperial fora, Castel Sant'Angelo and the complex of Hadrian's Villa and Villa d'Este, among the museum itineraries the Pantheon, the Gardens of Bomarzo, the Abbey of Fossanova, Monte Cassino Abbey and Farfa Abbey.\nLazio has many small and picturesque villages, 25 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.\nStatistics.\nLazio GDP growth from 2013 to 2017 in euro:\nIn 2019 there were 657,855 companies, 10.8% of the national total.\nThe table below shows the GDP, produced in Lazio at current market prices in 2006, expressed in millions of euros, broken down into the main economic macro-activities:\nUnemployment.\nThe unemployment rate stood at 7.7% in 2022.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWith a population of 5,714,882 million (as of 31 December 2021), Lazio is the second-most populated region of Italy. The overall population density in the region is 341 inhabitants per km2. However, the population density widely ranges from almost 800 inhabitants per km2 in the highly urbanized Rome metropolitan area to less than 60 inhabitants per km2 in the mountainous and rural province of Rieti. As of January 2023, the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that 615,108 foreign-born immigrants live in Lazio, equal to 11.1% of the total regional population.\nGovernment and politics.\nLazio has a system of representative democracy in which the President of the Region (') is the head of government and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is vested in the regional government (') and legislative power is vested in the Regional Council (\"\").\nRome is centre-left politically oriented by tradition, while the rest of Lazio is centre-right oriented. In the 2008 general election, Lazio gave 44.2% of its vote to the centre-right coalition, while the centre-left block took 41.4% of vote. In the 2013 general election, Lazio gave 40.7% of its vote to the centre-left block coalition, 29.3% to the centre-right coalition and 20.2 to the Five Star Movement.\nThe current president of Lazio is Francesco Rocca, independent politician and former president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in office in the centre-right coalition.\nAdministrative divisions.\nLazio is divided into four provinces and one metropolitan (province-level) city:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCuisine.\nOne of the most famous forms of food in Lazio is pasta. Dishes first attested inside the region's borders include:\n\"Guanciale\" is used in several sauces. \"Guanciale\" is the cut of pork obtained from the cheek of the pig, crossed by lean veins of muscle with a component of valuable fat, of a composition different from \"lardo\" (\"back fat\") and \"pancetta\" (\"belly fat\"): the consistency is harder than \"pancetta\" and it possesses a more distinctive flavor. \"Guanciale\" is salted pork fat, different from bacon, which is smoked. It is a typical product of Lazio, Umbria and Abruzzo. Another important ingredient is \"pecorino romano\" cheese.\nVegetables are common, artichokes (\"\"carciofi\") being among the most popular:\nOther popular vegetables are romanesco broccoli, asparagus, fava bean, \"\", romaine lettuce, pumpkin, zucchini and chicory.\nSpices.\nIn the cuisine of Lazio, spices are widely used. Among the most used are lesser cat-mint, called in Rome \"mentuccia\" (for artichokes and mushrooms), squaw mint, called in Rome \"menta romana\"\" (for lamb and tripe), laurel, rosemary, sage, juniper, chili and grated truffle.\n\"Quinto quarto\".\nAlthough Roman and Lazio cuisine use cheap ingredients like vegetable and pasta, poor people needed a source of protein. Therefore, they used the so-called \"quinto quarto\" (\"fifth quarter\"), leftovers from animal carcasses that remained after the sale of prized parts to the wealthy.\n\"Quinto quarto\" includes tripe (the most valuable part of reticulum, also called \"\"cuffia\", \"l'omaso\" or \"lampredotto\"\"), kidneys (which need to be soaked for a long time in water with lemon to remove urine smell), heart, liver, spleen, sweetbreads (pancreas, thymus and salivary glands), brain, tongue, ox tail, trotters and pajata (intestines of calf, fed only with its mother's milk). The intestines are cleaned and skinned but the chyme (mass of partly digested food) is left inside. Typical dishes of this style are:\nMeat dishes.\nTraditional meat dishes include \"saltimbocca alla romana\" (veal wrapped with \"prosciutto di Parma\" DOP and sage and cooked in white wine, butter and flour) and \"abbacchio alla romana\" (roasted lamb with garlic, rosemary, pepper and chopped \"prosciutto\").\nSports.\nThe region gives its name to the professional football club SS Lazio that plays in the Italian Serie A. The region has two professional clubs in the top flight, the other being AS Roma, who also play in the highest division of Italian football. Combined, the two have won five Italian championships with Roma winning three and Lazio two. The main sports stadium in Lazio is Stadio Olimpico in Rome which has housed both teams for a prolonged time and hosts Derby della Capitale between the two clubs. The stadium also hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics and the 1990 FIFA World Cup final. Outside of Rome the football scene has another club playing in the Serie A, that being Frosinone.\nLazio hosts no top-line motorsports events, but the Vallelunga circuit previously hosted the Superbike World Championship in motorcycle racing.\nRome is home to many international sporting events and competitions, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his bold and ingenious revival of dramatic and scenic art\". Pirandello's works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about 40 plays, some of which are written in Sicilian. Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nPirandello was born into an upper-class family in Girgenti (now Agrigento), Sicily, near the poor suburb of Porto Empedocle. His family's surname had originally been the Greek \"Pirangelos\" (Greek: ), which had been phonetically corrupted. Pirandello was of Greek descent, as he noted himself in an interview to Kostas Ouranis in 1934.\nThe area of his birth was called \"Caos\", from , Sicilian for \"trousers\", after the shape of a nearby ravine. His father, Stefano Pirandello, belonged to a wealthy family involved in the sulphur industry, and his mother, Caterina Ricci Gramitto, was also of a well-to-do background, descending from a family of the bourgeois professional class of Agrigento. Both families, the Pirandellos and the Ricci Gramittos, were ferociously anti-Bourbon and actively participated in the struggle for unification and democracy (). Stefano participated in the famous Expedition of the Thousand, later following Garibaldi all the way to the battle of Aspromonte, and Caterina, who had hardly reached the age of thirteen, was forced to accompany her father to Malta, where he had been sent into exile by the Bourbon monarchy. But the open participation in the Garibaldian cause and the strong sense of idealism of those early years were quickly transformed, above all in Caterina, into an angry and bitter disappointment with the new reality created by the unification. Pirandello would eventually assimilate this sense of betrayal and resentment and express it in several of his poems and in his novel \"The Old and the Young\". It is also probable that this climate of disillusion inculcated in the young Luigi the sense of disproportion between ideals and reality which is recognizable in his essay on humorism (\"L'Umorismo\").\nPirandello received his elementary education at home, but was much more fascinated by the fables and legends, somewhere between popular and magic, that his elderly servant Maria Stella used to recount to him than by anything scholastic or academic. By the age of twelve, he had already written his first tragedy. At the insistence of his father, he was registered at a technical school, but eventually switched to the study of the humanities at the \"ginnasio\", something which had always attracted him.\nIn 1880, the Pirandello family moved to Palermo. It was here, in the capital of Sicily, that Luigi completed his high school education. He also began reading omnivorously, focusing, above all, on 19th-century Italian poets such as Giosu\u00e8 Carducci and Arturo Graf. He then started writing his first poems and fell in love with his cousin Lina.\nDuring this period, the first signs of serious differences arose between Luigi and his father; Luigi had discovered some notes revealing the existence of Stefano's extramarital relations. As a reaction to the ever-increasing distrust and disharmony that Luigi was developing toward his father, a man of a robust physique and crude manners, his attachment to his mother would continue growing to the point of profound veneration. This later expressed itself, after her death, in the moving pages of the novella \"Colloqui con i personaggi\" in 1915.\nHis romantic feelings for his cousin, initially looked upon with disfavour, were suddenly taken very seriously by Lina's family. They demanded that Luigi abandon his studies and dedicate himself to the sulphur business so that he could immediately marry her. In 1886, during a vacation from school, Luigi went to visit the sulphur mines of Porto Empedocle and started working with his father. This experience was essential to him and would provide the basis for such stories as \"Il Fumo\", \"Ci\u00e0ula scopre la Luna\" as well as some of the descriptions and background in the novel \"The Old and the Young\". The marriage, which had seemed imminent, was postponed.\nPirandello then registered at the University of Palermo in the departments of Law and of Letters. The campus at Palermo, and above all the Department of Law, was the centre in those years of the vast movement which would eventually evolve into the Fasci Siciliani. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of friendship with its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La Loggia, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.\nHigher education.\nIn 1887, having definitively chosen the Department of Letters, he moved to Rome in order to continue his studies. But the encounter with the city, centre of the struggle for unification to which the families of his parents had participated with generous enthusiasm, was disappointing and nothing close to what he had expected. \"When I arrived in Rome it was raining hard, it was night time and I felt like my heart was being crushed, but then I laughed like a man in the throes of desperation.\"\nPirandello, who was an extremely sensitive moralist, finally had a chance to see for himself the irreducible decadence of the so-called heroes of the Risorgimento in the person of his uncle Rocco, now a greying and exhausted functionary of the prefecture who provided him with temporary lodgings in Rome. The \"desperate laugh\", the only manifestation of revenge for the disappointment undergone, inspired the bitter verses of his first collection of poems, \"Mal Giocondo\" (1889). But not all was negative; this first visit to Rome provided him with the opportunity to assiduously visit the many theatres of the capital: Il Nazionale, Il Valle, il Manzoni. \"Oh the dramatic theatre! I will conquer it. I cannot enter into one without experiencing a strange sensation, an excitement of the blood through all my veins...\" \nBecause of a conflict with a Latin professor, he was forced to leave the University of Rome and went to Bonn with a letter of presentation from one of his other professors. The stay in Bonn, which lasted two years, was fervid with cultural life. He read the German romantics, Jean Paul, Tieck, Chamisso, Heinrich Heine and Goethe. He began translating the \"Roman Elegies\" of Goethe, composed the \"Elegie Boreali\" in imitation of the style of the \"Roman Elegies\", and he began to meditate on the topic of humorism by way of the works of Cecco Angiolieri.\nIn March 1891 he received his doctorate in Romance Philology with a dissertation on the dialect of Agrigento: \"Sounds and Developments of Sounds in the Speech of Craperallis\".\nMarriage.\nAfter a brief sojourn in Sicily, during which the planned marriage with his cousin was finally called off, he returned to Rome, where he became friends with a group of writer-journalists including Ugo Fleres, Tomaso Gnoli, Giustino Ferri and Luigi Capuana. Capuana encouraged Pirandello to dedicate himself to narrative writing. In 1893 he wrote his first important work, \"Marta Ajala\", which was published in 1901 as \"l'Esclusa\". In 1894 he published his first collection of short stories, \"Amori senza Amore\". He also married in 1894, choosing (on his father's suggestion) a shy, withdrawn girl of a good family of Agrigentine origin educated by the nuns of San Vincenzo: Maria Antonietta Portulano.\nThe first years of matrimony brought on in him a new fervour for his studies and writings: his encounters with his friends and the discussions on art continued, more vivacious and stimulating than ever, while his family life, despite the complete incomprehension of his wife with respect to the artistic vocation of her husband, proceeded relatively tranquilly with the birth of two sons (Stefano and Fausto) and a daughter (Rosalia \"Lietta\"). In the meantime, Pirandello intensified his collaborations with newspaper editors and other journalists in magazines such as \"La Critica\" and \"La Tavola Rotonda\" in which he published, in 1895, the first part of the \"Dialoghi tra Il Gran Me e Il Piccolo Me\".\nIn 1897 he accepted an offer to teach Italian at the Istituto Superiore di Magistero di Roma, and in the magazine \"Il Marzocco\" he published several more pages of the \"Dialoghi\". In 1898, with Italo Falbo and Ugo Fleres, he founded the weekly \"Ariel\", in which he published the one-act play \"L'Epilogo\" (later changed to \"La Morsa\") and some novellas (La Scelta, Se...). The end of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th were a period of extreme productivity for Pirandello. In 1900, he published in \"Il Marzocco\" some of the most celebrated of his novellas (\"Lumie di Sicilia\", \"La Paura del Sonno\"...) and, in 1901, the collection of poems \"Zampogna\". In 1902 he published the first series of \"Beffe della Morte e della Vita\" and his second novel, \"Il Turno\".\nFamily disaster.\nThe year 1903 was fundamental to the life of Pirandello. The flooding of the sulphur mines of Aragona, in which his father Stefano had invested not only an enormous amount of his own capital but also Antonietta's dowry, precipitated the financial collapse of the family. Antonietta, after opening and reading the letter announcing the catastrophe, entered into a state of semi-catatonia and underwent such a psychological shock that her mental balance remained profoundly and irremediably shaken.\nPirandello, who had initially harboured thoughts of suicide, attempted to remedy the situation as best he could by increasing the number of his lessons in both Italian and German and asking for compensation from the magazines to which he had freely given away his writings and collaborations. In the magazine \"New Anthology\", directed by G. Cena, meanwhile, the novel which Pirandello had been writing while in this horrible situation (watching over his mentally ill wife at night after an entire day spent at work) began appearing in episodes. The title was \"Il Fu Mattia Pascal\" (\"The Late Mattia Pascal\"). This novel contains many autobiographical elements that have been fantastically re-elaborated. It was an immediate and resounding success. Translated into German in 1905, this novel paved the way to the notoriety and fame which allowed Pirandello to publish with the more important firms such as Treves, with whom he published, in 1906, another collection of novellas \"Erma Bifronte\". In 1908 he published a volume of essays entitled \"Arte e Scienza\" and the important essay \"L'Umorismo\", in which he initiated the legendary debate with Benedetto Croce that would continue with increasing bitterness and venom on both sides for many years.\nIn 1905 he took his wife to stay in Chianciano Terme together with their children where they stayed for two months in what the writer described as \"the village nestled on the windy hill just opposite the Collegiata\". Two short stories contained in the book \"Short Stories for a Year\" are set in this town: \"Bitter Water\" and \"Pallino and Mim\u00ec\".\nIn 1909 the first part of \"I Vecchi e I Giovani\" was published in episodes. This novel retraces the history of the failure and repression of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893 to 1894. When the novel came out in 1913 Pirandello sent a copy of it to his parents for their fiftieth wedding anniversary along with a dedication which said that \"their names, Stefano and Caterina, live heroically.\" However, while the mother is transfigured in the novel into the otherworldly figure of Caterina Laurentano, the father, represented by the husband of Caterina, Stefano Auriti, appears only in memories and flashbacks, since, as was observed by Leonardo Sciascia, \"he died censured in a Freudian sense by his son who, in the bottom of his soul, is his enemy.\" Also in 1909, Pirandello began his collaboration with the prestigious journal \"Corriere della Sera\" in which he published the novellas \"Mondo di Carta\" (\"World of Paper\"), \"La Giara\", and, in 1910, \"Non \u00e8 una cosa seria\" and \"Pensaci, Giacomino!\" (\"Think it over, Giacomino!\"). At this point Pirandello's fame as a writer was continually increasing. His private life, however, was poisoned by the suspicion and obsessive jealousy of Antonietta who began turning physically violent.\nIn 1911, while the publication of novellas and short stories continued, Pirandello finished his fourth novel, \"Suo Marito\", republished posthumously (1941), and completely revised in the first four chapters, with the title \"Giustino Roncella nato Boggi\u00f2lo\". During his life the author never republished this novel for reasons of discretion (within are implicit references to the writer Grazia Deledda). But the work which absorbed most of his energies at this time was the collection of stories \"La vendetta del cane\", \"Quando s'\u00e8 capito il giuoco\", \"Il treno ha fischiato\", \"Filo d'aria\" and \"Berecche e la guerra\". They were all published from 1913 to 1914 and are all now considered classics of Italian literature.\nFirst World War.\nAs Italy entered the First World War, Pirandello's son Stefano volunteered for service and was taken prisoner by the Austro-Hungarians. In 1916 the actor Angelo Musco successfully recited the three-act comedy that the writer had extracted from the novella \"Pensaci, Giacomino!\" and the \"pastoral\" comedy \"Liol\u00e0\".\nIn 1917 the collection of novellas \"E domani Luned\u00ec\" (\"And Tomorrow, Monday...\") was published, but the year was mostly marked by important theatrical representations: \"Cos\u00ec \u00e8 (se vi pare)\" (\"Right you are (if you think so)\"), \"A birrita cu' i ciancianeddi\" and \"Il Piacere dell'onest\u00e0\" (\"The Pleasure Of Honesty\"). A year later, \"Ma non \u00e8 una cosa seria\" (\"But It's Nothing Serious\") and \"Il Gioco delle Parti\" (\"The Game of Roles\") were all produced on stage. Pirandello's son Stefano returned home when the war ended.\nIn 1919 Pirandello had his wife placed in an asylum. The separation from his wife, despite her morbid jealousies and hallucinations, caused great suffering for Pirandello who, even as late as 1924, believed he could still properly care for her at home. She never left the asylum.\n1920 was the year of comedies such as \"Tutto per bene\", \"Come prima meglio di prima\", and \"La Signora Morli\". In 1921, the \"Compagnia di Dario Niccodemi\" staged, at the Valle di Roma, the play, \"Sei Personaggi in Cerca d'Autore\", \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\". It was a clamorous failure. The public divided into supporters and adversaries, the latter of whom shouted, \"Asylum, Asylum!\" The author, who was present at the performance with his daughter Lietta, left through a side exit to avoid the crowd of enemies. The same drama, however, was a great success when presented in Milan. In 1922 in Milan, \"Enrico IV\" was performed for the first time and was acclaimed universally as a success. Pirandello's international reputation was developing as well. The \"Sei personaggi\" was performed in London and New York.\nItaly under the Fascists.\nPirandello was an Italian nationalist and supported Italian fascism in a moderate way. In 1924, he wrote a letter to Benito Mussolini asking him to be accepted as a member of the National Fascist Party. In 1925 Pirandello, with the help of Mussolini, assumed the artistic direction and ownership of the Teatro d'Arte di Roma, founded by the Gruppo degli Undici. He described himself as \"a Fascist because I am Italian.\" For his devotion to Mussolini, the satirical magazine \"Il Becco Giallo\" used to call him \"P. Randello\" (\"randello\" in Italian means cudgel).\nHe expressed publicly apolitical belief, saying \"I'm apolitical, I'm only a man in the world.\" During these years, he had continuous conflicts with fascist leaders. In 1927 he tore his fascist membership card to pieces in front of the startled secretary-general of the Fascist Party. For the remainder of his life, Pirandello was always under close surveillance by the secret fascist police OVRA.\nHis play, \"I Giganti della Montagna\" (\"The Giants of the Mountain\"), has been interpreted as evidence of his realization that the fascists were hostile to culture; yet, during a later appearance in New York, Pirandello distributed a statement announcing his support of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. He then gave his Nobel Prize medal to the Fascist government to be melted down as part of the 1935 Oro alla Patria (\"Gold to the Fatherland\") campaign during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.\nPirandello's conception of the theatre underwent a significant change at this point. The idea of the actor as an inevitable betrayer of the text, as in the \"Sei Personaggi\", gave way to the identification of the actor with the character that they play. The company took their act throughout the major cities of Europe, and the Pirandellian repertoire became increasingly well known. Between 1925 and 1926 Pirandello's last and perhaps greatest novel, \"Uno, Nessuno e Centomila\" (\"One, No one and One Hundred Thousand\"), was published serially in the magazine \"La Fiera Letteraria\". He was one of the contributors of the nationalist women's magazine, \"Lidel\", and the Fascist daily \"Il Tevere\".\nLegacy.\nOn 14 July 1930, a version of his short play \"The Man with the Flower in His Mouth\", adapted and produced by Lance Sieveking, co-produced with John Logie Baird's company and starring Val Gielgud and Lionel Millard, became the first drama broadcast in both picture and sound when the British Broadcasting Corporation showed it for London audiences.\nPirandello was nominated \"Academic of Italy\" in 1929, and in 1934 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature after he had been nominated by Guglielmo Marconi, member of the Royal Academy of Italy. He was the last Italian playwright to be chosen for the award until Dario Fo won on 9 October 1997.\nPirandello died alone in his home at Via Bosio, Rome, on 10 December 1936. He refused a State funeral offered by Mussolini and only in 1947 were his cremated remains buried in Sicily. The Via Luigi Pirandello in Acquaviva delle Fonti is named after him.\nIn the context of playwriting during the early and mid-1900s, Pirandello's impact is notable. Pirandello inspired playwrights such as Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter to write plays that echo the themes of existential exploration and metaphysical questioning that he focused on in his works. His influence goes beyond playwrights; French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre was also inspired by Pirandello's ideas to explore one of the main pillars of his philosophy: existentialism. The playwright's portrayal of fractured identities and the ambiguity of existence in his plays served as inspiration for\u00a0Sartre's concepts of freedom, authenticity, and existential angst. Pirandello's character narratives and metaphysical themes not only aligned with but also enriched Sartre's philosophical discourses, creating a link between existential thought in theater and philosophy, where each medium deepened and reflected upon the complexities and theories of the other. The dialogues between self and other, freedom and responsibility, authenticity and bad faith, found meaning in the intersection of their respective domains. His legacy pushes further reflection into the complexities of characters, human consciousness, and identity.\nPirandello's contributions to theater and philosophy provide a rich tapestry of existential themes interwoven with detailed character narratives. His thorough and insightful examinations of the intricacies of the human psyche and identity have left a mark that is palpable in contemporary theater and academe. This influence, while rooted in a specific historical context, manages to bridge the gap between past and present. The careful juxtaposition of simplicity and depth in his works not only invites but stimulates discourse, resonating deeply with modern artists, playwrights, and thinkers. As a result, discussions on existential concepts, identity, and the nature of reality continue to be enriched by Pirandello's foundational ideas.\nSelected works.\nEnglish translations.\nNearly all of Pirandello's plays were translated into English by the actor Robert Rietti. Pirandello's poetry was translated for the first time in 2016 by George Hochfield. William Weaver is a noted translator of Luigi Pirandello. Frederick May translated a number of Pirandello's plays and short stories in editions published by Oxford University Press and Penguin Books.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Early Church Fathers ascribed to him authorship of both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. Prominent figures in early Christianity such as Jerome and Eusebius later reaffirmed his authorship, although a lack of conclusive evidence as to the identity of the author of the works has led to discussion in scholarly circles, both secular and religious.\nThe New Testament mentions Luke briefly a few times, and the Epistle to the Colossians refers to him as a physician (from Greek for 'one who heals'); thus he is thought to have been both a physician and a disciple of Paul.\nSince the early years of the faith, Christians have regarded him as a saint. He is believed to have been a martyr, reportedly having been hanged from an olive tree, though some believe otherwise. The Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic church and other major denominations venerate him as Saint Luke the Evangelist and as a patron saint of artists, physicians, bachelors, notaries, butchers, brewers, and others; his feast day is 18 October. \nHe is also described in the New Testament as a Doctor.\nLife.\nMany scholars believe that Luke was a physician who lived in the Hellenistic city of Antioch in Ancient Syria, born of a Greek family, although some scholars and theologians think Luke was a Hellenic Jew. While it has been widely accepted that the theology of Luke\u2013Acts points to a gentile Christian writing for a gentile audience, some have concluded that it is more plausible that Luke\u2013Acts is directed to a community made up of both Jewish and gentile Christians since there is stress on the scriptural roots of the gentile mission (see the use of Isaiah 49:6 in Luke\u2013Acts). DNA testing on what some Christian tradition holds to be his body has revealed Syrian ancestry.\nWhether Luke was a Jew or gentile, or something in between, it is clear from the quality of the Greek language used in Luke-Acts that the author, held in Christian tradition to be Luke, was one of the most highly educated of the authors of the New Testament. The author's conscious and intentional allusions and references to, and quotations of, ancient Classical and Hellenistic Greek authors, such as Homer, Aesop, Epimenides, Euripides, Plato, and Aratus indicate that he was familiar with actual Greek literary texts. This familiarity most likely derived from his experiences as a youth of the very homogeneous Hellenistic educational curriculum () that had been, and would continue to be, used for centuries throughout the eastern Mediterranean.\nLuke's earliest mention is in the Epistle to Philemon, chapter 1, verse 24. He is also mentioned in Colossians 4:14 and 2 Timothy 4:11, both traditionally held to be Pauline epistles (see Authorship of the Pauline epistles).\nEpiphanius states that Luke was one of the Seventy Apostles (\"Panarion\" 51.11), and John Chrysostom indicates at one point that the \"brother\" that Paul mentions in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians 8:18 is either Luke or Barnabas (\"Homily 18 on Second Corinthians\" on 2 Corinthians 8:18).\nIf one accepts that Luke was indeed the author of the Gospel bearing his name and the Acts of the Apostles, certain details of his personal life can be reasonably assumed. While he does exclude himself from those who were eyewitnesses to Jesus' ministry, he repeatedly uses the word \"we\" in describing the Pauline missions in Acts of the Apostles, indicating that he was personally there at those times.\nThe composition of the writings, as well as the range of vocabulary used, indicate that the author was an educated man. A quote in the Epistle to the Colossians differentiates between Luke and other colleagues \"of the circumcision.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Colossians 4:10\u201311, 14\nThis comment has traditionally caused commentators to conclude that Luke was a gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, that is not the only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to have been a gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to have been a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could just as easily be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.\nLuke's presence in Rome with the Apostle Paul near the end of Paul's life was attested by 2 Timothy 4:11: \"Only Luke is with me\". In the last chapter of the Book of Acts, widely attributed to Luke, there are several accounts in the first person also affirming Luke's presence in Rome, including Acts 28:16: \"And when we came to Rome...\" According to some accounts, Luke also contributed to the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews.\nLuke died at age 84 in Boeotia, according to a \"fairly early and widespread tradition\". According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos, Greek historian of the 14th century (and others), Luke's tomb was located in Thebes, whence his relics were transferred to Constantinople in the year 357.\nAuthorship of Luke and Acts.\nThe Gospel of Luke does not name its author. The Gospel was not, nor does it claim to be, written by direct witnesses to the reported events, unlike Acts beginning in the sixteenth chapter. However, in most translations the author suggests that they have investigated the book's events and notes the name (Theophilus) of that to whom they are writing.\nThe earliest manuscript of the Gospel (Papyrus 75 = Papyrus Bodmer XIV-XV), dated c. AD\u00a0200, ascribes the work to Luke; as did Irenaeus writing c. AD\u00a0180, and the Muratorian fragment, a 7th-century Latin manuscript thought to be copied and translated from a Greek manuscript as old as AD\u00a0170.\nThe Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles make up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke\u2013Acts. Together they account for 27.5% of the New Testament, the largest contribution by a single author.\nAs a historian.\nMost scholars understand Luke's works (Luke\u2013Acts) in the tradition of Greek historiography. Luke 1:1\u20134, drawing on historical investigation, identified the work to the readers as belonging to the genre of history. There is disagreement about how best to treat Luke's writings, with some historians regarding Luke as highly accurate, and others taking a more critical approach.\nBased on his accurate description of towns, cities and islands, as well as correctly naming various official titles, archaeologist William Mitchell Ramsay wrote that \"Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy. \u2026[He] should be placed along with the very greatest of historians.\" Professor of Classics at Auckland University, Edward Musgrave Blaiklock, wrote: \"For accuracy of detail, and for evocation of atmosphere, Luke stands, in fact, with Thucydides. The Acts of the Apostles is not shoddy product of pious imagining, but a trustworthy record. \u2026It was the spadework of archaeology which first revealed the truth.\" New Testament scholar Colin Hemer has made a number of advancements in understanding the historical nature and accuracy of Luke's writings.\nOn the purpose of Acts, New Testament scholar Luke Timothy Johnson has noted that \"Luke's account is selected and shaped to suit his apologetic interests, not in defiance of but in conformity to ancient standards of historiography.\" Such a position is shared by Richard Heard, who sees historical deficiencies as arising from \"special objects in writing and to the limitations of his sources of information.\"\nIn modern times, Luke's competence as a historian is questioned, depending upon one's \"a priori\" view of the supernatural. Since post-Enlightenment historians work with methodological naturalism, such historians would see a narrative that relates supernatural, fantastic things like angels, demons etc., as problematic as a historical source. Mark Powell claims that \"it is doubtful whether the writing of history was ever Luke's intent. Luke wrote to proclaim, to persuade, and to interpret; he did not write to preserve records for posterity. An awareness of this, has been, for many, the final nail in Luke the historian's coffin.\"\nRobert M. Grant has noted that although Luke saw himself within the historical tradition, his work contains a number of statistical improbabilities, such as the sizable crowd addressed by Peter in Acts 4:4. He has also noted chronological difficulties whereby Luke \"has Gamaliel refer to Theudas and Judas in the wrong order, and Theudas actually rebelled about a decade after Gamaliel spoke (5:36\u20137)\", though this report's status as a chronological difficulty is hotly disputed.\nBrent Landau writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs an artist.\nChristian tradition, starting from the 8th century, states that Luke was the first icon painter. He is said to have painted pictures of the Virgin Mary and Child, in particular the Hodegetria image in Constantinople (now lost). Starting from the 11th century, a number of painted images were venerated as his autograph works, including the Black Madonna of Cz\u0119stochowa, Our Lady of Vladimir, and \"Madonna del Rosario\". He was also said to have painted Saints Peter and Paul, and to have illustrated a gospel book with a full cycle of miniatures.\nThe late medieval Guilds of Saint Luke gathered together and protected painters in many cities of Europe, especially Flanders. The Academy of Saint Luke, in Rome, was imitated in many other European cities during the 16th century. The tradition that Luke painted icons of Mary and Jesus has been common, particularly in Eastern Orthodoxy. The tradition also has support from the Saint Thomas Christians of India who claim to still have one of the Theotokos icons that Saint Luke painted and which Saint Thomas brought to India.\nThe art critic A. I. Uspensky writes that the icons attributed to the brush of the Evangelist Luke have a completely Byzantine character that was fully established only in the 5th-6th centuries.\nSymbol.\nIn traditional depictions, such as paintings, evangelist portraits, and church mosaics, Saint Luke is often accompanied by an ox or bull, usually having wings. The ox is mentioned in both Ezechiel 1:10 and Revelation 4:7. Sometimes only the symbol is shown, especially when in a combination of those of all Four Evangelists. \"St Luke is suggested by the ox, a sacrificial animal, because his Gospel stresses the sacrificial nature of Christ's ministry and opens with Zechariah performing his priestly duties.\"\nVeneration.\nEastern Orthodoxy.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church commemorated Saint Luke, Apostle of the Seventy, Evangelist, companion (coworker) of the holy Apostle Paul, hieromartyr, physician, first icon painter with several feast days. The following are fixed feast days:\nThere are also moveable feasts in which Luke is commemorated:\nRoman Catholicism.\nThe Roman Catholic Church commemorates Luke the Evangelist on 18 October.\nOriental Orthodoxy.\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church commemorates the martyrdom of Luke on Paopi 22.\nAnglicanism.\nThe Church of England commemorates Luke the Evangelist on 18 October.\nRelics.\nDespot George of Serbia purportedly bought the relics from the Ottoman sultan Murad II for 30,000 gold coins. After the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia, the kingdom's last queen, George's granddaughter Mary, who had brought the relics with her from Serbia as her dowry, sold them to the Venetian Republic.\nIn 1992, the then Greek Orthodox Metropolitan Ieronymos of Thebes and Livadeia (who subsequently became Archbishop Ieronymos II of Athens and All Greece) requested from Bishop Antonio Mattiazzo of Padua the return of \"a significant fragment of the relics of St. Luke to be placed on the site where the holy tomb of the Evangelist is located and venerated today\". This prompted a scientific investigation of the relics in Padua, and by numerous lines of empirical evidence (archeological analyses of the Tomb in Thebes and the Reliquary of Padua, anatomical analyses of the remains, carbon-14 dating, comparison with the purported skull of the Evangelist located in Prague) confirmed that these were the remains of an individual of Syrian descent who died between AD 72 and AD 416. The Bishop of Padua then delivered to Metropolitan Ieronymos the rib of Saint Luke that was closest to his heart to be kept at his tomb in Thebes.\nThus, the relics of Saint Luke are divided as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Genetic characterization of the body attributed to the evangelist Luke\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

By then, they had settled on a lineup that included bassist Leon Wilkeson, keyboardist Billy Powell, and guitarist Ed King. Burns left and was replaced by Artimus Pyle in 1974. King left in 1975 and was replaced by Steve Gaines in 1976. At the height of their fame in the 1970s, the band popularized the Southern rock genre with songs such as \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and \"Free Bird\". After releasing five studio albums and one live album, the band's career was abruptly halted on October 20, 1977, when their chartered airplane crashed, killing Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines, and seriously injuring the rest of the band.\nLynyrd Skynyrd reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, Johnny Van Zant, as lead vocalist. They continued to tour and record with Johnny Van Zant, and Rickey Medlocke, who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996. Over the years, other founding members of the band have died either during or after their time in the band. In January 2018, Lynyrd Skynyrd announced its farewell tour, and continued touring until 2022. Members were still working on the band's fifteenth album at the time of Rossington's death in 2023, after which no founding members remained in the band.\nIn 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked Lynyrd Skynyrd No. 95 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006. As of 2023, the band has sold more than 38 million records in the United States. AllMusic called them \"the definitive Southern rock band\".\nHistory.\nEarly years (1963\u20131973).\nAllen Collins received his first guitar in 1963 and was later in a band called The Mods in Jacksonville, Florida. The Mods' membership included J.R. Rice and Larry Steele. In early 1964, Ronnie Van Zant joined another local band, The Squires, which he soon renamed to Us. That year, at a local 'Battle of the Bands', Us performed against The Mods and won the competition. Van Zant, however, left Us shortly afterward. In the early summer of 1964, bassist Larry Junstrom, drummer Bob Burns, and guitarist Gary Rossington formed a trio called Me, You, and Him.\nLater in the summer of 1964, teenagers Van Zant, Rossington, and Burns all became acquainted while playing on rival baseball teams. The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played The Rolling Stones' hit \"Time Is on My Side\". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. Bassist Larry Junstrom rounded out the lineup. They soon approached guitarist Allen Collins to join the band, and he agreed to join just two weeks later. The band later rehearsed in Junstrom's carport after Burns' parents said the band was too loud. The band settled on the name My Backyard, later changed to Conquer the Worm for a day or two, then The Noble Five, and finally The One Percent by 1967.\nIn 1968, Van Zant sought a new name after growing tired of taunts from audiences that the band had \"one percent talent\". At Burns' suggestion, the group settled on \"Leonard Skinnerd\", which was in part a reference to a character named \"Leonard Skinner\" in Allan Sherman's novelty song \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\" and in part a mocking tribute to P.E. teacher Leonard Skinner at Robert E. Lee High School. Skinner was notorious for strictly enforcing the school's policy against boys having long hair. Rossington dropped out of school, tired of being hassled about his hair. The more distinctive spelling \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" was adopted at least as early as 1969.\nBy 1970, Lynyrd Skynyrd had become a top band in Jacksonville, headlining at some local concerts, and opening for several national acts. Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in Macon, Georgia-based Hustlers Inc.; along with Phil Walden's younger brother, Alan, became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was transferred to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving blues rock sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \"southern\" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.\nDuring this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by Greg T. Walker on bass. At that time, Rickey Medlocke joined as a second drummer and second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke had grown up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather, Shorty Medlocke, was an influence in the writing of \"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\".\nPeak (1973\u20131977).\nIn 1972, the band (then comprising Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio's in Atlanta. Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label, which was to be distributed and supported by MCA Records, and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions, playing on only two tracks. He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part that Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in \"Simple Man\"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album. After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album \"(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)\" on August 13, 1973. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. The album featured the hit song \"Free Bird\", which received national airplay, eventually reaching No.\u00a019 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\nLynyrd Skynyrd's fan base continued to grow rapidly in 1973, thanks to their opening on the Who's \"Quadrophenia\" tour in the United States. Their 1974 follow-up album, \"Second Helping\", featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough. Its single \"Sweet Home Alabama\", a response to Neil Young's \"Southern Man\", reached No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 that August. Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young wrote the song \"Powderfinger\" for the band, but they never recorded it. During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was the only single to crack the top ten.\nBy 1975, personal issues began to take their toll on the band. In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour, and was replaced by Kentucky native and former US Marine Artimus Pyle. The band's third album, \"Nuthin' Fancy\", was recorded in 17 days. Unhappy with the band's lack of preparation for the album's recording, Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement after the tracking was completed, with Kooper mixing the album while the band left for the tour that had precipitated the constricted recording schedule. Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the \"Nuthin' Fancy\" tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. King's guitar roadie and Van Zant were arrested together and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings that broke, causing his performance to be substandard. Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to Los Angeles, believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.\nCollins and Rossington both had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition \"That Smell\" \u2013 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on Quaaludes. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.\nThe \"Street Survivors\" album of 1977 turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist Steve Gaines, who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd's newest member, claiming that the band would \"all be in his shadow one day\". Gaines' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written \"You Got That Right\" and the rousing guitar boogie \"I Know a Little\", which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain't No Good Life\" \u2013 the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant (the album \"Skynyrd's First: The Complete Muscle Shoals Album\", which features two songs sung by former drummer/future guitarist Rickey Medlocke, was released after the plane crash). The album also included the hit singles \"What's Your Name\" and \"That Smell\". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, with shows always highlighted by the iconic rock anthem \"Free Bird\".\nPlane crash (1977).\nFollowing a performance at the Greenville Memorial Auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, on October 20, 1977, the band boarded a chartered Convair CV-240 bound for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where they were scheduled to appear at LSU the following night. After running out of fuel, the pilots attempted an emergency landing before crashing in a heavily forested area five miles northeast of Gillsburg, Mississippi. Killed on impact were Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, along with backup singer Cassie Gaines (Steve's older sister), assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot John Gray. Other band members (Collins, Rossington, Wilkeson, Powell, Pyle, and Hawkins), tour manager Ron Eckerman, and several road crew members suffered serious injuries.\nThe accident came just three days after the release of the group's fifth studio album \"Street Survivors\". Following the crash and the ensuing press, \"Street Survivors\" became the band's second platinum album and reached No.\u00a05 on the \"Billboard\" 200, their highest position on the chart. The single \"What's Your Name\" reached No.\u00a013 on the singles charts in 1978. The original cover sleeve for \"Street Survivors\" had featured a photograph of the band amid flames, with Steve Gaines nearly obscured by fire. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve's widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with the album's back photo, a similar image of the band against a simple black background. However, the group would restore the original image for the 30th anniversary deluxe edition of the album.\nHiatus (1977\u20131987).\nLynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting only on one occasion to perform an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\" at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam V in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.\nRossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed the Rossington Collins Band, which released two MCA albums, \"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere\" in 1980 and \"This Is The Way\" in 1981. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, Dale Krantz, as the lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgement of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed The Rossington Band, which released two albums, \"Returned to the Scene of the Crime\" in 1986 and \"Love Your Man\" in 1988 and also opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987\u20131988.\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker Mylon LeFevre. During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed the Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins and released one MCA album, titled \"A.P.B.\"\nIn 1980, Allen Collins's wife, Kathy, died of a massive hemorrhage while miscarrying their third child. He formed the Allen Collins Band in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington Collins Band and released one MCA studio album, \"Here, There &amp; Back\". He was visibly suffering from Kathy's death; he excessively drank and consumed drugs. On January 29, 1986, Collins, then 33, crashed his Ford Thunderbird into a ditch near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend Debra Jean Watts and leaving himself permanently paralyzed from the chest down.\nReturn (1987\u20131995).\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins' paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. In return for avoiding prison following his guilty plea to DUI manslaughter, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of \"That Smell\", the lyrics of which had been partially directed at him). Collins was stricken with pneumonia in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990, at age 37.\nThe reunited band was intended to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album \"Southern by the Grace of God: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987\". That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle. Following this rule, the band would have been forced to retire in 2001, but they have still continued to tour for another two decades.\nThe band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled \"Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991\". By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band's sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled \"The Last Rebel\" in 1993. Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes. In 1994, Owen Hale replaced Kurt Custer on drums.\nMember changes and deaths (1996\u20132019).\nEd King had to take a break from touring in 1996 due to heart complications that required a transplant. In his absence, he was replaced by Hughie Thomasson. The band did not let King rejoin after he recovered. At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by Rickey Medlocke, who had previously played and recorded with the band for a short time in the early 1970s. The result was a major retooling of the band's 'guitar army'. Medlocke and Thomasson would also become major contributors to the band's songwriting along with Rossington and Van Zant.\nThe first album with this new lineup, released in 1997, was titled \"Twenty\". The band released another album, \"Edge of Forever\" in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer Kenny Aronoff. Michael Cartellone became the band's permanent drummer on the subsequent tour. Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that the band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.\nThe band released a Christmas album, titled \"Christmas Time Again\" in 2000. Leon Wilkeson, Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to emphysema and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by Ean Evans.\nThe first album to feature Evans was \"Vicious Cycle\", released in 2003. This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song \"Red, White and Blue\". The band also released a double album called ', which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour. On June 22, 2004, the album ' was released.\nThomasson left the band in 2005 to reform The Outlaws, and Mark \"Sparky\" Matejka, formerly of the country music band Hot Apple Pie, joined in 2006 as his replacement.\nOn March 13, 2006, Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (also discussed later in the article), and they reunited with former members Bob Burns (drums), Artimus Pyle (drums), and Ed King (guitar) for a performance of \"Free Bird.\"\nOn November 2, 2007, the band performed for a crowd of 50,000 people at the University of Florida's Gator Growl student-run pep rally in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium (\"The Swamp\" football stadium). This was the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had played to in the U.S., until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people attended.\nOn January 28, 2009, keyboardist Billy Powell died of a suspected heart attack at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. No autopsy was carried out. He was replaced by Peter Keys.\nOn March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud &amp; Proud Records, and released their new album \"God &amp; Guns\" on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the U.S. in 2009 with Keys on keyboards and Robert Kearns of the Bottle Rockets on bass; bassist Ean Evans died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009. Scottish rock band Gun performed as special guests for the UK leg of Skynyrd's tour in 2010.\nIn addition to the tour, Skynyrd appeared at the Sean Hannity Freedom Concert series in late 2010. Hannity had been actively promoting the \"God &amp; Guns\" album, frequently playing portions of the track \"That Ain't My America\" on his radio show. The tour is titled \"Rebels and Bandoleros\". The band continued to tour throughout 2011, playing alongside ZZ Top and the Doobie Brothers.\nOn May 2, 2012, the band announced the impending release of a new studio album, \"Last of a Dyin' Breed\", along with a North American and European tour. On August 21, 2012, \"Last of a Dyin' Breed\" was released.\nLynyrd Skynyrd used a Confederate flag from the 1970s until the 2010s, and several criticisms have been raised against them because of this. While promoting the album on CNN on September 9, 2012, members of the band talked about its discontinued use of Confederate imagery. In September 2012, the band briefly did not display the Confederate flag, which had for years been a part of their stage show, because they did not want to be associated with racists that adopted the flag. However, after protests from fans, they reversed this decision, citing it as part of their Southern American heritage and states' rights symbolism. The band would later cease use of the Confederate flag starting with their 2019 tour.\nOriginal drummer Bob Burns died at age 64 on April 3, 2015; his car crashed into a tree while he was driving alone near his home in Cartersville, Georgia. From 2015 through 2017, the band had periods of being sidelined or having to cancel shows due to health problems suffered by founding member Gary Rossington.\nFormer member Ed King, who had been battling cancer, died in his Nashville, Tennessee, home on August 22, 2018, at 68 years of age.\nFarewell tour, upcoming fifteenth album and the death of Rossington (2018\u2013present).\nOn January 25, 2018, Lynyrd Skynyrd announced their Last of the Street Survivors Farewell Tour, which started on May 4, 2018. Supporting acts included Kid Rock, Hank Williams Jr., Bad Company, the Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, .38 Special, Cheap Trick, Blackberry Smoke, the Randy Bachman Band, Blackfoot, Massive Wagons, and Status Quo. Concerts were usually on Fridays and Saturdays. On January 8, 2020, Rossington stated in an interview that while they would no longer be touring, they will continue to play occasional live shows.\nOn March 19, 2019, Johnny Van Zant announced that the band intended to go into the studio to record one last album after completing the tour with several songs ready or \"in the can\". They appeared at the Kaaboo Texas festival on May 11, 2019.\nLynyrd Skynyrd was among hundreds of recording artists whose original master recordings were believed to have been destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Though it is not known with certainty which, if any, of the band's master recordings were lost in the blaze, Lynyrd Skynyrd was among the artists listed in an internal Universal Music Group document listing the artists whose master recordings the company believed had been lost and subsequently spent tens of millions of dollars trying to replace.\nRossington, the last founding member of the band, died on March 5, 2023, leaving no original members left alive. In April 2023, the band confirmed that they would continue as a band. There had previously been agreements about how many pre-crash members had to be in the band in order for it to be active and \"legal\", but this appears to be no longer applicable since Rossington's death.\nIn November 2023, Dolly Parton released a cover of \"Free Bird\" on her rock album Rockstar; this version also featured contributions from members of Lynyrd Skynyrd (including slide guitar from Rossington, recorded before his death), along with former drummer Artimus Pyle and his band, and even part of the late Ronnie van Zant's vocal track from the original recording of \"Free Bird\" (with the permission of Ronnie van Zant's widow). A similar version was featured on a Pyle-led tribute album of re-recorded collaborations with other musicians on Skynyrd songs, and Skynyrd also plans (as of 2023) to release their own similar version; however, according to Parton, only her version was allowed to use Ronnie van Zant's original vocal track.\nRecognition.\nHonors.\nIn 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked the group No.\u00a095 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".\nOn November 28, 2005, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced that Lynyrd Skynyrd would be inducted alongside Black Sabbath, Blondie, Miles Davis, and the Sex Pistols. They were inducted in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan on March 13, 2006, during the Hall's 21st annual induction ceremony. The inductees included Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, Ed King, Steve Gaines, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson, Bob Burns, and Artimus Pyle.\nBiopic.\nOn April 4, 2017, a biopic film project was announced. The film was later titled \"\" and released in June 2020.\nFilm.\nOn March 13, 2018, filmmaker Stephen Kijak premiered his documentary called, \"If I Leave Here Tomorrow\" at the Stateside Theater during the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. Kijak was joined on stage by Johnny Van Zant and Gary Rossington at the world premiere to speak to fans about the film.\nBand members.\nCurrent lineup\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a large portion of the latter were only created during the Middle Ages, often based on scholarly etiology, this is not to be confused with a list of the actual names the settlements bore during the classical era.\nBackground.\nUntil the Modern Era, Latin was the common language for scholarship and mapmaking. During the 19th and 20th centuries, German scholars in particular have made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or \"Ortsnamenkunde\". These studies have, in turn, contributed to the study of genealogy. For genealogists and historians of pre-Modern Europe, knowing alternate names of places is vital to extracting information from both public and private records. Even specialists in this field point out, however, that the information can be easily taken out of context, since there is a great deal of repetition of place names throughout Europe; reliance purely on apparent connections should therefore be tempered with valid historical methodology.\nCaveats and notes.\nLatin place names are not always exclusive to one place \u2014 for example, there were several Roman cities whose names began with \"Colonia\" and then a more descriptive term. During the Middle Ages, these were often shortened to just \"Colonia\".

Lodovico settled in Bologna, and he began his career as the servant of Gerolamo Cardano. He was extremely bright, so Cardano started teaching him mathematics. Ferrari aided Cardano on his solutions for quartic equations and cubic equations, and was mainly responsible for the solution of quartic equations that Cardano published. While still in his teens, Ferrari was able to obtain a prestigious teaching post in Rome after Cardano resigned from it and recommended him. Ferrari retired when young at 42 years old, and wealthy. He then moved back to his home town of Bologna where he lived with his widowed sister Maddalena to take up a professorship of mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1565. Shortly thereafter, he died of white arsenic poisoning, according to a legend, by his sister.\nCardano\u2013Tartaglia formula.\nIn 1545 a famous dispute erupted between Ferrari and Cardano's contemporary Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia, involving the solution to cubic equations.

The lymphatic system functions as a critical portion of the body's immune system and returns interstitial fluid to the bloodstream.\nLymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or parasitic infections, but it can also be seen in a number of genetic disorders. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection because the lymphatic system has been compromised.\nThough incurable and progressive, a number of treatments may improve symptoms. This commonly includes compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, and manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), which together are known as combined decongestive therapy. Diuretics are not useful.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe most common manifestation of lymphedema is soft tissue swelling (edema). As the disorder progresses, worsening edema and skin changes including discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, dermal thickening, and ulcers may be seen. Additionally, there is increased risk of infection of the skin, known as erysipelas.\nComplications.\nWhen lymphatic impairment becomes so great that the collected lymph fluid exceeds the lymphatic system's ability to transport it, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, reducing oxygen availability. This interferes with wound healing and provides a rich medium for bacterial growth which can result in skin infections, lymphangitis, lymphadenitis, and, in severe cases, skin ulcers. It is vital for lymphedema patients to be aware of the symptoms of infection and to seek immediate treatment, since recurrent infections or cellulitis, in addition to their inherent danger, further damage the lymphatic system and set up a vicious circle.\nIn rare cases, lymphedema may lead to a form of cancer called lymphangiosarcoma, although the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not understood. Lymphedema-associated lymphangiosarcoma is called Stewart\u2013Treves syndrome. Lymphangiosarcoma most frequently occurs in cases of long-standing lymphedema. The incidence of angiosarcoma five years after radical mastectomy is estimated to be 0.45% in surviving patients. Lymphedema is also associated with a low grade form of cancer called retiform hemangioendothelioma (a low grade angiosarcoma).\nLymphedema can be disfiguring, and may result in a poor body image and psychological distress. Complications of lymphedema can cause difficulties in activities of daily living.\nCauses and risk factors.\nLymphedema may be inherited (primary) or caused by injury to the lymphatic vessels (secondary). There are also risk factors that may increase one's risk of developing lymphedema such as old age, being overweight or obese, and having rheumatic or psoriatic arthritis.\nLymph node damage.\nLymphedema is most commonly seen after lymph node dissection, surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer, most notably breast cancer. In many patients the condition does not develop until months or even years after therapy has concluded. Lymphedema may also be associated with accidents or certain diseases or conditions that may inhibit the lymphatic system from functioning properly. It can also be caused by damage to the lymphatic system from infections such as cellulitis. In tropical areas of the world where parasitic filarial worms are endemic, a common cause of secondary lymphedema is filariasis.\nPrimary lymphedema may be congenital or may arise sporadically. Multiple syndromes are associated with primary lymphedema, including Turner syndrome, Milroy's disease, and Klippel\u2013Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome. In these syndromes it may occur as a result of absent or malformed lymph nodes or lymphatic channels. Lymphedema can be present at birth, develop at the onset of puberty (praecox), or not become apparent for many years into adulthood (tarda). In men, lower-limb primary lymphedema is most common, occurring in one or both legs. Some cases of lymphedema may be associated with other vascular abnormalities.\nSecondary lymphedema affects both men and women, and, in Western countries, is most commonly due to cancer treatment. In women, it is most prevalent in an upper limb after breast cancer surgery, especially axillary lymph node dissection, and occurs on the same side of the body as the surgery. Breast and trunk lymphedema can also occur but go unrecognised as there is swelling in the area after surgery, and its symptoms (peau d'orange and an inverted nipple) can be confused with post surgery fat necrosis. Between 38 and 89% of breast cancer patients have lymphedema due to axillary lymph node dissection or radiation. Unilateral lymphedema of a lower limb occurs in up to 41% of patients after gynecologic cancer. For men treated for prostate cancer, a 5-66% incidence has been reported, with the incidence rate depending on whether staging or radical removal of lymph glands was done in addition to radiotherapy.\nHead and neck lymphedema can be caused by surgery or radiation therapy for tongue or throat cancer. It may also occur in the lower limbs or groin after surgery for colon, ovarian or uterine cancer, if removal of lymph nodes or radiation therapy is required. Surgery or treatment for prostate, colon and testicular cancers may result in secondary lymphedema, particularly when lymph nodes have been removed or damaged.\nThe onset of secondary lymphedema in patients who have had cancer surgery has also been linked to aircraft flight (likely due to decreased cabin pressure or relative immobility). For cancer survivors wearing a prescribed and properly fitted compression garment may help decrease swelling during air travel.\nSome cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been associated with the use of tamoxifen, due to blood clots and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.\nAt birth.\nHereditary lymphedema is a primary lymphedema \u2013 swelling that results from abnormalities in the lymphatic system that are present from birth. Swelling may be present in a single limb, several limbs, genitalia, or the face. It is sometimes diagnosed prenatally by a nuchal scan or postnatally by lymphoscintigraphy.\nThe most common cause is Meige disease which usually presents at puberty. Another form of hereditary lymphedema is Milroy's disease, caused by mutations in the VEGFR3 gene. Hereditary lymphedema is frequently syndromic and is associated with Turner syndrome, lymphedema\u2013distichiasis syndrome, yellow nail syndrome, and Klippel\u2013Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome.\nOne defined genetic cause for hereditary lymphedema is GATA2 deficiency. This deficiency is a grouping of several disorders caused by a single defect: familial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental \"GATA2\" genes. These autosomal dominant mutations cause a reduction, i.e. a haploinsufficiency, in the cellular levels of the gene's product, GATA2. The GATA2 protein is a transcription factor critical for the development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lymphatic-forming, and other tissue-forming stem cells. Due to these mutations cellular levels of GATA2 are deficient and over time individuals develop hematological, immunological, lymphatic, and other disorders. GATA2 deficiency-induced defects in the lymphatic vessels and valves underlies the development of lymphedema, primarily in the lower extremities but may also occur in places such as the face or testes. This form of the deficiency, when coupled with sensorineural hearing loss, which may also be due to faulty development of the lymphatic system, is sometimes termed Emberger syndrome.\nPrimary lymphedema occurs in approximately one to three births out of every 10,000 births, with a female to male ratio of 3.5:1. In North America, the incidence of primary lymphedema is approximately 1.15 births out of every 100,000 births. Compared to secondary lymphedema, primary lymphedema is relatively rare.\nInflammatory lymphedema.\nBilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema (BLEIL) is a distinct type of lymphedema occurring in a setting of acute and prolonged standing, such as in new recruits during basic training. Possible underlying mechanisms may include venous congestion and inflammatory vasculitis.\nPhysiology.\nLymph is formed from the fluid that filters out of blood and contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. This fluid is collected by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended endothelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, later with complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force moving lymph within its vessel walls. The sympathetic nervous system regulates the frequency and power of the contractions. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.\nSeveral research groups have hypothesized that chronic inflammation is a key regulator in the development of lymphedema. Th cells, particularly Th2 differentiation, play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of lymphedema. Research has shown that increased expression of Th2-inducing cytokines in the epidermal cells of the lymphoedematous limb. Treatment with QBX258 has been found to decrease hyperkeratosis and fibrosis, reduce the number of CD4+ cells, and normalize the expression of Th2-inducing cytokines and IL13R by keratinocytes. These findings suggest that epidermal cells may initiate or coordinate chronic Th2 responses in lymphedema.\nRole of T-cell inflammation and Th2 response.\nLymphedema involves a complex interplay of inflammatory processes. Recent research has shed light on the role of T-cell inflammation and the Th2 immune response in the initiation of lymphedema.\nT-cell inflammation and fibrosis.\nStudies have revealed that sustained lymphatic stasis results in the infiltration of CD4+ T-cells, leading to inflammation and fibrosis within affected tissues.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis is generally based on signs and symptoms, with testing used to rule out other potential causes. An accurate diagnosis and staging may help with management. A swollen limb can result from different conditions that require different treatments. Diagnosis of lymphedema is currently based on history, physical exam, and limb measurements. Imaging studies such as lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green lymphography are only required when surgery is being considered. However, the ideal method of staging to guide treatment is controversial because of several different proposed protocols.\nLymphedema can occur in both the upper and lower extremities, and in some cases, the head and neck. Assessment of the extremities first begins with a visual inspection; color, presence of hair, visible veins, size and any sores or ulcerations are noted. Lack of hair may indicate an arterial circulation problem. In cases of swelling, the extremities' circumference is measured over time for reference. In early stages of lymphedema, elevating the limb may reduce or eliminate the swelling. Palpation of the wrist or ankle can determine the degree of swelling; assessment includes a check of the pulses. The axillary or inguinal lymph nodes may be enlarged due to the swelling. Enlargement of the nodes lasting more than three weeks may indicate infection or other illnesses (such as sequela from breast cancer surgery) requiring further medical attention.\nDiagnosis or early detection of lymphedema is difficult. The first signs may be subjective observations such as a feeling of heaviness in the affected extremity. These may be symptomatic of early-stage lymphedema where accumulation of lymph is mild and not detectable by changes in volume or circumference. As lymphedema progresses, definitive diagnosis is commonly based upon an objective measurement of differences between the affected or at-risk limb and the opposite unaffected limb, e.g. in volume or circumference. No generally accepted criterion is definitively diagnostic, although a volume difference of 200\u00a0ml between limbs or a difference (at a single measurement site or set intervals along the limb) is often used. Bioimpedance measurement (which measures the amount of fluid in a limb) offers greater sensitivity than other methods. Devices like SOZO utilize Bioimpedence Analysis (BIA) by sending a current through the body and measuring the resultant impedance. Another approach involves Tissue Dielectric Constant (TDC) measurement, used by devices such as Delfin Technology's MoistureMeterD and LymphScanner, which employ microwaves to detect changes in the dielectric properties of tissue. These innovative techniques have become integral to official protocols for lymphedema detection.\nChronic venous stasis changes can mimic early lymphedema, but are more often bilateral and symmetric. Lipedema can also mimic lymphedema, however lipedema characteristically spares the feet beginning abruptly at the malleolus (ankle). As a part of the initial work-up before diagnosing lymphedema, it may be necessary to exclude other potential causes of lower extremity swelling such as kidney failure, hypoalbuminemia, congestive heart-failure, protein-losing kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, pregnancy and drug-induced edema.\nClassification.\nThe International Society of Lymphology (ISL) Staging System is based solely on subjective symptoms, making it prone to substantial observer bias. Imaging modalities have been suggested as useful adjuncts to the ISL staging to clarify the diagnosis, such as Cheng's Lymphedema Grading tool, which assesses the severity of extremity lymphedema based on objective limb measurements and provides appropriate options for management.\nI. Grading.\nII. Staging.\nAs described by the Fifth WHO Expert Committee on Filariasis, and endorsed by the American Society of Lymphology, the staging system helps to identify the severity of lymphedema. With the assistance of medical imaging, such as MRI or CT, staging can be established by the physician, and therapeutic or medical interventions may be applied:\nGrades.\nLymphedema can also be categorized by its severity (usually compared to a healthy extremity):\nDifferential.\nLymphedema should not be confused with edema arising from chronic venous insufficiency, which is caused by compromise of venous drainage rather than lymphatic drainage. However, untreated venous insufficiency can progress into a combined venous/lymphatic disorder known as phlebetic lymphedema (or phlebolymphedema).\nTreatment.\nCurative Treatment\nCurative treatment for lymphedema is surgical and relies on supermicrosurgery, which involves performing a https:// from a healthy donor site to the diseased area.\nIn simpler cases, a lymphatic-venous shunt allows excess lymph to be drained into adjacent superficial veins.\nThese treatments are performed by surgeons specializing in microsurgery and result in improvement in 98% of cases.\nComplementary treatment may improve outcomes. This commonly include compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) and the use of an intermittent pneumatic compression pump, which together is known as combined decongestive therapy. MLD is most effective in mild to moderate disease. In breast cancer-related lymphedema, MLD is safe and may offer added benefit to compression bandages for reducing swelling. Most people with lymphedema can be medically managed with conservative treatment. Diuretics are not useful. Surgery is generally only used if symptoms are not improved by other measures.\nCompression.\nGarments.\nOnce a person is diagnosed with lymphedema, compression becomes imperative in the management of the condition. Garments are often intended to be worn all day but may be taken off for sleep, unless otherwise prescribed. Elastic compression garments are worn on the affected limb following complete de-congestive therapy to maintain edema reduction. Inelastic garments provide containment and reduction. Available styles, options, and prices vary widely. A professional garment fitter or certified lymphedema therapist can help determine the best option for the patient.\nBandaging.\nCompression bandaging, also called wrapping, is the application of layers of padding and short-stretch bandages to the involved areas. Short-stretch bandages are preferred over long-stretch bandages (such as those normally used to treat sprains), as the long-stretch bandages cannot produce the proper therapeutic tension necessary to safely reduce lymphedema and may produce a tourniquet effect. Compression bandages provide resistance that assists in pumping fluid out of the affected area during exercise. This counter-force results in increased lymphatic drainage and therefore a decrease in size of the swollen area.\nIntermittent pneumatic compression therapy.\nIntermittent pneumatic compression therapy (IPC) utilizes a multi-chambered pneumatic sleeve with overlapping cells to promote movement of lymph fluid. Pump therapy should only be used in addition to other treatments such as compression bandaging and manual lymph drainage. Pump therapy has been used in the past to help with controlling lymphedema. In some cases, pump therapy helps soften fibrotic tissue and therefore potentially enable more efficient lymphatic drainage. However, reports link pump therapy to increased incidence of edema proximal to the affected limb, such as genital edema arising after pump therapy in the lower limb. Current literature has suggested the use of IPC treatment in conjunction with an elastic therapeutic tape is more effective in the overall reduction of lymphedema as well as increasing shoulder range of motion than the traditional treatment of IPC paired with complete decongestive therapy. The tape is an elastic cotton strip with an acrylic adhesive that is commonly used to relieve the discomfort and disability associated with sports injuries, but in the context of lymphedema, this increases the space between the dermis and the muscle which increases the opportunity for lymphatic fluid to flow out naturally. The use of IPC treatments with tape, as well as subsequent lymphatic drainage, has proven to significantly reduce the circumference of lymphatic limbs in patients experiencing lymphedema secondary to breast cancer post-mastectomy.\nExercise.\nIn those with lymphedema or at risk of developing lymphedema, such as following breast cancer treatment, resistance training did not increase swelling and led to decreases in some, in addition to other potential beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. Moreover, resistance training and other forms of exercise were not associated with an increased risk of developing lymphedema in people who previously received breast cancer-related treatment. Compression garments should be worn during exercise.\nPhysical therapy for patients with lymphedema may include trigger point release, soft tissue massage, postural improvement, patient education on condition management, strengthening, and stretching exercises. Exercises may increase in intensity and difficulty over time, beginning with passive movements to increase range of motion and progressing towards using external weights and resistance in various postures.\nSurgery.\nThe treatment of lymphedema is usually conservative, however the use of surgery is proposed for some cases.\nSuction assisted lipectomy (SAL), also known as liposuction for lymphedema, may help improve chronic non pitting edema. The procedure removes fat and protein and is done alongside continued compression therapy.\nVascularized lymph node transfers (VLNT) and lymphovenous bypass are supported by tentative evidence as of 2017[ [update]] but are associated with a number of complications.\nLaser therapy.\nLow-level laser therapy (LLLT) was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of lymphedema in November 2006. According to the US National Cancer Institute, LLLT may be effective in reducing lymphedema in some women. Two cycles of laser treatment were found to reduce the volume of the affected arm in approximately one-third of people with post-mastectomy lymphedema at three months post-treatment.\nPharmaceuticals.\nA new therapeutic approach involving the drug QBX258 has shown promising results in the treatment of lymphedema. Although it did not reach statistical significance, QBX258 treatment modestly decreased periostin expression and the number of CD4+ and CD4+IL4+ cells in lymphoedematous skin. Notably, QBX258 significantly reduced the expression of Th2-inducing cytokines, improving physical and social quality-of-life measures for patients. However, psychological improvements were not observed.\nEpidemiology.\nLymphedema affects approximately 200 million people worldwide.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He allegedly invented printing simultaneously with Johannes Gutenberg and was regarded by some in the Netherlands well into the 20th century as having invented printing first.\nBiography.\n He was an important citizen of Haarlem and held the position of sexton (\"Koster\") of Sint-Bavokerk. He is mentioned in contemporary documents between 1417 and 1434 as a member of the great council, an assessor (scabinus), and as the city treasurer. He probably perished in the plague that visited Haarlem in 1439 and 1440; his widow is mentioned in the latter year.\nThere are no known works printed by Laurens.\nJunius story.\nHadrianus Junius, otherwise known as Adriaen de Jonghe, wrote this story around 1567 in his book \"Batavia\", published only in 1588, and was quoted by Cornelis de Bie. Now known primarily for his \"Emblemata\", Junius moved to Haarlem in 1550, and wrote several books, acting shortly as the rector of the Latin School there, as the city physician and as historiographer of the States of Holland (as of 1565/66). His story was echoed by his friend Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, who started a printing business in Haarlem in 1560. Later Samuel Ampzing (with the help of Petrus Scriverius) repeated the story in \"Lavre-Kranz Voor Lavrens Koster Van Haerlem, Eerste Vinder vande Boek-Druckerye\" (1628) with illustrations of the invention. According to Junius, sometime in the 1420s, Coster was in the Haarlemmerhout carving letters from bark for the amusement of his grandchildren, and observed that the letters left impressions on the sand. He proceeded to invent a new type of ink that did not run, and he began a printing company based on his invention with a primitive typesetting arrangement using moveable type. Since the Haarlemmerhout was burned during a siege by the Kennemers in 1426 during the Hook and Cod wars, this must have been early in the 1420s. Using wooden letters at first, he later used lead and tin movable type. His company prospered and grew. He is said to have printed several books including \"Speculum Humanae Salvationis\" with several assistants including the letter cutter Johann Fust, and it was this letter cutter Fust (often spelled \"Faust\") who, when Laurens was nearing death, broke his promise of secrecy and stole his presses and type and took them to Mainz where he started his own printing company.\nStory by Ulrich Zell.\nThere is support for the claim that Coster might be the inventor. In the anonymous \"K\u00f6lner Chronik\" of 1499, Ulrich Zell, a printing assistant from Cologne, who was then between the age of 60 and 69 years old, claimed that printing had started in Mainz. He based this statement on knowledge that Holland used to print Latin grammar texts (\"Donatus\"). Neither Coster nor Haarlem are mentioned in that chronicle. If true, this points to Johann Gutenberg about a decade after Coster's death. However, the first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, long after Gutenberg. Either way, Coster is somewhat of a Haarlem local \"hero\", and apart from a statue on the \"Grote Markt\" his name can be found in many places in the city.\nEarliest known Haarlem printer.\nBetween 1483 and 1486, Jacob Bellaert worked in Haarlem. His books were known for their artistic woodcuts. Haarlem, Gouda, and Delft were all cities with early printing presses. This was because these cities did not have powerful religious institutions or universities, where competing copyist production (\"scriptoria\") took place. Bellart did not enjoy much success, however, because there were few buyers for his books in the \"Nederduits\" language. Most people who could afford a book wanted it to be in French, since that was the common language of the ruling classes. Perhaps the strongest evidence in favor of Gutenberg is therefore that Mainz has in its possession today a first-edition of Erasmus' \" Lof der Zotheid\" (English translation: \"The Praise of Folly\"), which was written in Gouda, but printed in Mainz in 1511. The earliest printed book from the Netherlands that has been dated with any certainty is from 1473. It is in the possession of the Museum Meermanno-Westreenianum and was printed in Utrecht, not Haarlem.\n300th anniversary.\nIn 1740 Martin Holtzhey produced a medal to commemorate 300 years of printing and Coster's invention. At the top of the allegorical scene, the heraldic shields of 4 men can be seen in addition to the coat of arms of Haarlem. They were all mayors of Haarlem and their names were Anthony van Styrum (1679-1756), who also served in the admiralty of Amsterdam, Pieter van der Camer (1666-1747), who commissioned his own commemorative medal to celebrate 50 years in the service of the \"vroedschap\" of Haarlem in 1743, Jan van Dyck, and Cornelis Ascanius van Sypesteyn (1694-1744), who himself was a collector of medals and who lived at Brederode. This medal set a historical precedent in Haarlem for commemorative medals; Sypesteyn's son Cornelis Ascanius van Sypesteyn (1723-1788) later became the founding director of the learned society Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen and its offshoot, the \"Oeconomische Tak\", and he hired Holtzhey's son Johann Georg to commission prize medals for both societies.\n400th anniversary.\nIn 1823 Haarlem celebrated the 400th anniversary of Coster's invention with a monument in the Haarlemmerhout. The monument is decorated with Latin inscriptions and a memorial text in Dutch, with symbolic \"A\" decorations at the top. The celebration was organized by Abraham de Vries, a Coster fan who became Haarlem's first librarian in 1821 and who received a commission from the city fathers to acquire \"Costeriana\", or material relating to Coster's claim to fame. De Vries was supported by the professor and city council member David Jacob van Lennep, who believed the legend and sponsored De Vries by obtaining funds from the city council for the monument. In the period after the Flanders Campaign which led to the French occupation of the Netherlands from 1794 to 1815, Haarlem's economy was severely depressed and the city council sought a local hero. In 1817, Van Lennep (who was in the city council at the time) had also placed the monument De Naald (Heemstede) at his own home in nearby Heemstede.\nJoh. Ensched\u00e9.\nBehind the St. Bavochurch the printing factory of Joh. Ensched\u00e9 was located, which from 1737 to 1940 printed the Oprechte Haerlemsche Courant and from 1810 onwards became a mint that printed banknotes and later postage stamps. Just as it had been in Coornhert's time, supporting the Coster legend became a publicity stunt for one of Haarlem's most important businesses, and the Ensched\u00e9 company complied by offering tours of the printing presses, and even opened the Museum Ensched\u00e9 in 1904 on the Klokhuisplein (now the location of a memorial plaque). Today, \"Costeriana\" still can be viewed (by appointment) in the collections of the Haarlem Public Library, the Museum Ensched\u00e9, and the Teyler's Museum.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18724", "revid": "49823109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18724", "title": "Land Rover", "text": "Car marque and former British car company\nLand Rover is a brand of predominantly four-wheel drive, off-road capable vehicles, owned by British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), since 2008 a subsidiary of India based Tata Motors. JLR builds Land Rovers in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. The Land Rover name was created in 1948 by the Rover Company for a utilitarian 4WD off-road vehicle. Currently, the Land Rover range consists solely of upmarket and luxury sport utility vehicles.\nLand Rover was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951. In 2001, it received a Queen's Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade. Over time, Land Rover grew into its own brand, and for a while also a company, encompassing a consistently growing range of four-wheel drive, off-road capable models. Starting with the much more upmarket 1970 Range Rover, and subsequent introductions of the mid-range Discovery and entry-level Freelander line, in 1989 and 1997, as well as the 1990 Land Rover Defender refresh, the marque today includes two models of Discovery, four distinct models of Range Rover, and after a three-year hiatus, a second generation of Defenders have gone into production for the 2020 model year \u2013 in short or long wheelbase, as before.\nFor half a century, from the original 1948 model, to 1997, when the Freelander was introduced, Land Rovers and Range Rovers exclusively relied on their trademark boxed-section vehicle frames. Land Rover used boxed frames in a direct product bloodline until the termination of the original Defender in 2016. Their last body-on-frame model was replaced by a monocoque with the third generation Discovery in 2017. Since then, all Land Rovers and Range Rovers have a unified body and frame structure.\nSince 2010, Land Rover has introduced two-wheel drive variants, both of the Freelander, and of the Evoque, after having built exclusively 4WD cars for 62 years. The 2WD Freelander has been succeeded by a 2WD Discovery Sport, available in some markets.\nHistory.\nOriginally, these vehicles were simply called the 'Land Rover' \u2013 an off-road capable car model of the Rover Company. As 'Land Rover' became established as a brand, the 'Series' indication later became a retronym model name. The Range Rover was introduced in 1970, and the company became a British Leyland subsidiary in 1978. In 1983 and 1984, the long and the short wheelbase Land Rovers were given official names \u2013 the One Ten, and the Ninety respectively. Together they were badged the Defender models in 1990, after the 1989 introduction of the new Discovery model.\nRover era.\nThe design for the original vehicle was started in 1947 by Maurice Wilks. Wilks, chief designer at the Rover Company, on his farm in Newborough, Anglesey, worked in conjunction with his brother Spencer who was the managing director of Rover. The design may have been influenced by the Jeep and the prototype, later nicknamed Centre Steer, was built on a Jeep chassis and axles. The early choice of colour was dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early vehicles only came in various shades of light green. Starting with the series I Land Rover, all models in this era featured sturdy box-section ladder-frame chassis. Early vehicles like the Series I were field-tested at Long Bennington and designed to be field-serviced.\nAfter the formation of Land Rover Limited in 1978 the hyphen in Land-Rover \u2013 as shown in the logo \u2013 began to be dropped.\nLand Rover Ltd \u2013 subsidiary of BL.\nLand Rover as a company has existed since 1978. Prior to this, it was a product line of the Rover Company, which was absorbed into the Rover-Triumph division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BL) following Leyland Motor Corporation's takeover of Rover in 1967. The ongoing commercial success of the original Land Rover series models and the Range Rover in the 1970s, in the midst of BL's well-documented business troubles, prompted the establishment of a separate Land Rover company under the BL umbrella, remaining part of the subsequent Rover Group in 1988 under the ownership of British Aerospace, after British Leyland was broken up and privatised.\nBMW era.\nOn 31 January 1994, Rover Group plc, including Land Rover, was acquired by BMW. In 2000, Rover Group was broken up by BMW and Land Rover was sold on to Ford Motor Company, becoming part of its Premier Automotive Group. The transition to BMW ownership only just preceded the introduction of the second generation Range Rover, prior to launching Land Rover's first unibody model, the Freelander in 1997. BMW was then responsible for much of the development of the Range Rover III \u2013 the first to have a monocoque structure and independent suspension, introduced under Ford in late 2001.\nFord era.\nAfter the introduction of the all-new Range Rover in 2001, Ford moved Land Rover further away from its traditional boxed ladder-frames, by introducing a new generation Discovery featuring \"Integrated Body Frame\", in 2004. From then on, only the Defender continued on Land Rover's traditional since 1948 underpinnings. Use of the Rover V8 engine in Land Rovers also ended with the replacement of the mk. II Discovery.\nIn 2006 Ford also purchased the Rover brand from BMW for around \u00a36 million. BMW had retained ownership of the brand to protect the integrity of the Land Rover brand, with which 'Rover' might be confused in the US \u2013 market, and allowed it to be used under licence by MG Rover until it collapsed in 2005, at which point it was offered to the Ford Motor Company, who by then owned Land Rover. On 11 June 2007, Ford announced that it planned to sell Land Rover along with Jaguar Cars. Private equity firms such as Alchemy Partners of the UK, TPG Capital, Ripplewood Holdings, Cerberus Capital Management and One Equity Partners of the US, Tata Motors of India and a consortium comprising Mahindra &amp; Mahindra of India and Apollo Management all initially expressed interest in purchasing the marques from the Ford Motor Company. On 1 January 2008, Ford formally declared that Tata was the preferred bidder. On 26 March 2008, Ford announced that it had agreed to sell its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors, and that it expected to complete the sale by the end of the second quarter of 2008.\nTata Motors era.\nOn 18 January 2008, Tata Motors, a part of the Tata Group, established Jaguar Land Rover Limited as a British-registered and wholly owned subsidiary. The new company was to be used as a holding company for the acquisition of the two businesses from Ford \u2013 Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover. That acquisition was completed on 2 June 2008 at a cost of \u00a31.7\u00a0billion. Included in the deal to buy Land Rover and Jaguar Cars were the rights to three other British brands: the Daimler marque, as well as two dormant brands Lanchester and Rover.\nOn 1 January 2013, the group, which had been operating as two separate companies (Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover), although on an integrated basis, underwent a fundamental restructuring. The parent company was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC, Jaguar Cars Limited was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Limited and the assets (excluding certain Chinese interests) of Land Rover were transferred to it. The consequence was that Jaguar Land Rover Limited became responsible in the UK for the design, manufacture and marketing of both Jaguar and Land Rover branded products, and Land Rover and Jaguar Cars ceased to be separate vehicle producing entities.\nManufacturing.\nJaguar Land Rover manufactures Land Rover cars in plants in five countries. In the United Kingdom the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Velar are built at their Solihull plant near Birmingham and the Discovery Sport and Evoque are built at their Halewood plant near Liverpool. In October 2018 JLR opened a new plant in Nitra, Slovakia to build the Discovery, and are now also building the 2020 Defender there. In Brazil the company builds both the Discovery Sport and Evoque in their plant in Itatiaia which was opened in June 2016. JLR has been building cars since 2011 in Pune, India and currently builds the Discovery Sport and Evoque there. Under a 50/50 joint venture with Chery at Changshu in China Discovery Sports and Evoques are also built.\nHistorically Land Rovers were manufactured primarily at the Solihull plant until production of the Freelander was moved to the Halewood plant. The Freelander was also assembled in CKD form at Land Rover's facility in Pune, India. As of 2015, the company continued to expand by building locally in India as well as increasing the number of models made at JLR's Chikhali facility near Pune to include the Discovery Sport and Evoque.\nDefender models were assembled under licence in several locations worldwide, including Spain (Santana Motors), Iran (Pazhan Morattab), Brazil (Karmann), and Turkey (Otokar).\nGlobal sales.\nGlobal and regional unit sales.\nWorldwide sales of Land Rover tripled from model year 2008/'09 to 2014/'15 (from almost 130,000 to some 385,000 units), to peak at a further 10% higher in '15/'16 and '16/'17, and have since slid by some 100,000 (to 320,000 units) in 2018/'19. In spite of the facts, that Australia and New Zealand were important Land Rover markets in the 20th century, and sales in the Asia Pacific region have quadrupled from 2008/'09 to 2014/'15, Land Rover have stopped publishing sales of that region separately \u2013 instead including them in \"Rest of World\" starting 2015/'16.\nOverall, Europe is the firm's primary market, consistently yielding 40% to 50% of global units sold. Generally, half of that is down to the home (UK) market. Sales in the U.K. and the U.S. have generally kept equal pace, but since 2012 China has taken the lead as Land Rover's biggest single country market, except for 2018/'19.\nPer calendar year: \nPer model year: \nUnit sales by model.\nThe Discovery Sport is the most successful Land Rover model, selling 95,520 units globally in 2018. This was followed by another 'sports' model, the Range Rover Sport, at 77,847 units.\nThe Discovery Sport is the successor to the brands Freelander model, which was Europe's best selling \u2013 for five years in a row, after its market introduction in 1997.\nConcepts.\nRange Stormer \u2013 Land Rover's first concept vehicle, unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, later became the Range Rover Sport. (Gritzinger, 2004).\nLand Rover LRX \u2013 Land Rover's second concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show. Originally a vehicle with ERAD technology, the production version did not include this. The car was then launched in 2011 as the Range Rover Evoque, and was the first Range Rover branded product to be offered with front wheel drive, and no low ratio transfer box.\nLand Rover DC100 \u2013 Land Rover's third concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show, designed to be a replacement for the Land Rover Defender, though it is unlikely that the Defender's replacement will be exactly the same as the DC100 concept.\nLand Rover Discovery Vision Concept \u2013 Land Rover's fourth concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2014, was designed to be a replacement for the Land Rover Discovery, This concept features Transparent Bonnet, Suicide doors, and Laser assisted lamps (there is a very little chance this will be included in any future production vehicles).\nMilitary.\nModels developed for the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) include:\nModels developed for the Australian Army\nEngines.\nDuring the history of the Land Rover many different engines have been fitted:\nAs of August 2012[ [update]], most Land Rovers in production are powered by Ford engines. Under the terms of the acquisition, Tata has the right to buy engines from Ford until 2019.\nElectric vehicles.\nIntegrated Electric Rear Axle Drive (ERAD) technology, dubbed e-terrain technology, will allow the vehicle to move off without starting the engine as well as supplying extra power over tough terrain. Land Rover's Diesel ERAD Hybrid was developed as part of a multimillion-pound project supported by the UK Government's Energy Saving Trust, under the low carbon research and development programme. ERAD programme is one of a broad range of sustainability-focused engineering programmes that Land Rover is pursuing, brought together by the company under the collective name \"e TERRAIN Technologies\".\nLand Rover presented at the 2008 London Motor Show its new ERAD diesel\u2013electric hybrid in a pair of Freelander 2 (LR2) prototypes. The new hybrid system is being designed as a scalable and modular system that could be applied across a variety of Land Rover models and powertrains.\nLand Rover unveiled the LRX hybrid concept at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, for it to be going into production. An ERAD will enable the car to run on electric power at speeds below .\nIn September 2011, the Range Rover Evoque was launched, though it was based on the LRX hybrid concept presented at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, it did not include the ERAD system, included in the original concept.\nIn February 2013, Land Rover unveiled at the 83rd Geneva Motor Show an All-Terrain Electric Defender that produces zero emissions. The electric vehicle was developed for research purposes following successful trials of the Defender-based electric vehicle, Leopard 1. The vehicle is capable of producing 70kW and 330Nm of torque and has a range of 80 kilometres or in low speed off-road use it can last for up to eight hours before recharging.\nAbilities.\nPower take-off (PTO) was integral to the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was \"...to have power take-offs everywhere!\" The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: \"the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. \nThe PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing.\" PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up to the demise of the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.\nLand Rovers (the Series/Defender models) are available in a variety of body styles, from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a twelve-seat fully trimmed station wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, 'cherry picker' hydraulic platforms, ambulances, snowploughs, and six-wheel-drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.\nMilitary use.\nVarious Land Rover models have been used in a military capacity, most notably by the British Army and Australian Army. Modifications may include military \"blackout\" lights, heavy-duty suspension, uprated brakes, 24\u00a0volt electrics, convoy lights, electronic suppression of the ignition system, blackout curtains and mounts for special equipment and small arms. Dedicated military models have been produced such as the 101 Forward Control and the air-portable 1/2\u00a0ton Lightweight. Military uses include light utility vehicle; communications platform; weapon platform for recoilless rifles, Anti-tank (e.g. TOW or M40 recoilless rifle) / Surface-to-Air Guided Weapons or machine guns; ambulances and workshops. The Discovery has also been used in small numbers, mostly as liaison vehicles.\nTwo models that have been designed for military use from the ground up are the 101 Forward Control from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s. The latter was intended to be transported under a helicopter. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS) teams were early users in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and their convoys of Land Rovers and larger military trucks are a sight often seen in the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes. More recently, vehicles have been painted white, and are issued with fittings similar to civilian UK Mountain Rescue teams.\nAn adaptation of Land Rovers to military purposes is the \"Pink Panther\" models. Approximately 100 Series IIA models were adapted to reconnaissance use by British special operations forces the SAS. For desert use they were often painted pink, hence the name. The vehicles were fitted with among other gear a sun compass, machine guns, larger fuel tanks and smoke dischargers. Similar adaptations were later made to Series IIIs and 90/110/Defenders.\nThe Australian Army adapted the Land Rover Series 2 into the Long Range Patrol Vehicle for use by the Special Air Service Regiment and as an anti-tank \"gunbuggy\" fitted with an M40 recoilless rifle.\nThe 75th Ranger Regiment of the United States Army also adapted twelve versions of the Land Rover that were officially designated the Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.\nSeries and Defender models have also been armoured. The most widespread of these is the Shorts Shorland, built by Shorts Brothers of Belfast. The first of these were delivered in 1965 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force. They were originally wheelbase models with an armoured body and a turret from the Ferret armoured car. By 1990, there had been more than 1,000 produced.\nIn the 1970s, a more conventional armoured Land Rover was built for the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Wales called the Hotspur. The Land Rover Tangi was built by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's own vehicle engineering team during the 1990s. The British Army has used various armoured Land Rovers, first in Northern Ireland but also in more recent campaigns. They first added protective panels to Series General Service vehicles, the Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK). \nLater they procured the Glover Webb APV and finally the Courtaulds (later NP Aerospace) Composite Armoured Vehicle, commonly known as Snatch. These were originally based on heavy-duty V8 110 chassis but some have recently been re-mounted on new chassis from Otokar of Turkey and fitted with diesel engines and air-conditioning for Iraq. Although these now have more in common with the 'Wolf' (Defender XD) Land Rovers that many mistakenly confuse them with, the Snatch and the Wolf are different vehicles.\nThe most radical conversion of a Land Rover for military purposes was the Centaur half-track. It was based on a Series III with a V8 engine and a shortened belt drive from the Alvis Scorpion light tank. A small number was manufactured, and they were used by Ghana, among others.\nThe Land Rover is used by military forces throughout the world. The current generation of Land Rover used by British Army, the Snatch 2, have upgraded and strengthened chassis and suspension compared to civilian-specification vehicles. There is also the Land Rover WMIK (weapon mounted installation kit) used by British Army. The WMIK consists of a driver, a raised gun, usually a Browning heavy machine gun or a grenade machine gun, this used for ground support, and a GPMG (general-purpose machine gunner) located next to the driver, this used for vehicle protection.\nCompetitive use.\nHighly modified Land Rovers have competed in the Dakar Rally and won the Macmillan \u2013 UK Challenge almost every year, as well as having been the vehicle used for the Camel Trophy. Now, Land Rover has its own G4 challenge.\nDriver training.\nLand Rover Experience was established in 1990, and consists of a network of centres throughout the world, set up to help customers get the most out of their vehicles' on and off-road capability. The flagship centres are Land Rover's bases at Solihull, Eastnor, Gaydon and Halewood. Courses offered include off-road driving, winching and trailer handling, along with a variety of corporate and individual 'Adventure Days'. The factory centres at Solihull and Halewood have manufacturing tours, while Gaydon has an engineering tour.\nSafety.\nModel-by-model road accident statistics from the UK Department for Transport published in 2006 showed that the Land Rover Defender was one of the safest cars on British roads as measured by chance of death in two-car injury accidents. The figures, which were based on data collected by police forces following accidents between 2000 and 2004 in Great Britain, showed that Defender drivers had a 1% chance of being killed or seriously injured and a 33% chance of sustaining any kind of injury. Other four-wheel-drive vehicles scored equally highly, and collectively these vehicles were much safer for their passengers than those in other classes such as passenger cars and MPVs. These figures reflect the fact that drivers of large mass vehicles are likely to be safer, often at the expense of other drivers if they collide with smaller cars.\nClubs.\nThe original Land Rover Owners Club was set up by the Rover Company in 1954. The company published the \"Land Rover Owners Club Review\" magazine for members from 1957 to 1968 when the club became the Rover Owners Association. This original association fell away when the company merged with British Leyland.\nThere are many Land Rover clubs throughout the UK and internationally. Land Rover clubs break down into a number of groups of varying interests.\nSingle Marque Clubs \u2013 Bring together owners of a specific model or series of vehicle such as the Land Rover Series One Club, or the Discovery Owners Club. Single marque clubs have a global membership.\nSpecial Vehicle Clubs \u2013 At various times Land Rover have produced vehicles for specific events or on a specific theme, most notable are the Camel Trophy and G4 Challenge vehicles which have been sold on to the general public, and a range of Defenders that were loosely based on the custom vehicles produced for the Tomb Raider motion picture.\nRegional Clubs in the UK break down into two groups, competitive and non-competitive. The non-competitive clubs activities generally relate to social events, off-road driving or green laning on un-surfaced public highways or 'pay and play' days at off-road centres. Competitive clubs are a phenomenon almost exclusively found within the UK, who as well as the non-competitive activities detailed above run competitive events such as Tyro, Road Taxed Vehicle (RTV) and Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trials, winch and recovery challenges or speed events such as Competitive Safaries. All UK competitive events are run within the framework of rules created by the Motor Sports Association (MSA) with further vehicle specific rules applied by the host club or association. Outside of the UK regional clubs are independent and mostly non-competitive.\nA number of clubs are affiliated to the Association of Land Rover Clubs (ALRC); formerly known as the Association of Rover Clubs (ARC) the association applies its own vehicle regulations to all of its member clubs who have the opportunity to compete together at regional events and an annual national event with vehicles approved to the same standard. In recent years some non-competitive clubs have dropped their affiliation fifth ALRC. Few clubs outside of the UK are affiliated with ALRC. Other than ALRC and the short lived Association of North American Rover Clubs (ANARC), which was created 1998 to celebrate Land Rover's 50th anniversary and disbanded in 2001, other groups of Land Rover clubs have affiliated with each other.\nLand Rover owners were also early adopters of virtual clubs that are entirely based online. Bill Caloccia created the original Land Rover Owner email list (LRO) as single marque offshoot of the British Cars email list in May 1990. Bill later created email lists in the mid-1990s for Range Rovers (RRO) and various regions (e.g., UK-LRO, AU-LRO, ZA-LRO, EU-LRO, IT-LRO, NL-LRO). In California members of the LRO list created mendo_recce in 1995.\nIn 2005, under Ford ownership, Land Rover became more interested in the club environment. An internal club was formed, The Land Rover Club, exclusive to employees of Ford's Premier Automotive Group (Now exclusive to the new 'Jaguar \u2013 Land Rover' group since the brand moved away from the Ford stable). Also, an agreement was generated to allow other clubs to use the Land Rover green oval logo under licence. In 2006, the Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire club were the pilot licensees for the new agreement, who now benefit from a reciprocal arrangement where their own logo is trade marked and owned by Land Rover and they can refer to themselves as a 'Land Rover Approved Club'.\nBrand extensions.\nBicycles.\nIn 1995, Land Rover endorsed the production of a hand-made bicycle using its logo. The bicycle, called the Land Rover APB and manufactured by Pashley Cycles of Stratford-upon-Avon, was the collapsible version of Pashley Cycles' Moulton APB (All Purpose Bicycle) model, with leading link front suspension and adjustable damping and stroke. Two more models immediately followed: the Land Rover XCB V-20, aimed primarily at younger riders (children); and the Land Rover XCB D-26, also available as the M26 with hydraulic rim brakes, front suspension and suspension seat pillar.\nIn June 2004, Land Rover released a comprehensive 25 model range of bicycles. The three main ranges are the \"Defender\", the \"Discovery\", and the \"Freelander\", each with different attributes. The \"Discovery\" is an all-rounder bicycle suited to a variety of terrains, \"Defender\" is most suited to rugged terrain and off-road pursuits, whereas the \"Freelander\" is designed for an urban lifestyle. All bikes are made from lightweight aluminium.\nIn 2010 the range was relaunched in conjunction with British manufacturer 2x2.\nCoffee.\nLand Rover has had its name associated with coffee since 2005, when the Land Rover Coffee company was established.\nPushchairs.\nLand Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence to produce a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design reflected the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nstyle=\"width:100%\" class=\"wraplinks\""}

The law takes the form\nformula_1\nWhere the square brackets denote concentration, and \"c\"0 is the total concentration of electrolyte.\nUsing formula_2, where formula_3 is the molar conductivity at concentration c and formula_4 is the limiting value of molar conductivity extrapolated to zero concentration or infinite dilution, this results in the following relation:\nformula_5\nDerivation.\nConsider a binary electrolyte AB which dissociates reversibly into A+ and B\u2212 ions. Ostwald noted that the law of mass action can be applied to such systems as dissociating electrolytes. The equilibrium state is represented by the equation:\n&lt;chem&gt;AB &lt;=&gt; {A+} + B^-&lt;/chem&gt;\nIf \"\u03b1\" is the fraction of dissociated electrolyte, then \"\u03b1c0\" is the concentration of each ionic species.

The concentration of any one ionic species is given by the root of the product of the dissociation constant and the concentration of the electrolyte.\nformula_9\nLimitations.\nThe Ostwald law of dilution provides a satisfactory description of the concentration dependence of the conductivity of weak electrolytes like CH3COOH and NH4OH. The variation of molar conductivity is essentially due to the incomplete dissociation of weak electrolytes into ions. \nFor strong electrolytes, however, Lewis and Randall recognized that the law fails badly since the supposed equilibrium constant is actually far from constant. This is because the dissociation of strong electrolytes into ions is essentially complete below a concentration threshold value. The decrease in molar conductivity as a function of concentration is actually due to attraction between ions of opposite charge as expressed in the Debye-H\u00fcckel-Onsager equation and later revisions.\nEven for weak electrolytes the equation is not exact. Chemical thermodynamics shows that the true equilibrium constant is a ratio of thermodynamic activities, and that each concentration must be multiplied by an activity coefficient. This correction is important for ionic solutions due to the strong forces between ionic charges. An estimate of their values is given by the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel theory at low concentrations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18729", "revid": "10810150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18729", "title": "Lleida", "text": "Lleida (, , ; ; \"see below\") is a city in the west of Catalonia, Spain. It is the capital and largest town in Segri\u00e0 county, the Ponent region and the province of Lleida. Geographically, it is located in the Catalan Central Depression. It had 140,797 inhabitants as of 2022[ [update]].\nLleida is one of the oldest towns in Catalonia, with recorded settlements dating back to the Bronze Age period. Until the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the area served as a settlement for an Iberian people, the Ilergetes. The town became a municipality, named Ilerda, under the reign of Augustus. It was ruled by Muslims from the 8th century until reconquered in 1149. In 1297, the University of Lleida was founded, becoming the third oldest in the whole of Spain. During the following centuries, the town was damaged by several wars such as the Reapers' War in the 17th century and the Spanish Civil War in the 20th century. Since then, the city has been in constant urban, commercial and demographic growth.\nName.\nAlthough the usual Spanish form of the town's name is , pronounced , the associations of that name with enforced Castilianization under the Francoist regime have led to the Catalan form being used for official purposes even in Spanish. The local pronunciation of the name is , while the pronunciation in Western Catalan is and in Central Catalan is .\nHistory.\nIn ancient times the city, named \"Iltrida\" and \"Ilerda\", was the chief city of the Ilergetes, an Iberian tribe. Ind\u00edbil, king of the Ilergetes, and Mandoni, king of the Ausetanes, defended it against the Carthaginian and Roman invasions.\nUnder the Romans the city was incorporated into the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis, and was a place of considerable importance, historically as well as geographically. It stood upon an eminence, on the right (west) bank of the river Sicoris (the modern Segre), the principal tributary of the Ebre, and some distance above its confluence with the Cinga (modern Cinca); thus commanding the country between those rivers, as well as the great road from Tarraco (modern Tarragona), the provincial capital, to the northwest of Spain, which here crossed the Sicoris.\nIts situation induced the legates of Pompey in Spain to make it the key of their defense against Caesar, in the first year of the Civil War (49 BC). Afranius and Marcus Petreius threw themselves into the place with five legions; and their siege by Caesar himself (Battle of Ilerda), as narrated in his own words, forms one of the most interesting passages of military history. Caesar's skill as a general, in a contest where the formation of the district and a series of natural events seemed very favorable to his enemies, ultimately gained him victory. It was ended by the capitulation of Afranius and Petreius. In consequence of the battle, the Latin phrase \"Ilerdam videas\" is said to have been used by people who wanted to cast bad luck on someone else.\nUnder the Roman Empire Ilerda was a prosperous city and a \"municipium\". It minted its own coins. It had a fine stone bridge over the Sicoris, which was so sturdy that its foundations support a bridge to this day. In the time of Ausonius the city had fallen into decay but it rose again into importance in the Middle Ages.\nIt was part of Visigothic and Muslim Hispania until it was conquered from the Moors by Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona in 1149.\nIt used to be the seat of a major university, the oldest in the Crown of Aragon, until 1717, when it was moved by Philip V to the nearby town of Cervera. The University of Lleida is nowadays active again since 1991.\nDuring the Reapers' War Lleida was occupied by the French and rebel forces. In 1644 the city was conquered by the Spanish under Felipe da Silva.\nLleida served as a key defence point for Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and fell to the Insurgents, whose air forces bombed it extensively in 1937 and 1938. The 2 November 1937 Condor Legion attacks against Lleida became especially infamous since they targeted the school known as \"Liceu Escolar de Lleida\". 48 children and several teachers died in it that day, 300 people were killed in the 2 November bombings altogether and the town would be bombed and besieged again in 1938, when it was conquered by Francisco Franco's forces.\nAfter some decades without any kind of population growth it experienced a massive influx of Andalusians, who helped the town undergo a relative demographic growth. Nowadays it is home to immigrants of 146 different nationalities.\nLleida was the Capital of Catalan Culture in 2007.\nJewish History.\nThe \"Juderia\", or Jewish quarter in Lleida dates back to the 11th century. The Jewish quarter in Lleida was also referred to as La Cuirassa. This name distinction is unique compared to other Jewish communities in Spain, and historians believe that the origin of the term is linked to the former Jewish quarter that existed in the times of the Moors, which was connected to the \"coira\u00e7a\", a protrusion of the city wall. The Jews established their quarter next to this wall, leading to the name \"La Cuirassa.\" A street named \"Juder\u00eda\", which still exists in today's Lleida dates back to the time where the Jewish quarter was still active. The Jewish quarter was located in the fortified area of Lleida; in this area, a ring with the name \"Goig\" carved in Hebrew was found in 1870. A Jewish ritual bath, or mikveh dating to the 9th century, one of the oldest in Europe, was found in Lleida.\nClimate.\nLleida has a temperate semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"). Winters are mild and foggy though cooler than places on the coast while summers are hot and dry. Frosts are common during winter although snowfall can occasionally fall, averaging 1 or 2 days. Precipitation is low, with an annual average of with a peak in April and May and another peak in September and October. \nDistricts and neighbourhoods.\nLleida is divided in the following districts by the Socioeconomic Observatory of Lleida:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransport.\nRailway.\nLleida is served by Renfe's Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line, serving Barcelona, Zaragoza, Calatayud, Guadalajara, and Madrid. Lleida has a new airport opened in January 2010, and a minor airfield located in Alf\u00e8s. Also, the town is the western terminus of the Eix Transversal Lleida-Girona, and a railway covering the same distance (\"Eix Transversal Ferroviari\") is currently under planning.\nLleida's only passenger railway station is Lleida Pirineus. It is served by both Renfe and Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya train lines. In the future a Rodalies Lleida commuter network will connect the town with its adjacent area and the main towns of its province, improving the existing network with more train frequency and newly built infrastructure. A second railway station is Pla de la Vilanoveta in an industrial area, and only used by freight trains. A future railway museum will be located in its facilities. Since 2008 the bulk of public transport of Lleida's surrounding area, mainly buses operated by several companies, is managed by Autoritat Territorial de la Mobilitat de l'\u00c0rea de Lleida.\nBus.\nThe urban buses, coloured yellow with blue stripes and owned by \"Autobusos de Lleida\", include the following lines:\nIn addition to these, there's a tourist bus and a regular night service to nearby clubs.\nAirport.\nLleida is served by Lleida-Alguaire airport which opened in 2010. The airport provides direct routes to the Balearic Islands which are operated by Iberia. The nearest major airport is Josep Tarradellas Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport which provides most domestic and international destinations, it is located south east of Lleida.\nFuture and planned services.\nA tram-train system is pending approval. Using an existing but outdated passenger line, it would link Balaguer and Lleida, crossing both towns in a much needed move towards better public transportation, both inner-city and between localities.\nLanguages.\nLleida is a traditionally Catalan-speaking city, with a characteristic dialect (known as Western or, more specifically, Northwestern Catalan, or colloquially \"lleidat\u00e0\"). Most of the population is actively bilingual in Spanish.\nCulture.\nLleida was the Capital of Catalan Culture in 2007.\nTheatre and music venues.\nEnric Granados Auditorium is the city's concert hall and main music institution and conservatory. It is named after the composer Enric Granados, who was born in the city. CaixaForum Lleida (formerly known as \"Centre Cultural de la Fundaci\u00f3 La Caixa\") includes a concert hall. Teatre Municipal de l'Escorxador is the town's main theatre; it includes a concert venue, Caf\u00e8 del Teatre. A theatre and congress centre, La Llotja de Lleida, opened in 2010.\nMusic festivals.\nThere are two important music festivals in Lleida; M\u00daSIQUES DISPERSES Folk Festival in March, and the jazz festival JAZZ TARDOR in November. Concerts are also a regular fixture of the two local feasts, Sant Anastasi in May, and Sant Miquel in September.\nFilm.\nCaixaForum Lleida is the usual venue for film-related events and screenings. A Latin-American film festival is held yearly in the town (\"Mostra de Cinema Llatinoameric\u00e0 de Lleida\"), and an animation film festival called \"Animac\" is held every May.\nArt and museums.\nThe Lleida Museum opened in 2008 and displays historical artefacts and works of art from various periods. The Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs, a historically relevant building, exhibits both ancient and contemporary art. The Centre d'Art La Panera is a contemporary art institution. The Museu d'Art Jaume Morera displays art from the 20th and 21st centuries (as well as artwork by its namesake).\nThe city has a number of small municipal galleries, such as the Sala Municipal d'Exposicions de Sant Joan and the Sala Manel Garcia Sarramona. There are also several institutions dedicated to local artists, such as the Sala Leandre Crist\u00f2fol, containing artwork by the sculptor and painter Leandre Crist\u00f2fol (1908\u20131998); and the Sala Coma Estadella, dedicated to the sculptor and painter Albert Coma Estadella (1933\u20131991).\nPrivate art galleries include the Espai Cavallers.

Traditionally the capital of the province of Maine, it is now the capital of the Sarthe department and the seat of the Roman Catholic diocese of Le Mans. Le Mans is a part of the Pays de la Loire region.\nIts inhabitants are called \"Manceaux\" (male) and \"Mancelles\" (female). Since 1923, the city has hosted the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active endurance sports car race. The event is among the most attended and prestigious motor sports events in the world.\nHistory.\nFirst mentioned by Claudius Ptolemy, the Roman city \"Vindinium\" was the capital of the Aulerci, a sub tribe of the Aedui. Le Mans is also known as \"Civitas Cenomanorum\" (City of the Cenomani), or \"Cenomanus\". Their city, seized by the Romans in 47 BC, was within the ancient Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis. A 3rd-century amphitheatre is still visible. The \"thermae\" were demolished during the crisis of the third century when workers were mobilized to build the city's defensive walls. The ancient wall around Le Mans is one of the most complete circuits of Gallo-Roman city walls to survive.\nAs the use of the French language replaced late Vulgar Latin in the area, \"Cenomanus\", with dissimilation, became known as \"Celmins.\" \"Cel-\" was taken to be a form of the French word for \"this\" and \"that\", and was replaced by \"le\", which means \"the\".\nAs the principal city of Maine, Le Mans was the stage for struggles in the eleventh century between the counts of Anjou and the dukes of Normandy. When the Normans had control of Maine, William the Conqueror successfully invaded England and established an occupation. In 1069 the citizens of Maine revolted and expelled the Normans, resulting in Hugh V being proclaimed count of Maine. Geoffrey V of Anjou married Matilda of England in the cathedral. Their son Henry II Plantagenet, king of England, was born in the town.\nIn the 13th century Le Mans came under the control of the French crown. It was subsequently invaded by England during the Hundred Years' War.\nIndustrialization took place in the 19th century which saw the development of railway and motor vehicle production as well as textiles and tobacco manufacture.\nWilbur Wright began official public demonstrations of the airplane he had developed with his younger brother Orville on 8 August 1908, at the Hunaudi\u00e8res horse racing track near Le Mans.\nWorld War II.\nJust outside Le Mans city centre there used to be an airfield, built to protect the Renault factory.\nSoon after Le Mans was liberated by the U.S. 79th and 90th Infantry Divisions on 8 August 1944, engineers of the Ninth Air Force Engineering Command began construction of a combat Advanced Landing Ground on a location the Germans had used a simple airfield. The airfield was declared operational on 3 September and designated as \"A-35\". It was used by several American fighter and transport units in additional offensives across France; the airfield was closed in November 1944.\nClimate.\nLe Mans has a temperate oceanic climate (\"Cfb\") influenced by the mild Atlantic air travelling inland. Summers are warm and occasionally hot, whereas winters are mild and cloudy. Precipitation is relatively uniform and moderate year round.\nDemographics.\nAs of 2018[ [update]], there were 367,082 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (\"aire d'attraction\") of Le Mans, with 143,252 of these living in the city proper (commune). In 1855 Le Mans absorbed four neighbouring communes. The population data for 1851 and earlier in the table and graph below refer to the pre-1855 borders.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransportation.\nThe Gare du Mans is the main railway station of Le Mans. It takes 1 hour to reach Paris from Le Mans by TGV high speed train. There are also TGV connections to Lille, Marseille, Nantes, Rennes and Brest. Gare du Mans is also a hub for regional trains. Le Mans inaugurated a new light rail system on 17 November 2007.\nSport.\nMotorsport.\nThe first French Grand Prix took place on a 64-mile (103\u00a0km) circuit based at Le Mans in 1906.\nSince the 1920s, the city has been best known for its connection with motorsports. There are two official and separate racing tracks at Le Mans, though they share certain portions. The smaller is the Bugatti Circuit (named after Ettore Bugatti, founder of the car company bearing his name), a relatively short permanent circuit, which is used for racing throughout the year and regularly hosts the French motorcycle Grand Prix. The longer and more famous Circuit de la Sarthe is composed partly of public roads. These are closed to the public when the track is in use for racing. Since 1923, this route has been used for the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race. Boutiques and shops are set up during the race, selling merchandise and promoting products for cars.\nThe \"Le Mans start\" was formerly used in the 24-hour race: drivers lined up across the track from their cars, ran across the track, jumped into their cars and started them to begin the race.\nThe 1955 Le Mans disaster was a large accident during the race that killed eighty-four spectators.\nBasketball.\nThe city is home to Le Mans Sarthe Basket, 2006 Champion of the LNB Pro A, France's top professional basketball division.\nThe team plays its home games at the Antar\u00e8s, which served as one of the host arenas of the FIBA EuroBasket 1999.\nNotable people.\nLe Mans was the birthplace of:\nNotable residents include:\nDied in Le Mans:\nInternational relations.\nLe Mans is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGastronomy.\nThe culinary specialty of Le Mans is \"rillettes\", a shredded pork p\u00e2t\u00e9.\nLandmarks.\nLocated at Mayet near Le Mans, the Le Mans-Mayet transmitter has a height of 342\u00a0m and is one of the tallest radio masts in France.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "18733", "revid": "50639432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18733", "title": "Lois McMaster Bujold", "text": "American speculative fiction author (born 1949)\nLois McMaster Bujold ( ; born November 2, 1949) is an American speculative fiction writer. She has won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, matching Robert A. Heinlein's record (not counting his Retro Hugos). Her novella \"The Mountains of Mourning\" won both the Hugo Award and Nebula Award. In the fantasy genre, \"The Curse of Chalion\" won the Mythopoeic Award for Adult Literature and was nominated for the 2002 World Fantasy Award for best novel, and both her fourth Hugo Award and second Nebula Award were for \"Paladin of Souls\". In 2011 she was awarded the Skylark Award. She has won two Hugo Awards for Best Series, in 2017 for the Vorkosigan Saga and in 2018 for the World of the Five Gods. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association named her its 36th SFWA Grand Master in 2019.\nThe bulk of Bujold's works comprises three series: the Vorkosigan Saga, the World of the Five Gods, and the Sharing Knife series.\nBiography.\nBujold is the daughter of Robert Charles McMaster and attributes her early interest in science fiction, as well as certain aspects of the Vorkosigan Saga, to his influence. He was editor of the \"Nondestructive Testing Handbook\".\nBujold writes that her experience growing up with a famous father is reflected in the same experience that her characters (Miles, Fiametta) have of growing up in the shadow of a \"Great Man\". Having observed this tendency in both genders, she wonders why it is always called \"great man's son syndrome\", and never \"great man's daughter's syndrome.\" Her brother, an engineer like their father, helped provide technical details to support her writing of \"Falling Free\".\nShe has stated that she was always a \"voracious reader\". She started reading adult science fiction at the age of nine, picking up the habit from her father. She became a member of science fiction fandom, joined the Central Ohio Science Fiction Society, and co-published \"StarDate\", a science fiction fanzine in which a story of hers appeared under the byline Lois McMaster. Her reading tastes later expanded and she stated she now reads \"history, mysteries, romance, travel, war, poetry, etc\".\nShe attended Ohio State University from 1968 to 1972. While she was interested in writing, she didn't pursue an English major, feeling it was too concerned with literary criticism instead of literary creation.\nShe married John Fredric Bujold in 1971, but they divorced in the early 1990s. The marriage produced two children, a daughter named Anne (born 1979) and a son named Paul (born 1981). Anne Bujold is currently (January 2020) Artist-In-Residence for the Metals Department at the Appalachian Center for Craft, a campus of Tennessee Tech; formerly she was a metal artist and welder in Portland, Oregon and vice president of the Northwest Blacksmith Association. Bujold currently lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nInspiration.\nBujold had been friends with Lillian Stewart Carl since high school, where they \"collaborated on extended story lines [but where] only a fragment of the total was written out.\". At one point, she even co-produced a \"Star Trek\" zine called \"StarDate\" which she wrote for. In college, she wrote a Sherlock Holmes mystery as well. However, she stopped writing after that, being busy with marriage, family, and a career in hospital patient care.\nIt wasn't until her thirties that she returned to writing. Bujold has credited her friend Lillian Stewart Carl's first book sales with inspiring her to return to the field: \"it occurred to me that if she could do it, I could do it too.\" She originally planned to write as a hobby again, but discovered the amount of work required was too much for anything other than a profession, so she decided to turn professional. With support from Carl and Patricia Wrede, she was able to complete her first novel.\nScience fiction.\nLois Bujold wrote three books (\"Shards of Honor\", \"The Warrior's Apprentice\" and \"Ethan of Athos\") before \"The Warrior's Apprentice\" was finally accepted, after four rejections. \"The Warrior's Apprentice\" was the first book purchased, though not the first Vorkosigan book written, nor would it be the first one to be published. On the strength of \"The Warrior's Apprentice\", Baen Books agreed to a three-book deal to include the two bracketing novels. By 2010, Baen Books claimed to have sold two million copies of Bujold's books.\nBujold is best known for her Vorkosigan Saga, a series of novels featuring Miles Vorkosigan, a physically impaired interstellar spy and mercenary admiral from the planet Barrayar, set approximately 1000 years in the future. The series also includes prequels starring Miles' parents, along with companion novels centered on secondary characters. Earlier titles are generally firmly in the space opera tradition with no shortage of battles, conspiracies, and wild twists, while in more recent volumes, Miles becomes more of a detective. In \"A Civil Campaign\", Bujold explores yet another genre: a high-society romance with a plot that pays tribute to Regency romance novelist Georgette Heyer (as acknowledged in the dedication). It centers on a catastrophic dinner party, with misunderstandings and dialogue justifying the subtitle \"A Comedy of Biology and Manners\".\nThe author has stated that the series structure is modeled after the Horatio Hornblower books, documenting the life of a single person. In themes and echoes, they also reflect Dorothy L. Sayers' mystery character Lord Peter Wimsey. Bujold has also said that part of the challenge of writing a series is that many readers will encounter the stories in \"utterly random order\", so she must provide sufficient background in each of them without being excessively repetitious. Most recent printings of her Vorkosigan tales do include an appendix at the end of each book, summarizing the internal chronology of the series.\nBujold has discussed her own views on the optimum reading order for the Vorkosigan series in her blog.\nFantasy.\nBujold also wanted to break into the fantasy genre, but met with early setbacks. Her first foray into fantasy was \"The Spirit Ring\". She wrote the book \"on spec\", shopped it around, and found low offers, sending her back to Baen Books, where Jim Baen bought it for a fair price in exchange for the promise of more Vorkosigan books. Bujold called this experience very educational; the book received little critical acclaim, and had only mediocre sales.\nShe did not attempt to break into the fantasy market again for almost another decade, with \"The Curse of Chalion\". This book was also written on spec and offered to a book auction. This time she met with considerable critical and commercial success by tapping into a crossover market of fantasy and romance genre fans. The fantasy world of Chalion was first conceived as a result of a University of Minnesota course she was taking about medieval Spain in her spare time. She would eventually expand the setting into the \"World of the Five Gods\" series, including \"Paladin of Souls\", \"The Hallowed Hunt\", and the fifteen novels, novellas, and short stories of the Penric and Desdemona series.\nThe next fantasy world she created was the tetralogy set in the universe of \"The Sharing Knife\", borrowing inspiration for its landscapes and for the dialect of the \"farmers\" from ones she grew up with in central Ohio. She writes that her first readers who helped proofread it said she got it exactly right and they could recognize Ohio features in the descriptions and dialects.\nRelation to fan fiction.\nBujold has generally been supportive of fan fiction written about her characters and universe. Amy H. Sturgis, in her essay \"From Both Sides Now: Bujold and the Fan Fiction Phenomenon\", notes that this is unusual for writers of Bujold's generation, most of whom are opposed to fan fiction. Sturgis relates this to Bujold's own production of \"Star Trek\" and Sherlock Holmes fan fiction early in her life, which Sturgis saw as an apprenticeship for her professional writing career.\nBujold herself ties her appreciation of fan fiction to her appreciation of \"active\" readers. To her, good readers are the \"unsung collaborators\" who make the story work, by actually constructing the world and characters in their heads. Books, to her, don't actually exist until they enter the reader's head and grow there. And sometimes, the characters and stories in a book grow so much that they escape the writer's original confines and become fan fiction. To Bujold, great literature is never \"sterile\", stopping with only what the original author wrote. She further believes that fan fiction gives authors a unique chance to see into the minds of those \"invisible collaborators\", the readers.\nDespite this, she no longer reads fan fiction about her own characters due to legal and financial concerns, \"fascinating as [she] finds it\".\nAwards and nominations.\nBujold has also received the following accolades:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lycopene (from the Neo-Latin \"Lycopersicon\", the name of a former tomato genus) is a bright red carotenoid hydrocarbon found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables.\nOccurrence.\nAside from tomatoes or tomato products like ketchup, it is found in watermelons, grapefruits, red guavas, and baked beans. It has no vitamin A activity.\nIn plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms, lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, which is responsible for yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection. \nLike all carotenoids, lycopene is a tetraterpene. It is soluble in fat, but insoluble in water. Eleven conjugated double bonds give lycopene its deep red color.\nOwing to the strong color, lycopene is used as a food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for use in the US, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d), and the European Union (E160d).\nStructure and physical properties.\nLycopene is a symmetrical tetraterpene because it consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen and is derived from eight isoprene subunits. Isolation procedures for lycopene were first reported in 1910, and the structure of the molecule was determined by 1931. In its natural, all-\"trans\" form, the molecule is long and somewhat flat, constrained by its system of 11 conjugated double bonds. The extended conjugation is responsible for its deep red color.\nPlants and photosynthetic bacteria produce all-\"trans\" lycopene. When exposed to light or heat, lycopene can undergo isomerization to any of a number of \"cis\"-isomers, which have a less linear shape. Isomers distinct stabilities, with highest stability: 5-cis \u2265 all-trans \u2265 9-cis \u2265 13-cis &gt; 15-cis &gt; 7-cis &gt; 11-cis: lowest. In human blood, various \"cis\"-isomers constitute more than 60% of the total lycopene concentration, but the biological effects of individual isomers have not been investigated.\nCarotenoids like lycopene are found in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes in plants, photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, and algae. They are responsible for the bright orange\u2013red colors of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis, and protect photosynthetic organisms from excessive light damage. Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, and xanthophylls.\nDispersed lycopene molecules can be encapsulated into carbon nanotubes enhancing their optical properties. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube\u2014light is absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the nanotube. Encapsulation increases chemical and thermal stability of lycopene molecules; it also allows their isolation and individual characterization.\nBiosynthesis.\nThe unconditioned biosynthesis of lycopene in eukaryotic plants and in prokaryotic cyanobacteria is similar, as are the enzymes involved. Synthesis begins with mevalonic acid, which is converted into dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. This is then condensed with three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an isomer of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate), to give the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Two molecules of this product are then condensed in a tail-to-tail configuration to give the 40-carbon phytoene, the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis. Through several desaturation steps, phytoene is converted into lycopene. The two terminal isoprene groups of lycopene can be cyclized to produce beta-carotene, which can then be transformed into a wide variety of xanthophylls.\nDiet.\nConsumption by humans.\nAbsorption of lycopene requires that it be combined with bile salts and fat to form micelles. Intestinal absorption of lycopene is enhanced by the presence of fat and by cooking. Lycopene dietary supplements (in oil) may be more efficiently absorbed than lycopene from food.\nLycopene is not an essential nutrient for humans, but is commonly found in the diet mainly from dishes prepared from tomatoes. The median and 99th percentile of dietary lycopene intake have been estimated to be 5.2 and 123\u00a0mg/d, respectively.\nSources.\nFruits and vegetables that are high in lycopene include autumn olive, gac, tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, pink guava, papaya, seabuckthorn, wolfberry (goji, a berry relative of tomato), and rosehip. Ketchup is a common dietary source of lycopene. Although gac (\"Momordica cochinchinensis\" Spreng) has the highest content of lycopene of any known fruit or vegetable (multiple times more than tomatoes), tomatoes and tomato-based sauces, juices, and ketchup account for more than 85% of the dietary intake of lycopene for most people. The lycopene content of tomatoes depends on variety and increases as the fruit ripens.\nUnlike other fruits and vegetables, where nutritional content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases the concentration of bioavailable lycopene. Lycopene in tomato paste is up to four times more bioavailable than in fresh tomatoes. Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of bioavailable lycopene compared to raw tomatoes.\nCooking and crushing tomatoes (as in the canning process) and serving in oil-rich dishes (such as spaghetti sauce or pizza) greatly increases assimilation from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Lycopene is fat-soluble, so the oil is said to help absorption. Gac has high lycopene content derived mainly from its seed coats. Cara Cara navel oranges, and other citrus fruit, such as pink grapefruits, also contain lycopene. Some foods that do not appear red also contain lycopene, e.g., baked beans. \nWhen lycopene is used as a food additive (E160d), it is usually obtained from tomatoes.\nAdverse effects.\nLycopene is non-toxic and commonly found in the diet, mainly from tomato products. There are cases of intolerance or allergic reaction to dietary lycopene, which may cause diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain or cramps, gas, and loss of appetite. Lycopene may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with anticoagulant drugs. Because lycopene may cause low blood pressure, interactions with drugs that affect blood pressure may occur. Lycopene may affect the immune system, the nervous system, sensitivity to sunlight, or drugs used for stomach ailments.\nLycopenemia is an orange discoloration of the skin that is observed with high intakes of lycopene. The discoloration is expected to fade after discontinuing excessive lycopene intake.\nResearch and potential health effects.\nA 2020 review of randomized controlled trials found conflicting evidence for lycopene having an effect on cardiovascular risk factors, whereas a 2017 review concluded that tomato products and lycopene supplementation reduced blood lipids and blood pressure. \nA 2015 review found that dietary lycopene was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer, whereas a 2021 meta-analysis found that dietary lycopene did not affect prostate cancer risk. Other reviews concluded that research has been insufficient to establish whether lycopene consumption affects human health.\nRegulatory status in Europe and the United States.\nIn a review of literature on lycopene and its potential benefit in the diet, the European Food Safety Authority concluded there was insufficient evidence for lycopene having antioxidant effects in humans, particularly in skin, heart function, or vision protection from ultraviolet light.\nAlthough lycopene from tomatoes has been tested in humans for cardiovascular diseases and prostate cancer, no effect on any disease was found. The US Food and Drug Administration, in rejecting manufacturers' requests in 2005 to allow \"qualified labeling\" for lycopene and the reduction of various cancer risks, provided a conclusion that remains in effect :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;no studies provided information about whether lycopene intake may reduce the risk of any of the specific forms of cancer. Based on the above, FDA concludes that there is no credible evidence supporting a relationship between lycopene consumption, either as a food ingredient, a component of food, or as a dietary supplement, and any of these cancers.\nIn a review of research through 2024, the US National Cancer Institute concluded that the FDA has not approved the use of lycopene as effective for treating any medical condition, including various types of cancer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a university town (since 1990), a long-standing cultural centre, and a market and shopping town, surrounded by vineyards and wine-growing villages of the Palatinate wine region. Landau lies east of the Palatinate forest, on the German Wine Route.\nIt contains the districts (\"Ortsteile\") of Arzheim, Dammheim, Godramstein, M\u00f6rlheim, M\u00f6rzheim, Nussdorf, Queichheim, and Wollmesheim.\nHistory and other settings.\nLandau was first mentioned as a settlement in 1106. It was in the possession of the counts of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Landeck, whose arms, differenced by an escutcheon of the Imperial eagle, served as the arms of Landau until 1955. The town was granted a charter in 1274 by King Rudolf I of Germany, who declared the town a Free Imperial Town in 1291; nevertheless Prince-Bishop Emich of Speyer, a major landowner in the district, seized the town in 1324. The town did not regain its ancient rights until 1511 from Maximilian I. An Augustinian monastery was founded in 1276. It has also helped provide college education for the past 28 years.\nAfter the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, control of Landau was ceded to France, although with certain ill-defined reservations. Landau was later part of France from 1680 to 1815, during which it was one of the \"D\u00e9capole\", the ten free cities of Alsace, and received its modern fortifications by Louis XIV's military architect Vauban in 1688\u201399, making the little town (its 1789 population was approximately 5,000) one of Europe's strongest citadels. In the War of the Spanish Succession it had four sieges. After the siege of 1702 lost by the French, an Imperial garrison was installed in Landau. In a subsequent siege from 13 October to 15 November 1703 the French regained the town, following their victory in the Battle of Speyerbach. A third siege, begun on 12 September 1704 by Louis, Margrave of Baden-Baden, ended on 23 November 1704 with a French defeat. During this siege King Joseph I arrived at Landau coming from Vienna in a newly developed convertible carriage. This carriage would become very popular and became named the landau in English, or in German. The French recaptured Landau once more in a final siege which lasted from 6 June to 20 August 1713 by Marshal General Villars.\nLandau was part of Bas-Rhin department between 1789 and 1815. After Napoleon's Hundred Days following his escape from Elba, Landau, which had remained French, was granted to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1815 and became the capital of one of the thirteen \"Bezirks\u00e4mter\" (counties) of the Bavarian Rheinkreis, later renamed Pfalz.\nIn 1840 famous political cartoonist Thomas Nast was born in Landau.\nFollowing World War II, Landau was an important barracks town for the French occupation.\nMain sites.\nLandau's large main square (\"Rathausplatz\") is dominated by the town hall (\"Rathaus\") and the market hall (\"Altes Kaufhaus\"). In the 19th century, the former fortifications gave way to a ring road that encircles the old town centre, from which the old industrial buildings have been excluded. A convention hall, the \"Festhalle\", was built in Art Nouveau style, 1905\u201307 on a rise overlooking the town park and facing the modernist \"Bundesamt\", the regional government building.\nThe Protestant Collegiate Church () in Landau in der Pfalz is one of the oldest buildings in the town.

Recognised as one of the greatest European actresses of all time, Ullmann is known as the muse and frequent collaborator of filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, whom she dated for five years. She acted in many of his films, including \"Persona\" (1966), \"Cries and Whispers\" (1972), \"Scenes from a Marriage\" (1973), \"The Passion of Anna\" (1969), and \"Autumn Sonata\" (1978).\nUllmann won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama in 1972 for the film \"The Emigrants\" and has been nominated for another four. In 2000, she was nominated for the Palme d'Or for her second directorial feature film, \"Faithless\". She has received two BAFTA Award nominations, and two nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, for \"The Emigrants\" and Ingmar Bergman's \"Face to Face\". On March 25, 2022, Ullmann was presented with an Honorary Academy Award in recognition of her \"bravery and emotional transparency that has gifted audiences with deeply affecting screen portrayals\".\nEarly life.\nLiv Johanne Ullmann was born in Tokyo on 16 December 1938, the daughter of Norwegian parents Janna Erbe (n\u00e9e Lund; 1910\u20131996) and Erik Viggo Ullmann (1907\u20131945). Her father was an aircraft engineer who was working in Tokyo at the time. Her grandfather helped Jews escape from the Norwegian town where he lived during World War II, and was thus sent to the Dachau concentration camp, where he died. When Ullmann was two years old, she moved with her parents to Canada and settled in Toronto, where her father worked at the Norwegian Air Force base on Toronto Island during World War II. The family then moved to the U.S. and settled in New York City, where her father died four years later after a lengthy hospitalisation from head injuries due to being struck by an aeroplane propeller, and his death affected her greatly. Her mother worked as a bookseller while raising Ullmann and her sister alone. They eventually returned to Norway and lived in Trondheim.\nCareer.\nUllmann began her acting career as a stage actress in Norway during the mid-1950s. She continued to act in theatre for most of her career and became noted for her portrayal of Nora Helmer in Henrik Ibsen's play \"A Doll's House\".\nShe became better known once she started to work with Swedish movie director Ingmar Bergman. She later acted, with acclaim, in 10 of his movies, including \"Persona\" (1966), \"The Passion of Anna\" (1969), \"Cries and Whispers\" (1972), and \"Autumn Sonata\" (1978), in the last of which her co-actress Ingrid Bergman resumed her own Swedish cinema career. She co-acted often with Swedish actor and fellow Bergman collaborator Erland Josephson, with whom she made the Swedish television drama \"Scenes from a Marriage\" (1973), which was also edited to feature-movie length and distributed theatrically. Ullmann acted with Laurence Olivier in \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), directed by Richard Attenborough.\nNominated more than 40 times for awards, including various lifetime achievement awards, she won the best-actress prize three times from the National Society of Film Critics and three times from the National Board of Review, received three awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, and a Golden Globe. During 1971, Ullmann was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for the movie \"The Emigrants\", and again during 1976 for the movie \"Face to Face\".\nUllmann made her New York City stage debut in 1975, also in \"A Doll's House\". Appearances in \"Anna Christie\" and \"Ghosts\" followed, as well as the less-than-successful musical version of \"I Remember Mama\". This show, composed by Richard Rodgers, experienced numerous revisions during a long preview period, then closed after 108 performances. She also featured in the widely deprecated musical movie remake of \"Lost Horizon\" during 1973. In 1977, when she appeared on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre in Eugene O'Neill's \"Anna Christie\", \"The New York Times\" said that she \"glowed with despair and hope, and was everything one could have wished her to have been\" in a performance \"not to be missed and never to be forgotten\", with her \"grace and authority\" that was \"perhaps more than Garbo...born for Anna Christie:--Or more properly, Anna Christie was born for her.\"\nIn 1980, Brian De Palma, who directed \"Carrie\", wanted Liv Ullmann to play the role of Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller \"Dressed to Kill\" and offered it to her, but she declined because of the violence. The role subsequently went to Angie Dickinson. In 1982, Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, \"Fanny and Alexander\", and wrote the role with this in mind. She declined it, feeling the role was too sad. She later stated in interviews that turning it down was one of the few things she really regretted.\nDuring 1984, she was chairperson of the jury at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival, and during 2001 chaired the jury of the Cannes Film Festival. She introduced her daughter, Linn Ullmann, to the audience with the words: \"Here comes the woman whom Ingmar Bergman loves the most\". Her daughter was there to receive the Prize of Honour on behalf of her father; she would return to serve the jury herself during 2011. She published two autobiographies, \"Changing\" (1977) and \"Choices\" (1984).\nUllmann's first film as a director was \"Sofie\" (1992); her friend and former co-actor, Erland Josephson, starred on it. She later directed the Bergman-composed movie \"Faithless\" (2000). \"Faithless\" garnered nominations for both the Palme d'Or and Best Actress category at the Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2003, Ullmann reprised her role for \"Scenes from a Marriage\" in \"Saraband\" (2003), Bergman's final telemovie. Her previous screen role had been in the Swedish movie \"Zorn\" (1994).\nIn 2004, Ullmann revealed that she had received an offer in November 2003 to play in three episodes of the American television series, \"Sex and the City\". She was amused by the offer, and said that it was one of the few programs she regularly watched, but she turned it down. Later that year, Steven Soderbergh wrote a role in the movie \"Ocean's 12\" especially for her, but she also turned that down.\nDuring 2006, Ullmann announced that she had been forced to end her longtime wish of making a film based on \"A Doll's House\". According to her statement, the Norwegian Film Fund was preventing writer Ketil Bj\u00f8rnstad and her from pursuing the project. Australian actress Cate Blanchett and British actress Kate Winslet had been intended to have been cast in the main roles of the movie. She later directed Blanchett in the play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", by Tennessee Williams, at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney, which was performed September through October 2009, and then continued from 29 October to 21 November 2009 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where it won a Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Non-resident Production, as well as actress and supporting performer for 2009. The play was also performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York. Ullmann narrated the Canada\u2013Norway co-produced animated short movie \"The Danish Poet\" (2006), which won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film at the 79th Academy Awards during 2007. \nIn 2008, she was the head of the jury at the 30th Moscow International Film Festival.\nDuring 2012, she attended the International Indian Film Academy Awards in Singapore, where she was honored for her Outstanding Contributions to International Cinema and she also showed her movie on her relationship with Ingmar Bergman. In 2013, Ullmann directed a film adaptation of \"Miss Julie\". The film, released in September 2014, stars Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell, and Samantha Morton. It was widely praised by the Norwegian press.\nIn 2018, Ullmann narrated \"Wars Don't End\", a documentary about the Lebensborn war children.\nIn March 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that Ullmann would receive the Academy Honorary Award. John Lithgow presented her with the statue at the Governors Awards, saying, \"For those few who claim that she never would've been called one of our greatest actors without Ingmar Bergman, I would answer, Bergman would probably never been called one of our greatest filmmakers without Liv Ullman\".\nHonours and causes.\nUllmann is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and has traveled widely for the organization. She is also co-founder and honorary chair of the Women's Refugee Commission.\nIn 2005, King Harald V of Norway made Ullmann a Commander with Star of the Order of St. Olav.\nUllmann received an honorary degree, a doctorate of philosophy, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in 2006.\nPersonal life.\nUllmann was married to Norwegian psychiatrist Hans Jakob Stang from 1960 until they divorced in 1965. She was with Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman from 1965 to 1970, becoming his muse and frequent collaborator. They had a daughter, writer Linn Ullmann (born 1966), whose son Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel (born 1990) became a filmmaker.\nIn 1985, Ullman married American real estate developer Donald Saunders from Boston, and they divorced in 1995 but remained in a relationship.\nCredits.\nFilm.\nAs actress\nAs director\nAwards and recognition.\nHonors\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "18739", "revid": "43209119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18739", "title": "Laika", "text": "Soviet dog, first animal to orbit Earth (c. 1954\u20131957)\nLaika ( ; , ; c.\u20091954 \u2013 3 November 1957) was a Soviet space dog who was one of the first animals in space and the first to orbit the Earth. A stray mongrel from the streets of Moscow, she flew aboard the Sputnik 2 spacecraft, launched into low orbit on 3 November 1957. As the technology to re-enter the atmosphere had not yet been developed, Laika's survival was never expected. She died of hyperthermia hours into the flight, on the craft's fourth orbit.\nLittle was known about the effects of spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and animal flights were viewed by engineers as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment, which monitored Laika's vital signs, aimed to prove that a living organism could survive being launched into orbit and continue to function under conditions of weakened gravity and increased radiation, providing scientists with some of the first data on the biological effects of spaceflight.\nLaika's death was possibly caused by a failure of the central R\u20117 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion. In 2008, a small monument to Laika depicting her standing atop a rocket was unveiled near the military research facility in Moscow that prepared her flight. She also appears on the \"Monument to the Conquerors of Space\" in Moscow.\nSputnik 2.\nAfter the success of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union, wanted a spacecraft launched on 7 November 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Khrushchev specifically wanted to deliver a \"space spectacular\", a mission that would repeat the triumph of Sputnik1, stunning the world with Soviet prowess. \nWhile construction had already started on Sputnik\u00a03, a more sophisticated satellite, it would not be ready until December. To meet the November deadline, a new simple satellite would need to be built. Sergei Korolev proposed that a dog be placed in the satellite, an idea which was quickly adopted by planners. Soviet rocket engineers had long intended a canine orbit before attempting human spaceflight; since 1951, they had lofted 12 dogs into sub-orbital space on ballistic flights, working gradually toward an orbital mission set for some time in 1958. To satisfy Khrushchev's demands, they expedited the orbital canine flight for the November launch.\nAccording to Russian sources, the official decision to launch Sputnik2 was made on 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft. Sputnik2, therefore, was something of a rushed job, with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.\nThe craft was equipped with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness was designed to be fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.\nTraining.\nLaika was found as a stray dog wandering the streets of Moscow. Soviet scientists chose to use Moscow strays since they assumed that such animals had already learned to endure conditions of extreme cold and hunger. She was a mongrel female, approximately three years old. Another account reported that she weighed about . Soviet personnel gave her several names and nicknames, among them Kudryavka (Russian for \"Little Curly\"), Zhuchka (\"Little Bug\"), and Limonchik (\"Little Lemon\"). Laika, the Russian name for several breeds of dogs similar to the husky, was the name popularised around the world. Its literal translation would be \"Barker\", from the Russian verb \"layat\" (\"\u043b\u0430\u044f\u0442\u044c\"), \"to bark\". According to some accounts, the technicians actually renamed her from Kudryavka to Laika owing to her loud barking. The American press dubbed her Muttnik (\"mutt\" + suffix \"-nik\") as a pun on Sputnik, or referred to her as \"Curly\". Her true pedigree is unknown, although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part terrier. NASA refers to Laika as a \"part-Samoyed terrier\". A Russian magazine described her temperament as phlegmatic, saying that she did not quarrel with other dogs.\nThe Soviet Union and United States had previously sent animals only on sub-orbital flights. Three dogs were trained for the Sputnik2 flight: Albina, Mushka, and Laika. Soviet space-life scientists Vladimir Yazdovsky and Oleg Gazenko trained the dogs.\nTo adapt the dogs to the confines of the tiny cabin of Sputnik2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to twenty days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by . The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space. It was made up of 40% bread crumbs, 40% powdered meat and 20% beef fat mixed with agar and water. Presumably the formula was of water, agar, and of food.\nTen days before the launch, Vladimir Yazdovsky chose Laika to be the primary flight dog. Before the launch, Yazdovsky took Laika home to play with his children. In a book chronicling the story of Soviet space medicine, he wrote, \"Laika was quiet and charming... I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.\"\nPreflight preparations.\nYazdovsky made the final selection of dogs and their designated roles. Laika was to be the \"flight dog\"\u00a0\u2013 a sacrifice to science on a one-way mission to space. Albina, who had already flown twice on a high-altitude test rocket, was to act as Laika's backup. She was not sent as the primary due to Albina recently giving birth to three pups, and thus Yazdovsky thought it cruel to send Albina the primary and separate a mother from their children. The third dog, Mushka, was a \"control dog\"\u00a0\u2013 she was to stay on the ground and be used to test instrumentation and life support.\nBefore leaving for the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Yazdovsky and Gazenko conducted surgery on the dogs, routing the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.\nBecause the existing airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, the dogs and crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu\u2011104 plane to Tashkent. From there, a smaller and lighter Il\u201114 plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they were placed in the capsules to get familiar with the feeding system.\nAccording to a NASA document, Laika was placed in the capsule of the satellite on 31 October 1957\u00a0\u2013 three days before the start of the mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely low, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak ethanol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.\nOne of the technicians preparing the capsule before final lift-off stated: \"After placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her bon voyage, knowing that she would not survive the flight.\"\nVoyage.\nAccounts of the time of launch vary from source to source, given as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.\nAt peak acceleration, Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik2's nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however, the \"Block A\" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to . After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.\nThe Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a serving of poisoned food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth day. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, \"It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.\"\nOver five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik2 disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.\nEthics of animal testing.\nDue to the overshadowing issue of the Soviet\u2013U.S. Space Race, the ethical issues raised by this experiment, which were a matter of concern in the west, went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper clippings from 1957 show, the press was initially focused on reporting the political perspective, while Laika's health and retrieval\u00a0\u2013 or lack thereof\u00a0\u2013 only became an issue later.\nSputnik 2 was not designed to be retrievable, and it had always been accepted that Laika would die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute's silence on each day Laika remained in space, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on members of the public to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York. Laboratory researchers in the United States offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.\nIn Warsaw Pact countries, open criticism of the Soviet space program was difficult because of political censorship, but there were notable cases of criticism in Polish scientific circles. A Polish scientific periodical, \"Kto, Kiedy, Dlaczego\" (\"Who, When, Why\"), published in 1958, discussed the mission of Sputnik2. In the periodical's section dedicated to astronautics, Krzysztof Boru\u0144 described the Sputnik2 mission as \"regrettable\" and criticised not bringing Laika back to Earth alive as \"undoubtedly a great loss for science\".\nIn the Soviet Union, there was less controversy. Neither the media, books in the following years, nor the public openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. In 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet regime, Oleg Gazenko, one of the scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, expressed regret for allowing her to die:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it. We shouldn't have done it[...] We did not learn enough from this mission to justify the death of the dog.\nFuture space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered; the first successful recovery followed the flight of Korabl-Sputnik\u00a02, wherein the dogs Belka and Strelka, alongside dozens of other organisms, safely returned to Earth. Nonetheless, four other dogs later died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R\u20117 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960, while Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik\u00a03 suffered an emergency and had to be detonated.\nTribute.\nLaika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.\nIn 1988 the Spanish band Mecano releases the song \"Laika\" paying tribute to the flight of the dog. The end of the song alludes to Laika's death: \"There is one less dog on the Earth / And one more star in the sky\".\nKarl Schroeder wrote a pessimistic near future science fiction novellette \"Laika's Ghost\" with the idea that in the pragmatic world, \"only people ready to take up the dream of flight to other worlds are aged remnants of the former Soviet Union\".\nThe 2007 graphic novel \"Laika\" by Nick Abadzis won several awards.\nNorwegian singer Emmy released a song in 2025 titled \"Laika Party\" to compete in the Irish \"Eurosong\" selection for the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest. The song tells a story about the singer wishing that Laika had never died and was living happily in space. Emmy won the selection to represent Ireland at the contest.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Recorded in Copenhagen, Denmark, at Sweet Silence Studios with producer Flemming Rasmussen, it is the band's final album to feature bassist Cliff Burton. While touring in support of \"Master of Puppets\", he died on September 27, 1986, after the band's tour bus was involved in an accident in D\u00f6rarp, Sweden.\nThe album's artwork, designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam, depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a clouded, blood-red sky, with a fiery orange glow on the horizon. The album is the band\u2019s most recent to date to feature a runtime of under an hour. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of Ozzy Osbourne. The European leg was canceled after Burton's death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist.\n\"Master of Puppets\" peaked at number 29 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its music and political lyrics. It is widely regarded to be one of the greatest and most influential metal albums of all time, and is credited with consolidating the American thrash metal scene. It was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2025 for shipping eight million copies in the United States, and was later certified six times platinum by Music Canada and platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In 2015, \"Master of Puppets\" became the first metal recording to be selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nBackground and recording.\nMetallica's 1983 debut \"Kill 'Em All\" laid the foundation for thrash metal with its aggressive musicianship and vitriolic lyrics. The album revitalized the American underground scene, and inspired similar records by contemporaries. The band's second album \"Ride the Lightning\" extended the limits of the genre with its more sophisticated songwriting and improved production. The album caught the attention of Elektra Records representative Michael Alago, who signed the group to an eight-album deal in the fall of 1984. Elektra reissued \"Ride the Lightning\" on November 19, and the band began touring larger venues and festivals throughout 1985. After parting with manager Jon Zazula, Metallica began working with Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch of Q Prime. During the summer, the band played the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, alongside Bon Jovi and Ratt to an audience of 70,000.\nMetallica was motivated to make an album that would impress critics and fans, and began writing new material in mid-1985. Lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich were the main songwriters on the album, already titled \"Master of Puppets\". The two developed ideas at a garage in El Cerrito, California, before inviting bassist Cliff Burton and guitarist Kirk Hammett for rehearsals. Hetfield and Ulrich described the songwriting process as starting with \"guitar riffs, assembled and reassembled until they start to sound like a song\". After that, the band came up with a song title and topic, and Hetfield wrote lyrics to match the title. \"Master of Puppets\" is Metallica's first album not to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine claimed he had co-written \"Leper Messiah\", based on an old song called \"The Hills Ran Red\". The band denied this, but stated that one section incorporated Mustaine's ideas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen I saw two kids who worked there in London wearing T-shirts of a local San Francisco band, I knew I was onto something. When I heard their record, I knew they were the one band that could sell to both mainstream and underground metal audiences.\n\u2014 Cliff Burnstein, on signing Metallica\nThe band was not satisfied with the acoustics of the American studios they considered, and decided to record in Ulrich's native Denmark. Ulrich took drum lessons, and Hammett worked with Joe Satriani to learn how to record more efficiently. Ulrich was in talks with Rush's bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee to produce the album, but the collaboration never materialized because of uncoordinated schedules. Metallica recorded the album with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 1 to December 27, 1985. The writing of all the songs except \"Orion\" and \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" was completed before the band's arrival in Copenhagen. Rasmussen stated that the band brought well-prepared demos of the songs, and only slight changes were made to the compositions in the studio. The recording took longer than the previous album because Metallica had developed a sense of perfectionism and had higher ambitions.\nMetallica eschewed the slick production and synthesizers of contemporary hard rock and glam metal albums. With a reputation for drinking, the band stayed sober on recording days. Hammett recalled that the group was \"just making another album\" at the time and \"had no idea that the record would have such a range of influence that it went on to have\". He also said that the group was \"definitely peaking\" at the time and that the album had \"the sound of a band really gelling, really learning how to work well together.\" The band largely recorded their instrumental parts separately, starting the songs with a click track and a guide guitar part from Hetfield.\nRasmussen and Metallica did not manage to complete the mixtapes as planned. Instead, the multitrack recordings were sent in January 1986 to Michael Wagener, who finished the album's mixing. The cover was designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a blood-red sky. Ulrich explained that the artwork summarized the lyrical content of the album\u2014people being subconsciously manipulated. The original artwork was sold at Rockefeller Plaza, New York City for $28,000 in 2008. The band mocked the warning stickers promoted by the PMRC with a facetious Parental Advisory label on the cover: \"The only track you probably won't want to play is 'Damage, Inc.' due to multiple use of the infamous 'F' word. Otherwise, there aren't any 'shits', 'fucks', 'pisses', 'cunts', 'motherfuckers', or 'cocksuckers' anywhere on this record\".\nThe album was recorded with the following equipment: Hammett's guitars were a 1974 Gibson Flying V, a Jackson Randy Rhoads, and a Fernandes Stratocaster copy; Hetfield used a Jackson King V played through a Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+ amplifier modified as a pre-amp; Burton played an Aria Pro II SB1000 through Mesa Boogie amplifier heads and cabinets; Ulrich played Tama drum equipment, and borrowed a rare Ludwig Black Beauty snare drum from Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen.\nMusic and lyrics.\n\"Master of Puppets\" features dynamic music and thick arrangements. Metallica delivered a more refined approach and performance compared to the previous two albums, with multilayered songs and technical dexterity. This album and its predecessor \"Ride the Lightning\" follow a similar track sequencing: both open with an up-tempo song with an acoustic intro, followed by a lengthy title track, and a fourth track with ballad qualities. Although both albums are similarly structured, the musicianship on \"Master of Puppets\" is more powerful and epic in scope, with tight rhythms and delicate guitar solos. According to music writer Joel McIver, \"Master of Puppets\" introduced a new level of heaviness and complexity in thrash metal, displaying atmospheric and precisely executed songs. Hetfield's vocals had matured from the hoarse shouting of the first two albums to a deeper, in-control, yet aggressive style.\nThe songs explore themes such as control and the abuse of power. The lyrics describe the consequences of alienation, oppression, and feelings of powerlessness. Author Ryan Moore thought the lyrics depicted \"ominous yet unnamed forces of power wielding total control over helpless human subjects\". The lyrics were considered perceptive and harrowing, and were praised for being honest and socially conscious by writer Brock Helander. Referring to the epic proportions of the songs, BBC Music's Eamonn Stack stated that \"at this stage in their careers Metallica weren't even doing songs, they were telling stories\". The compositions and arrangements benefited from bassist Cliff Burton's classical training and understanding of harmony.\n\"Battery\" refers to angry violence, as in the term \"assault and battery\". Some critics contended that the title actually refers to an artillery battery, and interpreted it as \"Hetfield [singing] of a war tactic as the aggressor\" personifying destruction. The song begins with bass-heavy classical guitars that build upon multitracked layers until they are joined by a sonic wall of distorted electric guitars. It then breaks into fast, aggressive riffing, featuring off-beat rhythms and heavily distorted minor dyads where root-fifth power chords might be expected. Hetfield improvised the riff while relaxing in London.\n\"Master of Puppets\" consists of several riffs with odd meters and a cleanly picked middle section with melodic solo. The song shares a similar structure with \"The Four Horsemen\" from the band's first album: two verse-chorus sets lead to a lengthy interlude to another verse-chorus set. The opening and pre-verse sections feature fast downpicked chromatic riffing at around 212 beats per minute in mostly time. Every fourth bar of each verse and the outro is cut short by more than a beat; the time signature of these bars is often idealistically analyzed as being , but it is performed with a delay after the third beat, making it closer to (). A lengthy interlude follows the second chorus, beginning with a clean, arpeggiated section over which Hetfield contributes a melodic solo; the riffing becomes distorted and progressively more heavy and Hammett provides a more virtuosic solo before the song eventually returns to the main verse. A riff from \"Andy Warhol\" by David Bowie (at 0:48) is quoted in the track (at 6:19). It is a homage made by Burton and Hammett to whom Bowie was a huge influence. The song closes with a fade-out of sinister laughter. The lyrical theme is cocaine addiction.\n\"The Thing That Should Not Be\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\" and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are down-tuned, creating slow and moody ambience.\n\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating and time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \"Fade to Black\" on \"Ride the Lightning\" and would follow with \"One\" on \"...And Justice for All\" and later \"The Day That Never Comes\" on \"Death Magnetic\".\n\"Disposable Heroes\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films.\nThe syncopated riffing of \"Leper Messiah\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \"Lie!\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \"Ziggy Stardust\".\n\"Orion\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with a fade-in bass section, heavily processed to resemble an orchestra. It continues with mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass riff at half-tempo. The tempo accelerates during the latter part, and ends with music fading out. Burton arranged the middle section, which features its moody bass line and multipart guitar harmonies.\n\"Damage, Inc.\" rants about senseless violence and reprisal at an unspecified target. It starts with a series of reversed bass chords based on the chorale prelude of Bach's \"Come, Sweet Death\". The song then jumps into a rapid rhythm with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was influenced by Deep Purple.\nReception.\n\"Master of Puppets\" was hailed as a masterpiece by critics outside of the thrash metal audience and cited by some as the genre's greatest album. In a contemporary review, Tim Holmes of \"Rolling Stone\" asserted that the band had redefined heavy metal with the technical skill and subtlety showcased on the album, which he described as \"the sound of global paranoia\". \"Kerrang!\" wrote that \"Master of Puppets\" \"finally put Metallica into the big leagues where they belong\". Editor Tom King said Metallica was at an \"incredible song-writing peak\" during the recording sessions, partially because Burton contributed to the songwriting. By contrast, \"Spin\"'s Judge I-Rankin was disappointed with the album and said, although the production is exceptional and Metallica's experimentation is commendable, it eschews the less \"intellectual\" approach of \"Kill 'Em All\" for a MDC-inspired direction that is inconsistent.\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic's Steve Huey viewed \"Master of Puppets\" as Metallica's best album and remarked that, although it was not as unexpected as \"Ride the Lightning\", it is a more musically and thematically consistent album. Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said the songs were the band's most intense at that point, and veer toward \"the progressive tendency of Rush.\" Adrien Begrand of \"PopMatters\" praised the production as \"a metal version of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound\" and believed none of Metallica's subsequent albums could match its passionate and intense musical quality. BBC Music's Eamonn Stack called the album \"hard, fast, rock with substance\" and likened the songs to stories of \"biblical proportions\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff compared the album to \"Ride the Lightning\" and found \"Master of Puppets\" not a remake, though similar in \"awesome power and effect\". Robert Christgau was more critical. Writing in \"\" (1990), he said the band's energy and political motivations are respectable, but the music evokes clich\u00e9d images of \"revolutionary heroes\" who are \"male chauvinists too inexperienced to know better\".\nReleased on March 3, 1986, the album had a 72-week run on the \"Billboard\" 200 album charts and earned the band its first gold certification. The album debuted on March 29 at number 128 and peaked at number 29 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. \"Billboard\" reported that 300,000 copies were sold in its first three weeks. More than 500,000 copies were sold in its first year, even with virtually no radio airplay and no music videos. In 2025, \"Master of Puppets\" was certified 8\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with eight million copies shipped in the United States. Between the beginning of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991 and 2023, 7,980,000 copies were sold. The album was less successful on an international level, despite entering the top 5 on the Finnish and the top 40 on the German and Swiss album charts in its inaugural year. In 2004, it peaked within the Top 15 in Sweden. In 2008, the album reached the top 40 on the Australian and Norwegian album charts. It received 6\u00d7 platinum certification from Music Canada and a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 600,000 and 100,000 copies, respectively.\nBassist Robert Trujillo cited \"Master of Puppets\" as his favorite album, \"I feel \"Master of Puppets\" has a lot of everything. It's got instrumentals, it's got great segues, great riffs. It's got one of my favorite songs ever by Metallica, and that song is \"Disposable Heroes\". So any time I can hear that particular song, count me in. \"Battery\" is an amazing song. So it's just got everything that I love about Metallica.\"\nAccolades and legacy.\n\"Master of Puppets\" has appeared in several publications' best album lists. It was ranked number 167 on the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and upgrading to number 97 in a 2020 revised list. The magazine would also later rank it second on its 2017 list of \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\", behind Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\". \"Time\" included the album in its list of the 100 best albums of all time. According to the magazine's Josh Tyrangiel, \"Master of Puppets\" reinforced the velocity of playing in heavy metal and diminished some of its clich\u00e9s. \"Slant Magazine\" placed the album at number 90 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s, saying \"Master of Puppets\" is Metallica's best and most sincere recording. The album is featured in Robert Dimery's book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". IGN named \"Master of Puppets\" the best heavy metal album of all time. The website stated it was Metallica's best because it \"built upon and perfected everything they had experimented with prior\" and that \"all the pieces come together in glorious cohesion\". Music journalist Martin Popoff also ranked it the best heavy metal album. \"Rock Hard\" ranked the album as the second greatest rock and metal album of all time, behind AC/DC's \"Back in Black\". The album was voted the fourth greatest guitar album of all time by \"Guitar World\" in 2006, and the title track ranked number 61 on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar solos. \"Total Guitar\" ranked the main riff of the title track at number 7 among the top 20 guitar riffs. The April 2006 edition of \"Kerrang!\" was dedicated to the album and included the cover album \"Master of Puppets: Remastered\" as a giveaway.\n\"Master of Puppets\" became thrash metal's first platinum album and by the early 1990s thrash metal successfully challenged and redefined the mainstream of heavy metal. Metallica and a few other bands headlined arena concerts and appeared regularly on MTV, although radio play remained incommensurate with their popularity. \"Master of Puppets\" is widely accepted as the genre's most accomplished album, and paved the way for subsequent development. The album, in the words of writer Christopher Knowles, \"ripped Metallica away from the underground and put them atop the metal mountain\". David Hayter from \"Guitar Planet\" recognized the album as one of the most influential records ever made and a benchmark by which other metal albums should be judged. MTV's Kyle Anderson had similar thoughts, saying that 25 years after its release the album remained a \"stone cold classic\". Carlos Ramirez from Noisecreep believes that \"Master of Puppets\" stands as one of the most representative albums of its genre.\nThe year 1986 is seen as a pinnacle year for thrash metal in which the genre broke out of the underground due to albums such as Megadeth's \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" and Slayer's \"Reign in Blood\". Anthrax released \"Among the Living\" in 1987, and by the end of the year these bands, alongside Metallica, were being called the \"Big Four\" of thrash metal. \"Master of Puppets\" frequently tops critic and fan polls of favorite thrash metal albums. Histories of the band tend to position \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Master of Puppets\", and \"...And Justice for All\" as a trilogy over the course of which the band's music progressively matured and became more sophisticated. In 2015, the album was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry.\n\"Kerrang!\" released a tribute album titled \"Master of Puppets: Remastered\" with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of \"Master of Puppets\". The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium\u2014all of which are influenced by Metallica.\nThe title track was also featured in the fourth season finale of the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\", as the character Eddie Munson plays the song in the Upside Down dimension to draw the dimension's monsters away from his friends. Kelly McClure of \"Salon\" compares the song's newfound popularity to Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\", another song featured in the show's fourth season. The song's appearance on \"Stranger Things\" saw the song resurging on Spotify's charts, behind \"Running Up That Hill\", and the band stated on social media that \"It\u2019s an incredible honor to be such a big part of Eddie\u2019s journey and to once again be keeping company with all of the amazing artists featured in the show.\"\nTour and Burton's death.\nMetallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. The Damage, Inc. Tour began in March 1986, and the band spent March to August touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as mockery. Ulrich, however, stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for their excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \"Alcoholica\". The band members occasionally even wore satirical T-shirts reading \"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\".\nThe band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\" Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates.\nThe European leg of the tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. The morning after a performance on September 26 in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled off the road, and Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver claimed he hit a patch of black ice, but others believed he was either drunk or fell asleep at the wheel. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted. The band returned to San Francisco and hired Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted to replace Burton. Many of the songs that appeared on the band's next album, \"...And Justice for All\", were composed during Burton's career with the band.\nLater live performances.\nAll of the songs have been performed live, and some became permanent setlist features. Four tracks were featured on the nine-song set list for the album's promotional tour: \"Battery\" as opener, \"Master of Puppets\", \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", and \"Damage, Inc.\" The title track, which was issued as a single in France, became a live staple and the most-played Metallica song. \"Loudwire\"'s Chad Childers characterized the band's performance as \"furious\" and the song as the set's highlight. \"Rolling Stone\" described the live performance as \"a classic in all its eight-minute glory\". While filming its 3D movie \"\" (2013) at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, crosses were rising from the stage during the song, reminiscent of the album's cover art.\n\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" is the second-most performed song from the album. The live performance is often accompanied by lasers, pyrotechnical effects and film screens. \"Battery\" is usually played at the beginning of the setlist or during the encore, accompanied by lasers and flame plumes. \"Disposable Heroes\" is featured in the video album \"\" (2009) filmed in Mexico City, in which the song was played on the second of three nights at the Foro Sol. \"Orion\" is the least-performed song from the album. Its first live performance was during the Escape from the Studio '06 tour, when the band performed the album in its entirety, honoring the 20th anniversary of its release. The band performed the album in the middle of the set. \"Battery\", \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", \"Damage, Inc.\" and the full-length \"Master of Puppets\" were revived for the band's concerts in 1997 and 1998, after having been retired for a number of years.\nTrack listing.\nOriginal release.\nAll lyrics written by James Hetfield. \nThe bonus tracks on the digital re-release were recorded live at the Seattle Coliseum, Seattle, Washington, on August 29 and 30, 1989, and also appeared on the live album \"\" (1993).\n2017 deluxe box set.\nIn 2017, the album was remastered and reissued in a limited edition deluxe box set with an expanded track listing and bonus content.

{"id": "18758", "revid": "19275099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18758", "title": "Ride the Lightning", "text": "Ride the Lightning is the second album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel \"The Stand\", in which a character uses the phrase to refer to execution by electric chair.\nAlthough rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. Bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the band and had more input in the songwriting. Beyond the fast tempos of its debut \"Kill 'Em All\", Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It is the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from successor Kirk Hammett.\n\"Ride the Lightning\" received a highly positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. \"Ride the Lightning\" peaked at number 100 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with virtually no radio exposure and has since reached number 48. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked \"Ride the Lightning\" on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on thrash metal.\nBackground and recording.\nMetallica released its debut album, \"Kill 'Em All\", on the independent label Megaforce Records on July 25, 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material, and from September, began performing the songs that were to make up \"Ride the Lightning\" at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing at clubs across the United States. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica some of its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar, so the band offered the job to Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time.\nHetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was co-produced by Flemming Rasmussen, the founder of Sweet Silence Studios. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen because he liked his work on Rainbow's \"Difficult to Cure\" (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at Mercyful Fate's practice room in Copenhagen.\nBefore entering the studio, Metallica collected ideas on \"riff tape\" recordings of various jam sessions. Hetfield and Ulrich went through the tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Together, they record the basic tracks live - only rhythm guitar and drums - with Kirk Hammett and Cliff Burton adding their parts later. Rasmussen, with the support of drum roadie Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of timing and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse at the back of the studio, which was not soundproof, and caused reverberation. Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for \"Kill 'Em All\". \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", \"Trapped Under Ice\", and \"Escape\" were written mostly in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on \"Fight Fire with Fire\", \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Creeping Death\", and \"The Call of Ktulu\", which had already been performed live.\nLead guitarist Kirk Hammett took the album's name from a passage in Stephen King's novel \"The Stand\". The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had difficulty recording because gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. The band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night, because the studio was booked by other artists during the daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several A&amp;R representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first, it seemed that Metallica was going to sign with Bronze Records, but the deal was canceled, because Bronze executive Gerry Bron did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence Studios, and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer Eddie Kramer, and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Bron's failure to share the band's artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, though Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of its bands.\nMetallica had to record quickly because of European shows scheduled 29 days after entering the studio. Recording finished on March 14, and Megaforce released the album on July 27. Although the original album budget was $20,000, the final expense was above US$. Metallica's European label Music for Nations paid the studio costs because Megaforce owner Jon Zazula could not afford them. Metallica was unhappy with the lack of promotion by Megaforce, and decided to part ways with Zazula. Major label Elektra Records A&amp;R executive Michael Alago noticed Metallica at The Stone gig in San Francisco, and invited Elektra's chairman and the head of promotion to see the August show in New York. The performance at Roseland Ballroom, with Anthrax and Metallica opening for Raven, pleased the Elektra staff, and the band was offered a contract the following morning. On September 12, Metallica signed with Elektra, which re-released the album on November 19. Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch of Q Prime were concurrently appointed as the band's new managers. \"Ride the Lightning\" is the last Metallica album to feature co-writing contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who received credit on the title track and \"The Call of Ktulu\". The album also represented the first time Hammett was given writing credits.\nMusic and lyrics.\nMusic writers opine that \"Ride the Lightning\" exhibits greater musical maturity, with sonically broader songs than \"Kill 'Em All\", which was noted for its one-dimensional sound. This development is partially because of bassist Cliff Burton's knowledge of music theory. He showed Hetfield how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony works, which reflected on the song compositions. Hetfield developed more socially aware lyrics, as well as ominous and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich explained that Metallica opted not to rely strictly on fast tempos as on the previous album, but to explore other musical approaches that sounded powerful and heavy. \"Grinder\" magazine's Kevin Fisher summarized the album as \"ultimate thrash, destruction and total blur\" that reminded him of the speed and power of \"Kill 'Em All\". Music journalist Martin Popoff observed that \"Ride the Lightning\" offered \"sophistication and brutality in equal measure\" and was seen as something new at the time of its release. Discussing the album's lyrical content, philosopher William Irwin wrote: \"After \"Kill 'Em All\", the rebellion and aggression became much more focused as the enemy became more clearly defined. Metallica was deeply concerned about various domains in which the common man was wrongfully yet ingeniously deceived. More precisely, they were highly critical of those in power\".\nThe major-key acoustic introduction to \"Fight Fire with Fire\" displays Metallica's evolution towards a more harmonically complex style of songwriting. The fastest Metallica song in terms of picking speed, it is driven by nimbly tremolo-picked riffs in the verses and chorus. The extended solo at the end dissolves in a sound effect of a vast nuclear explosion. The main riff was taped during the Kill 'Em All Tour and the acoustic intro was something Burton was playing on acoustic guitar at the time. The lyrical themes focused on nuclear annihilation, and specifically critiques the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction.\n\"Ride the Lightning\" is Metallica's first song to have emphasized the misery of the criminal justice system. The lyrics are in the perspective of a death row inmate anticipating execution by the electric chair. The song, one of the two album tracks that credits Mustaine, begins in a mid-tempo which gradually accelerates as the song progresses. One of the riffs, originally composed by Mustaine, was simplified. It features an instrumental middle section highlighted by Hammett's soloing. According to Hetfield, the song is not a criticism of capital punishment, but a tale of a man sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, as in the opening lyrics: \"Guilty as charged/But damn it/It ain't right\". The song would later be covered by Mustaine's own band, Megadeth, in 2026.\n\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" begins with a bell tolling, followed by a marching riff and high-register bass melody. The chromatic introduction, which Burton wrote before he joined Metallica, is often mistaken for an electric guitar but is actually Burton's bass guitar augmented with distortion and a wah-wah pedal. The lyrics were inspired by Ernest Hemingway's 1940 novel of the same name, which explores the horror and dishonor of modern warfare. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" was released as a promotional single in two versions, an edit on side A and the album version on side B.\n\"Fade to Black\" is a power ballad with lyrics about suicide. Hetfield wrote the words because he felt powerless after the band's equipment was stolen before the January 1984 show in Boston. Musically, the song begins with an acoustic guitar introduction overlaid with electric soloing. The song becomes progressively heavier and faster, ending with multi-layered guitar solos. The ballad's arpeggiated chords and reserved singing was incongruous for thrash metal bands at the time and disappointed some of Metallica's fans. The song's structure foreshadows later Metallica ballads, \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", \"One\", and \"The Day That Never Comes\". \"Fade to Black\" was released as a promotional single in 1984, in phosphorescent green.\n\"Trapped Under Ice\" is about a person who wakes from a cryonic state. Realizing there is nowhere to go, and no-one will come to the rescue, the person helplessly awaits impending doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the album's opener. It was inspired by a track Hammett's former band Exodus had demoed called \"Impaler\", which was later released on that band's 2004 album \"Tempo of the Damned\".\n\"Escape\" was originally titled \"The Hammer\" and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-picked riff. \"Escape\" is Hetfield's most disliked Metallica song, due to it being the result of the record company forcing Metallica to write something more radio friendly. Book authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome said the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay on rock radio. Metallica has so far performed \"Escape\" live only once, at the 2012 Orion Music\u00a0+ More festival, while performing \"Ride the Lightning\" in its entirety.\n\"Creeping Death\" describes the (Exodus 12:29). The lyrics deal with the ten plagues visited on Ancient Egypt; four of them are mentioned throughout the song, as well as the Passover. The title was inspired by a scene from \"The Ten Commandments\" while the band was watching the movie at Burton's house. The bridge, with its chant \"Die, by my hand!\", was originally written by Hammett for the song \"Die by His Hand\" while he was playing in Exodus, who recorded it as a demo but did not feature it on an album. Journalist Joel McIver called the song a \"moshpit anthem\" due to its epic lyrical themes and dramatic atmosphere. \"Creeping Death\" was released as a single with a B-side titled \"Garage Days Revisited\" made up of covers of Diamond Head's \"Am I Evil?\" and Blitzkrieg's \"Blitzkrieg\".\n\"The Call of Ktulu\", tentatively titled \"When Hell Freezes Over\", was inspired by H.\u00a0P. Lovecraft's book \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\", which was introduced to the rest of the band by Burton. The title was taken from one of Lovecraft's key stories featuring Cthulhu, \"The Call of Cthulhu\", although the original name was modified to \"Ktulu\" for easier pronunciation. The track begins with a D minor chord progression in the intro, written by Mustaine (Mustaine later re-used the chord structure on Megadeth's track \"Hangar 18\") followed by a two-minute bass solo over a rhythmic riff pattern. Conductor Michael Kamen rearranged the piece for Metallica's 1999 \"S&amp;M\" project and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2001.\nReception and legacy.\n\"Ride the Lightning\" received widespread acclaim from music critics. According to \"Q\" magazine, the album confirmed Metallica's status as the leading heavy metal band of the modern era. The magazine credited the group for redefining the norms of thrash metal with \"Fade to Black\", the genre's first power ballad. British rock magazine \"Kerrang!\" stated that the album's maturity and musical intelligence helped Metallica expand heavy metal's boundaries. Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" described \"Ride the Lightning\" as a more refined extension of the group's debut. In a retrospective review, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman named it as one of the few albums that can be charming and powerful at the same time. He praised Hetfield's vocal performance and concluded that Metallica was \"firing on all cylinders\". AllMusic's Steve Huey saw the album as a more ambitious and remarkable effort than \"Kill 'Em All\". He called \"Ride the Lightning\" an \"all-time metal classic\" because of the band's rich musical imagination and lyrics that avoided heavy metal cliches.\n\"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" viewed the album as a great step forward for the band and as an album that established the concept for Metallica's following two records. Colin Larkin, writing in the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", singled out \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" as an example of Metallica's growing music potential. Popoff regards \"Ride the Lightning\" as an album where \"extreme metal became art\". \"This literally was the first album since (Judas Priest's 1976) \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" where the rulebook has changed. This was a new kind of heaviness; the soft, billowy but explosive production was amazing, the speed was superhuman\", stated Popoff. Reviewing the 2016 reissue, Jason Anderson of \"Uncut\" considers \"Ride the Lightning\" the second best Metallica album which set the pace for metal in the years to come.\nMegaforce initially pressed 75,000 copies of the album for the US market, while Music for Nations serviced the European market. By late 1984, 85,000 copies of \"Ride the Lightning\" had been sold in Europe, resulting in Metallica's first cover story for \"Kerrang!\" in its December issue. After signing Metallica, Elektra released the single \"Creeping Death\" in a sleeve depicting a bridge and a skull painted grey and green. The album peaked at number 100 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with no radio exposure. \"Ride the Lightning\" went gold by November 1987 and in 2012 was certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for six million copies shipped in the US.\nThe album, along with \"Kill 'Em All\", was reissued in 2016 as a boxed set including demos and live recordings. Many rock publications have ranked \"Ride the Lightning\" on their best album lists. The album placed fifth on IGN Music's \"Top 25 Metal Albums\" list. \"Spin\" listed it as a thrash metal essential, declaring it \"the thrashiest thrash ever\". According to \"Guitar World\", \"Ride the Lightning\" \"didn't just change the band's trajectory\u2014it reset the course of metal itself\". Corey Deiterman of the \"Houston Press\" considers \"Ride the Lightning\" the most influential Metallica album, saying it had a lasting impact on genres such as crossover thrash and hardcore punk. In 2017, it was ranked 11th on \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\". In a 1991 interview, Jason Newsted stated that \"Ride the Lightning\" was next to \"Metallica\", \"the best album ever\".\nTouring.\nAfter recording was completed, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker wanted to arrange a triple-bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with Exciter, Metallica, and the Rods. The Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote \"Ride the Lightning\", Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour on November 16, in Rouen, France, with English new wave band Tank as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, first as a co-headlining act with W.A.S.P. and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting. \nThe American leg ended in March 1985, and the band spent the following months working on the next album, \"Master of Puppets\", whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the Monsters of Rock festival held at Castle Donington in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between Ratt and Bon Jovi, two glam metal groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallica's. At the start of the set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: \"If you came here to see spandex, eye make-up, and the words 'oh baby' in every fuckin' song, this ain't the fuckin' band!\" Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, California, before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the Loreley Metal Hammer Festival in Germany, headlined by Venom. \"Disposable Heroes\" from the upcoming album was performed live for the first time at this festival. Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on December 29 opening for Y&amp;T, and a New Year's Eve concert at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on a bill with Metal Church, Exodus, and Megadeth, the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered \"Master of Puppets\" from the then-upcoming third album.\nTrack listing.\nOriginal release.\nThe bonus tracks on the digital re-release were recorded live at the Seattle Coliseum, Seattle, Washington, on August 29 and 30, 1989, and later appeared on the live album \"\" (1993).\n2016 deluxe box set.\nIn 2016, the album was remastered and reissued in a limited-edition deluxe box set with an expanded track listing and bonus content.
